 Natural Gas Terms set forth in Item 1.
 Business of this annual report. 

Item 1. 

Business. 

General 

Mariner Energy, Inc. is an independent oil and gas exploration,
 development, and production company. We were incorporated in
 August 1983 as a Delaware corporation. Our corporate
 headquarters are located at One BriarLake Plaza,
 Suite 2000, 2000 West Sam Houston Parkway South,
 Houston, Texas 77042. Our telephone number is
 (713) 954-5500 
 and our website address is www.mariner-energy.com. Our common
 stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under
 the symbol ME. 

We currently operate in three principal geographic areas:

Permian Basin, where we are an active driller in the prolific
 Spraberry field at depths between 6,000 and
 10,000 feet. Our increasing Permian Basin operation, which
 is characterized by long reserve life, stable drilling and
 production performance, and relatively lower capital
 requirements, somewhat counterbalances the higher geological
 risk, operational challenges and capital requirements attendant
 to most of our Gulf of Mexico deepwater operations. We have
 expanded our presence in the region, targeting a combination of
 infill drilling activities in established producing trends,
 including the Spraberry, Dean and Wolfcamp trends, as well as
 exploration activities in emerging plays such as the Wolfberry
 and newer Wolfcamp trends.

Gulf of Mexico Deepwater, where we have actively conducted
 exploration and development projects since 1996 in water depths
 ranging from 1,300 feet up to 7,000 feet. Employing
 our experienced geoscientists, rich seismic database, and
 extensive subsea tieback expertise, we have participated in more
 than 84 deepwater wells. Our deepwater exploration operation
 targets larger potential reserve accumulations than are
 generally accessible onshore or on the Gulf of Mexico shelf.

Gulf of Mexico Shelf, where we drill or participate in
 conventional shelf wells and deep shelf wells extending to 1,300
 foot water depths. We currently pursue a two-pronged strategy on
 the shelf, combining opportunistic acquisitions of legacy
 producing fields believed to hold exploitation potential and
 active exploration activities targeting conventional and deep
 shelf opportunities. Given the highly mature nature of this area
 and the steep production declines characteristic of most wells
 in this region, the goal of our shallow water or shelf operation
 is to maximize cash flow for reinvestment in our deepwater and
 Permian Basin operations, as well as for expansion into new
 operating areas.

During 2008, we produced approximately 118.4 Bcfe and our
 average daily production rate was 323 MMcfe per day. At
 December 31, 2008, we had 973.9 Bcfe of estimated
 proved reserves, of which approximately 57 were natural gas and
 43 were oil, natural gas liquids NGLs and
 condensate. Approximately 70 of our estimated proved reserves
 were classified as proved developed.

We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements
 and other information as required by the Securities and Exchange
 Commission SEC ). Our SEC filings are available to

Recent
 Developments 

Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Acquisition On
 December 19, 2008, we acquired additional working interests
 in our existing property, Atwater Valley Block 426 (Bass
 Lite), for approximately 32.6 million, increasing our
 working interest by 11.6 to 53.8 . We internally estimated
 proved reserves attributable to the acquisition of approximately
 17.6 Bcfe (100 natural gas).

Acquisition of Incremental Spraberry
 Interests On February 29, 2008 and
 December 1, 2008, we acquired additional working interests
 in certain of our existing properties in the Spraberry field in
 the Permian Basin, increasing our average working interest
 across these properties to approximately 80 . We internally
 estimated proved reserves attributable to the acquisition of
 approximately 27.4 Bcfe. We operate substantially all of
 the assets. The purchase prices were approximately
 21.7 million for the February acquisition and
 19.4 million for the December acquisition.

Impact of
 Worldwide Financial Crisis and Lower Commodity Prices on Capital
 Program 

In recent years, oil and gas commodity prices generally trended
 upwards in response to robust demand and constrained supplies,
 with oil and gas prices peaking at more than 140.00 per barrel
 and 13.00 per Mcf, respectively, in July 2008. In response to
 the sustained increase in commodity prices, the oil and gas
 industry experienced significant increases in activity and in
 demand for oil field services. The increased demand for these
 services resulted in significant inflation in the cost of
 drilling rigs, services, equipment and labor.

In the second half of 2008, a world-wide economic recession and
 oversupply of natural gas in North America led to an
 unprecedented decline in oil and gas prices, with oil falling by
 more than 100.00 per barrel from its peak earlier in 2008.
 However, the inflated cost of oil field services resulting from
 sustained historically high commodity prices did not decrease in
 line with the decline in commodity prices. The prospect of
 continued low commodity prices and disproportionately high
 service costs has constrained the industry s capital
 reinvestment and undermined rates of return in new projects,
 particularly those in areas characterized by high costs or long
 reserve lives. In order to manage our capital program within
 expected cash flows, we tentatively have reduced our 2009
 capital budget by more than 50 from 2008.

Our 2009 activities in the Permian Basin will focus primarily on
 expanding beyond our typical Spraberry infill drilling operation
 into new exploration plays, such as the Wolfberry and Wolfcamp
 Detrital trends. We plan to delineate prospects and determine
 their economic viability. Our goal is to expand our prospect
 inventory and generate opportunities to drill when commodity
 prices or service costs adjust to levels expected to yield more
 attractive returns. Until then, we are scaling down our infill
 drilling and development activities to primarily lease-saving
 operations and contractual drilling commitments. We also
 anticipate substantially reduced recompletion and development
 activities in our Gulf of Mexico shelf operation until commodity
 price and service cost dynamics adjust to allow a more
 attractive rate of return. In addition, we are allocating a
 disproportionate portion of our 2009 capital budget to our Gulf
 of Mexico deepwater exploration program due primarily to
 contractual drilling commitments.

Balanced
 Growth Strategy 

We are a growth company and strive to increase our reserves and
 production from our existing asset base as well as through
 expansion into new operating areas. Our management team pursues
 a balanced growth strategy employing varying elements of
 exploration, development, and acquisition activities in
 complementary operating regions intended to achieve an overall
 moderate-risk growth profile at attractive rates of return under
 most industry conditions.

Exploration: Our exploration program is
 designed to facilitate organic growth through exploration in a
 wide variety of exploratory drilling projects, including
 higher-risk, high-impact projects that have the potential to
 create substantial value for our stockholders. We view
 exploration as a core competency. We typically dedicate a
 significant portion of our capital program each year to
 prospecting for new oil

4

Table of Contents 

and gas fields, including in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater where
 reserve accumulations are typically much larger than those found
 onshore or on the shelf. Our explorationists have a
 distinguished track record in the Gulf of Mexico. Our reputation
 for generating high-quality exploration prospects also can
 create potentially valuable partnering opportunities, which can
 enable us to participate in exploration projects developed by
 other operators.

Development: Our development efforts are
 intended to complement our higher-risk exploration projects
 through a variety of moderate-risk activities targeted at
 maximizing recovery and production from known reservoirs as well
 as finding overlooked oil and gas accumulations in and around
 existing fields. Our geoscientists and engineers have a solid
 track record in effectively developing new fields, redeveloping
 legacy fields, rejuvenating production, controlling unit costs,
 and adding incremental reserves at attractive finding costs in
 both onshore and offshore fields. Our development and
 exploitation program strives to enhance the rate of returns of
 our projects, allowing us to establish critical operating mass
 from which to expand in our focus areas, and generate a rich
 portfolio of relatively lower-risk engineering/exploitation
 projects that counterbalance our higher-risk exploration
 activities.

Acquisitions: In addition to our internal
 exploration and development activities on our existing
 properties, we also compete actively for new oil and gas
 properties through property acquisitions as well as corporate
 transactions. Our management team has substantial experience
 identifying and executing a wide variety of tactical and
 strategic transactions that augment our existing operations or
 present opportunities to expand into new operating regions. We
 primarily focus our acquisition efforts on stable, onshore
 basins such as the Permian Basin, which can counterbalance our
 growing deepwater exploration operations, but we also respond in
 an opportunistic fashion to attractive acquisition opportunities
 in the Gulf of Mexico. Due to our existing prospect inventory,
 we are not compelled to make acquisitions in order to grow;
 however we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions
 aggressively on an opportunistic basis as an integral part of
 our growth strategy.

Our
 Competitive Strengths 

We believe our core resources and strengths include:

Diversity of assets and activities. Our assets
 and operations are diversified among the Permian Basin and the
 Gulf of Mexico deepwater and shelf. Each of these areas involves
 distinctly different operational characteristics, as well as
 different financial and operational risks and rewards. Moreover,
 within these operating areas we pursue a breadth of exploration,
 development and acquisition activities, which in turn entail
 unique risks and rewards. By diversifying our assets both
 onshore and in the Gulf, and pursuing a full range of
 exploration, development and acquisition activities, we strive
 to mitigate concentration risk and avoid overdependence on any
 single activity to facilitate our growth. By maintaining a
 variety of investment opportunities ranging from high-risk,
 high-impact projects in the deepwater to relatively low-risk,
 repeatable projects in the Permian Basin, we attempt to execute
 a balanced capital program and attain a more moderate
 company-wide risk profile while still affording our stockholders
 the significant potential upside attendant to an active
 deepwater exploration company.

Large prospect inventory. We believe we have
 significant potential for growth through the exploration and
 development of our existing asset base. We are one of the
 largest leaseholders among independent producers in the Gulf of
 Mexico. Additionally, we are an active participant at MMS lease
 sales. We were the apparent high bidder on three blocks at the
 Outer Continental Shelf 207 Lease Sale held on August 20,
 2008 by the MMS. The MMS awarded all three blocks to us,
 yielding an aggregate exposure of 0.9 million. We hold a
 100 working interest in each of these blocks. In addition, the
 MMS awarded us 19 blocks on which we were the apparent high
 bidder at the Central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 206 held by the
 MMS on March 19, 2008. The awarded blocks involve seven
 deepwater subsalt prospects (both Miocene and Lower Tertiary),
 four deepwater prospects, four deep shelf prospects, and one
 conventional shelf prospect. Our net exposure on the awarded
 bids was 79.1 million and our working interest ranges from
 33 to 100 . Furthermore, in the Permian Basin we have a large
 and growing asset base that we anticipate is capable of
 sustaining our current drilling program for a number of years.
 We believe that our large acreage position makes us less
 dependent on acquisitions for our growth as compared to
 companies that have less extensive drilling inventories.

Table of Contents 

Exploration expertise. Our seasoned team of
 geoscientists has made significant discoveries in the Gulf of
 Mexico and has achieved a cumulative 65 success rate during the
 three years ended December 31, 2008. Our geoscientists each
 average almost 30 years of relevant industry experience. We
 believe our emphasis on exploration allows us a competitive
 advantage over other companies who are either wholly dependent
 on acquisitions for growth or only sporadically engage in more
 limited exploration activities.

Operational control and substantial working
 interests. We serve as operator of properties
 representing approximately 87 of our production and have an
 average 74 working interest in our operated properties. We
 believe operating our properties gives us a competitive
 advantage over non-operating interest holders, particularly in a
 challenging financial environment, since operatorship better
 allows us to determine the extent and timing of our capital
 programs, as well as to assert the most direct impact on
 operating costs.

Extensive seismic library. We have access to
 recent-vintage, regional
 3-D seismic
 data covering a significant portion of the Gulf of Mexico. We
 use seismic technology in our exploration program to identify
 and assess prospects, and in our development program to assess
 hydrocarbon reservoirs with a goal of optimizing drilling,
 workover and recompletion operations. We believe that our
 investment in
 3-D seismic
 data gives us an advantage over companies with less extensive
 seismic resources in that we are better able to interpret
 geological events and stratigraphic trends on a more precise
 geographical basis utilizing more detailed analytical data.

Subsea tieback expertise. We have accumulated
 an extensive track record in the use of subsea tieback
 technology, which enables production from subsea wells to
 existing third-party production facilities through subsea flow
 line and umbilical infrastructure. This technology typically
 allows us to avoid the significant lead time and capital
 commitment associated with the fabrication and installation of
 production platforms or floating production facilities, thereby
 accelerating our project start ups and reducing our financial
 exposure. In turn, we believe this lowers the economic
 thresholds of our target prospects and allows us to exploit
 reserves that otherwise may be considered non-commercial because
 of the high cost of stand-alone production facilities.

Properties 

Our principal oil and gas properties are located in the Permian

Permian
 Basin Operations 

Our Permian Basin operations historically have emphasized
 downspacing redevelopment activities in the prolific
 oil-producing Spraberry field in the Permian Basin. Since we
 began our Permian Basin redevelopment initiative in 2002, we
 have increased by approximately five-fold our net acreage
 position in the related fields and are targeting the Permian
 Basin for continued expansion through our Permian Basin
 operation s headquarters in Midland, Texas. Production from
 the region is primarily from the Spraberry, Dean and Wolfcamp
 formations at depths between 6,000 and 10,000 feet, and is
 heavily weighted toward long-lived oil and NGLs.

During 2008, our Permian Basin operations produced approximately
 14.9 Bcfe (13 of our total production) and accounted for
 approximately 436.6 Bcfe or 45 of our total estimated
 proved reserves at year end. Oil and NGLs accounted for 73 of
 total the Permian Basin production for 2008. We drilled
 122 wells in the region during 2008 with a 100 success
 rate. Based upon our current level of drilling activity, our
 drilling inventory in this area would sustain a five-year
 drilling program.

Our largest field in the Permian Basin by reserves is the
 Spraberry Field, where we have been active for more than
 20 years. We operate our wells in this field and hold an
 average 80 working interest. This property consists of net
 developed and undeveloped acres of 55,989 and 8,907,
 respectively on which there were 829 wells as of
 December 31, 2008 producing approximately 13.5 Bcfe
 net in 2008. This field is located in the Spraberry trend and
 productive zones in the field include the Spraberry, Dean and
 Wolfcamp formations. At year-end 2008, our share of estimated
 proved reserves attributed to this field was 419.1 Bcfe,
 consisting of 69 oil and 31 natural gas.

Gulf
 of Mexico Deepwater Operations 

We have acquired and maintained a significant acreage position
 in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater. We have successfully generated
 and operated deepwater exploration and development projects
 since 1996. As a corollary to our exploration activities, we
 have pioneered sophisticated deepwater development strategies
 employing extensive subsea tieback technologies that allow us to
 produce our discoveries without the expense of permanent
 production facilities. As of December 31, 2008, we held
 interests in 95 deepwater blocks and 40 subsea wells. These
 wells were tied back to 31 host production facilities for
 production processing. An additional four wells were then under
 development for tieback to two additional host production
 facilities. Although we have interests throughout the Gulf of
 Mexico, we focus much of our efforts in infrastructure-dominated
 corridors where our subsea technology can be most efficiently
 deployed. We feel our geological understanding based on
 exploration success in these corridors gives us a competitive
 advantage in assessing prospects and vying for new leases.

Production in our Gulf of Mexico deepwater operations is largely
 from Pleistocene to lower Miocene aged formations and varies
 between oil and gas depending on formation and age. During 2008,
 our deepwater operation produced approximately 40.4 Bcfe
 (34 of our total production) and accounted for approximately
 198.7 Bcfe or 20 of our total estimated proved reserves at
 year end. Natural gas accounted for 69 of total deepwater
 production for 2008. We drilled eight wells in the region during
 2008 with a 63 success rate.

We operate Atwater Valley 426, known as Bass Lite, in which in
 December 2008 we increased our working interest by 11.6 to
 53.8 . It is in the Pleistocene formation and is located in
 approximately 6,750 feet of water. The field consists of
 two development wells drilled during 2007 that are connected by
 a 56-mile 
 subsea tieback to the Devil s Tower spar. Production on
 Bass Lite began in February 2008 and the field produced
 8.5 Bcfe net to our interest during 2008. The project
 commenced production at full capacity once the topside
 facilities work was completed in August 2008. At year end 2008,
 our share of estimated proved reserves attributed to this field
 was 95.8 Bcfe, of which 100 are natural gas.

We operate Garden Banks 462, known as Geauxpher, in which we
 hold a 60 working interest. We made this deepwater discovery in
 June 2008. The well, which lies in water depths of approximately
 2,700 feet, was drilled to a total depth of
 23,156 feet (measured depth). At year-end 2008, our share
 of estimated proved reserves attributed to the discovery was
 32.7 Bcfe, consisting of 3 oil and 97 natural gas. A
 two-well development is underway, with initial production
 expected during the first half of 2009. Apache Corporation holds
 a 40 working interest in the development.

Green Canyon 646, known as Daniel Boone, is operated by W T
 Offshore, Inc. and consists of one well in the
 Pliocene/Pleistocene formation. It is located in approximately
 4,200 feet of water and we have an approximate 40 working
 interest in the well. The field is being developed and first
 production is expected in 2009. At year end 2008, our share of
 estimated proved reserves attributed to this field was
 18.3 Bcfe, consisting of 68 oil and 32 natural gas.

East Breaks 558/602, known as Northwest Nansen, is operated by
 Anadarko Petroleum Corp. The field, which is in the
 Pliocene/Pleistocene formation, consists of four wells in
 approximately 3,500 feet of water that are connected by
 subsea tiebacks to the Nansen spar. We hold a 50 working
 interest in the East Breaks 558 well, which was completed
 as a gas well, and a 33 working interest in the three East
 Breaks 602 wells, which were completed as oil wells. The
 field began producing in February 2008 and the field produced
 12.9 Bcfe net to our interest during 2008. At year end
 2008, our share of estimated proved reserves attributed to the
 field was 16.6 Bcfe, consisting of 34 oil and 66 natural
 gas.

Ewing Bank 921, known as North Black Widow, is operated by ENI
 Petroleum US and began producing in the Pliocene/Pleistocene
 formation in 2007. We hold an approximate 35 working interest
 in one well, which is located in approximately 1,700 feet
 of water. Our share of net production during 2008 was
 approximately 1.9 Bcfe. At year end 2008, our share of
 estimated proved reserves attributed to the field was
 7.8 Bcfe, consisting of 91 oil and 9 natural gas.

Gulf
 of Mexico Shelf Operations 

As an operator on the Gulf of Mexico shelf for a number of
 years, we expanded our Gulf of Mexico shelf operations in 2006
 through our acquisition of the Gulf of Mexico operations of
 Forest Oil Corporation

8

Table of Contents 

Forest and in January 2008 through our acquisition
 of an indirect subsidiary of StatoilHydro ASA that owns
 substantially all of its former Gulf of Mexico shelf assets and
 operations. We increased our interests in shelf operations to
 335 blocks at year-end 2008 from 235 blocks at year-end 2007.
 Due to our operational scale and substantial lease position on
 the shelf, we are able to pursue a diverse array of exploration
 and development projects on the shelf, including numerous
 engineering projects designed to increase production and
 reserves, as well as to manage production costs through
 optimization of topside facilities and efficiencies of scale.
 Drilling prospects run the gamut from relatively small,
 low-risk, conventional shelf projects that can be drilled from
 one of our numerous existing platform facilities, to
 high-impact, deep shelf exploration prospects at depths
 approaching 20,000 total vertical feet.

During 2008, our Gulf of Mexico shelf operation produced
 approximately 63.1 Bcfe (53 of our total production) and
 accounted for approximately 338.6 Bcfe or 35 of our total
 estimated proved reserves at year end. Natural gas accounted for
 76 of total shelf production for 2008. We drilled 17 wells
 in the region during 2008 with an 88 success rate.

Our largest field in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf by reserves is
 Vermilion 380. At year-end 2008, estimated proved reserves
 attributed to this field were 33.1 Bcfe, consisting of
 approximately 50 oil and 50 natural gas. During 2008, we
 drilled three wells and completed one well before Hurricane Ike
 damaged the platform. Hurricane Ike also interrupted the
 drilling of a fourth well. Remaining development involves
 finishing the drilling of the fourth well, drilling a fifth well
 and completing the remaining wells. We anticipate that
 production from the five new wells will commence by third
 quarter 2009. The field currently has two producing wells (one
 of which is the new well we drilled and completed in
 2008) in 340 feet of water. These two wells produced
 approximately 0.5 Bcfe in 2008. We generated this prospect
 from former Forest properties and hold a 100 working interest
 in the newly drilled wells.

We operate Vermilion
 14/26/35, 
 which consists of 10 producing wells in less than 20 feet
 of water. We hold a 100 working interest in this field. It has
 been producing for more than 20 years from numerous
 formations and in 2008 produced approximately 1.5 Bcfe net.
 At year-end 2008, estimated proved reserves attributed to this
 field were 30.1 Bcfe, consisting of approximately 8 oil
 and 92 natural gas.

We operate our 100 working interest in West Cameron 110 which
 consists of six producing wells. We operate the field, which has
 been producing for more than 20 years from numerous
 formations in approximately 40 feet of water and produced
 approximately 4.7 Bcfe net in 2008. At year-end 2008,
 estimated proved reserves attributed to this field were
 29.3 Bcfe, consisting of approximately 4 oil and 96 
 natural gas.

We operate South Pass 24, which consists of 25 producing wells
 in approximately 10 feet of water. We have a 97 working
 interest in the property. South Pass 24 has been producing for
 more than 50 years from numerous formations, and in 2008
 produced approximately 1.8 Bcfe net. At year-end 2008,
 estimated proved reserves attributed to this field were
 21.5 Bcfe, consisting of approximately 61 oil and 39 
 natural gas.

We operate High Island 116, which consists of one producing well
 in approximately 30 feet of water. We have a 100 working
 interest in the property. It has been producing for more than
 20 years and in 2008 produced approximately 0.8 Bcfe
 net. At year-end 2008, estimated proved reserves attributed to
 this field were 19.5 Bcfe, consisting of approximately 3 
 oil and 97 natural gas.

PV10 value PV10 is not a measure under generally
 accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
 GAAP and differs from the corollary GAAP measure
 standardized measure of discounted future net cash
 flows in that PV10 is calculated without regard to future
 income taxes. Management believes that the presentation of PV10
 values is relevant and useful to our investors because it
 presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to
 our estimated proved reserves independent of our individual
 income tax attributes, thereby isolating the intrinsic value of
 the estimated future cash flows attributable to our reserves.
 Because many factors that are unique to each individual company
 affect the amount of future income taxes to be paid, the use of
 a pre-tax measure provides greater comparability of assets when
 evaluating companies. For these reasons, management uses, and
 believes the industry generally uses,

the PV10 measure in evaluating and comparing acquisition
 candidates and assessing the potential return on investment
 related to investments in oil and natural gas properties. 

PV10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance
 under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a
 substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net
 cash flows as defined under GAAP. For our presentation of the
 standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, please

Uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of proved
 reserves, including many risk factors beyond our control.
 Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating
 subsurface accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be
 measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve
 estimate is a function of the quality of available data and the
 interpretation thereof. As a result, estimates by different
 engineers often vary, sometimes significantly. In addition,
 physical factors such as the results of drilling, testing and
 production subsequent to the date of an estimate, as well as
 economic factors such as change in product prices and operating
 costs, may require revision of such estimates. Accordingly, oil
 and natural gas quantities ultimately recovered will vary from
 reserve estimates.

Marketing
 and Customers 

We market substantially all of the oil and natural gas
 production from the properties we operate, as well as the
 properties operated by others where our interest is significant.
 Our natural gas, oil and condensate production is sold to a
 variety of customers under short-term marketing arrangements at
 market-based prices. The following table lists customers
 accounting for more than 10 of our total revenues for the year

Title to
 Properties 

Substantially all of our properties currently are subject to
 liens securing our bank credit facility and obligations under
 hedging arrangements with lenders under our bank credit
 facility. In addition, our properties are subject to customary
 royalty interests, liens incident to operating agreements, liens
 for current taxes and other typical burdens and encumbrances. We
 do not believe that any of these burdens or encumbrances
 materially interfere with the use of such properties in the
 operation of our business. Our properties may also be subject to
 obligations or duties under applicable laws, ordinances, rules,
 regulations and orders of governmental authorities.

We believe that we have performed customary investigation of,
 and have satisfactory title to or rights in, all of our
 producing properties. As is customary in the oil and natural gas
 industry, minimal investigation of title is made at the time of
 acquisition of undeveloped properties. Title investigation is
 made usually only before commencement of drilling operations. We
 believe that title issues are less likely to arise with offshore
 oil and natural gas properties than with onshore properties.

Competition 

We believe that our leasehold acreage, exploration, drilling and
 production capabilities, large
 3-D seismic
 database and technical and operational experience enable us to
 compete effectively. However, our primary competitors include
 major integrated oil and natural gas companies, nationally owned
 or sponsored enterprises, and domestic independent oil and
 natural gas companies. Many of our larger competitors possess
 and employ financial and personnel resources substantially
 greater than those available to us. Such companies may be able
 to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and
 exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and
 purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our
 financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire
 additional prospects and discover reserves in the future is
 dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable
 properties and consummate transactions in a highly competitive
 environment. In addition, there is substantial competition for
 capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas
 industry. Larger competitors may be better able to withstand
 sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling and absorb the burden
 of changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can,
 which would adversely affect our competitive position.

Royalty
 Relief 

The Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act
 RRA ), effective November 28, 1995, provides
 that all tracts in the Western and Central Planning Areas of the
 Gulf of Mexico, including whole lease blocks in the Eastern
 Planning Area of the Gulf of Mexico lying west of 87 degrees, 30
 minutes West longitude, in water more than 200 meters deep and
 offered for bid within five years after the effective date of
 the RRA, will be entitled to royalty relief as follows:

Water Depth 

Royalty Relief 

200-400 
 meters

no royalty payable on the first 17.5 million BOE produced

400-800 
 meters

no royalty payable on the first 52.5 million BOE produced

800 meters or deeper

no royalty payable on the first 87.5 million BOE produced

Leases offered for bid within five years after the effective
 date of the RRA are referred to as post-Act leases. 
 The RRA also allows federal offshore lessees the opportunity to
 apply for discretionary royalty relief for new production on
 leases acquired before the RRA was enacted, or pre-Act
 leases. If the MMS determines that new production under a
 pre-Act lease would not be economic without royalty relief, then
 the MMS may relieve a portion of the royalty to make the project
 economic.

In addition to granting discretionary royalty relief, the MMS
 has elected to include royalty relief provisions in many leases
 issued after November 28, 2000, or post-2000
 leases. For these post-2000 lease sales that have occurred
 to-date for which the MMS has elected to include royalty relief,
 the MMS has specified the water depth categories and royalty
 suspension volumes applicable to production from leases issued
 in the sale.

In 2004, the MMS adopted additional royalty relief incentives
 for production of natural gas from reservoirs located deep under
 shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico. These incentives apply to
 natural gas

14

Table of Contents 

produced in water depths of less than 200 meters and from deep
 natural gas accumulations of at least 15,000 feet of true
 vertical depth. Drilling of qualified wells must have started on
 or after March 26, 2003, and production must begin before
 May 3, 2009, unless the lessee obtains a one-year
 extension. These incentives generally apply only to production
 that occurs during years when the average price of natural gas
 on the New York Mercantile Exchange does not exceed the price
 threshold of 10.15 per million Btu, expressed in 2007 dollars.
 In regulations published in November 2008, the MMS implemented
 additional royalty relief provisions to reflect statutory
 changes enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The
 regulations provide enhanced incentives for gas production from
 wells of at least 20,000 feet of true vertical depth in
 waters of 400 meters or less. These regulations also expand the
 royalty relief incentives for natural gas produced from leases
 in waters 200 to 400 meters deep by entitling such leases to the
 royalty relief incentives available under the existing
 regulations for leases in less than 200 meters of water, with
 two exceptions. First, the incentive for production in waters
 200 to 400 meters in depth applies to wells for which drilling
 began on or after May 18, 2007, rather than March 26,
 2003, and that begin production before May 3, 2013, rather
 than May 3, 2009. Second, the applicable price threshold is
 4.55 per million Btu, expressed in 2007 dollars, rather than
 10.15.

The impact of royalty relief can be significant. Effective with
 lease sales in 2008, royalty rates for leases in all water
 depths in the Gulf of Mexico increased to 18.75 of production.
 For Gulf of Mexico leases awarded in 2007 lease sales, the
 royalty rate was 16.7 of production in all water depths.
 Royalty relief can substantially improve the economics of
 projects located in deepwater or in shallow water involving deep
 natural gas.

Many of our MMS leases that are subject to royalty relief
 contain language that suspends royalty relief if commodity
 prices exceed predetermined threshold levels for a given
 calendar year. As a result, royalty relief for a lease in a
 particular calendar year may be contingent upon average
 commodity prices remaining below the price threshold specified
 for that year. Since 2000, commodity prices have exceeded some
 of the predetermined price thresholds, except in 2002, for a
 number of our projects. For the affected leases, we have been
 ordered by the MMS to pay royalties for natural gas produced in
 some of those years. However, we have challenged the MMS s
 authority to include price thresholds in six of our post-Act
 leases awarded in 1996 and 1997. We believe that post-Act leases
 are entitled to automatic royalty relief under the RRA,
 regardless of commodity prices, and have pursued administrative
 and judicial remedies in this dispute with the MMS. For more
 information concerning the contested royalty payments and the
 MMS s demands, see Item 3. Legal
 Proceedings. 

Regulation 

Our operations are subject to extensive and continually changing
 regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry. Many
 departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized
 by statute to issue, and have issued, rules and regulations
 binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual
 participants. The failure to comply with such rules and
 regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory
 burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of
 doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability. We
 do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different
 manner by these regulations than are our competitors.

Transportation
 and Sale of Natural Gas 

Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural
 gas in interstate commerce have been regulated pursuant to the
 Natural Gas Act of 1938, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and
 the regulations promulgated thereunder by the Federal Energy
 Regulatory Commission, or FERC. In the past, the federal
 government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could
 be sold. Deregulation of natural gas sales by producers began
 with the enactment of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. In
 1989, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act,
 which removed all remaining Natural Gas Act of 1938 and Natural
 Gas Policy Act of 1978 price and non-price controls affecting
 producer sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993.
 Congress could, however, re-enact price controls in the future.
 The FERC regulates interstate natural gas pipeline
 transportation rates and service conditions, which affect the
 marketing of gas produced by us and the revenues received by us
 for sales of such natural gas. The FERC requires interstate
 pipelines to provide open-

15

Table of Contents 

access transportation on a non-discriminatory basis for all
 natural gas shippers. The FERC frequently reviews and modifies
 its regulations regarding the transportation of natural gas with
 the stated goal of fostering competition within all phases of
 the natural gas industry. In addition, with respect to
 production onshore or in state waters, the intra-state
 transportation of natural gas would be subject to state
 regulatory jurisdiction as well.

In August, 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005,
 or EP Act 2005. Among other matters, EP Act 2005 amends the
 Natural Gas Act, or NGA, to make it unlawful for any
 entity , including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers
 such as Mariner, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or
 contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural
 gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject
 to regulation by the FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed
 by the FERC. On January 19, 2006, the FERC issued
 regulations implementing this provision. The regulations make it
 unlawful in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas
 subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale
 of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the
 FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ
 any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue
 statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement
 necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or to
 engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit
 upon any person. EP Act 2005 also gives the FERC authority to
 impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA up to
 1,000,000 per day per violation. The new anti-manipulation rule
 does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or
 other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to
 activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the
 extent the activities are conducted in connection
 with gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to
 FERC jurisdiction. It therefore reflects a significant expansion
 of the FERC s enforcement authority. We do not anticipate
 we will be affected any differently than other producers of
 natural gas.

Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the
 natural gas industry are considered from time to time by
 Congress, the FERC, state regulatory bodies and the courts. We
 cannot predict when or if any such proposals might become
 effective or their effect, if any, on our operations. The
 natural gas industry historically has been closely regulated;
 thus, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory
 approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue
 indefinitely into the future.

Regulation
 of Production 

The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation
 under a wide range of state and federal statutes, rules, orders
 and regulations. State and federal statutes and regulations
 require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and
 reports concerning operations. Texas and Louisiana, the states
 in which we own and operate properties, have regulations
 governing conservation matters, including provisions for the
 unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the
 establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and
 natural gas wells, the spacing of wells, and the plugging and
 abandonment of wells and removal of related production
 equipment. Texas and Louisiana also restrict production to the
 market demand for oil and natural gas and several states have
 indicated interests in revising applicable regulations. These
 regulations can limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can
 produce from our wells, limit the number of wells, or limit the
 locations at which we can conduct drilling operations. Moreover,
 each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with
 respect to production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and gas
 liquids within its jurisdiction.

Most of our offshore operations are conducted on federal leases
 that are administered by the MMS. Such leases require compliance
 with detailed MMS regulations and orders pursuant to the Outer
 Continental Shelf Lands Act that are subject to interpretation
 and change by the MMS. Among other things, we are required to
 obtain prior MMS approval for our exploration plans and
 development and production plans at each lease. MMS regulations
 also impose construction requirements for production facilities
 located on federal offshore leases, as well as detailed
 technical requirements for plugging and abandonment of wells,
 and removal of platforms and other production facilities on such
 leases. The MMS requires lessees to post surety bonds, or
 provide other acceptable financial assurances, to ensure all
 obligations are satisfied on federal offshore leases. The cost
 of these surety bonds or other financial assurances can be
 substantial, and there is no assurance that bonds or other
 financial assurances can be obtained in all cases. We are
 currently in compliance with all MMS financial assurance
 requirements. Under certain circumstances, the MMS is authorized
 to suspend or terminate

16

Table of Contents 

operations on federal offshore leases. Any suspension or
 termination of operations on our offshore leases could have an
 adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
 operations.

Our crude oil and gas production is subject to royalty interests
 established under the applicable leases. Royalty on production
 from state and private leases is generally governed by state law
 and royalty on production from leases on federal or Indian lands
 is governed by federal law. The MMS is authorized by statute to
 administer royalty valuation and collection for production from
 federal and Indian leases. The MMS generally exercises this
 authority through standards established under its regulations
 and related policies. We do not anticipate that we will be
 affected by changes in federal or state law affecting royalty
 obligations any differently than other producers of crude oil
 and natural gas.

Environmental
 and Safety Regulations 

Our operations are subject to numerous stringent and complex
 laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels
 governing the discharge of materials into the environment or
 otherwise relating to human health and environmental protection.
 These laws and regulations may, among other things:

require acquisition of a permit before drilling commences;

restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various
 materials that can be released into the environment in
 connection with drilling and production activities; and

limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities in certain
 ecologically sensitive and other protected areas.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to obtain
 or comply with permits may result in the assessment of
 administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of
 remedial requirements and the imposition of injunctions to force
 future compliance. Offshore drilling in some areas has been
 opposed by environmental groups and, in some areas, has been
 restricted. Our business and prospects could be adversely
 affected to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental
 action is taken that prohibits or restricts our exploration and
 production activities or imposes environmental protection
 requirements that result in increased costs to us or the oil and
 natural gas industry in general.

The following is a summary of some of the existing laws and
 regulations to which our business operations are subject:

Spills and Releases. The Comprehensive
 Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
 CERCLA ), and analogous state laws, impose joint and
 several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of
 the original act, on certain classes of persons that contributed
 to the release of a hazardous substance into the
 environment. These persons include the owner and
 operator of the site where the release occurred,
 past owners and operators of the site, and companies that
 disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous
 substances found at the site. Responsible parties under CERCLA
 may be liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances
 that have been released into the environment and for damages to
 natural resources. Additionally, it is not uncommon for
 neighboring landowners and other third parties to file tort
 claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused
 by the release of hazardous substances into the environment. In
 the course of our ordinary operations, we may generate waste
 that may fall within CERCLA s definition of a
 hazardous substance. 

We currently own, lease or operate, and have in the past owned,
 leased or operated, numerous properties that for many years have
 been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas.
 Many of these properties have been operated by third parties
 whose actions with respect to the treatment and disposal or
 release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our
 control. It is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may
 have been disposed of or released on or under such properties,
 or on or under other locations where such wastes may have been
 taken for disposal. These properties and wastes disposed thereon
 may be subject to CERCLA and analogous state laws. Under such
 laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously
 disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by
 prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property
 (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial
 plugging operations to prevent future contamination, or to pay
 the costs of such remedial measures. Although we believe we have
 utilized operating and disposal practices that are standard in
 the industry, during the course of operations

17

Table of Contents 

hydrocarbons and other wastes may have been released on some of
 the properties we own, lease or operate. We are not presently
 aware of any pending
 clean-up 
 obligations that could have a material impact on our operations
 or financial condition.

The Oil Pollution Act OPA ). The
 OPA and regulations thereunder impose strict, joint and several
 liability on responsible parties for damages,
 including natural resource damages, resulting from oil spills
 into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the
 exclusive economic zone of the United States. A
 responsible party includes the owner or operator of
 an onshore facility and the lessee or permittee of the area in
 which an offshore facility is located. The OPA establishes a
 liability limit for onshore facilities of 350 million,
 while the liability limit for offshore facilities is equal to
 all removal costs plus up to 75 million in other damages.
 These liability limits may not apply if a spill is caused by a
 party s gross negligence or willful misconduct, the spill
 resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or
 operating regulation, or if a party fails to report a spill or
 to cooperate fully in a
 clean-up. 

The OPA also requires the lessee or permittee of an offshore
 area in which a covered offshore facility is located to provide
 financial assurance in the amount of 35 million to cover
 liabilities related to an oil spill. The amount of financial
 assurance required under the OPA may be increased up to
 150 million depending on the risk represented by the
 quantity or quality of oil that is handled by a facility. The
 failure to comply with the OPA s requirements may subject a
 responsible party to civil, criminal, or administrative
 enforcement actions. We are not aware of any action or event
 that would subject us to liability under the OPA, and we believe
 that compliance with the OPA s financial assurance and
 other operating requirements will not have a material impact on
 our operations or financial condition.

Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution
 Control Act of 1972, also known as the Clean Water Act, imposes
 restrictions and controls on the discharge of produced waters
 and other oil and gas pollutants into navigable waters. These
 controls have become more stringent over the years, and it is
 possible that additional restrictions may be imposed in the
 future. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into
 state and federal waters. Certain state regulations and the
 general permits issued under the Federal National Pollutant
 Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, program prohibit the
 discharge of produced waters and sand, drilling fluids, drill
 cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and gas
 industry into certain coastal and offshore waters. The Clean
 Water Act provides for civil, criminal and administrative
 penalties for unauthorized discharges of oil and other
 pollutants, and imposes liability on parties responsible for
 those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental
 damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages
 resulting from the release. Comparable state statutes impose
 liabilities and authorize penalties in the case of an
 unauthorized discharge of petroleum or its derivatives, or other
 pollutants, into state waters.

In furtherance of the Clean Water Act, the Environmental
 Protection Agency EPA promulgated the Spill
 Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure SPCC regulations, which require facilities that possess certain
 threshold quantities of oil that could impact navigable waters
 or adjoining shorelines to prepare SPCC plans and meet specified
 construction and operating standards. The SPCC regulations were
 revised in 2002 and required the amendment of SPCC plans before
 February 18, 2006, if necessary, and required compliance
 with the implementation of such amended plans by August 18,
 2006. This compliance deadline has been extended multiple times
 and on May 16, 2007 was extended until July 1, 2009.
 We have SPCC plans and similar contingency plans in place at
 several of our facilities, and may be required to prepare such
 plans for additional facilities where a spill or release of oil
 could reach or impact jurisdictional waters of the United
 States. We do not anticipate that the revisions to the SPCC
 regulations will cause a material impact on our operations or
 financial condition.

Air Emissions. The Federal Clean Air Act and
 associated state laws and regulations restrict the emission of
 air pollutants from many sources, including oil and natural gas
 operations. New facilities may be required to obtain permits
 before operations can commence, and existing facilities may be
 required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in
 order to remain in compliance. Federal and state regulatory
 agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties
 for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the
 Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. We
 believe that compliance with the Clean Air

18

Table of Contents 

Act and analogous state laws and regulations will not have a
 material impact on our operations or financial condition.

Recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of
 certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse
 gases and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be
 contributing to warming of the Earth s atmosphere. In
 response to such studies, the U.S. Congress is actively
 considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
 In addition, at least 17 states have declined to wait for
 Congress to develop and implement climate control legislation
 and have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of
 greenhouse gases. Also, as a result of the U.S. Supreme
 Court s decision on April 2, 2007 in Massachusetts,
 et al. v. EPA , the EPA must consider whether it is
 required to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from mobile
 sources (e.g., cars and trucks) even if Congress does not adopt
 new legislation specifically addressing emissions of greenhouse
 gases. The Court s holding in Massachusetts that
 greenhouse gases fall under the Federal Clean Air Act s
 definition of air pollutant may also result in
 future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary
 sources under various Clean Air Act programs, including those
 that may be used in our operations. It is not possible at this
 time to predict how legislation that may be enacted to address
 greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business. However,
 future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance
 costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have a
 material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
 demand for our operations, results of operations, and cash flows.

Waste Handling. The Resource Conservation and
 Recovery Act RCRA ), and analogous state and local
 laws and regulations govern the management of wastes, including
 the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. RCRA
 imposes stringent operating requirements, and liability for
 failure to meet such requirements, on a person who is either a
 generator or transporter of hazardous
 waste or an owner or operator of a
 hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facility. RCRA
 specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste
 drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated
 with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil
 and natural gas. A similar exemption is contained in many of the
 state counterparts to RCRA. As a result, we are not required to
 comply with a substantial portion of RCRA s requirements
 because our operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous
 wastes. However, these wastes may be regulated by EPA or state
 agencies as solid waste. In addition, ordinary industrial
 wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes,
 and waste compressor oils, may be regulated under RCRA as
 hazardous waste. We do not believe the current costs of managing
 our wastes, as they are presently classified, to be significant.
 However, any repeal or modification of the oil and natural gas
 exploration and production exemption, or modifications of
 similar exemptions in analogous state statutes, would increase
 the volume of hazardous waste we are required to manage and
 dispose of and would cause us, as well as our competitors, to
 incur increased operating expenses.

Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species
 Act, or ESA, restricts activities that may affect endangered or
 threatened species or their habitats. We believe that we are in
 substantial compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of
 previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could
 cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to
 operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.

Safety. The Occupational Safety and Health
 Act, or OSHA, and other similar laws and regulations govern the
 protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA
 hazard communication standard, EPA community right-to-know
 regulations under Title III of CERCLA and analogous state
 statutes require that information be maintained about hazardous
 materials used or produced in our operations and that this
 information be provided to employees, state and local
 governments and citizens. We believe that we are in substantial
 compliance with these requirements and with other applicable
 OSHA requirements.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2008, we had 276 full-time
 employees. Our employees are not represented by any labor
 unions. We have never experienced a work stoppage or strike and
 we consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory.

Insurance
 Matters 

Mariner is a member of OIL Insurance, Ltd. OIL ), an
 energy industry insurance cooperative, which provides our
 primary layer of physical damage and windstorm insurance
 coverage. Our coverage is subject to

19

Table of Contents 

a 10.0 million per-occurrence deductible for our assets
 and a 250.0 million per-occurrence loss limit. However, if
 a single event causes losses to all OIL-insured assets in excess
 of 750.0 million, amounts covered for such losses will be
 reduced on a pro-rata basis among OIL members.

In addition to our primary coverage through OIL, we also
 maintain commercial difference in conditions 
 insurance that would apply (with no additional deductible) once
 our limits with OIL are exhausted, as well as partial business
 interruption insurance covering certain of our significant
 producing fields and certain other fields situated in hurricane
 prone areas. Our business interruption coverage begins to
 provide benefits after a
 60-day 
 waiting period once the designated field is shut-in due to a
 covered event and is limited to 35 of the forecast cash flow
 from each designated property. Our commercial policy expires
 annually on June 1, and is subject to a general limit of
 100.0 million per occurrence and in the case of named
 windstorms, a combined annual aggregate limit of
 100.0 million covering both property damage and business
 interruption.

In 2008, our operations were adversely affected by Hurricane
 Ike. The hurricane resulted in shut-in and delayed production as
 well as facility repairs and replacement expenses. We are
 evaluating the nature and extent of damage resulting from the
 hurricane. With respect to Hurricane Ike, our OIL coverage has a
 10.0 million per occurrence deductible and a
 250.0 million per occurrence limit, subject to an
 industry-wide loss limit per occurrence of 750.0 million.
 To the extent that aggregate claims exceed the OIL industry-wide
 loss limit per occurrence, we expect our insurance recovery
 would be reduced pro-rata with all other competing claims from
 Hurricane Ike and the shortfall covered by our commercial excess
 insurance, subject to policy limits.

Applicable insurance for our Hurricane Katrina and Rita claims
 with respect to the Gulf of Mexico assets previously acquired
 from Forest is provided by OIL. Our coverage for the former
 Forest properties is subject to a deductible of
 5.0 million per occurrence and a 1.0 billion
 industry-wide loss limit per occurrence. OIL has advised us that
 the aggregate claims resulting from each of Hurricanes Katrina
 and Rita are expected to exceed the 1.0 billion per
 occurrence loss limit and that therefore, our insurance recovery
 is expected to be reduced pro-rata with all other competing
 claims from the storms. During 2008, we settled our Katrina and
 Rita claims with our excess insurance providers for a one-time
 payment of 48.5 million. The insurance coverage for
 Mariner s legacy properties is subject to a
 3.75 million deductible. See Item 7.

 estimated future net revenues are discounted at an annual rate
 of 10 , in accordance with the SEC s practice, to determine
 their present value. The present value is shown to
 indicate the effect of time on the value of the revenue stream

Item 1A. 

Risk
 Factors. 

Risks
 Relating to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and to Our
 Business 

The
 recent worldwide financial and credit crisis could lead to an
 extended worldwide economic recession and have a material
 adverse effect on our results of operations and
 liquidity. 

The recent worldwide financial and credit crisis has reduced the
 availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation
 and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide. The
 shortage of liquidity and credit combined with recent
 substantial losses in worldwide equity markets could lead to an
 extended worldwide economic recession. A recession or slowdown
 in economic activity would likely reduce worldwide demand for
 energy and result in lower oil and natural gas prices, which
 could materially adversely affect our profitability and results
 of operations.

In addition, the economic crisis may adversely affect our
 liquidity. We may be unable to obtain adequate funding under our
 bank credit facility because our lending counterparties may be
 unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations, or
 because our borrowing base under the facility may be decreased
 as the result of a redetermination, reducing it due to lower oil
 or natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in
 reserves or

23

Table of Contents 

other reasons. If funding is not available as needed, or is
 available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet
 our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to
 implement our business strategies or otherwise take advantage of
 business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures.

Oil
 and natural gas prices are volatile, and a decline in oil and
 natural gas prices would reduce our revenues, profitability and
 cash flow and impede our growth. 

Our revenues, profitability and cash flow depend substantially
 upon the prices and demand for oil and natural gas. The markets
 for these commodities are volatile and even relatively modest
 drops in prices can affect significantly our financial results
 and impede our growth. Oil and natural gas prices increased to,
 and then declined significantly from, historical highs in 2008
 and may fluctuate and decline significantly in the near future.
 Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate in response to
 relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and
 natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional
 factors beyond our control, such as:

domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;

price and quantity of foreign imports;

actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and
 other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and
 production controls;

level of consumer product demand;

domestic and foreign governmental regulations;

political conditions in or affecting other oil-producing and
 natural gas-producing countries, including the current conflicts
 in the Middle East and conditions in South America and Russia;

weather conditions;

technological advances affecting oil and natural gas consumption;

overall U.S. and global economic conditions; and

price and availability of alternative fuels.

Further, oil prices and natural gas prices do not necessarily
 fluctuate in direct relationship to each other. To the extent
 that oil or natural gas comprises more than 50 of our
 production or estimated proved reserves, our financial results
 may be more sensitive to movements in prices of that commodity.
 Lower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease our
 revenues on a per unit basis, but also may reduce the amount of
 oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. This may
 result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to
 our estimated proved reserves and could have a material adverse
 effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See
 Item 1. Business Estimated Proved
 Reserves. In addition, we may, from time to time, enter
 into long-term contracts based upon our reasoned expectations
 for commodity price levels. If commodity prices subsequently
 decrease significantly for a sustained period, we may be unable
 to perform our obligations or otherwise breach the contract and
 be liable for damages.

Reserve
 estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be
 inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates
 or underlying assumptions will affect materially the quantities
 and present value of our reserves, which may lower our bank
 borrowing base and reduce our access to capital. 

Estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex and
 inherently imprecise. It requires interpretation of the
 available technical data and making many assumptions about
 future conditions, including price and other economic
 conditions. In preparing estimates we project production rates
 and timing of development expenditures. We also analyze the
 available geological, geophysical, production and engineering
 data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary.
 This process also requires economic assumptions about matters
 such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating
 expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.
 Actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues,
 taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and
 quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most
 likely will vary from our estimates, perhaps significantly. In
 addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect
 production history, results of exploration and development,
 prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of

24

Table of Contents 

which are beyond our control. At December 31, 2008,
 approximately 30 of our estimated proved reserves were proved
 undeveloped.

If the interpretations or assumptions we use in arriving at our
 estimates prove to be inaccurate, the amount of oil and natural
 gas that we ultimately recover may differ materially from the
 estimated quantities and net present value of reserves shown in
 this report. See Item 1. Business 
 Estimated Proved Reserves for information about our oil
 and gas reserves.

In
 estimating future net revenues from estimated proved reserves,
 we assume that future prices and costs are fixed and apply a
 fixed discount factor. If any such assumption or the discount
 factor is materially inaccurate, our revenues, profitability and
 cash flow could be materially less than our
 estimates. 

The present value of future net revenues from our estimated
 proved reserves referred to in this report is not necessarily
 the actual current market value of our estimated oil and natural
 gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the
 estimated discounted future net cash flows from our estimated
 proved reserves on fixed prices and costs as of the date of the
 estimate. Actual future prices and costs fluctuate over time and
 may differ materially from those used in the present value
 estimate.

The timing of both the production and expenses from the
 development and production of oil and natural gas properties
 will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from
 our estimated proved reserves and their present value. In
 addition, the 10 discount factor that we use to calculate the
 net present value of future net cash flows for reporting
 purposes in accordance with SEC rules may not necessarily be the
 most appropriate discount factor. The effective interest rate at
 various times and the risks associated with our business or the
 oil and natural gas industry, in general, will affect the
 appropriateness of the 10 discount factor in arriving at an
 accurate net present value of future net cash flows.

If oil
 and natural gas prices decrease, we may be required to
 write-down the carrying value and/or the estimates of total
 reserves of our oil and natural gas properties. 

Accounting rules applicable to us require that we review
 periodically the carrying value of our oil and natural gas
 properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market
 factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment
 reviews and the continuing evaluation of development plans,
 production data, economics and other factors, we may be required
 to write-down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas
 properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to
 earnings. At December 31, 2008, the net capitalized cost of
 our proved oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling limit and
 we recorded a non-cash ceiling test impairment of
 575.6 million during the fourth quarter. Refer to
 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Oil and
 Gas Properties, and Note 1. Summary of
 Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the
 Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8
 of this Annual Report on
 Form 10-K 
 for a discussion of our use of the full cost method of
 accounting for our oil and gas properties and its impact at
 December 31, 2008. We may incur other non-cash charges in
 the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our
 results of operations in the period taken. We may also reduce
 our estimates of the reserves that may be economically
 recovered, which could have the effect of reducing the value of
 our reserves.

We
 need to replace our reserves at a faster rate than companies
 whose reserves have longer production periods. Our failure to
 replace our reserves would result in decreasing reserves and
 production over time. 

Unless we conduct successful exploration and development
 activities or acquire properties containing proven reserves, our
 estimated proved reserves will decline as reserves are depleted.
 Producing oil and natural gas reserves are generally
 characterized by declining production rates that vary depending
 on reservoir characteristics and other factors. High production
 rates generally result in recovery of a relatively higher
 percentage of reserves from properties during the initial few
 years of production. A significant portion of our current
 operations are conducted in the Gulf of Mexico. Production from
 reserves in the Gulf of Mexico generally declines more rapidly
 than reserves from reservoirs in other producing regions. As a
 result, our need to replace reserves from new investments is
 relatively greater than those of producers who produce their
 reserves over a longer time period, such as those producers
 whose reserves are located in areas where the rate of reserve
 production is lower. If we are not able to find, develop or
 acquire additional reserves to replace our

25

Table of Contents 

current and future production, our production rates will decline
 even if we drill the undeveloped locations that were included in
 our estimated proved reserves. Our future oil and natural gas
 reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and income,
 are dependent on our success in economically finding or
 acquiring new reserves and efficiently developing our existing
 reserves.

Approximately
 50 of our total estimated proved reserves are either developed
 non-producing or undeveloped and those reserves may not
 ultimately be produced or developed. 

As of December 31, 2008, approximately 20 of our total
 estimated proved reserves were developed non-producing and
 approximately 30 were undeveloped. These reserves may not
 ultimately be developed or produced. Furthermore, not all of our
 undeveloped or developed non-producing reserves may be
 ultimately produced during the time periods we have planned, at
 the costs we have budgeted, or at all, which in turn may have a
 material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Any
 production problems related to our Gulf of Mexico properties
 could reduce our revenue, profitability and cash flow
 materially. 

A substantial portion of our exploration and production
 activities is located in the Gulf of Mexico. This concentration
 of activity makes us more vulnerable than some other industry
 participants to the risks associated with the Gulf of Mexico,
 including delays and increased costs relating to adverse weather
 conditions such as hurricanes, which are common in the Gulf of
 Mexico during certain times of the year, drilling rig and other
 oilfield services and compliance with environmental and other
 laws and regulations.

Our
 exploration and development activities may not be commercially
 successful. 

Exploration activities involve numerous risks, including the
 risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas
 reservoirs will be discovered. In addition, the future cost and
 timing of drilling, completing and producing wells is often
 uncertain. Furthermore, drilling operations may be curtailed,
 delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors,
 including:

unexpected drilling conditions;

pressure or irregularities in formations;

equipment failures or accidents;

adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes, which are
 common in the Gulf of Mexico during certain times of the year;

compliance with governmental regulations;

unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment or labor;

reductions in oil and natural gas prices; and

limitations in the market for oil and natural gas.

If any of these factors were to occur with respect to a
 particular project, we could lose all or a part of our
 investment in the project, or we could fail to realize the
 expected benefits from the project, either of which could
 materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.

Our
 exploratory drilling projects are based in part on seismic data,
 which is costly and cannot ensure the commercial success of the
 project. 

Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop and exploit
 prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through
 geophysical and geological analyses, production data and
 engineering studies, the results of which are often uncertain.
 Even when used and properly interpreted,
 3-D seismic
 data and visualization techniques only assist geoscientists and
 geologists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon
 indicators.
 3-D seismic
 data do not enable an interpreter to conclusively determine
 whether hydrocarbons are present or producible economically. In
 addition, the use of
 3-D seismic
 and other advanced technologies may require greater predrilling
 expenditures than other drilling strategies. Because of these
 factors, we could incur losses as a result of exploratory
 drilling expenditures. Poor results from exploration activities
 could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows,
 ability to replace reserves and results of operations.

26

Table of Contents 

Oil
 and gas drilling and production involve many business and
 operating risks, any one of which could reduce our levels of
 production, cause substantial losses or prevent us from
 realizing profits. 

Our business is subject to all of the operating risks associated
 with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including:

fires;

explosions;

blow-outs and surface cratering;

uncontrollable flows of underground natural gas, oil and
 formation water;

natural events and natural disasters, such as loop currents, and
 hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;

pipe or cement failures;

casing collapses;

lost or damaged oilfield drilling and service tools;

abnormally pressured formations; and

environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills,
 pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases.

If any of these events occurs, we could incur substantial losses
 as a result of injury or loss of life, severe damage to and
 destruction of property, natural resources and equipment,
 pollution and other environmental damage,
 clean-up 
 responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties,
 suspension of our operations and repairs to resume operations.

Our
 offshore operations involve special risks that could increase
 our cost of operations and adversely affect our ability to
 produce oil and natural gas. 

Offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks
 specific to the marine environment, such as capsizing,
 collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse
 weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial
 damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, we
 could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or
 eliminate the funds available for exploration, development or
 leasehold acquisitions, or result in loss of equipment and
 properties.

Exploration for oil or natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico
 deepwater generally involves greater operational and financial
 risks than exploration on the shelf. Deepwater drilling
 generally requires more time and more advanced drilling
 technologies, involving a higher risk of technological failure
 and usually higher drilling costs. Moreover, deepwater projects
 often lack proximity to the physical and oilfield service
 infrastructure present in the shallow waters of the Gulf of
 Mexico, necessitating significant capital investment in subsea
 flow line infrastructure. Subsea tieback production systems
 require substantial time and the use of advanced and very
 sophisticated installation equipment supported by remotely
 operated vehicles. These operations may encounter mechanical
 difficulties and equipment failures that could result in
 significant cost overruns. As a result, a significant amount of
 time and capital must be invested before we can market the
 associated oil or natural gas, increasing both the financial and
 operational risk involved with these operations. Because of the
 lack and high cost of infrastructure, some reserve discoveries
 in the deepwater may never be produced economically. See
 Item 1. Business Properties 
 Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Operations in this Annual Report
 on
 Form 10-K 
 for information about our use of tieback technology.

Our
 hedging transactions may not protect us adequately from
 fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and may limit future
 potential gains from increases in commodity prices or result in
 losses. 

We typically enter into hedging arrangements pertaining to a
 substantial portion of our expected future production in order
 to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas
 prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow. These
 financial arrangements typically take the form of price swap
 contracts and costless collars. Hedging arrangements expose us
 to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including
 situations when the other party to the hedging contract defaults
 on its contract or production is less than

27

Table of Contents 

expected. During periods of high commodity prices, hedging
 arrangements may limit significantly the extent to which we can
 realize financial gains from such higher prices. Our hedging
 arrangements reduced the benefit we received from increases in
 oil and natural gas prices by approximately 100.8 million
 in 2008. Although we currently maintain an active hedging
 program, we may choose not to engage in hedging transactions in
 the future. As a result, we may be affected adversely during
 periods of declining oil and natural gas prices.

Counterparty
 contract default could have an adverse effect on
 us. 

Our revenues are generated under contracts with various
 counterparties. Results of operations would be adversely
 affected as a result of non-performance by any of these
 counterparties of their contractual obligations under the
 various contracts. A counterparty s default or
 non-performance could be caused by factors beyond our control
 such as a counterparty experiencing credit default. A default
 could occur as a result of circumstances relating directly to
 the counterparty, such as defaulting on its credit obligations,
 or due to circumstances caused by other market participants
 having a direct or indirect relationship with the counterparty.
 Defaults by counterparties may occur from time to time, and this
 could negatively impact our results of operations, financial
 position and cash flows.

Properties
 we acquire may not produce as projected, and we may be unable to
 determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated
 with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against
 such liabilities. 

Properties we acquire may not produce as expected, may be in an
 unexpected condition and may subject us to increased costs and
 liabilities, including environmental liabilities. The reviews we
 conduct of acquired properties, prior to acquisition, are not
 capable of identifying all potential adverse conditions.
 Generally, it is not feasible to review in depth every
 individual property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily, we
 will focus our review efforts on the higher value properties or
 properties with known adverse conditions and will sample the
 remainder. However, even a detailed review of records and
 properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential
 problems or permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with
 the properties to assess fully their condition, any
 deficiencies, and development potential. Inspections may not
 always be performed on every well, and environmental problems,
 such as ground water contamination, are not necessarily
 observable even when an inspection is undertaken.

Market
 conditions or transportation impediments may hinder our access
 to oil and natural gas markets or delay our
 production. 

Market conditions, the unavailability of satisfactory oil and
 natural gas transportation or the remote location of our
 drilling operations may hinder our access to oil and natural gas
 markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready
 market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a
 number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil
 and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines or
 trucking and terminal facilities. In deepwater operations, the
 availability of a ready market depends on the proximity of, and
 our ability to tie into, existing production platforms owned or
 operated by others and the ability to negotiate commercially
 satisfactory arrangements with the owners or operators. We may
 be required to shut in wells or delay initial production for
 lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of
 pipeline or gathering system capacity. When that occurs, we are
 unable to realize revenue from those wells until the production
 can be tied to a gathering system. This can result in
 considerable delays from the initial discovery of a reservoir to
 the actual production of the oil and natural gas and realization
 of revenues.

The
 unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment,
 supplies or personnel could affect adversely our ability to
 execute on a timely basis our exploration and development plans
 within budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our
 financial condition and results of operations. 

Increased drilling activity periodically results in service cost
 increases and shortages in drilling rigs, personnel, equipment
 and supplies in certain areas. Shortages in availability or the
 high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or personnel
 could delay or affect adversely our exploration and development
 operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our
 financial condition and results of operations. Increases in
 drilling activity in the United States or the Gulf of Mexico
 could exacerbate this situation.

Competition
 in the oil and natural gas industry is intense and many of our
 competitors have resources that are greater than ours, giving
 them an advantage in evaluating and obtaining properties and
 prospects. 

We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring
 prospects and productive properties, marketing oil and natural
 gas and securing equipment and trained personnel. Many of our
 competitors are major and large independent oil and natural gas
 companies and possess and employ financial, technical and
 personnel resources substantially greater than ours. Those
 companies may be able to develop and acquire more prospects and
 productive properties than our financial or personnel resources
 permit. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and discover
 reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate
 and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in a
 highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial
 competition for capital available for investment in the oil and
 natural gas industry. Larger competitors may be better able to
 withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling and absorb
 the burden of changes in laws and regulations more easily than
 we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position.
 We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in
 acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing
 hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and
 raising additional capital.

Financial
 difficulties encountered by our farm-out partners, working
 interest owners or third-party operators could adversely affect
 our ability to timely complete the exploration and development
 of our prospects. 

From time to time, we enter into farm-out agreements to fund a
 portion of the exploration and development costs of our
 prospects. Moreover, other companies operate some of the other
 properties in which we have an ownership interest. Liquidity and
 cash flow problems encountered by our partners and co-owners of
 our properties may lead to a delay in the pace of drilling or
 project development that may be detrimental to a project. In
 addition, our farm-out partners and working interest owners may
 be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of
 projects as they become due. In the case of a farm-out partner,
 we may have to obtain alternative funding in order to complete
 the exploration and development of the prospects subject to the
 farm-out agreement. In the case of a working interest owner, we
 may be required to pay the working interest owner s share
 of the project costs. We cannot assure you that we would be able
 to obtain the capital necessary in order to fund either of these
 contingencies.

We
 cannot control the timing or scope of drilling and development
 activities on properties we do not operate, and therefore we may
 not be in a position to control the associated costs or the rate
 of production of the reserves. 

Other companies operate some of the properties in which we have
 an interest. As a result, we have a limited ability to exercise
 influence over operations for these properties or their
 associated costs. Our dependence on the operator and other
 working interest owners for these projects and our limited
 ability to influence operations and associated costs could
 materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted
 returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities. The
 success and timing of drilling and development activities on
 properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of
 factors that are outside of our control, including timing and
 amount of capital expenditures, the operator s expertise
 and financial resources, approval of other participants in
 drilling wells and selection of technology.

Compliance
 with environmental and other government regulations could be
 costly and could affect production negatively. 

Exploration for and development, production and sale of oil and
 natural gas in the United States and the Gulf of Mexico are
 subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and
 regulations, including environmental and health and safety laws
 and regulations. We may be required to make large expenditures
 to comply with these environmental and other requirements.
 Matters subject to regulation include, among others,
 environmental assessment prior to development, discharge and
 emission permits for drilling and production operations,
 drilling bonds, and reports concerning operations and taxation.

Under these laws and regulations, and also common law causes of
 action, we could be liable for personal injuries, property
 damage, oil spills, discharge of pollutants and hazardous
 materials, remediation and
 clean-up 

29

Table of Contents 

costs and other environmental damages. Failure to comply with
 these laws and regulations or to obtain or comply with required
 permits may result in the suspension or termination of our
 operations and subject us to remedial obligations, as well as
 administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these
 laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially
 increase our costs. We cannot predict how agencies or courts
 will interpret existing laws and regulations, whether additional
 or more stringent laws and regulations will be adopted or the
 effect these interpretations and adoptions may have on our
 business or financial condition. For example, the OPA imposes a
 variety of regulations on responsible parties 
 related to the prevention of oil spills. The implementation of
 new, or the modification of existing, environmental laws or
 regulations promulgated pursuant to the OPA could have a
 material adverse impact on us. Further, Congress or the MMS
 could decide to limit exploratory drilling or natural gas
 production in additional areas of the Gulf of Mexico.
 Accordingly, any of these liabilities, penalties, suspensions,
 terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse
 effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See
 Item 1. Business Regulation for
 more information on our regulatory and environmental matters.

Compliance
 with MMS regulations could significantly delay or curtail our
 operations or require us to make material expenditures, all of
 which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
 condition or results of operations. 

A significant portion of our operations are located on federal
 oil and natural gas leases that are administered by the MMS. As
 an offshore operator, we must obtain MMS approval for our
 exploration, development and production plans prior to
 commencing such operations. The MMS has promulgated regulations
 that, among other things, require us to meet stringent
 engineering and construction specifications, restrict the
 flaring or venting of natural gas, govern the plug and
 abandonment of wells located offshore and the installation and
 removal of all production facilities and govern the calculation
 of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from
 federal leases.

Our
 insurance may not fully protect us against our business and
 operating risks. 

We maintain insurance for some, but not all, of the potential
 risks and liabilities associated with our business. For some
 risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of
 available insurance is excessive relative to the risks
 presented. As a result of the losses sustained in 2005 from
 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and in 2008 from Hurricane Ike, as
 well as other factors affecting market conditions, premiums and
 deductibles for certain insurance policies, including windstorm
 insurance, have increased substantially. In some instances,
 certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for
 reduced amounts of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to
 renew our existing insurance policies or procure other desirable
 insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.

Although we maintain insurance at levels that we believe are
 appropriate and consistent with industry practice, we are not
 fully insured against all risks, including drilling and
 completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third
 parties or insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental
 risks generally are not fully insurable. Losses and liabilities
 from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment
 of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on
 our financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
 we have not yet been able to determine the full extent of our
 insurance recovery and the net cost to us resulting from the
 hurricanes. See Item 1. Business 
 Insurance Matters and Item 7. Management s
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
 Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for
 more information.

Risks
 Relating to Significant Acquisitions and Other Strategic
 Transactions 

The
 evaluation and integration of significant acquisitions may be
 difficult. 

We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties,
 prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that
 appear to fit within our overall business strategy. Significant
 acquisitions and other strategic transactions may involve many
 risks, including:

diversion of our management s attention to evaluating,
 negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and
 strategic transactions;

30

Table of Contents 

challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations,
 information management and other technology systems and business
 cultures with those of ours while carrying on our ongoing
 business;

our exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired businesses,
 operations or properties;

possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations,
 including assumptions relating to reserves, future production,
 volumes, revenues, costs and synergies;

difficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate
 organizations; and

challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with
 acquired operations.

The process of integrating operations could cause an
 interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our
 business. Members of our senior management may be required to
 devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process,
 which will decrease the time they will have to manage our
 business. If our senior management is not able to effectively
 manage the integration process, or if any significant business
 activities are interrupted as a result of the integration
 process, our business could suffer.

If we
 fail to realize the anticipated benefits of a significant
 acquisition, our results of operations may be lower than we
 expect. 

The success of a significant acquisition will depend, in part,
 on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities from
 combining the acquired assets or operations with those of ours.
 Even if a combination is successful, it may not be possible to
 realize the full benefits we may expect in estimated proved
 reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating
 synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition or
 realize these benefits within the expected time frame.
 Anticipated benefits of an acquisition may be offset by
 operating losses relating to changes in commodity prices, or in
 oil and natural gas industry conditions, or by risks and
 uncertainties relating to the exploratory prospects of the
 combined assets or operations, or an increase in operating or
 other costs or other difficulties. If we fail to realize the
 benefits we anticipate from an acquisition, our results of
 operations may be adversely affected.

Financing
 and other liabilities of a significant acquisition may adversely
 affect our financial condition and results of operations or be
 dilutive to stockholders. 

Future significant acquisitions and other strategic transactions
 could result in our incurring additional debt, contingent
 liabilities and expenses, all of which could decrease our
 liquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our
 financial condition and operating results. In addition, an
 issuance of securities in connection with such transactions
 could dilute or lessen the rights of our current common
 stockholders.

Risks
 Relating to Financings 

We
 will require additional capital to fund our future activities.
 If we fail to obtain additional capital, we may not be able to
 implement fully our business plan, which could lead to a decline
 in reserves. 

We may require financing beyond our cash flow from operations to
 fully execute our business plan. Historically, we have financed
 our business plan and operations primarily with internally
 generated cash flow, bank borrowings, proceeds from the sale of
 oil and natural gas properties, exploration arrangements with
 other parties, the issuance of debt securities, privately raised
 equity and borrowings from affiliates. In the future, we will
 require substantial capital to fund our business plan and
 operations. We expect to meet our needs from one or more of our
 excess cash flow, debt financings and equity offerings.
 Sufficient capital may not be available on acceptable terms or
 at all. If we cannot obtain additional capital resources, we may
 curtail our drilling, development and other activities or be
 forced to sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms.

The issuance of additional debt would require that a portion of
 our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of
 interest on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use our
 cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures,
 acquisitions and general corporate requirements, which could
 place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other
 competitors. Additionally, if revenues decrease as a result of
 lower oil or natural gas prices, operating difficulties or
 declines in reserves, our ability to obtain the capital
 necessary to undertake or complete future exploration and
 development programs and to pursue other opportunities may be
 limited. This could also result in a curtailment of our
 operations relating to exploration and development of our
 prospects, which in turn could result in a decline in our oil
 and natural gas reserves.

31

Table of Contents 

We may
 not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet our debt
 obligations. 

We expect our earnings and cash flow to vary significantly from
 year to year due to price volatility. As a result, the amount of
 debt that we can manage, in some periods, may not be appropriate
 for us in other periods. Additionally, our future cash flow may
 be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and commitments,
 including the notes. Any insufficiency could negatively impact
 our business. A range of economic, competitive, business and
 industry factors will affect our future financial performance
 and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flow from
 operations and to pay our debt. Many of these factors, such as
 oil and natural gas prices, economic and financial conditions in
 our industry and the global economy or competitive initiatives
 of our competitors, are beyond our control.

Our
 debt level and the covenants in the agreements governing our
 debt could negatively impact our financial condition, results of
 operations and business prospects and prevent us from fulfilling
 our obligations under our debt obligations. 

Our level of indebtedness and the covenants contained in the
 agreements governing our debt could have important consequences
 for our operations, including:

making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations
 and increasing the risk that we may default on our debt
 obligations;

requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
 from operations to required payments on debt, thereby reducing
 the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital
 expenditures and other general business activities;

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the
 future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions
 and general corporate and other activities;

limiting management s discretion in operating our business;

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to,
 changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

detracting from our ability to withstand, successfully, a
 downturn in our business or the economy generally;

placing us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged
 competitors; and

making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, because
 debt under our bank credit facility will, in some cases, vary
 with prevailing interest rates.

We may be required to repay all or a portion of our debt on an
 accelerated basis in certain circumstances. If we fail to comply
 with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements
 governing our debt, it could lead to an event of default and the
 consequent acceleration of our obligation to repay outstanding
 debt. Our ability to comply with these covenants and other
 restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control,
 including prevailing economic and financial conditions.

In addition, under the terms of our bank credit facility and the
 indentures governing our two series of senior unsecured notes,
 we must comply with certain financial covenants, including
 current asset and total debt ratio requirements under the bank
 credit facility. Our ability to comply with these covenants in
 future periods will depend on our ongoing financial and
 operating performance, which in turn will be subject to general
 economic conditions and financial, market and competitive
 factors, in particular the selling prices for our products and
 our ability to successfully implement our overall business
 strategy.

The breach of any of the covenants in the indentures or the bank
 credit facility could result in a default under the applicable
 agreement or a cross default under each agreement, which would
 permit the applicable lenders or noteholders, as the case may
 be, to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and
 payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. We may not
 have sufficient funds to make such payments. If we are unable to
 repay our debt out of cash on hand, we could attempt to
 refinance such debt, sell assets or repay such debt with the
 proceeds from an equity offering. We cannot assure that we will
 be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on
 our debt or those future borrowings, equity financings or
 proceeds from the sale of assets will be available to pay or
 refinance such debt. The terms of our debt, including our

32

Table of Contents 

bank credit facility, may also prohibit us from taking such
 actions. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash
 through an offering of our capital stock, a refinancing of our
 debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions,
 the value of our assets and our operating performance at the
 time of such offering or other financing. We cannot assure that
 any such offerings, refinancing or sale of assets could be
 successfully completed.

We have offices in Houston and Midland, Texas and Lafayette,
 Louisiana. As of December 31, 2008, our leases covered
 approximately 94,226 square feet, 6,580 square feet
 and 14,376 square feet of office space in Houston, Midland
 and Lafayette, respectively. The leases run through
 October 31, 2018, October 31, 2011 and
 September 30, 2013 in Houston, Midland and Lafayette,
 respectively. The total annual costs of our leases for 2008 were
 approximately 2.1 million.

Item 3. 

Legal
 Proceedings. 

Mariner and its subsidiary, Mariner Energy Resources, Inc.
 MERI ), own numerous properties in the Gulf of
 Mexico. Certain of such properties were leased from the MMS
 subject to the RRA. Section 304 of the RRA relieves lessees
 of the obligation to pay royalties on certain leases until after
 a designated volume has been produced. Four of these leases held
 by Mariner and two held by MERI that are producing or have
 produced contain lease language (inserted by the MMS) that
 conditions royalty relief on commodity prices remaining below
 specified thresholds. Since 2000, commodity prices have exceeded
 some of the predetermined thresholds, except in 2002. In May
 2006 and September 2008, the MMS issued orders asserting that
 the price thresholds had been exceeded in calendar years 2000,
 2001, and each of the years from 2003 through 2007, and,
 accordingly, that royalties were due under such leases on oil
 and gas produced in those years. The potential liability of MERI
 under its leases relate to production from the leases commencing
 July 1, 2005, the effective date of Mariner s
 acquisition of MERI. Mariner and MERI believe that the MMS did
 not have the statutory authority to include commodity price
 threshold language in the leases governed by Section 304 of
 the RRA and accordingly have withheld payment of royalties.
 Mariner and MERI have challenged the MMS s authority in
 pending administrative appeals for those leases for which the
 MMS has issued orders to pay.

The enforceability of the price threshold provisions in leases
 granted pursuant to Section 304 of the RRA is currently
 being litigated in several administrative appeals filed by other
 companies in addition to Mariner, as well as in Kerr-McGee
 Oil Gas Corp. v. Allred ,
 No. 08-30069 
 (5th Cir.). In the Kerr-McGee litigation, the
 district court in the Western District of Louisiana granted
 Kerr-McGee s motion for summary judgment, ruling that the
 price threshold provisions are unlawful and unenforceable under
 Section 304 of the RRA. Kerr-McGee Oil Gas
 Corp. v. Allred , No. 2:06 CV 0439 (W.D. La.) (Mem.
 Ruling filed Oct. 30, 2007). The Department of the Interior
 appealed that judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for
 the Fifth Circuit. On January 12, 2009, the Fifth Circuit
 affirmed the district court s judgment that the price
 provisions are unlawful based on Section 304 of the RRA.
 Kerr-McGee Oil Gas Corp. v.
 U.S. Dep t of Interior , 
 F.3d , 2009 WL 57883 (5th Cir. Jan. 12, 2009).
 Until the appeals process is complete, we will continue to
 monitor the case. Given the judicial history of the case, we
 determined that as of December 31, 2008, we no longer will
 record a liability for our estimated exposure to the MMS on our
 leases granted pursuant to Section 304 of the RRA. At
 December 31, 2008, this liability would have been
 57.3 million, including interest. In addition, as of
 December 31, 2008, we began including in our estimated
 proved reserves those reserves attributable to these RRA
 Section 304 leases which, at December 31, 2008, was
 approximately 18.1 Bcfe.

In the ordinary course of business, we are a claimant
 and/or a
 defendant in various legal proceedings, including proceedings as
 to which we have insurance coverage and those that may involve
 the filing of liens against us or our assets. We do not consider
 our exposure in these proceedings, individually or in the
 aggregate, to be material.

Business
 Overview 

We are an independent oil and natural gas exploration,
 development and production company with principal operations in
 the Permian Basin and the Gulf of Mexico. As of
 December 31, 2008, approximately 70 of our total estimated
 proved reserves were classified as proved developed, with
 approximately 45 of the total estimated proved reserves located
 in the Permian Basin, 20 in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater and
 35 on the Gulf of Mexico shelf.

Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend
 substantially on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and
 our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves
 that are economically recoverable while controlling and reducing
 costs. The energy markets historically have been very volatile.
 Oil and natural gas prices increased to, and then declined
 significantly from, historical highs in 2008 and may fluctuate
 and decline significantly in the future. Although we attempt to
 mitigate the impact of price declines and provide for more
 predictable cash flows through our hedging strategy, a
 substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices or
 poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on
 our financial position, results of operations, cash flows,
 quantities of natural gas and oil reserves that we can
 economically produce and our access to capital. Conversely, the
 use of derivative instruments also can prevent us from realizing
 the full benefit of upward price movements.

The recent worldwide financial and credit crisis has reduced the
 availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation
 and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide. The
 shortage of liquidity and credit combined with recent
 substantial losses in worldwide equity markets could lead to an
 extended worldwide economic recession. A recession or slowdown
 in economic activity would likely reduce worldwide demand for
 energy and result in lower oil and natural gas prices, which
 could materially adversely affect our profitability and results
 of operations.

Acquisitions. On December 19, 2008, we
 acquired additional working interests in our existing property,
 Atwater Valley Block 426 (Bass Lite), for approximately
 32.6 million, increasing our working interest by 11.6 to
 53.8 . We internally estimated proved reserves attributable to
 the acquisition of approximately 17.6 Bcfe (100 natural
 gas).

On January 31, 2008, we acquired 100 of the equity in a
 subsidiary of Hydro Gulf of Mexico, Inc. pursuant to a
 Membership Interest Purchase Agreement executed on
 December 23, 2007. The acquired subsidiary, now known as
 Mariner Gulf of Mexico LLC MGOM ), was an indirect
 subsidiary of StatoilHydro ASA and owns substantially all of its
 former Gulf of Mexico shelf operations. A summary of these
 assets and operations as of January 1, 2008 includes:

Ryder Scott Company, L.P. estimated proved oil and gas reserves
 of 49.7 Bcfe, 93 of which are developed;

interests in 36 (16 net) producing wells producing approximately
 53 MMcfe per day net to MGOM s interest, 76 of which
 Mariner now operates;

gas gathering systems comprised of 31 miles of
 10-inch, 
 12-inch and
 16-inch 
 pipelines; and

approximately 106,000 net acres of developed leasehold and
 256,000 net acres of undeveloped leasehold.

We paid approximately 243.0 million for MGOM, subject to
 customary purchase price adjustments, including
 8.0 million for reimbursement of drilling costs
 attributable to the High Island 166 #5 well.

On December 31, 2007, February 29, 2008, and
 December 1, 2008 we acquired additional working interests
 in certain of our existing properties in the Spraberry field in
 the Permian Basin. We internally estimated proved reserves
 attributable to the December 2007 acquisition of approximately
 94.9 Bcfe (75 oil and NGLs), to the February 2008
 acquisition of approximately 14.0 Bcfe (65 oil and NGLs)
 and to the December 2008 acquisition of approximately
 13.4 Bcfe (66 oil and NGLs). We operate substantially all
 of the assets. The purchase prices, subject to customary
 purchase price adjustments, were approximately
 122.5 million for the December 2007 acquisition,
 21.7 million for the February 2008 acquisition and
 19.4 million for the December 2008 acquisition.

On March 2, 2006, a subsidiary of Mariner completed a
 merger transaction with Forest Energy Resources, Inc. (the
 Forest Merger pursuant to which Mariner effectively
 acquired Forest s Gulf of Mexico operations. Prior to the
 consummation of the Forest Merger, Forest transferred and
 contributed the assets and certain liabilities associated with
 its Gulf of Mexico operations to Forest Energy Resources.
 Immediately prior to the Forest Merger, Forest distributed all
 of the outstanding shares of Forest Energy Resources to Forest
 stockholders on a pro rata basis. Forest Energy Resources then
 merged with a newly-formed subsidiary of Mariner, became a new
 wholly-owned subsidiary of Mariner, and changed its name to
 Mariner Energy Resources, Inc. Immediately following the Forest
 Merger, approximately 59 of Mariner common stock was held by
 stockholders of Forest and approximately 41 of Mariner common
 stock was held by the pre-merger stockholders of Mariner. In the
 Forest Merger, Mariner issued 50,637,010 shares of common
 stock to the stockholders of Forest Energy Resources, Inc. Our
 acquisition of Forest Energy Resources added approximately
 298 Bcfe of estimated proved reserves. The Forest Merger
 has had a significant effect on the comparability of operating
 and financial results between periods.

Net loss for 2008 was 388.7 million compared to net
 income of 143.9 million for 2007. The decrease was
 primarily attributable to 886.5 million in impairments
 resulting from our full cost ceiling test, other property
 impairment and goodwill, as discussed below. Basic and
 fully-diluted earnings per share for 2008 were (4.44) for each
 measure compared to 1.68 and 1.67, respectively for 2007.

Net production Natural gas production increased
 approximately 18 in 2008 to approximately 218 MMcf per
 day, compared to approximately 186 MMcf per day in 2007.
 Oil production increased 16 in 2008 to approximately
 13,300 barrels per day, compared to approximately
 11,500 barrels per day in 2007. Natural gas liquids
 production increased 30 in 2008 and total overall production
 increased 18 in 2008 to approximately 323 MMcfe per day,
 compared to 275 MMcfe per day in 2007. Natural gas
 production comprised approximately 67 of total production in
 both 2008 and 2007.

Net production in the Gulf of Mexico for 2008 increased 16 to
 103.5 Bcfe from 89.1 Bcfe for 2007 primarily
 reflecting the start up in 2008 of production from several new
 projects, most notably, Northwest Nansen located in East Breaks
 602 (which contributed 12.9 Bcfe) and Bass Lite located in
 Atwater 426 (which contributed 8.4 Bcfe), and the impact of
 our acquisition of MGOM (which contributed 13.1 Bcfe). This
 increase was offset by the impacts of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike
 in the third quarter which resulted in net shut-in production
 (assuming pre-hurricane net production levels remained constant)
 of approximately 20 Bcfe.

Onshore production for 2008 increased 33 to 14.9 Bcfe from
 11.2 Bcfe for 2007, primarily as a result of our
 acquisition of additional interests and drilling and development
 of existing acreage in the Permian Basin (which contributed
 2.6 Bcfe in 2008).

Natural gas, oil and NGL revenues for 2008 increased 43 
 to 1,248.0 million compared to 873.1 million for
 2007 as a result of increased pricing (approximately
 217.1 million, net of the effect of hedging), and
 increased production (approximately 157.8 million).

During 2008, our revenues reflected a net recognized hedging
 loss of 100.8 million comprised of 98.8 million in
 unfavorable cash settlements and an unrealized loss of
 2.0 million related to the ineffective portion not
 eligible for deferral under SFAS 133. This compares to a
 net recognized hedging gain of approximately 45.1 million
 for 2007, comprised of 46.7 million in favorable cash
 settlements and an unrealized loss of 1.6 million related
 to the ineffective portion not eligible for deferral under
 SFAS 133.

Other revenues for 2008 increased approximately
 50.9 million to 52.5 million from 1.6 million
 for 2007 as a result of the release of suspended revenue of
 46.5 million related to a potential MMS royalty liability
 and 4.3 million of imputed rent from the lease of office
 property acquired in January 2008.

Lease operating expense LOE in 2008
 increased approximately 79.0 million to
 231.6 million from 152.6 million for 2007, primarily
 as a result of a 36.0 million multiple-year retrospective
 contingent OIL insurance premium. LOE also was imparted by
 start-up of
 production in February 2008 from Bass Lite and Northwest Nansen,
 the acquisition of MGOM in January 2008, and the impact of the
 additional Permian Basin assets acquired at year-end 2007, which
 are long-lived and typically carry a higher
 per-unit LOE.

Severance and ad valorem tax for 2008 increased
 approximately 5.1 million to 18.2 million from
 13.1 million for 2007 due to increased severance as a
 result of higher oil prices and increased production

43

Table of Contents 

from the drilling and completion of additional wells and our
 acquisition of additional interests in the Permian Basin.

Transportation expense for 2008 increased approximately
 6.2 million to 15.0 million from 8.8 million
 for 2007 due primarily to commencement of production in 2008 at
 Bass Lite, Northwest Nansen, Galveston 352 and High Island A467.

General and administrative expense G A for 2008 increased approximately 18.4 million to
 60.6 million from 42.2 million for 2007. The
 increase was due primarily to an increase in stock compensation
 expense of approximately 10.1 million to
 21.0 million from 10.9 million for 2007. This
 increase was primarily due to long-term performance-based
 restricted stock awarded during 2008. See Note 5.
 Share-Based Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated
 Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual
 Report on
 Form 10-K 
 for more detail on stock grants. Beginning in 2008, that portion
 of Lafayette and Midland office expense that is directly related
 to production activity was classified as LOE, and we began
 capitalizing stock compensation expense attributable to those
 non-officer employees directly engaged in exploration,
 development and acquisition activities. Capitalized G A
 related to our acquisition, exploration and development
 activities increased 5.8 million to 19.8 million in
 2008 from 14.0 million in 2007.

Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense for
 2008 increased approximately 83.0 million to
 467.3 million from 384.3 million for 2007, primarily
 as a result of increased production from our acquisitions of
 MGOM and additional interests in the Permian Basin properties,
 and start-up 
 production from Bass Lite and Northwest Nansen.

Full cost ceiling test impairment of 575.6 million
 was recognized in December 2008 as a result of the net
 capitalized cost of our proved oil and gas properties exceeding
 our ceiling limit. See Critical Accounting
 Policies and Estimates Oil and Gas Properties 
 for more detail on this impairment.

Goodwill impairment of 295.6 million was recorded
 in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of our annual
 impairment test. The goodwill was originally recorded in
 conjunction with the Forest Merger and the impairment is a
 result of weakened economic conditions and a decline in our
 stock price during the fourth quarter of 2008. See
 Critical Accounting Policies and
 Estimates Goodwill for more detail on this
 impairment.

Other property impairment of 15.3 million was
 recognized as a result of our annual impairment assessement
 performed on our other property. See Critical
 Accounting Policies and Estimates Other
 Property for more detail on this impairment.

Net interest expense for 2008 increased approximately
 3.1 million to 56.4 million from 53.3 million
 for 2007 due primarily to an increase in average daily debt
 levels, partially offset by lower interest rates, and an
 additional four months of interest expense related to our
 8 Senior Notes due 2017 issued on April 30, 2007.
 Capitalized interest increased to 9.7 million in 2008 from
 0.5 million in 2007.

Income before taxes and minority interest for 2008
 decreased approximately 658.0 million to a loss of
 436.7 million from income of 221.3 million for 2007
 due primarily to 886.5 million in impairments related to
 our full cost ceiling test, other property and goodwill as
 discussed above.

Provision for income taxes for 2008 reflected an
 effective tax rate of 11.0 as compared to 34.9 for 2007. The
 decrease in our effective tax rate was due primarily to a
 permanent book-tax difference attributable to the goodwill
 impairment discussed above. Excluding this permanent book-tax
 difference, the effective rate for 2008 would have been 34.2 .

Net income for 2007 was 143.9 million compared to
 121.5 million for 2006. The increase was primarily the
 result of higher operating income attributable to 12 full months
 of our ownership of the Forest Gulf of Mexico operations. Basic
 and fully-diluted earnings per share for 2007 were 1.68 and
 1.67, respectively compared to 1.59 and 1.58, respectively
 for 2006.

Net production Natural gas production increased 21 in
 2007 to approximately 186 MMcf per day, compared to
 approximately 154 MMcf per day in 2006. Oil production
 increased 30 in 2007 to approximately 11,500 barrels per
 day, compared to approximately 8,900 barrels per day in
 2006. Natural gas

45

Table of Contents 

liquids increased 43 in 2007 and total overall production
 increased 25 in 2007 to approximately 275 MMcfe per day,
 compared to 221 MMcfe per day in 2006. Natural gas
 production comprised approximately 68 of total production in
 2007 compared to approximately 70 in 2006. The increase in
 production and the oil to gas ratio resulted from the 12 full
 months of ownership of the Forest Gulf of Mexico operations in
 2007, compared to approximately 10 months in 2006. Our Gulf
 of Mexico production in 2006 was adversely affected by the 2005
 hurricane season, resulting in shut-in production and startup
 delays. As a result of ongoing repairs to pipelines, facilities,
 terminals and host facilities, most of the shut-in production
 recommenced by the end of 2006. Specifically, our Rigel project
 recommenced production in the first quarter of 2006, and our
 Pluto and Ochre projects recommenced production in the third
 quarter of 2006.

Production in the Gulf of Mexico increased 25 to 89.1 Bcfe
 for 2007 from 71.3 Bcfe for 2006, while onshore production
 increased 22 to 11.2 Bcfe for 2007 from 9.2 Bcfe for
 2006.

Natural gas, oil and NGL revenues for 2007 increased 33 
 to 873.1 million compared to 656.2 million for 2006
 as a result of increased pricing (approximately
 161.1 million, net of the effect of hedging), and
 increased production (approximately 55.9 million).

During 2007, our revenues reflect a net recognized hedging gain
 of approximately 45.1 million, comprised of
 46.7 million in favorable cash settlements and an
 unrealized loss of 1.6 million related to the ineffective
 portion not eligible for deferral under SFAS 133. This
 compares to a net recognized hedging gain of approximately
 33.0 million for 2006, comprised of 11.3 million in
 favorable cash settlements and an unrealized gain of
 4.2 million related to the ineffective portion not
 eligible for deferral under SFAS 133. In addition, the fair
 value of oil and natural gas derivatives acquired through the
 Forest Merger resulted in a 17.5 million non-cash gain.
 The fair value of the acquired derivatives was fully recognized
 in 2006.

Lease operating expense in 2007 increased 67 to
 152.6 million from 91.6 million for 2006. The
 increase primarily was attributable to 12 full months of
 ownership of the Forest Gulf of Mexico shelf assets in 2007 as
 compared to only 10 months in 2006, which carry a higher
 operating cost than Mariner s legacy deepwater operations.
 Additionally, insurance premiums increased to 17.8 million
 in 2007 from 10.5 million in 2006 as a result of
 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Field costs increased
 7.6 million
 year-over-year 
 in the Permian Basin with the addition of new productive wells
 in the Spraberry field.

Severance and ad valorem taxes were 13.1 million
 and 9.1 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
 increase was primarily attributable to increased production and
 appreciated property values on the Permian Basin properties.

Transportation expense for 2007 was 8.8 million
 compared to 5.1 million for 2006. The increase was
 primarily due to increased production.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization
 DD A expense increased 32 to
 384.3 million from 292.2 million for 2007 and 2006,
 respectively. The increase was a result of increased production
 due to 12 full months of ownership of the Forest Gulf of Mexico
 operations in 2007 as compared to only ten months in 2006, as
 well as an increase in the
 unit-of-production 
 depreciation, depletion and amortization rate. The per unit rate
 increased 6 primarily due to an increase in deepwater
 development activities and the Forest Gulf of Mexico operations,
 as well as increased accretion of asset retirement obligations
 due to the Forest Gulf of Mexico operations.

General and administrative expense totaled
 42.2 million for 2007, compared to 33.6 million for
 2006. The increase was primarily related to a 4.4 million
 increase in professional fees associated with system
 enhancements, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance efforts, insurance claim
 activities and an increase in health insurance costs. In
 addition, overhead reimbursements billed or received from
 working interest owners decreased 4.2 million from
 16.7 million in 2006 to 12.5 million in 2007.
 Salaries and wages for 2007 remained relatively flat at
 35.2 million as the integration of the Forest Gulf of
 Mexico operations has stabilized. The 2006 G A expenses
 included severance, retention, relocation and transition costs
 of 2.6 million related to the acquisition of the Forest
 Gulf of Mexico operations.

Capitalized G A related to our acquisition, exploration and
 development activities increased to 14.0 million in 2007
 from 11.0 million for 2006.

G A expense includes charges for share-based compensation
 expense of 10.9 million for 2007 compared to
 10.2 million for 2006. For 2007 and 2006, 7.0 and
 6.6 million of share-based compensation expense,
 respectively, resulted from amortization of the cost of
 restricted stock granted at the closing of Mariner s equity
 private placement in March 2005 and the remaining related to the
 amortization of new grants issued in 2007 and 2006 with vesting
 periods of three to four years. The restricted stock related to
 Mariner s equity private placement fully vested by May 2006
 and there will be no further charges related to those stock
 grants.

Net interest expense increased to 53.3 million from
 38.7 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. This
 increase was primarily due to an increase in average debt levels
 to 632.1 million for 2007 from 475.1 million for
 2006. Debt increased during 2007 as a result of the April 2007
 issuance of 300 million principal amount of 8 Senior
 Notes due 2017, as well as continuing hurricane-related repair
 and abandonment costs of 37.8 million. Additionally, the
 amendment and restatement of the bank credit facility on
 March 2, 2006 was treated as an extinguishment of debt for
 accounting purposes, and resulted in a charge of
 1.2 million to interest expense. Capitalized interest
 decreased from 1.5 million in 2006 to 0.5 million in
 2007.

Income before taxes and minority interest increased 17 
 to 221.3 million from 188.8 million for 2007 and
 2006, respectively. This increase was primarily the result of
 higher operating income attributed to 12 full months of
 ownership of the Forest Gulf of Mexico operations.

Provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax
 rate of 34.9 for 2007 as compared to an effective tax rate of
 35.7 for the comparable period of 2006.

Operating cash flow OCF is not a financial or
 operating measure under GAAP. The table below reconciles OCF to
 related GAAP information. We believe that OCF is a widely
 accepted financial indicator that provides additional
 information about our ability to meet our future requirements
 for debt service, capital expenditures and working capital, but
 OCF should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
 net income, operating income, cash flow from operating
 activities or any other measure of financial performance
 presented in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of our
 profitability or liquidity.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by
 325.9 million to 862.0 million in 2008 from
 536.1 million in 2007. The increase was due to greater
 operating revenue due to an increase in production of
 48 MMcfe per day or 157.8 million and an increase in
 the realized price per Mcfe of 1.83 or 217.1 million,
 offset by higher lease operating expense.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had a working capital
 deficit of 50.6 million, including non-cash current
 derivative assets and liabilities and deferred tax assets and
 liabilities. In addition, working capital is negatively impacted
 by accrued capital expenditures. This deficit will be funded by
 cash flow from operating activities and our bank credit
 facility, as needed.

Net cash flows used in investing activities increased to
 1,264.8 million in 2008 from 643.8 million in 2007
 primarily due to the acquisition of MGOM (including
 approximately 15.0 million of mid-stream assets reflected
 in other property), increased capital expenditures attributable
 to increased activity in our drilling programs, and an increase
 in other property reflecting an investment of approximately
 34.6 million in office property. This increase was
 partially offset by 31.8 million of restricted cash
 released in January 2007 from the sale of our interest in Garden
 Banks 422 (Cottonwood).

Net cash flows provided by financing activities were
 387.4 million for 2008 compared to 116.7 million for
 2007. The increase was due primarily to 223.5 million
 borrowed in January 2008 under our bank credit facility to
 finance the purchase of MGOM and net increased borrowings of
 342.5 million for working capital requirements. This
 increase was partially offset by the decrease attributable to
 the proceeds received from our issuance in April 2007 of
 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8 senior
 notes due in 2017.

2008 Uses of Capital. Our primary uses of
 capital during 2008 were as follows:

funding capital expenditures (excluding hurricane repairs and
 acquisitions) of approximately 1,005.7 million;

funding hurricane repairs and hurricane-related abandonment
 expenditures of approximately 55.6 million;

paying interest of approximately 62.2 million;

funding the purchase of MGOM for approximately

Proceeds from sale of Cottonwood project in 2006 (Garden Banks

 5.0 million remained as of December 31, 2007 (Refer
 to Restricted Cash under
 Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting
 Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
 Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on
 Form 10-K). 

2008 Hurricane Expenditures. During the year
 ended 2008, we incurred approximately 21.7 million in
 hurricane expenditures resulting from Hurricanes Ike and Gustav,
 of which 0.8 million were repairs and 20.9 were capital
 expenditures. Since 2004, we have incurred approximately
 213.5 million in hurricane expenditures from Hurricanes
 Ike, Gustav, Ivan, Katrina and Rita, of which 0.8 million
 were repairs, 158.2 were capital expenditures and
 54.5 million were hurricane-related abandonment costs. Net
 of our deductible of 14.4 million and insurance proceeds
 received of 69.4 million, our insurance receivable at
 December 31, 2008 was 35.3 million, of which an
 estimated 13.1 million is expected to be settled within
 the next 12 months. However, due to the magnitude of
 Hurricanes Ike, Katrina and Rita and the complexity of the
 insurance claims being processed by the insurance industry, the
 timing of our ultimate insurance recovery cannot be assured. We
 expect to maintain a potentially significant insurance
 receivable through 2010 in respect of Hurricane Ike while we
 actively pursue settlement of our claims to minimize the impact
 to our working capital and liquidity. We expect to recover
 substantially all of our outstanding OIL claims in respect of
 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita by 2010. Any differences between our
 insurance recoveries and insurance receivables will be recorded
 as adjustments to our oil and natural gas properties.

2008 Sources of Capital. Our primary sources
 of capital during 2008 were as follows:

cash flow from operations;

borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility; and

insurance proceeds.

Bank Credit Facility We have a secured
 revolving credit facility with a group of banks pursuant to an
 amended and restated credit agreement dated March 2, 2006,
 as further amended. The credit facility matures January 31,
 2012 and is subject to a borrowing base which is redetermined
 periodically. As of December 31, 2008, maximum credit
 availability under the facility was 1.0 billion, including
 up 50.0 million in letters of credit, subject to a
 borrowing base of 850.0 million scheduled to be
 redetermined in February 2009. The redetermination was pending
 on February 28, 2009, and we anticipate that it will occur
 in March 2009.

The lenders redetermine the borrowing base periodically based
 upon their evaluation of our oil and gas reserves and other
 factors. Any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent
 of all lenders. The outstanding principal balance of loans under
 the credit facility may not exceed the borrowing base. If the
 borrowing base falls below the sum of the amount borrowed and
 uncollateralized letter of credit exposure,

49

Table of Contents 

then to the extent of the deficit, we must prepay borrowings and
 cash collateralize letter of credit exposure, pledge additional
 unencumbered collateral, repay borrowings and cash collateralize
 letters of credit on an installment basis, or effect some
 combination of these actions.

Borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest at
 either a LIBOR-based rate or a prime-based rate, at our option,
 plus a specified margin. We must pay a commitment fee of 0.250 
 to 0.375 per year on unused availability under the bank credit
 facility. We have used borrowings under the facility to
 facilitate the Forest Merger and acquisition of MGOM, and have
 used and may use borrowings under the facility for general
 corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, 570.0 million and
 179.0 million, respectively, were outstanding under the
 credit facility, and the interest rates were 3.31 and 7.25 ,
 respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2008 five
 letters of credit totaling 7.2 million were outstanding,
 of which 4.2 million was required for plugging and
 abandonment obligations at certain of our offshore fields.

Payment and performance of our obligations under the credit
 facility (including any obligations under commodity and interest
 rate hedges entered into with facility lenders) are secured by
 liens upon substantially all of our assets, and guaranteed by
 our subsidiaries, other than MERI which is a co-borrower. We
 also are subject to various restrictive covenants and other
 usual and customary terms and conditions, including limits on
 additional debt, cash dividends and other restricted payments,
 liens, investments, asset dispositions, mergers and speculative
 hedging. Financial covenants under the credit facility require
 us to, among other things:

maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets plus the unused
 borrowing base to consolidated current liabilities of not less
 than 1.0 to 1.0; and

maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the
 credit agreement) of not more than 2.5 to 1.0.

We were in compliance with the financial covenants under the
 bank credit facility as of December 31, 2008. Our breach of
 these covenants would be an event of default, after which the
 lenders could terminate their lending obligations and accelerate
 maturity of any outstanding indebtedness under the credit
 facility which then would become due and payable in full. An
 unrescinded acceleration of maturity under the bank credit
 facility would constitute an event of default under our senior
 notes described below, which could trigger acceleration of
 maturity of the indebtedness evidenced by the senior notes.

Senior Notes Mariner has outstanding the
 following two issues of debt issued in registered transactions,
 referred to collectively as the Notes :

300 million principal amount of
 7 1 / 2 Senior
 Notes due 2013 issued in March 2006 the
 7 1 / 2 Notes 

300 million principal amount of 8 Senior Notes due
 2017 issued in April 2007 the 8 Notes 

The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Mariner, rank
 senior in right of payment to any future subordinated
 indebtedness, rank equally in right of payment with each other
 and with Mariner s existing and future senior unsecured
 indebtedness and are effectively subordinated in right of
 payment to Mariner s senior secured indebtedness, including
 its obligations under its bank credit facility, to the extent of
 the collateral securing such indebtedness, and to all existing
 and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any
 non-guarantor subsidiaries.

The Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior
 unsecured basis by Mariner s existing and future domestic
 subsidiaries. In the future, the guarantees may be released or
 terminated under certain circumstances. Each subsidiary
 guarantee ranks senior in right of payment to any future
 subordinated indebtedness of the guarantor subsidiary, ranks
 equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior
 unsecured indebtedness of the guarantor subsidiary and
 effectively subordinate to all existing and future secured
 indebtedness of the guarantor subsidiary, including its
 guarantees of indebtedness under Mariner s bank credit
 facility, to the extent of the collateral securing such
 indebtedness.

Interest on the
 7 1 / 2 Notes
 is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The
 7 1 / 2 Notes
 mature on April 15, 2013. Interest on the 8 Notes is
 payable on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning
 November 15, 2007. The 8 Notes mature on May 15,
 2017. There is no sinking fund for the Notes.

Table of Contents 

The Company may redeem the
 7 1 / 2 Notes
 at any time before April 15, 2010 and the 8 Notes at
 any time before May 15, 2012, in each case at a price equal
 to the principal amount redeemed plus a make-whole premium,
 using a discount rate of the Treasury rate plus 0.50 and
 accrued but unpaid interest. Beginning on the dates indicated
 below, the Company may redeem the Notes from time to time, in
 whole or in part, at the prices set forth below (expressed as
 percentages of the principal amount redeemed) plus accrued but
 unpaid interest:

May 15, 2014 at 101.333 

May 15, 2015 and thereafter at 100.000 

In addition, before April 15, 2009, the Company may redeem
 up to 35 of the
 7 1 / 2 Notes
 with the proceeds of equity offerings at a price equal to
 107.50 of the principal amount of the
 7 1 / 2 Notes
 redeemed. Before May 15, 2010, the Company may redeem up to
 35 of the 8 Notes with the proceeds of equity offerings
 at a price equal to 108 of the principal amount of the
 8 Notes redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest.

If the Company experiences a change of control (as defined in
 each of the indentures governing the Notes), subject to certain
 exceptions, the Company must give holders of the Notes the
 opportunity to sell to the Company their Notes, in whole or in
 part, at a purchase price equal to 101 of the principal amount,
 plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages to the
 date of purchase.

The Company and its restricted subsidiaries are subject to
 certain negative covenants under each of the indentures
 governing the Notes. The indentures limit the ability of the
 Company and each of its restricted subsidiaries to, among other
 things:

make investments;

incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;

create certain liens;

sell assets;

enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments
 from its subsidiaries to itself;

consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its
 assets;

engage in transactions with affiliates;

pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or
 subordinated indebtedness; and

create unrestricted subsidiaries.

Costs associated with the
 7 1 / 2 Notes
 offering were approximately 8.5 million, excluding
 discounts of 3.8 million. Costs associated with the
 8 Notes offering included aggregate underwriting discounts
 of approximately 5.3 million and offering expenses of
 approximately 1.3 million.

Future Uses of Capital. Our identified needs
 for liquidity in the future are as follows:

funding future capital expenditures;

funding hurricane repairs and hurricane-related abandonment
 operations;

financing any future acquisitions that Mariner may identify;

paying routine operating and administrative expenses; and

paying other commitments comprised largely of cash settlement of
 hedging obligations and debt service.

2009 Capital Expenditures. In the second half
 of 2008, a world-wide economic recession and oversupply of
 natural gas in North America led to an unprecedented decline in
 oil and gas prices. However, the inflated cost of oil field
 services resulting from sustained historically high commodity
 prices did not decrease

51

Table of Contents 

in line with the decline in commodity prices. The prospect of
 continued low commodity prices and disproportionately high
 service costs has constrained the industry s capital
 reinvestment and undermined rates of return in new projects,
 particularly those in areas characterized by high costs or long
 reserve lives. In order to manage our capital program within
 expected cash flows, we tentatively have reduced our 2009
 capital budget by more than 50 from 2008. Refer to Item.
 1. Business Impact of Worldwide Financial Crisis and
 Lower Commodity Prices on Capital Program in Part I
 of this Annual Report on
 Form 10-K 
 for an outline of our planned 2009 activities in the Permian
 Basin and Gulf of Mexico.

We anticipate that our base operating capital expenditures for
 2009 will be approximately 430.6 million (excluding
 hurricane-related expenditures and acquisitions), with
 significant potential for increase or decrease depending upon
 drilling success and cash flow experience during the year.
 Approximately 48 of the base operating capital program is
 planned to be allocated to development activities, 45 to
 exploration activities, and the remainder to other items
 (primarily capitalized overhead and interest). In addition, we
 estimate to incur additional hurricane-related costs of
 36.1 million during 2009 related to Hurricane Ike, that we
 believe is substantially covered under applicable insurance.
 Complete recovery or settlement is not expected to occur during
 the next 12 months.

(1) 

As of December 31, 2008, we incurred debt obligations under
 our bank credit facility, the Notes. 

(2) 

Interest obligations represent interest due on the bank credit
 facility and the Notes at 7.5 and 8 . Future interest
 obligations under our bank credit facility are uncertain, due to
 the variable interest rate on fluctuating balances. Based on a
 3.31 weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding
 under our bank credit facility as of December 31, 2008, our
 cash payments for interest would be 18.9 million annually
 for 2009 through 2011 and 1.6 million in 2012. 

(3) 

We accrued approximately 36.0 million as of
 December 31, 2008, for an insurance premium contingency
 related to our membership in OIL. As part of our membership, we
 are obligated to pay a withdrawal premium if we elect to
 withdraw from OIL. We do not anticipate withdrawing from OIL;
 however, due to the contingency, OIL calculates a potential
 withdrawal premium annually based on past losses and we accrue a
 liability for the potential premium. OIL requires smaller
 members to provide a letter of credit or other acceptable
 security in favor of OIL to secure payment of the withdrawal
 premium. Acceptable security has included a letter of credit or
 a security agreement pursuant to which a member grants OIL a
 security interest in certain claim proceeds payable by OIL to
 the member. We anticipate that we will enter into such a
 security agreement, granting to OIL a security interest in a
 portion of our Hurricane Ike claim proceeds payable by OIL. We
 expect to have the ability to replace the security agreement
 with a letter of credit or other acceptable security in favor of
 OIL. 

52

Table of Contents

Other liabilities include accrued LOE of 30.9 million,
 accrued liabilities of 11.0 million, gas balancing of
 15.9 million, oil and gas payable of 24.5 million,
 accrued compensation of 10.7 million, other G A of
 4.2 million and other liabilities for 1.9 million. 

Adequacy
 of Capital Sources and Liquidity 

Future Capital Resources. Our anticipated
 sources of liquidity in the future are as follows:

cash flow from operations in future periods;

proceeds under our bank credit facility;

proceeds from insurance policies relating to hurricane
 repairs; and

proceeds from future capital markets transactions as needed.

In 2009, we intend to tailor our operating capital program
 (exclusive of hurricane-related expenditures and acquisitions)
 within our projected operating cash flow so that our operating
 capital requirements are largely self-funding under normal
 commodity price assumptions. We anticipate using proceeds under
 our bank credit facility only for working capital needs or
 acquisitions and not generally to fund our operations. We would
 generally expect to fund future acquisitions on a case by case
 basis through a combination of bank debt and capital markets
 activities. Based on our current operating plan and assumed
 price case, our expected cash flow from operations and continued
 access to our bank credit facility allows us ample liquidity to
 conduct our operations as planned for the foreseeable future.

The timing of expenditures (especially regarding deepwater
 projects) is unpredictable. Also, our cash flows are heavily
 dependent on the oil and natural gas commodity markets, and our
 ability to hedge oil and natural gas prices. If either oil or
 natural gas commodity prices decrease from their current levels,
 our ability to finance our planned capital expenditures could be
 affected negatively. Amounts available for borrowing under our
 bank credit facility are largely dependent on our level of
 estimated proved reserves and current oil and natural gas
 prices. If either our estimated proved reserves or commodity
 prices decrease, amounts available to us to borrow under our
 bank credit facility could be reduced. If our cash flows are
 less than anticipated or amounts available for borrowing are
 reduced, we may be forced to defer planned capital expenditures.

In addition, the recent worldwide financial and credit crisis
 may adversely affect our liquidity. We may be unable to obtain
 adequate funding under our bank credit facility because our
 lending counterparties may be unwilling or unable to meet their
 funding obligations, or because our borrowing base under the
 facility may be decreased as the result of a redetermination,
 reducing it due to lower oil or natural gas prices, operating
 difficulties, declines in reserves or other reasons. If funding
 is not available as needed, or is available only on unfavorable
 terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due
 or we may be unable to implement our business strategies or
 otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to
 competitive pressures.

Off-Balance
 Sheet Arrangements 

Mariner s bank credit facility has a letter of credit
 subfacility of up to 50.0 million that is included as a
 use of the borrowing base. As of December 31, 2008, five
 such letters of credit totaling 7.2 million were
 outstanding.

Fair
 Value Measurement 

We determine fair value for our natural gas and crude oil
 costless collars using fair value measurements based on the
 Black-Scholes valuation model, adjusted for credit risk. The
 credit risk adjustment for collar liabilities is based on our
 credit quality and the credit risk adjustment for collar assets
 is based on the credit quality of our counterparty. Such
 valuations have historically approximated our exit price for
 such derivatives. We validate the fair value measurements of our
 collars using a Black-Scholes pricing model using observable
 market data, to the extent available, and unobservable or
 adjusted data, if observable data is not available or is not
 representative of fair value. As of December 31, 2008, our
 internal calculations of fair value were determined using market
 data.

53

Table of Contents 

We determine the fair value of our natural gas and crude oil
 fixed price swaps by reference to forward pricing curves for
 natural gas and oil futures contracts. The difference between
 the forward price curve and the contractual fixed price is
 discounted to the measurement date using a credit-risk adjusted
 discount rate. The credit risk adjustment for swap liabilities
 is based on our credit quality and the credit risk adjustment
 for swap assets is based on the credit quality of our
 counterparty. Our fair value determinations of our swaps have
 historically approximated our exit price for such derivatives.

Due to unavailability of observable volatility data input or use
 of adjusted implied volatility for our collars, we have
 determined that fair value measurements of all of our collars
 are categorized as level 3 in accordance with
 SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements 
 SFAS 157 (see Note 9, Fair Value
 Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
 Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on
 Form 10-K). As of December 31, 2008 we had no collars
 outstanding. We have determined that the fair value methodology
 described above for our swaps is consistent with observable
 market inputs and have categorized our swaps as level 2 in
 accordance with SFAS 157.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, we
 recorded an asset for the increase in the fair value of our
 derivative financial instruments of 154.2 million,
 principally due to the decrease in natural gas and oil commodity
 prices below our swap prices and floor prices in our collars.
 The increase was comprised of an increase in accumulated other
 comprehensive income of approximately 165.7 million, net
 of income taxes of 91.3 million, approximately
 98.8 million of unfavorable cash hedging settlements
 during the period reflected in natural gas and oil revenues, and
 an unrealized non-cash loss due to hedging ineffectiveness under
 SFAS 133 of approximately 2.0 million reflected in
 natural gas revenues.

We expect the continued volatility of natural gas and oil
 commodity prices to have a material impact on the fair value of
 our derivatives positions. It is our intent to hold all of our
 derivatives positions to maturity such that realized gains or
 losses are generally recognized in income when the hedged
 natural gas or oil is produced and sold. While the derivatives
 settlements may decrease (or increase) our effective price
 realized, the ultimate settlement of our derivatives positions
 is not expected to materially adversely affect our liquidity,
 results of operations or cash flows.

Critical
 Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our discussion and analysis of Mariner s financial
 condition and results of operations are based upon Consolidated
 Financial Statements that have been prepared in accordance with
 GAAP. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements
 requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
 reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
 Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1
 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. See
 Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting
 Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
 Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on
 Form 10-K. 
 We analyze our estimates, including those related to oil and gas
 revenues; oil and gas properties; fair value of derivative
 instruments; goodwill; abandonment liabilities; income taxes;
 commitments and contingencies; depreciation, depletion and
 amortization; share-based compensation; and full-cost ceiling
 calculation. Our estimates are based on historical experience
 and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
 the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
 estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe
 the following critical accounting policies affect our more
 significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of
 our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Oil
 and Gas Properties 

Our oil and gas properties are accounted for using the full-cost
 method of accounting. All direct costs and certain indirect
 costs associated with the acquisition, exploration and
 development of oil and gas properties are capitalized, including
 certain G A costs. G A costs associated with
 production, operations, marketing and general corporate
 activities are expensed as incurred. The capitalized costs,
 coupled with our estimated asset retirement obligations recorded
 in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
 SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset
 Retirement Obligations SFAS 143 ), are
 included in the amortization base and amortized to expense using
 the unit-of-production method. Amortization is calculated based
 on estimated proved oil and gas reserves. Proceeds from the sale
 or disposition of oil and gas properties are applied to

54

Table of Contents 

reduce net capitalized costs unless the sale or disposition
 causes a significant change in the relationship between costs
 and the estimated value of proved reserves.

Capitalized costs (net of accumulated depreciation, depletion
 and amortization and deferred income taxes) of proved oil and
 gas properties are subject to a ceiling. The ceiling limits
 these costs to an amount equal to the present value, discounted
 at 10 , of estimated future net cash flows from estimated proved
 reserves less estimated future operating and development costs,
 abandonment costs (net of salvage value) and estimated related
 future income taxes. The full-cost ceiling limitation is
 calculated using natural gas and oil prices in effect as of the
 balance sheet date and is adjusted for basis or
 location differentials. Price is held constant over the life of
 the reserves.

We use derivative financial instruments that qualify for cash
 flow hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133,
 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
 Activities, SFAS 133 to hedge against
 the volatility of natural gas prices. In accordance with
 Securities and Exchange Commission SEC guidelines,
 we include estimated future cash flows from our hedging program
 in our ceiling test calculation. If net capitalized costs
 related to proved properties exceed the ceiling limit, the
 excess is impaired and recorded in the Consolidated Statements
 of Operations.

At December 31, 2008, the net capitalized cost of proved
 oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling limit due to a
 decline in oil and gas commodity prices during the fourth
 quarter 2008 and the Company recorded a non-cash ceiling test
 impairment of 575.6 million during the fourth quarter. The
 writedown would have been 695.6 million if we had not used
 hedge adjusted prices for the volumes that were subject to
 hedges. The ceiling limit of our proved reserves was calculated
 based upon quoted market prices of 5.71 per Mcfe for gas and
 44.61 per barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials for
 the year ended December 31, 2008. If commodity prices
 continue to deteriorate during the first quarter of 2009, we may
 be required to record a ceiling test impairment which could be
 material to our financial position and results of operations.

Estimated
 Proved Reserves 

Our most significant financial estimates are based on estimates
 of proved oil and natural gas reserves. Estimates of proved
 reserves are key components in determining our rate for
 recording depreciation, depletion and amortization and our
 full-cost ceiling limitation. There are numerous uncertainties
 inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in
 projecting future revenues, rates of production and timing of
 development expenditures, including many factors beyond our
 control. The estimation process relies on assumptions and
 interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering
 and production data. The accuracy of reserve estimates is a
 function of the quality and quantity of available data. Our
 reserves are fully engineered on an annual basis by Ryder Scott
 Company, L.P.

Unproved
 Properties 

The costs associated with unevaluated properties and properties
 under development are not initially included in the full-cost
 amortization base. These costs relate to unproved leasehold
 acreage and include costs for seismic data, wells and production
 facilities in progress and wells pending determination. Interest
 is capitalized on the costs in unproved properties while in the
 development stage. Unevaluated leasehold costs are transferred
 to the amortization base once determination has been made or
 upon expiration of a lease. Geological and geophysical costs,
 including
 3-D seismic
 data costs, are included in the full-cost amortization base as
 incurred when such costs cannot be associated with specific
 unevaluated properties for which we own a direct interest.
 Seismic data costs are associated with specific unevaluated
 properties if the seismic data is acquired for the purpose of
 evaluating acreage or trends covered by a leasehold interest
 owned by us. We make this determination based on an analysis of
 leasehold and seismic maps and discussions with our Chief
 Exploration Officer. Geological and geophysical costs included
 in unproved properties are transferred to the full-cost
 amortization base along with the associated leasehold costs on a
 specific project basis. Costs associated with wells in progress
 and wells pending determination are transferred to the
 amortization base once a determination is made whether or not
 proved reserves can be assigned to the property. Costs of dry
 holes are transferred to the amortization base immediately upon
 determination that the well is unsuccessful. All items included
 in our unevaluated property balance are assessed on a quarterly
 basis for possible impairment or reduction in value.

55

Table of Contents 

Abandonment
 Liability 

In accordance with SFAS 143, we record the fair value of a
 liability for the legal obligation to retire an asset in the
 period in which it is incurred and capitalize the corresponding
 cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived
 asset. Upon our adoption of SFAS 143, we recorded an asset
 retirement obligation to reflect our legal obligations related
 to future plugging and abandonment of its oil and natural gas
 wells. The liability is accreted to its then present value each
 period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful
 life of the related asset. If the liability is settled for an
 amount other than the recorded amount, the difference is
 recognized in Oil and Gas Properties.

To estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, we
 employ a present value technique, which reflects certain
 assumptions, including our credit-adjusted risk-free interest
 rate, the estimated settlement date of the liability and the
 estimated current cost to settle the liability. Changes in
 timing or to the original estimate of cash flows will result in
 changes to the carrying amount of the liability.

Other
 Property 

Other property and equipment is recorded at cost and consists of
 real estate, IT equipment, office furniture and fixtures,
 leasehold improvements and gas gathering systems. Acquisitions
 and betterments are capitalized; maintenance and repairs are
 expensed as incurred. Depreciation of other property and
 equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over their
 estimated useful lives, which range from three to twenty-two
 years. Per SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
 Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
 SFAS 144 ), we assess other property for
 impairment when events indicate the carrying value exceeds fair
 value. As a result of our SFAS 144 assessment performed at
 December 31, 2008, an impairment of 15.3 million was
 recorded related to office property.

Goodwill 

We account for goodwill in accordance with
 SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible
 Assets SFAS 142 ). SFAS 142 requires
 goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and
 between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate a
 potential impairment. In a purchase transaction, goodwill
 represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated
 fair value of the assets acquired net of the fair value of
 liabilities assumed. We follow the full cost method of
 accounting and all of our oil and gas properties are located in
 the United States. For the purpose of performing an impairment
 test, we have determined that we have one reporting unit. Our
 goodwill impairment reviews consist of a two-step process. The
 first step is to determine the fair value of our reporting unit
 and compare it to the carrying value of the related net assets.
 Fair value is determined based on our estimates of market
 values. If this fair value exceeds the carrying value no further
 analysis or goodwill write-down is required. The second step is
 required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than
 the carrying value of the net assets. In this step the implied
 fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the
 underlying assets and liabilities, including both recognized and
 unrecognized tangible and intangible assets, based on their fair
 values. If necessary, goodwill is then written-down to its
 implied fair value.

We perform our goodwill test annually on November 30 and more
 often if circumstances require. Amounts recorded in goodwill
 relate to the excess purchase price paid in association with the
 Forest Merger. See Note 2. Acquisitions and
 Dispositions Forest Gulf of Mexico Operation 
 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
 Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on
 Form 10-K. 

In connection with our annual impairment test on
 November 30, 2008, we performed a step one impairment
 analysis. As a result of weakened economic conditions and a
 decline in our stock price during the fourth quarter of 2008,
 the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeded the fair value
 and a step two analysis was required to determine the
 impairment. Our fair value estimates in step two were developed
 using a weighted average cost of capital WACC of
 12.0 and a control premium of 25.0 . A 1.0 increase and
 decrease of the WACC would have changed the fair value by (3.7 and 4.0 respectively. We allocated the estimated fair value
 determined using these assumptions to the identifiable tangible
 and intangible assets and liabilities of our reporting unit
 based on their respective values. This allocation indicated no
 residual value for goodwill and we recorded approximately
 295.6 million of goodwill impairment in continuing
 operations as of December 31, 2008. We had previously
 determined that there was no impairment loss in continuing
 operations

56

Table of Contents 

as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007,
 goodwill decreased as a result of changes in the book and tax
 basis related to the Forest Merger.

Income
 Taxes 

Our provision for taxes includes both state and federal taxes.
 The Company records its federal income taxes in accordance with
 SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes 
 SFAS 109 which results in the recognition of
 deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
 consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying
 amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred
 tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
 expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
 temporary differences and carry forwards are expected to be
 recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
 liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
 the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation
 allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
 assets to the amount more likely than not to be recovered.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation
 No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
 (an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109) 
 FIN 48 ). This interpretation clarified the
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the
 financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and
 measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be
 taken in a tax return. We apply significant judgment in
 evaluating our tax positions and estimating our provision for
 income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are
 many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax
 determination is uncertain. The actual outcome of these future
 tax consequences could differ significantly from these
 estimates, which could impact our financial position, results of
 operations and cash flows. We do not have uncertain tax
 positions outstanding and, as such, did not recorded a
 FIN 48 liability for the years ended December 31, 2008
 and 2007.

Additionally, in May 2006, the State of Texas enacted
 substantial changes to its tax structure beginning in 2007 by
 implementing a new margin tax of 1 to be imposed on revenues
 less certain costs, as specified in the legislation.

Derivative
 Financial Instruments 

The Company utilizes derivative instruments in the form of
 natural gas and crude oil price swap agreements and costless
 collar arrangements in order to manage price risk associated
 with future crude oil and natural gas production and fixed-price
 crude oil and natural gas purchase and sale commitments. Such
 agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance
 with SFAS 133. Gains and losses resulting from these
 transactions, recorded at market value, are deferred and
 recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as
 appropriate, until recognized as operating income in the
 Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations as the
 physical production hedged by the contracts is delivered. The
 Company presents the fair value of its derivatives on a net
 basis in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 39
 Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts an
 interpretation of APB Opinion No. 10 and FASB Statement
 No. 105 FIN 39 ).

We are required to assess the effectiveness of all our
 derivative contracts at inception and at every quarter-end. If
 open contracts cease to qualify for hedge accounting,
 mark-to-market accounting is utilized and changes in the fair
 value of open contracts are recognized in the Consolidated
 Statements of Operations. Mark-to-market accounting may cause
 volatility in Net Income. Fair value is assessed, measured and
 estimated by obtaining forward commodity pricing, credit
 adjusted risk-free interest rates and estimated volatility
 factors. In addition, forward price curves and estimates of
 future volatility factors are used to assess and measure the
 effectiveness of our open contracts at the end of each period.
 The fair values we report in our Consolidated Financial
 Statements change as estimates are revised to reflect actual
 results, changes in market conditions or other factors, many of
 which are beyond our control.

The net cash flows related to any recognized gains or losses
 associated with these hedges are reported as oil and gas
 revenues and presented in cash flows from operations. If the
 hedge is terminated prior to expected maturity, gains or losses
 are deferred and included in income in the same period as the
 physical production hedged by the contracts is delivered.

57

Table of Contents 

The conditions to be met for a derivative instrument to qualify
 as a cash flow hedge are the following: (i) the item to be
 hedged exposes the Company to price risk; (ii) the
 derivative reduces the risk exposure and is designated as a
 hedge at the time the derivative contract is entered into; and
 (iii) at the inception of the hedge and throughout the
 hedge period there is a high correlation of changes in the
 market value of the derivative instrument and the fair value of
 the underlying item being hedged.

When the designated item associated with a derivative instrument
 matures, is sold, extinguished or terminated, derivative gains
 or losses are recognized as part of the gain or loss on sale or
 settlement of the underlying item. When a derivative instrument
 is associated with an anticipated transaction that is no longer
 expected to occur or if correlation no longer exists, the gain
 or loss on the derivative is recognized in income to the extent
 the future results have not been offset by the effects of price
 or interest rate changes on the hedged item since the inception
 of the hedge.

Revenue
 Recognition 

Oil revenues are recognized when production is sold to a
 purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, and delivery has
 occurred and title has transferred. Natural gas and NGLs
 revenues are recorded using the entitlement method. Under the
 entitlement method, revenue is recorded when title passes based
 on the Company s net interest or nominated deliveries. The
 Company records its entitled share of revenues based on entitled
 volumes and contracted sales prices. The sales price for natural
 gas, crude oil and NGLs are adjusted for revenue deductions. The
 revenue deductions are based on contractual or historical data
 and do not require significant judgment. Subsequently, these
 revenue deductions are adjusted to reflect actual charges based
 on third party documents. Historically, these adjustments have
 been insignificant. Since there is a ready market for natural
 gas, crude oil and NGLs, the Company sells the majority of its
 products soon after production at various locations at which
 time title and risk of loss pass to the buyer. As a result, the
 Company maintains a minimum amount of product inventory in
 storage.

Gas imbalances occur when Mariner sells more or less than its
 entitled ownership percentage of total gas production. Any
 amount received in excess (overproduction) of Mariner s
 share is treated as a liability. If Mariner receives less than
 it is entitled, the shortage (underproduction) is recorded as a
 receivable. Imbalances are reduced either by subsequent
 recoupment of
 over-and-under 
 deliveries or by cash settlement, as required by applicable
 contracts. Production imbalances are recorded at the lowest of
 (i) the price in effect at the time of production,
 (ii) the current market price or (iii) the contract
 price, if a contract exists. Mariner s gas imbalances are
 not material, as oil and natural gas volumes sold are not
 significantly different from its share of production

Share-Based
 Compensation Expense 

We account for share-based compensation in accordance with the
 fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),
 Share-Based Payment SFAS 123(R) ).
 Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R),
 share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
 based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense
 over the vesting period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing
 model to determine the fair value of options on the grant date,
 which requires judgment in estimating the expected life of the
 option and the expected volatility of our stock. We use a Monte
 Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of restricted stock
 granted in 2008 under our stock incentive plan s long-term
 performance-based restricted stock program.

Recent
 Accounting Pronouncements 

On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued the final rule,
 Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting 
 Final Rule ). The Final Rule adopts revisions to the
 SEC s oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and is
 effective for annual reports on
 Forms 10-K 
 for years ending on or after December 31, 2009. Early
 adoption of the Final Rule is prohibited. The revisions are
 intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and
 comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves to help
 investors evaluate their investments in oil and gas companies.
 The amendments are also designed to modernize the oil and gas
 disclosure requirements to align

58

Table of Contents 

them with current practices and changes in technology. Revised
 requirements in the SEC s Final Rule include, but are not
 limited to:

Oil and gas reserves must be reported using the average price
 over the prior 12 month period, rather than year-end prices;

Companies will be allowed to report, on an optional basis,
 probable and possible reserves;

Non-traditional reserves, such as oil and gas extracted from
 coal and shales, will be included in the definition of oil
 and gas producing activities 

Companies will be permitted to use new technologies to determine
 proved reserves, as long as those technologies have been
 demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions with
 respect to reserve volumes;

Companies will be required to disclose, in narrative form,
 additional details on their proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs),
 including the total quantity of PUDs at year end, any material
 changes to PUDs that occurred during the year, investments and
 progress made to convert PUDs to developed oil and gas reserves
 and an explanation of the reasons why material concentrations of
 PUDs in individual fields or countries have remained undeveloped
 for five years or more after disclosure as PUDs;

Companies will be required to report the qualifications and
 measures taken to assure the independence and objectivity of any
 business entity or employee primarily responsible for preparing
 or auditing the reserves estimates.

We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the Final
 Rule. The SEC is discussing the Final Rule with the FASB staff
 to align FASB accounting standards with the new SEC rules. These
 discussions may delay the required compliance date. Absent any
 change in the effective date, we will begin complying with the
 disclosure requirements in our annual report on
 Form 10-K 
 for the year ended December 31, 2009.

In October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position
 FSP No. 157-3, 
 Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
 Market for That Asset Is Not Active 
 FSP 157-3 ). 
 FSP 157-3 
 applies to financial assets within the scope of accounting
 pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements in
 accordance with SFAS No. 157, Fair Value
 Measurements SFAS 157 and clarifies the
 application of SFAS 157 in a market that is not active.
 This FSP also provides an example to illustrate key
 considerations in determining the fair value of a financial
 asset when the market for that financial asset is not active.
 This FSP was effective upon issuance, including prior periods
 for which financial statements have not been issued. Revisions
 resulting from a change in the valuation technique or its
 application are accounted for as a change in accounting estimate
 according to SFAS No. 154 Accounting Changes and
 Error Corrections . The adoption of
 FSP 157-3 
 did not have a material effect on the Company s results of
 operations, financial position or cash flows.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The
 Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
 SFAS 162 ). SFAS 162 is intended to
 improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent
 framework, or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to
 be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in
 conformity with GAAP for nongovernmental entities. The FASB
 believes that the GAAP hierarchy should be directed to entities
 because it is the entity (not its auditor) that is responsible
 for selecting accounting principles for financial statements
 that are presented in conformity with GAAP. This statement
 became effective on November 15, 2008 following the
 SEC s approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
 Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of
 Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting
 Principles. The adoption of SFAS 162 did not have a
 material effect on our results of operations, financial position
 or cash flows.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP
 No. 142-3, 
 Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
 Assets 
 FSP 142-3 ). 
 FSP 142-3 
 amends the factors that should be considered in developing
 renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
 life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement
 No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 
 FSP 142-3 
 is effective for financial statements issued after
 December 15, 2008. The adoption of
 FSP 142-3 
 did not have a material effect on our results of operations,
 financial position, or cash flows.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
 Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
 Activities an amendment of FASB Statement
 No. 133 SFAS 161 ). SFAS 161 is
 intended to improve financial reporting about derivative
 instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced
 disclosures to enable investors to better understand their
 effects on an entity s financial position, financial
 performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for
 financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods
 beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application
 encouraged. SFAS 161 also improves transparency about the
 location and amounts of derivative instruments in an
 entity s financial statements; how derivative instruments
 and related hedged items are accounted for under
 SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
 Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 SFAS 133 and how derivative instruments and
 related hedged items affect its financial position, financial
 performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 achieves these
 improvements by requiring disclosure of the fair values of
 derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular
 format. It also provides more information about an entity s
 liquidity by requiring disclosure of derivative features that
 are credit-risk related. Finally, it requires cross-referencing
 within footnotes to enable financial statement users to locate
 important information about derivative instruments. We currently
 are evaluating the effect the adoption of SFAS 161 will
 have on our results of operations, financial position and cash
 flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
 Business Combinations 
 SFAS 141(R) ), which replaces SFAS 141.
 SFAS 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how
 an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements
 the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any
 non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill
 acquired. The Statement also establishes disclosure requirements
 which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial
 effects of the business combination. SFAS 141(R) is
 effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
 2008. The adoption of SFAS 141(R) will have an impact on
 accounting for business combinations with the effect dependent
 upon acquisitions at that time.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
 Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
 Statements an amendment of Accounting Research
 Bulletin No. 51 SFAS 160 ),
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for
 ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than
 the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable
 to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a
 parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained
 non-controlling equity investments when a subsidiary is
 deconsolidated. The Statement also establishes reporting
 requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly
 identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and
 the interests of the non-controlling owners. SFAS 160 is
 effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
 2008. The adoption of SFAS 160 is not expected to have a
 material effect on our results of operations, financial position
 or cash flows.

During February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
 Liabilities SFAS 159 ). SFAS 159
 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments
 and certain other items at fair value that are not currently
 required to be measured at fair value, and thereby mitigate
 volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related
 assets and liabilities differently without having to apply
 complex hedge accounting provisions. This Statement also
 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
 facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different
 measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
 liabilities. SFAS 159 was effective for the Company as of
 January 1, 2008. SFAS 159 did not have an impact on
 the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements as the
 Company elected not to measure at fair value additional
 financial assets and liabilities not already required to be
 measured at fair value.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, which
 establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands
 disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS 157
 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather it
 eliminates inconsistencies in the guidance found in various
 prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 was effective for
 fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February
 2008, the FASB issued FSP
 No. FAS 157-2, 
 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which
 delayed the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial
 assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are
 recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
 statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). This FSP is
 effective for financial statements issued during fiscal years
 beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods
 within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this
 FSP. Accordingly, our adoption of

60

Table of Contents 

SFAS 157 was limited to financial assets and liabilities,
 which primarily affects the valuation of the Company s
 derivative contracts. The adoption of SFAS 157 with respect
 to financial assets and liabilities did not have a material
 impact on our net asset values (see Note 11 to the
 Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8
 of this Annual Report on
 Form 10-K). 
 The Company is still in the process of evaluating SFAS 157
 with respect to its effect on nonfinancial assets and
 liabilities and therefore has not yet determined the impact that
 it will have on its financial statements upon full adoption in
 2009. Nonfinancial assets and liabilities for which the Company
 has not applied the provisions of SFAS 157 include its
 asset retirement obligations and assets held for future sale
 when applicable.

Item 7A. 

Quantitative
 and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
 Risk . 

Commodity
 Prices and Related Hedging Activities 

Our major market risk exposure continues to be the prices
 applicable to our natural gas and oil production. The sales
 price of our production is primarily driven by the prevailing
 market price. Historically, prices received for our natural gas
 and oil production have been volatile and unpredictable.
 Hypothetically, if production levels were to remain at 2008
 levels, a 10 increase in commodity prices from those as of
 December 31, 2008 would increase our cash flow by
 approximately 134.9 million for the year ended
 December 31, 2009.

The energy markets have historically been very volatile, and we
 can reasonably expect that oil and gas prices will be subject to
 wide fluctuations in the future. In an effort to reduce the
 effects of the volatility of the price of oil and natural gas on
 our operations, management has adopted a policy of hedging oil
 and natural gas prices from time to time primarily through the
 use of commodity price swap agreements and costless collar
 arrangements. While the use of these hedging arrangements limits
 the downside risk of adverse price movements, it also limits
 future gains from favorable movements. In addition, forward
 price curves and estimates of future volatility are used to
 assess and measure the ineffectiveness of our open contracts at
 the end of each period. If open contracts cease to qualify for
 hedge accounting, the mark-to-market change in fair value is
 recognized in oil and natural gas revenue in the Consolidated
 Statements of Operations. Not qualifying for hedge accounting
 and cash flow hedge designation will cause volatility in Net
 Income. The fair values we report in our Consolidated Financial
 Statements change as estimates are revised to reflect actual
 results, changes in market conditions or other factors, many of
 which are beyond our control.

Hedge gains and losses are recorded by commodity type in oil and
 natural gas revenues in the Consolidated Statements of
 Operations. The effects on our oil and gas revenues from our
 hedging activities were as follows:

We have reviewed the financial strength of our counterparties
 and believe the credit risk associated with these swaps and
 costless collars to be minimal. Hedges with counterparties that
 are lenders under our bank credit facility are secured under the
 bank credit facility.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company expects to realize
 within the next 12 months approximately 121.9 million
 in net gains resulting from hedging activities that are
 currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
 These hedging gains are expected to be realized as an increase
 of 47.2 million to oil revenues and an increase of
 74.7 million to natural gas revenues. On January 29,
 2008, the Company liquidated crude oil fixed price swaps in
 respect of 977 thousand barrels in exchange for a cash payment
 of 10.1 million and installment payments of
 13.5 million to be received monthly throughout 2009.

Interest
 Rates 

Borrowings under our bank credit facility mature on
 January 31, 2012 and bear interest at either a LIBOR-based
 rate or a prime-based rate, at our option, plus a specified
 margin. Both options expose us to risk of earnings loss due to
 changes in market rates. We have not entered into interest rate
 hedges that would mitigate such risk. During 2008, the interest
 rate on our outstanding bank debt was 3.31 . If the balance of
 our bank debt at December 31, 2008 were to remain constant,
 a 10 increase in market interest rates would decrease our cash
 flow by approximately 1.9 million for the year ended
 December 31, 2008.

MANAGEMENT S
 REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Management, including Mariner s chief executive officer and
 chief financial officer, is responsible for establishing and
 maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 for Mariner. Mariner s internal control system was designed
 to provide reasonable assurance to Mariner s management and
 directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of
 published financial statements. Because of its inherent
 limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
 prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
 evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
 risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
 conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or
 procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
 internal control over financial reporting based on the
 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
 Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that
 Mariner s internal control over financial reporting was
 effective as of December 31, 2008. Deloitte 
 Touche LLP, Mariner s independent auditor for 2008, has
 issued an attestation report on Mariner s internal control
 over financial reporting that is included in the accompanying
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.

REPORT OF
 INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Mariner Energy, Inc.

Houston, Texas

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
 Mariner Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related
 consolidated statements of operations, stockholders 
 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
 ended December 31, 2008. We also have audited the
 Company s internal control over financial reporting as of
 December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in
 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
 Commission. The Company s management is responsible for
 these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
 control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
 effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
 included in the accompanying Management s Report on
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
 to express an opinion on these financial statements and an
 opinion on the Company s internal control over financial
 reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
 Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
 standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
 reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
 free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
 control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
 respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
 examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
 disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
 accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
 management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
 presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
 reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
 control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
 material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
 and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
 assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
 procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
 believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
 opinions.

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a
 process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
 company s principal executive and principal financial
 officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
 by the company s board of directors, management, and other
 personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
 reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
 financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles. A company s
 internal control over financial reporting includes those
 policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
 of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
 reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
 company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
 are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
 statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
 principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
 are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
 management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
 unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
 company s assets that could have a material effect on the
 financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
 financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
 improper management override of controls, material misstatements
 due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
 timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
 effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
 to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
 become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
 degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
 deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
 to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
 position of Mariner Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
 December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their
 operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
 the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
 America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
 material respects, effective internal control over financial
 reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria
 established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
 Treadway Commission.

NOTES TO
 THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

For
 the Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 

Note 1. 

Summary
 of Significant Accounting Policies 

Mariner Energy, Inc. Mariner or the
 Company is an independent oil and gas exploration,
 development and production company with principal operations in
 the Permian Basin and in the Gulf of Mexico, both shelf and
 deepwater. Unless otherwise indicated, references to
 Mariner , the Company , we ,
 our , ours and us refer to
 Mariner Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively.

Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated
 Financial Statements include our accounts and those of our
 subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions are eliminated upon
 consolidation.

Reclassifications and Use of Estimates in the Preparation of
 Financial Statements Certain prior period
 amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year
 presentation. Amounts for litigation expense were presented as
 Other miscellaneous expense in the Company s
 Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended
 December 31, 2007 and 2006. These amounts are presented
 herein as General and administrative expense for
 comparability to 2008 presentation. Stock compensation expense
 attributable to those non-officer employees directly engaged in
 exploration, development and acquisition activities is
 capitalized. Other reclassifications are insignificant in
 nature. These reclassifications had no effect on total operating
 income or net income.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
 generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
 America GAAP requires management to make estimates
 and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
 liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
 at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount
 of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
 results could differ from these estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents All short-term,
 highly liquid investments that have an original maturity date of
 three months or less are considered cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash In connection with the sale
 of the Company s interest in Cottonwood at
 December 31, 2006, see Note 2. Acquisitions and
 Dispositions , net cash proceeds were deposited in escrow
 with qualified intermediaries for potential reinvestment in
 like-kind exchange transactions under Section 1031 of the
 Internal Revenue Code. The proceeds were designated for the
 potential future acquisition of natural gas and oil assets and
 were invested in interest-bearing accounts with creditworthy
 financial institutions. The reporting requirements of
 Section 1031 required the Company to identify replacement
 property within 45 days. The Company did not identify
 replacement property within the required time period and
 received proceeds and interest of 32.0 million on
 January 19, 2007.

Receivables Substantially all of the
 Company s receivables arise from sales of oil or natural
 gas, or from reimbursable expenses billed to the other
 participants in oil and gas wells for which the Company serves
 as operator. We routinely assess the recoverability of all
 material trade and other receivables to determine their
 collectability. We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based
 on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable
 will not be collected and the amount of the reserve may be
 reasonably estimated.

Insurance receivables The balance at
 December 31, 2008 is repair and capital-related costs
 incurred to bring productive properties back to operating
 condition after sustaining significant damage from Hurricanes
 Katrina and Rita in 2005 and Hurricane Ike in 2008. Mariner
 believes its insurance receivable is collectable under the
 Company s insurance policies. Any differences between its
 insurance recoveries and insurance receivables will be recorded
 as an adjustment to oil and gas properties.

Oil and Gas Properties The Company s oil
 and gas properties are accounted for using the full-cost method
 of accounting. All direct costs and certain indirect costs
 associated with the acquisition, exploration and development of
 oil and gas properties are capitalized, including eligible
 general and administrative costs G A ).
 G A costs associated with production, operations, marketing
 and general corporate activities are expensed as incurred. These
 capitalized costs, coupled with its estimated asset retirement
 obligations recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial
 Accounting Standards SFAS No. 143,
 Accounting for Asset

NOTES TO
 THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
 STATEMENTS (Continued) 

For the
 Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 

Retirement Obligations SFAS 143 ), are
 included in the amortization base and amortized to expense using
 the unit-of-production method. Amortization is calculated based
 on estimated proved oil and gas reserves. Proceeds from the sale
 or disposition of oil and gas properties are applied to reduce
 net capitalized costs unless the sale or disposition causes a
 significant change in the relationship between costs and the
 estimated value of proved reserves.

Capitalized costs (net of accumulated depreciation, depletion
 and amortization and deferred income taxes) of proved oil and
 gas properties are subject to a full-cost ceiling limitation.
 The ceiling limits these costs to an amount equal to the present
 value, discounted at 10 , of estimated future net cash flows
 from estimated proved reserves less estimated future operating
 and development costs, abandonment costs (net of salvage value)
 and estimated related future income taxes. The full-cost ceiling
 limitation is calculated using natural gas and oil prices in
 effect as of the balance sheet date and is adjusted for
 basis or location differentials. Price is held
 constant over the life of the reserves. The Company uses
 derivative financial instruments that qualify for cash flow
 hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, Accounting
 for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, 
 SFAS 133 to hedge against the volatility of
 natural gas prices. In accordance with Securities and Exchange
 Commission SEC guidelines, Mariner includes
 estimated future cash flows from its hedging program in the
 ceiling test calculation. If net capitalized costs related to
 proved properties exceed the ceiling limit, the excess is
 impaired and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of
 Operations.

At December 31, 2008, the net capitalized cost of proved
 oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling limit and the
 Company recorded a non-cash ceiling test impairment of
 575.6 million during the fourth quarter. The writedown
 would have been 695.6 million if we had not used hedge
 adjusted prices for the volumes that were subject to hedges. The
 ceiling limit of its proved reserves was calculated based upon
 quoted market prices of 5.71 per Mcfe for gas and 44.61 per
 barrel for oil, adjusted for market differentials for the year
 ended December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2007 and
 2006, respectively, the ceiling limit exceeded the net
 capitalized costs of our proved oil and gas properties and no
 impairment was recorded.

Unproved Properties The costs associated with
 unevaluated properties and properties under development are not
 initially included in the full-cost amortization base. These
 costs relate to unproved leasehold acreage and include costs for
 seismic data, wells and production facilities in progress and
 wells pending determination. Interest is capitalized on the
 costs in unproved properties while in the development stage.
 Unevaluated leasehold costs are transferred to the amortization
 base once determination has been made or upon expiration of a
 lease. Geological and geophysical costs, including
 3-D seismic
 data costs, are included in the full-cost amortization base as
 incurred when such costs cannot be associated with specific
 unevaluated properties for which the Company owns a direct
 interest. Seismic data costs are associated with specific
 unevaluated properties if the seismic data is acquired for the
 purpose of evaluating acreage or trends covered by a leasehold
 interest owned by us. Mariner makes this determination based on
 an analysis of leasehold and seismic maps and discussions with
 its Chief Exploration Officer. Geological and geophysical costs
 included in unproved properties are transferred to the full-cost
 amortization base along with the associated leasehold costs on a
 specific project basis. Costs associated with wells in progress
 and wells pending determination are transferred to the
 amortization base once a determination is made whether or not
 proved reserves can be assigned to the property. Costs of dry
 holes are transferred to the amortization base immediately upon
 determination that the well is unsuccessful. Each property
 included in our unevaluated property balance is assessed on a
 quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value.

Abandonment Liability In accordance with
 SFAS 143, the Company records the fair value of a liability
 for the legal obligation to retire an asset in the period in
 which it is incurred with the corresponding cost capitalized by
 increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.
 Upon adoption of SFAS 143, the Company recorded an asset
 retirement obligation to reflect the Company s legal
 obligations related to future plugging and abandonment of its
 oil and natural gas wells. The liability is accreted to its then
 present value

each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the
 useful life of the related asset. If the liability is settled
 for an amount other than the recorded amount, the difference is
 recognized in Oil and Gas Properties.

To estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation, we
 employ a present value technique, which reflects certain
 assumptions, including our credit-adjusted risk-free interest
 rate, the estimated settlement date of the liability and the
 estimated current cost to settle the liability. Changes in
 timing or to the original estimate of cash flows will result in
 changes to the carrying amount of the liability.

 the beginning and ending aggregate carrying amounts of the asset
 retirement obligation.

Includes 82.4 million and 31.0 million classified as
 a current accrued liability at December 31, 2008 and 2007. 

Estimated Proved Reserves The Company s
 most significant financial estimates are based on estimates of
 proved oil and natural gas reserves. Estimates of proved
 reserves are key components in determining the rate for
 recording depreciation, depletion and amortization and our
 full-cost ceiling limitation. There are numerous uncertainties
 inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in
 projecting future revenues, rates of production and timing of
 development expenditures, including many factors beyond the
 Company s control. The estimation process relies on
 assumptions and interpretations of available geologic,
 geophysical, engineering and production data. The accuracy of
 reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of
 available data.

Other Property and Equipment Other property
 and equipment is recorded at cost and consists of real estate,
 IT equipment, office furniture and fixtures, leasehold
 improvements and gas gathering systems. Acquisitions and
 betterments are capitalized; maintenance and repairs are
 expensed as incurred. Depreciation of other property and
 equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over their
 estimated useful lives, which range from three to twenty-two
 years. Per SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
 Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
 SFAS 144 ), the Company assesses other
 property for impairment when events indicate the carrying value
 exceeds fair value. As a result of the Company s
 SFAS 144 assessment performed at December 31, 2008, an
 impairment of 15.3 million was recorded related to real
 estate property.

Derivative Financial Instruments The Company
 utilizes derivative instruments in the form of natural gas and
 crude oil price swap agreements and costless collar arrangements
 in order to manage price risk associated with future crude oil
 and natural gas production and fixed-price crude oil and natural
 gas purchase and sale commitments. Such agreements are accounted
 for as cash flow hedges in accordance with SFAS 133. Gains
 and losses resulting from these transactions, recorded at market
 value, are deferred and recorded in Accumulated Other
 Comprehensive Income as appropriate, until recognized as
 operating income in the Company s Consolidated Statements
 of Operations as the physical production hedged by the contracts
 is delivered. The Company presents the fair value of its
 derivatives on a net basis in accordance with Financial
 Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation
 No. 39 Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain
 Contracts an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 10 and FASB
 Statement No. 105 FIN 39 ).

Mariner is required to assess the effectiveness of all our
 derivative contracts at inception and at every quarter-end. If
 open contracts cease to qualify for hedge accounting,
 mark-to-market accounting is utilized and changes in the fair
 value of open contracts are recognized in the Consolidated
 Statements of Operations. Mark-to-market accounting may cause
 volatility in Net Income. Fair value is assessed, measured and
 estimated by obtaining forward commodity pricing, credit
 adjusted risk-free interest rates and estimated volatility
 factors. In addition, forward price curves and estimates of
 future volatility factors are used to assess and measure the
 effectiveness of our open contracts at the end of each period.
 The fair values we report in our Consolidated Financial
 Statements change as estimates are revised to reflect actual
 results, changes in market conditions or other factors, many of
 which are beyond its control.

The net cash flows related to any recognized gains or losses
 associated with these hedges are reported as oil and gas
 revenues and presented in cash flows from operations. If the
 hedge is terminated prior to expected maturity, gains or losses
 are deferred and included in income in the same period as the
 physical production hedged by the contracts is delivered.

The conditions to be met for a derivative instrument to qualify
 as a cash flow hedge are the following: (i) the item to be
 hedged exposes the Company to price risk; (ii) the
 derivative reduces the risk exposure and is designated as a
 hedge at the time the derivative contract is entered into; and
 (iii) at the inception of the

hedge and throughout the hedge period there is a high
 correlation of changes in the market value of the derivative
 instrument and the fair value of the underlying item being
 hedged.

When the designated item associated with a derivative instrument
 matures, is sold, extinguished or terminated, derivative gains
 or losses are recognized as part of the gain or loss on sale or
 settlement of the underlying item. When a derivative instrument
 is associated with an anticipated transaction that is no longer
 expected to occur or if correlation no longer exists, the gain
 or loss on the derivative is recognized in income.

Goodwill The Company accounts for goodwill in
 accordance with SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other
 Intangible Assets SFAS 142 ).
 SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on
 an annual basis and between annual tests when events or
 circumstances indicate a potential impairment. In a purchase
 transaction, goodwill represents the excess of the purchase
 price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired net
 of the fair value of liabilities assumed. Amounts recorded in
 goodwill relate to the excess purchase price paid in association
 with the acquisition of Forest Energy Resources, Inc. See
 Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions 
 Forest Gulf of Mexico Operations . Mariner follows the
 full cost method of accounting and all of its oil and gas
 properties are located in the United States. For the purpose of
 performing an impairment test, the Company has determined that
 it has one reporting unit. The goodwill impairment reviews
 consist of a two-step process. The first step is to determine
 the fair value of the Company s assets and compare it to
 the carrying value of the related net assets. Fair value is
 determined based on estimates of market values. If this fair
 value exceeds the carrying value no further analysis or goodwill
 write-down is required. Step two is required if the fair value
 of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net
 assets. In this step the implied fair value of the reporting
 unit is allocated to all the underlying assets and liabilities,
 including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and
 intangible assets, based on their fair values. If necessary,
 goodwill is then written-down to its implied fair value.

The Company performs its goodwill test annually on November 30
 and more often if circumstances require. In connection with its
 annual impairment test on November 30, 2008, Mariner
 performed a step one impairment analysis. As a result of
 weakened economic conditions and a decline in its stock price
 during the fourth quarter of 2008, the carrying value of the
 Company exceeded the fair value of its net assets and a step two
 analysis was required to determine the impairment.
 Mariner s fair value estimates in step two were developed
 using a weighted average cost of capital WACC of
 12.0 and a control premium of 25.0 . A 1.0 increase and
 decrease of the WACC would have changed the fair value by (3.7 and 4.0 respectively. The Company allocated the estimated fair
 value determined using these assumptions to the identifiable
 tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the Company
 based on their respective values. This allocation indicated no
 residual value for goodwill and the Company recorded
 approximately 295.6 million of goodwill impairment in
 continuing operations as of December 31, 2008. Mariner had
 previously determined that there was no impairment loss in
 continuing operations as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
 respectively. In 2007, goodwill decreased as a result of changes
 in the book and tax basis related to the Forest Merger.

Income Taxes Mariner s provision for
 taxes includes both state and federal taxes. The Company records
 its federal income taxes in accordance with
 SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes 
 SFAS 109 which results in the recognition of
 deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
 consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying
 amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred
 tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
 expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
 temporary differences and carry forwards are expected to be
 recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
 liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
 the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation
 allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
 assets to the amount more likely than not to be recovered.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB
 Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
 Income Taxes (an interpretation of FASB Statement
 No. 109) FIN 48 ). This
 interpretation clarified the accounting for uncertainty in
 income taxes recognized in the financial statements by
 prescribing a

recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax
 position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The
 Company applies significant judgment in evaluating its tax
 positions and estimating its provision for income taxes. During
 the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and
 calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is
 uncertain. The actual outcome of these future tax consequences
 could differ significantly from these estimates, which could
 impact our financial position, results of operations and cash
 flows.

Additionally, in May 2006, the State of Texas enacted
 substantial changes to its tax structure beginning in 2007 by
 implementing a new margin tax of 1.0 to be imposed on revenues
 less certain costs, as specified in the legislation.

Revenue Recognition Oil revenues are
 recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or
 determinable price, and delivery has occurred and title has
 transferred. Natural gas and natural gas liquids
 NGLs revenues are recorded using the entitlement
 method. Under the entitlement method, revenue is recorded when
 title passes based on the Company s net interest or
 nominated deliveries. The Company records its entitled share of
 revenues based on entitled volumes and contracted sales prices.
 The sales price for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs are adjusted
 for revenue deductions. The revenue deductions are based on
 contractual or historical data and do not require significant
 judgment. Subsequently, these revenue deductions are adjusted to
 reflect actual charges based on third party documents.
 Historically, these adjustments have been insignificant. Since
 there is a ready market for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, the
 Company sells the majority of its products soon after production
 at various locations at which time title and risk of loss pass
 to the buyer. As a result, the Company maintains a minimum
 amount of product inventory in storage.

Gas imbalances occur when Mariner sells more or less than its
 entitled ownership percentage of total gas production. Any
 amount received in excess (overproduction) of Mariner s
 share is treated as a liability. If Mariner receives less than
 it is entitled, the shortage (underproduction) is recorded as a
 receivable. Imbalances are reduced either by subsequent
 recoupment of
 over-and-under 
 deliveries or by cash settlement, as required by applicable
 contracts. Production imbalances are recorded at the lowest of
 (i) the price in effect at the time of production,
 (ii) the current market price or (iii) the contract
 price, if a contract exists. Mariner s gas imbalances are
 not material, as oil and natural gas volumes sold are not
 significantly different from its share of production.

Operating Costs The Company classifies its
 operating costs as lease operating expense, severance and ad
 valorem taxes, transportation expense and general and
 administrative expense. Lease operating expense is comprised of
 those costs and expenses necessary to produce oil and gas after
 an individual well or field has been completed and prepared for
 production. These costs include direct costs such as field
 operations, general maintenance expenses, workovers and the
 costs associated with production handling agreements for most of
 our deepwater fields. Lease operating expense also includes
 indirect costs such as oil and gas property insurance and
 overhead allocations in accordance with joint operating
 agreements.

Severance and ad valorem taxes are comprised of severance,
 production and ad valorem taxes and are generally variable costs
 based on production, except for ad valorem taxes which are based
 on revenue.

Transportation expense includes variable costs associated with
 transportation of product to sales meters from the wellhead or
 field gathering point.

General and Administrative Expense General
 and administrative expense includes employee compensation costs
 (including share-based compensation expense), the costs of third
 party consultants and professionals, rent and other costs of
 leasing and maintaining office space, the costs of maintaining
 computer hardware and software, and insurance and other items.

Capitalized G A Under the full-cost
 method of accounting, a portion of our general and
 administrative expenses that are directly attributable to our
 acquisition, exploration and development activities are
 capitalized as part of our full-cost pool. We capitalized
 general and administrative costs related to our acquisition,

For the
 Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 

exploration and development activities of approximately
 19.8 million, 14.0 million and 11.0 million
 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
 respectively. Share-based compensation expense is classified
 with general and administrative expenses, except for amounts
 attributable to non-officer employees directly engaged in
 exploration, development and acquisition activities. See
 Note 5. Stockholders Equity for further
 discussion on share-based compensation expense.

Overhead Recovery The Company receives
 reimbursement for administrative and overhead expenses incurred
 on behalf of other working interest owners on properties it
 operates. These reimbursements totaling 13.5 million,
 12.5 million and 16.7 million for the years ended
 December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were
 allocated as reductions to general and administrative expenses
 incurred. Generally, Mariner does not receive any reimbursements
 or fees in excess of the costs incurred; however, if it did, we
 would credit the excess to the full-cost pool to be recognized
 through lower cost amortization as production occurs.

Concentration of Credit Risk Mariner extends
 credit, primarily in the form of uncollateralized oil and gas
 sales and joint interest owners receivables, to various
 companies in the oil and gas industry, which results in a
 concentration of credit risk. The concentration of credit risk
 may be affected by changes in economic or other conditions
 within the industry and may accordingly impact the
 Company s overall credit risk. However, the Company
 believes that the risk of these unsecured receivables is
 mitigated by the size, reputation, and nature of the companies
 to which it extends credit.

Use of Estimates The preparation of financial
 statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
 principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
 that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
 disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
 the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
 and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates
 made by management include (1) oil and natural gas
 reserves; (2) depreciation, depletion and amortization,
 including future abandonment costs; (3) assigning fair
 value and allocating purchase price in connection with business
 combinations, including goodwill; (4) income taxes;
 (5) accrued assets and liabilities; (6) stock based
 compensation; (7) asset retirement obligations and
 (8) valuation of derivative instruments. Although
 management believes these estimates are reasonable, actual
 results could differ from these estimates.

Net Income per Share Basic earnings per share
 is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average
 number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
 Fully diluted earnings per share assumes the conversion of all
 potentially dilutive securities and is calculated by dividing
 net income by the sum of the weighted average number of shares
 of common stock outstanding plus all potentially dilutive
 securities.

Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income
 includes net income and certain items recorded directly to
 stockholder s equity and classified as other comprehensive
 income. The table below summarizes comprehensive income and

Recent
 Accounting Pronouncements 

On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued the Final Rule, which
 adopts revisions to the SEC s oil and gas reporting
 disclosure requirements and is effective for annual reports on
 Forms 10-K 
 for years ending on or after December 31, 2009. Early
 adoption of the Final Rule is prohibited. The revisions are
 intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and
 comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves to help
 investors evaluate their investments in oil and gas companies.
 The amendments are also designed to modernize the oil and gas
 disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and
 changes in technology. Revised requirements in the SEC s
 Final Rule include, but are not limited to:

Oil and gas reserves must be reported using the average price
 over the prior 12 month period, rather than year-end prices;

Companies will be allowed to report, on an optional basis,
 probable and possible reserves;

Non-traditional reserves, such as oil and gas extracted from
 coal and shales, will be included in the definition of oil
 and gas producing activities 

Companies will be permitted to use new technologies to determine
 proved reserves, as long as those technologies have been
 demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions with
 respect to reserve volumes;

Companies will be required to disclose, in narrative form,
 additional details on their proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs),
 including the total quantity of PUDs at year end, any material
 changes to PUDs that occurred during the year, investments and
 progress made to convert PUDs to developed oil and gas reserves
 and an explanation of the reasons why material concentrations of
 PUDs in individual fields or countries have remained undeveloped
 for five years or more after disclosure as PUDs;

Companies will be required to report the qualifications and
 measures taken to assure the independence and objectivity of any
 business entity or employee primarily responsible for preparing
 or auditing the reserves estimates.

The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of
 adopting the Final Rule. The SEC is discussing the Final Rule
 with the FASB staff to align FASB accounting standards with the
 new SEC rules These discussions may delay the required
 compliance date. Absent any change in the effective date,
 Mariner will begin complying with the disclosure requirements in
 its annual report on
 Form 10-K 
 for the year ended December 31, 2009.

In October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position
 FSP No. 157-3, 
 Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
 Market for That Asset Is Not Active 
 FSP 157-3 ). 
 FSP 157-3

 pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements in

For the
 Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 

accordance with SFAS No. 157, Fair Value
 Measurements SFAS 157 and clarifies the
 application of SFAS 157 in a market that is not active.
 This FSP also provides an example to illustrate key
 considerations in determining the fair value of a financial
 asset when the market for that financial asset is not active.
 This FSP was effective upon issuance, including prior periods
 for which financial statements have not been issued. Revisions
 resulting from a change in the valuation technique or its
 application are accounted for as a change in accounting estimate
 according to SFAS No. 154 Accounting Changes and
 Error Corrections . The adoption of
 FSP 157-3 
 did not have a material effect on the Company s results of
 operations, financial position or cash flows.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The
 Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
 SFAS 162 ). SFAS 162 is intended to
 improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent
 framework, or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to
 be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in
 conformity with GAAP for nongovernmental entities. The FASB
 believes that the GAAP hierarchy should be directed to entities
 because it is the entity (not its auditor) that is responsible
 for selecting accounting principles for financial statements
 that are presented in conformity with GAAP. This statement
 became effective on November 15, 2008 following the
 SEC s approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
 Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of
 Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting
 Principles. The adoption of SFAS 162 did not have a
 material effect on the Company s results of operations,
 financial position or cash flows.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP
 No. 142-3, 
 Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
 Assets 
 FSP 142-3 ). 
 FSP 142-3 
 amends the factors that should be considered in developing
 renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
 life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB Statement
 No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 
 FSP 142-3 
 is effective for financial statements issued after
 December 15, 2008. The adoption of
 FSP 142-3 
 did not have a material effect on the Company s results of
 operations, financial position or cash flows.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
 Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
 Activities an amendment of FASB Statement
 No. 133 SFAS 161 ). SFAS 161 is
 intended to improve financial reporting about derivative
 instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced
 disclosures to enable investors to better understand their
 effects on an entity s financial position, financial
 performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for
 financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods
 beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application
 encouraged. SFAS 161 also improves transparency about the
 location and amounts of derivative instruments in an
 entity s financial statements; how derivative instruments
 and related hedged items are accounted for under
 SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
 Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 SFAS 133 and how derivative instruments and
 related hedged items affect its financial position, financial
 performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 achieves these
 improvements by requiring disclosure of the fair values of
 derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular
 format. It also provides more information about an entity s
 liquidity by requiring disclosure of derivative features that
 are credit-risk related. Finally, it requires cross-referencing
 within footnotes to enable financial statement users to locate
 important information about derivative instruments. The Company
 is currently evaluating the effect the application of
 SFAS 161 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
 Business Combinations 
 SFAS 141(R) ), which replaces SFAS 141.
 SFAS 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how
 an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements
 the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any
 non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill
 acquired. The Statement also establishes disclosure requirements
 which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial
 effects of the business combination. SFAS 141(R) is
 effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
 2008. The adoption of SFAS 141(R) will have an impact on
 accounting for business combinations with the effect dependent
 upon acquisitions at that time.

For the
 Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
 Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
 Statements an amendment of Accounting Research
 Bulletin No. 51 SFAS 160 ),
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for
 ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than
 the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable
 to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a
 parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained
 non-controlling equity investments when a subsidiary is
 deconsolidated. The Statement also establishes reporting
 requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly
 identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and
 the interests of the non-controlling owners. SFAS 160 is
 effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
 2008. The adoption of SFAS 160 is not expected to have a
 material effect on the Company s results of operations,
 financial position or cash flows.

During February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
 Liabilities SFAS 159 ). SFAS 159
 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments
 and certain other items at fair value that are not currently
 required to be measured at fair value, and thereby mitigate
 volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related
 assets and liabilities differently without having to apply
 complex hedge accounting provisions. This Statement also
 establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
 facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different
 measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
 liabilities. SFAS 159 was effective for the Company as of
 January 1, 2008. SFAS 159 did not have an impact on
 the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements as the
 Company elected not to measure at fair value additional
 financial assets and liabilities not already required to be
 measured at fair value.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, which
 establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands
 disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS 157
 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather it
 eliminates inconsistencies in the guidance found in various
 prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 was effective for
 fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February
 2008, the FASB issued FSP
 No. FAS 157-2, 
 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which
 delayed the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial
 assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are
 recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
 statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). This FSP is
 effective for financial statements issued during fiscal years
 beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods
 within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this
 FSP. Accordingly, our adoption of SFAS 157 was limited to
 financial assets and liabilities, which primarily affects the
 valuation of the Company s derivative contracts. The
 adoption of SFAS 157 with respect to financial assets and
 liabilities did not have a material impact on our net asset
 values (see Note 11). The Company is still in the process
 of evaluating SFAS 157 with respect to its effect on
 nonfinancial assets and liabilities and therefore has not yet
 determined the impact that it will have on its financial
 statements upon full adoption in 2009. Nonfinancial assets and
 liabilities for which the Company has not applied the provisions
 of SFAS 157 include its asset retirement obligations and
 assets held for future sale when applicable.

Acquisitions
 and Dispositions 

Gulf of Mexico Shelf Acquisition. On
 January 31, 2008, Mariner acquired 100 of the equity in a
 subsidiary of Hydro Gulf of Mexico, Inc. pursuant to a
 Membership Interest Purchase Agreement executed on
 December 23, 2007. The acquired subsidiary, now known as
 Mariner Gulf of Mexico LLC MGOM ), was an indirect
 subsidiary of StatoilHydro ASA and owns substantially all of its
 former Gulf of Mexico shelf operations. Mariner paid
 approximately 243.0 million, subject to customary purchase
 price adjustments, including 8.0 million for reimbursement
 of drilling costs attributable to the High Island
 166 #5 well.

Pro Forma Financial Information The pro forma
 information set forth below gives effect to the acquisition of
 MGOM as if it had been consummated as of the beginning of the
 applicable period. The pro forma information has been derived
 from the historical Consolidated Financial Statements of the
 Company and the statements of revenues and direct operating
 expenses of MGOM. The pro forma information is for illustrative

Bass Lite On December 19, 2008, we
 acquired additional working interests in our existing property,
 Atwater Valley Block 426 (Bass Lite), for approximately
 32.6 million, increasing our working interest by 11.6 to
 53.8 . We internally estimated proved reserves attributable to
 the acquisition of approximately 17.6 Bcfe (100 natural
 gas).

Interest in Cottonwood On December 1,
 2006, Mariner completed the sale of its 20 interest in Garden
 Banks 244 (Cottonwood) to Petrobras America, Inc., for
 31.8 million. The sale was effective November 1,
 2006. Proceeds from the sale were deposited in trust with a
 qualified intermediary to preserve Mariner s ability to
 reinvest them in a tax-deferred, like-kind exchange transaction
 for federal income tax purposes. Inasmuch as Mariner elected not
 to identify replacement like-kind property to facilitate the
 exchange, proceeds and related interest totaling
 32.0 million were disbursed to Mariner on January 19,
 2007 and used to repay borrowings under its bank credit
 facility. No gain was recorded for book purposes on this
 disposition.

West Cameron 110/111 On August 7, 2006,
 the Company exercised its preferential right to purchase the
 interest of BP Exploration and Production Inc. BP in West Cameron Block 110 and the southeast quadrant of
 West Cameron Block 111 in the Gulf of Mexico. BP retained
 rights to depths below 15,000 feet.

The acquisition cost was 70.9 million. A
 10.4 million letter of credit under our bank credit
 facility was also issued in favor of BP to secure plugging and
 abandonment liabilities.

Forest Gulf of Mexico Operations On
 March 2, 2006, a subsidiary of the Company completed a
 merger transaction with Forest Energy Resources, Inc. (the
 Forest Merger ). Prior to the consummation of the
 Forest Merger, Forest Oil Corporation Forest transferred and contributed the assets of, and certain
 liabilities associated with, its offshore Gulf of Mexico
 operations to Forest Energy Resources, Inc. Immediately prior to
 the Forest Merger, Forest distributed all of the outstanding
 shares of Forest Energy Resources, Inc. to Forest stockholders
 on a pro rata basis. Forest Energy Resources, Inc. then merged
 with a newly formed subsidiary of Mariner, became a new wholly
 owned subsidiary of Mariner and changed its name to Mariner
 Energy Resources, Inc. MERI ). Immediately following
 the Forest Merger, approximately 59 of the Mariner common stock
 was held by stockholders of Forest and approximately 41 of
 Mariner common stock was held by the pre-merger stockholders of
 Mariner.

To acquire MERI, Mariner issued 50,637,010 shares of its
 common stock to the stockholders of Forest Energy Resources,
 Inc. The aggregate consideration was valued at
 890.0 million, comprised of 3.8 million in
 pre-merger costs and 886.2 million in common stock, based
 on the closing price of the Company s common stock of
 17.50 per share on September 12, 2005 (which was the date
 that the terms of the acquisition were announced).

The Forest Merger was accounted for using the purchase method of
 accounting under the accounting standards established in
 SFAS 141, Business Combinations and
 SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 
 As a result, the assets and liabilities acquired by Mariner in
 the Forest Merger are included in the Company s
 December 31, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company
 reflected the results of operations of the Forest Merger
 beginning March 2, 2006. The Company recorded the estimated
 fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at
 the March 2, 2006 closing date, which are summarized in the
 following table:

(In millions) 

Oil and natural gas properties

1,211.4

Abandonment liabilities

Other assets and liabilities

(24.5

Net Assets Acquired 

890.0

The Forest Merger includes a large undeveloped offshore acreage
 position, which complements the Company s large seismic
 database and a large portfolio of potential exploratory
 prospects. The initial fair value estimate of the underlying
 assets and liabilities acquired is determined by estimating the
 value of the underlying proved reserves at the transaction date
 plus or minus the fair value of other assets and liabilities,
 including inventory, unproved oil and gas properties, gas
 imbalances, debt (at face value), derivatives, and abandonment
 liabilities. The deferred tax liability recognizes the
 difference between the historical tax basis of the assets of
 Forest Energy Resources, Inc. and the acquisition cost recorded
 for book purposes. Goodwill represents the excess of the
 purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets
 acquired net of the fair value of liabilities assumed in the
 acquisition. The entire goodwill balance is non-deductible for
 tax purposes.

The purchase price allocation has been finalized. In 2006, we
 recorded a 27.1 million goodwill adjustment primarily
 related to insurance receivables and deferred taxes. In April
 2006, Mariner made a

Bank Credit Facility The Company has a
 secured revolving credit facility with a group of banks pursuant
 to an amended and restated credit agreement dated March 2,
 2006, as further amended. The credit facility matures
 January 31, 2012 and is subject to a borrowing base which
 is redetermined periodically. As of December 31, 2008,
 maximum credit availability under the facility was
 1.0 billion, including up 50.0 million in letters of
 credit, subject to a borrowing base of 850.0 million
 scheduled to be redetermined in February 2009. The
 redetermination was pending on February 28, 2009, and
 Mariner anticipates that it will occur in March 2009.

The lenders redetermine the borrowing base periodically based
 upon their evaluation of the Company s oil and gas reserves
 and other factors. Any increase in the borrowing base requires
 the consent of all lenders. The outstanding principal balance of
 loans under the credit facility may not exceed the borrowing
 base. If the

borrowing base falls below the sum of the amount borrowed and
 uncollateralized letter of credit exposure, then to the extent
 of the deficit, the Company must prepay borrowings and cash
 collateralize letter of credit exposure, pledge additional
 unencumbered collateral, repay borrowings and cash collateralize
 letters of credit on an installment basis, or effect some
 combination of these actions.

Borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest at
 either a LIBOR-based rate or a prime-based rate, at the
 Company s option, plus a specified margin. The Company must
 pay a commitment fee of 0.250 to 0.375 per year on unused
 availability under the bank credit facility. The Company has
 used borrowings under the facility to facilitate the Forest
 Merger and acquisition of MGOM, and has used and may use
 borrowings under the facility for general corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, 570.0 million and
 179.0 million, respectively, were outstanding under the
 credit facility, and the interest rate was 3.31 and 7.25 ,
 respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2008 five
 letters of credit totaling 7.2 million were outstanding,
 of which 4.2 million was required for plugging and
 abandonment obligations at certain of the Company s
 offshore fields.

The Company s payment and performance of its obligations
 under the credit facility (including any obligations under
 commodity and interest rate hedges entered into with facility
 lenders) are secured by liens upon substantially all of the
 assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, and guaranteed by
 its subsidiaries, other than MERI which is a co-borrower. The
 Company also is subject to various restrictive covenants and
 other usual and customary terms and conditions, including limits
 on additional debt, cash dividends and other restricted
 payments, liens, investments, asset dispositions, mergers and
 speculative hedging. Financial covenants under the credit
 facility require the Company to, among other things:

maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets plus the unused
 borrowing base to consolidated current liabilities of not less
 than 1.0 to 1.0; and

maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the
 credit agreement) of not more than 2.5 to 1.0.

The Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under
 the bank credit facility as of December 31, 2008.

Senior Notes On April 24, 2006, the
 Company sold and issued to eligible purchasers
 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its
 7 1 / 2 Senior
 Notes due 2013 (the
 7 1 / 2 Notes pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as
 amended. The
 7 1 / 2 Notes
 were priced to yield 7.75 to maturity. Net proceeds, after
 deducting initial purchasers discounts and commissions and
 offering expenses, were approximately 287.9 million.
 Mariner used the net proceeds of the offering to repay debt
 under the bank credit facility. On November 9, 2006, the
 Company replaced the original Notes issued in the private
 placement with new Notes with identical terms and tenor through
 an exchange offer registered under the Securities Act of 1933.

On April 30, 2007, the Company sold and issued
 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its
 8 Senior Notes due 2017 (the 8 Notes and
 together with the
 7 1 / 2 Notes,
 the Notes ). The 8 Notes were sold at par in an
 underwritten offering registered under the Securities Act of
 1933. Net offering proceeds, after deducting underwriters 
 discounts and offering expenses, were approximately
 293.4 million. The Company used the net offering proceeds
 to repay debt under its bank credit facility.

The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, rank
 senior in right of payment to any future subordinated
 indebtedness, rank equally in right of payment with each other
 and with the Company s existing and future senior unsecured
 indebtedness, and are effectively subordinated in right of
 payment to the Company s senior secured indebtedness,
 including its obligations under its bank credit facility, to the
 extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness, and to all
 existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any
 non-guarantor subsidiaries.

If the Company experiences a change of control (as defined in
 each of the indentures governing the Notes), subject to certain
 exceptions, the Company must give holders of the Notes the
 opportunity to sell to the Company their Notes, in whole or in
 part, at a purchase price equal to 101 of the principal amount,
 plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages to the
 date of purchase.

The Company and its restricted subsidiaries are subject to
 certain negative covenants under each of the indentures
 governing the Notes. The indentures limit the ability of the
 Company and each of its restricted subsidiaries to do the
 following:

make investments;

incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;

create certain liens;

For the
 Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 

Rights Plan On October 12, 2008,
 Mariner s Board of Directors adopted a rights plan pursuant
 to which it declared and paid a dividend of one right
 Right for each outstanding share of the
 Company s common stock to holders of record at the close of
 business on October 23, 2008. The rights plan is intended
 to safeguard the interests of Mariner s stockholders by
 serving as a general deterrent to potentially unfair or coercive
 takeover practices, especially those exploiting market
 instability. The Rights generally would become exercisable if an
 acquiring party accumulates 10 or more of Mariner s common
 stock and entitle holders of Rights to purchase stock of either
 Mariner or an acquiring entity at half of market value. The
 Rights are governed by a Rights Agreement, dated as of
 October 12, 2008, between Mariner and Continental Stock
 Transfer Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the
 Rights Agreement ).

Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from
 Mariner under certain circumstances a unit consisting of one
 one-thousandth of a share of its Series A Junior
 Participating Preferred Stock, par value 0.0001 per share, at a
 purchase price of 75.00 per fractional share, subject to
 adjustment. The Rights are not exercisable (and are transferable
 only with Mariner s common stock) until a
 Distribution Date occurs (or they are earlier
 redeemed or expire), which generally occurs on the 10th day
 following a public announcement that a person or group of
 affiliated or associated persons (an Acquiring
 Person has acquired beneficial ownership of 10 or more
 of Mariner s outstanding common stock or after the
 commencement or announcement of a tender offer or exchange offer
 which would result in any such person or group of persons
 acquiring such beneficial ownership. Until a Right is exercised,
 the holder thereof, as such, has no rights as a stockholder of
 the Company.

If a person becomes an Acquiring Person, holders of Rights will
 be entitled to purchase shares of Mariner s common stock
 for one-half its current market price, as defined in the Rights
 Agreement. This is referred to as a flip-in event 
 under the Rights Agreement. After any flip-in event, all Rights
 that are beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person, or by
 certain related parties, will be null and void. Mariner s
 Board of Directors has the power to decide that a particular
 tender or exchange offer for all outstanding shares of
 Mariner s common stock is fair to, and otherwise in the
 best interests of, its stockholders. If the Board makes this
 determination, the purchase of shares under the offer will not
 be a flip-in event.

If, after there is an Acquiring Person, Mariner is acquired in a
 merger or other business combination transaction or 50 or more
 of its assets, earning power or cash flow are sold or
 transferred, each holder of a Right will have the right to
 purchase shares of the acquiring company s common stock at
 a price of one-half the current market price of that stock. This
 is referred to as a flip-over event under the Rights
 Agreement. An Acquiring Person will not be entitled to exercise
 its Rights, which will have become void.

The Rights expire on October 12, 2018 unless extended or
 earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company. Mariner generally
 is entitled to redeem the Rights at .001 per Right at any time
 until the tenth day after the Rights become exercisable. At any
 time after a flip-in event and before either a person becomes
 the beneficial owner of 50 or more of Mariner s
 outstanding common stock or a flip-over event, the
 Company s Board of Directors may decide to exchange the
 Rights for shares of Mariner s common stock on a
 one-for-one 
 basis. Rights owned by an Acquiring Person, which will have
 become void, will not be exchanged.

Note 5. 

Share-Based
 Compensation 

The Company accounts for its share-based compensation in
 accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based
 Payment SFAS 123(R) ). Under
 SFAS 123(R), share-based compensation is measured at the
 grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award and
 is recognized as an expense over the requisite employee service
 period, which generally equals the vesting period of the grant.
 The Company determines share-based compensation expense for
 restricted stock and option grants equal to their fair value at
 the date of grant. The fair value then is amortized to
 share-based compensation expense over the applicable vesting
 period.

Stock Incentive Plan The Company adopted a
 Stock Incentive Plan that became effective March 11, 2005,
 was amended and restated on March 2, 2006, further amended
 on March 16, 2006, and amended and restated on
 February 6, 2007. Awards to participants under the Stock
 Incentive Plan may be made in the form of incentive stock
 options or ISOs, non-qualified stock options or restricted
 stock. The participants to whom awards are granted, the type or
 types of awards granted to a participant, the number of shares
 covered by each award, and the purchase price, conditions and
 other terms of each award are determined by the Board of
 Directors or a committee thereof. A total of
 6,500,000 shares of Mariner s common stock are subject
 to the Stock Incentive Plan. No more than 2,850,000 shares
 issuable upon exercise of options or as restricted stock can be
 issued to any individual. Unless sooner terminated, no award may
 be granted under the Stock Incentive Plan after October 12,
 2015. As of December 31, 2008, 2,530,388 shares
 remained available for future issuance to participants under the
 Stock Incentive Plan. During the year ended December 31,
 2008, 490,881 shares of restricted stock vested under the
 Stock Incentive Plan, resulting in withholding tax obligations.
 Plan participants can elect to have Mariner withhold and cancel
 shares of restricted stock to satisfy the associated tax
 withholding obligations. In such event, Mariner would be
 required to pay any tax withholding obligation in cash. As a
 result of such participant elections, the Company withheld an
 aggregate 143,842 shares in the year ended
 December 31, 2008 that otherwise would have remained
 outstanding upon vesting of the restricted stock. The shares
 withheld became treasury shares that were retired and restored
 to the status of authorized and unissued shares of common stock,
 and the Company s capital was reduced by an amount equal to
 the .0001 par value of the retired shares. Mariner paid in
 cash the associated withholding taxes of approximately
 4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Rollover Options In connection with the
 Forest Merger and during the year ended December 31, 2006,
 the Company granted options to acquire 156,626 shares of
 its common stock to certain former employees of Forest or Forest
 Energy Resources, Inc. Rollover Options ). The
 Rollover Options are evidenced by non-qualified stock option
 agreements and are not covered by the Stock Incentive Plan. As
 of December 31, 2008, Rollover Options to purchase
 32,543 shares of the Company s common stock remained
 outstanding, all of which were presently exercisable.

Equity Participation Plan The Company adopted
 an Equity Participation Plan, as amended, that provided for the
 one-time grant at the closing of its private equity placement on
 March 11, 2005 of 2,267,270 restricted shares of
 Mariner s common stock to certain of its employees. No
 further grants will be made under the Equity Participation Plan,
 although persons who received such a grant are eligible for
 future awards of restricted stock or stock options under
 Mariner s Stock Incentive Plan, as amended or restated from
 time to time, described below. The Company intended the grants
 of restricted stock under the Equity Participation Plan to serve
 as a means of incentive compensation for performance and not
 primarily as an opportunity to participate in the equity
 appreciation of its common stock. Therefore, Equity
 Participation Plan grantees did not pay any consideration for
 the common stock they received, and the Company received no
 remuneration for the stock. As a result of closing the Forest
 Merger, all shares of restricted stock granted under the Equity
 Participation Plan vested as follows: (i) the
 463,656 shares of restricted stock held by non-executive
 employees

vested on March 2, 2006, and (ii) the
 1,803,614 shares of restricted stock held by executive
 officers vested on May 31, 2006 pursuant to an agreement,
 made in exchange for a cash payment of 1,000 to each officer,
 that his or her shares of restricted stock would not vest before
 the later of March 11, 2006 or ninety days after the
 effective date of the Forest Merger. The Equity Participation
 Plan expired upon the vesting of all shares granted thereunder.
 Stock could be withheld by the Company upon vesting to satisfy
 its tax withholding obligations with respect to the vesting of
 the restricted stock. Participants in the Equity Participation
 Plan had the right to elect to have Mariner withhold and cancel
 shares of the restricted stock to satisfy our tax withholding
 obligations. In such events, Mariner would be required to pay
 any tax withholding obligation in cash. In 2006, as a result of
 such participant elections, the Company withheld an aggregate
 807,376 shares that otherwise would have remained
 outstanding upon vesting of the restricted stock, reducing the
 aggregate outstanding vested stock grants made under the Equity
 Participation Plan to 1,459,894 shares. The
 807,376 shares withheld became treasury shares that were
 retired and restored to the status of authorized and unissued
 shares of common stock, and the Company s capital was
 reduced by an amount equal to the .0001 par value of the
 retired shares. the Company paid in cash the associated
 withholding taxes of 14.0 million, of which
 3.3 million and 10.7 million were paid in the first
 and second quarter of 2006, respectively.

Restricted
 Stock Grants 

Restricted stock granted under the Stock Incentive Plan is
 issued on the grant date, but is restricted as to
 transferability. Restricted stock grants generally vest over
 periods ranging from three to four years, except for grants made
 under the Stock Incentive Plan s Long-Term
 Performance-Based Restriced Stock Program discussed below.
 Compensation cost for all awards of restricted stock under the
 Stock Incentive Plan is based on the closing market price of
 Mariner s common stock on the date of grant. Stock-based
 compensation expense is based on the awards ultimately expected
 to vest, and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.

At December 31, 2008, unrecognized compensation expense
 under the Stock Incentive Plan for the unvested portion of
 restricted stock grants was 56.1 million. These costs are
 expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
 approximately four years. As of May 31, 2006, participants
 were fully vested in restricted stock granted under the Equity
 Participation Plan and no unrecognized compensation remains.

Long-Term Performance-Based Restricted Stock
 Program In June 2008, Mariner s Board of
 Directors adopted a Long-Term Performance-Based Restricted Stock
 Program (the Program under the Stock Incentive
 Plan. Shares of restricted common stock subject to the Program
 were granted during the year ended December 31, 2008.
 Vesting of these shares is contingent, begins upon satisfaction
 of specified thresholds of 38.00 and 46.00 for the market
 price per share of Mariner s common stock, and continues in
 installments over five to seven years thereafter, assuming, in
 most instances, continued employment by Mariner. The fair value
 of restricted stock grants made under the Program is estimated
 using a Monte Carlo simulation. Stock-based compensation expense
 related to these restricted stock grants totaled
 6.4 million for the 12 months ended December 31,
 2008.

Weighted average fair values and valuation assumptions used to
 value the Long-Term Performance Based Restricted Stock grants
 for the year ended December 31, 2008 are as follows:

Expected volatility is calculated based on the average
 historical stock price volatility of Mariner and a peer group as
 of December 31, 2008. The peer group consisted of the
 following seven independent oil and gas exploration and
 production companies: ATP Oil Gas Corporation,
 Callon Petroleum Co., Energy Partners, Ltd., McMoRan Exploration
 Co., Plains Exploration Production Company, Stone
 Energy Corporation, and W T Offshore, Inc. The risk-free
 interest rate is determined at the grant date and is based on
 10-year, 
 zero-coupon government bonds with maturity equal to the
 contractual term of the awards, converted to a continuously
 compounded rate. The expected life is based upon the contractual
 terms of the restricted stock grants under the Program.

 Company received 0.7 million, 0.8 million and
 0.7 million, respectively, upon the exercise of such
 options and a windfall tax deduction of approximately
 0.3 million, 0.4 million and approximately 63,000
 in excess of previously recorded tax benefits, based on the
 option value at the time of grant. The windfalls are reflected
 in net operating tax carry forwards pursuant to
 SFAS 123(R), but the additional tax benefit associated with
 the windfall is not recognized until the deduction reduces taxes
 payable.

Employee
 Benefit and Royalty Plans 

Employee Capital Accumulation Plan The
 Company provides all full-time employees (who are at least
 18 years of age) participation in the Employee Capital
 Accumulation Plan (the Plan ), which is comprised of
 a contributory 401(k) savings plan and a discretionary profit
 sharing plan. Under the 401(k) feature, the Company, at its sole
 discretion, may contribute an employer-matching contribution
 equal to a percentage not to exceed 50 of each eligible
 participant s matched salary reduction contribution as
 defined by the Plan. Under the discretionary profit sharing
 contribution feature of the Plan, the Company s
 contribution, if any, must be determined annually and be 4 of
 the lesser of the Company s operating income or total
 employee compensation and be allocated to each eligible
 participant pro rata to his or her compensation. The Company
 contributed 1.1 million, 0.9 million and
 0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
 2007 and 2006, respectively. Currently there are no plans to
 terminate the Plan.

Overriding Royalty Interests Pursuant to
 agreements, certain employees and consultants of the Company are
 entitled to receive, as incentive compensation, overriding
 royalty interests Overriding Royalty Interests in
 certain oil and gas prospects acquired by the Company. Such
 Overriding Royalty Interests entitle the holder to receive a
 specified percentage of the gross proceeds from the future sale
 of oil and gas (less production taxes), if any, applicable to
 the prospects. Cash payments made by the Company to current
 employees and consultants with respect to Overriding Royalty
 Interests were 3.6 million, 5.8 million and
 2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Note 7. 

Derivative
 Financial Instruments 

Derivative Financial Instruments The energy
 markets have historically been very volatile, and we expect that
 oil and gas prices will be subject to wide fluctuations in the
 future. In an effort to reduce the effects of the volatility of
 the price of oil and natural gas on the Company s
 operations, management has elected to hedge oil and natural gas
 prices from time to time through the use of commodity price swap
 agreements and costless collars. While the use of these hedging
 arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price
 movements, it also limits future gains from favorable movements.
 In addition, forward price curves and estimates of future
 volatility are used to assess and measure the ineffectiveness of
 our open contracts at the end of each period. If open contracts
 cease to qualify for hedge accounting, the mark to market change
 in fair value is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of
 Operations. Loss of hedge accounting and cash flow designation
 will cause volatility in earnings. The fair values we report in
 our Consolidated Financial Statements change as estimates are
 revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions
 or other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

The Company has reviewed the financial strength of its
 counterparties and believes the credit risk associated with
 these swaps and costless collars is minimal. Hedges with
 counterparties that are lenders under the Company s bank
 credit facility are secured under the bank credit facility.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company expected to realize
 within the next 12 months approximately 121.9 million
 in net gains resulting from hedging activities that are recorded
 in accumulated other comprehensive income. These hedging gains
 were expected to be realized as an increase of
 47.2 million to oil revenues and an increase of
 74.7 million to natural gas revenues. On January 29,
 2008, the Company liquidated crude oil fixed price swaps in
 respect of 977 thousand barrels in exchange for a cash payment
 of 10.1 million and installment payments of
 13.5 million to be received monthly throughout 2009.

 contracts are 2.3 million and 0.7 million in 2009
 and 2010 respectively. At December 31, 2008, the Company
 also has a long-term commitment for contracted drilling services
 of 183.9 million, of which 124.5 million and
 59.4 million is due in 2009 and 2010, respectively.

Current
 Insurance Against Hurricanes 

Mariner is a member of OIL Insurance, Ltd. OIL ), an
 energy industry insurance cooperative, which provides the
 Company s primary layer of physical damage and windstorm
 insurance coverage. Mariner s coverage is subject to a
 10.0 million per-occurrence deductible for our assets and
 a 250.0 million per-occurrence loss limit. However, if a
 single event causes losses to all OIL-insured assets in excess
 of 750.0 million, amounts covered for such losses will be
 reduced on a pro-rata basis among OIL members.

In addition to Mariner s primary coverage through OIL, it
 also maintains commercial difference in conditions 
 insurance that would apply (with no additional deductible) once
 its limits with OIL are exhausted,

as well as partial business interruption insurance covering
 certain of its significant producing fields as well as certain
 other fields situated in hurricane prone areas. Mariner s
 business interruption coverage begins to provide benefits after
 a 60-day 
 waiting period once the designated field is shut-in due to a
 covered event and is limited to 35 of the forecast cash flow
 from each designated property. Mariner s commercial policy
 expires annually on June 1, and is subject to a general
 limit of 100.0 million per occurrence and in the case of
 named windstorms, a combined annual aggregate limit of
 100.0 million covering both property damage and business
 interruption.

The Company accrued approximately 36.0 million as of
 December 31, 2008, for an OIL premium contingency. As part
 of its OIL membership, the Company is obligated to pay a
 withdrawal premium if it elects to withdraw from OIL. Mariner
 does not anticipate withdrawing from OIL; however, due to the
 contingency, OIL calculates a potential withdrawal premium
 annually based on past losses and Mariner accrues a liability
 for the potential premium. OIL requires smaller members to
 provide a letter of credit or other acceptable security in favor
 of OIL to secure payment of the withdrawal premium. Acceptable
 security has included a letter of credit or a security agreement
 pursuant to which a member grants OIL a security interest in
 certain claim proceeds payable by OIL to the member. Mariner
 anticipates that it will enter into such a security agreement,
 granting to OIL a security interest in a portion of
 Mariner s Hurricane Ike claim proceeds payable by OIL.
 Mariner would have the ability to replace the security agreement
 with a letter of credit or other acceptable security in favor of
 OIL.

Hurricane
 Ike (2008) 

In 2008, the Company s operations were adversely affected
 by Hurricane Ike. The hurricane resulted in shut-in and delayed
 production as well as facility repairs and replacement expenses.
 The Company is evaluating the nature and extent of damage
 resulting from the hurricane. With respect to Hurricane Ike,
 Mariner s OIL coverage has a 10.0 million per
 occurrence deductible and a 250.0 million per occurrence
 limit, subject to an industry-wide loss limit of
 750.0 million per occurrence. To the extent that aggregate
 claims exceed the OIL industry-wide loss limit per-occurrence,
 Mariner expects its insurance recovery would be reduced pro-rata
 with all other competing claims from Hurricane Ike and the
 shortfall covered by its excess insurance, subject to policy
 limits. Due to the magnitude of Hurricane Ike and the complexity
 of the insurance claims being processed by the insurance
 industry, the timing of the Company s ultimate insurance
 recovery cannot be ascertained. Mariner expects to maintain a
 potentially significant insurance receivable through 2010 while
 it actively pursues settlement of its Hurricane Ike claims to
 minimize the impact to its working capital and liquidity.

Hurricanes
 Katrina and Rita (2005) 

In 2005, the Company s operations were adversely affected
 by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, resulting in substantial shut-in
 and delayed production, as well as necessitating extensive
 facility repairs and hurricane-related abandonment operations.
 Since 2005, the Company has incurred approximately
 182.2 million in hurricane expenditures resulting from
 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, of which 127.7 million were
 capitalized expenditures and 54.5 million were
 hurricane-related abandonment costs.

Applicable insurance for the Company s Hurricane Katrina
 and Rita claims with respect to the Gulf of Mexico assets
 previously acquired from Forest is provided by OIL.
 Mariner s coverage for the former Forest properties is
 subject to a deductible of 5.0 million per occurrence and
 a 1.0 billion industry-wide loss limit per occurrence. OIL
 has advised the Company that the aggregate claims resulting from
 each of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita are expected to exceed the
 1.0 billion per occurrence loss limit and that therefore,
 Mariner s insurance recovery is expected to be reduced
 pro-rata with all other competing claims from the storms. During
 2008, the Company settled its Katrina and Rita claims with its
 excess insurance providers for a one-time payment of
 48.5 million. The insurance coverage for Mariner s
 legacy properties is subject to a 3.75 million deductible.

For the
 Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had recovered
 14.6 million from OIL and 48.5 million from its
 conventional carriers in respect of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita,
 and the insurance receivable balance for the Company s
 claims for those hurricanes was approximately
 25.2 million, of which 18.2 million is classified as
 a Long-term asset. Due to the magnitude of the storms and the
 complexity of the insurance claims being processed by the
 insurance industry, the timing of the Company s ultimate
 insurance recovery cannot be assured. However, Mariner expects
 to recover substantially all of its outstanding OIL claims in
 respect of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita by 2010. Any differences
 between insurance recoveries and insurance receivables will be
 recorded as adjustments to oil and natural gas properties.

MMS Proceedings Mariner and its subsidiary,
 Mariner Energy Resources, Inc. MERI ), own numerous
 properties in the Gulf of Mexico. Certain of such properties
 were leased from the MMS subject to the RRA. Section 304 of
 the RRA relieves lessees of the obligation to pay royalties on
 certain leases until after a designated volume has been
 produced. Four of these leases held by Mariner and two held by
 MERI that are producing or have produced contain lease language
 (inserted by the MMS) that conditions royalty relief on
 commodity prices remaining below specified thresholds. Since
 2000, commodity prices have exceeded some of the predetermined
 thresholds, except in 2002. In May 2006 and September 2008, the
 MMS issued orders asserting that the price thresholds had been
 exceeded in calendar years 2000, 2001, and each of the years
 from 2003 through 2007, and, accordingly, that royalties were
 due under such leases on oil and gas produced in those years.
 The potential liability of MERI under its leases relate to
 production from the leases commencing July 1, 2005, the
 effective date of Mariner s acquisition of MERI. Mariner
 and MERI believe that the MMS did not have the statutory
 authority to include commodity price threshold language in the
 leases governed by Section 304 of the RRA and accordingly
 have withheld payment of royalties. Mariner and MERI have
 challenged the MMS s authority in pending administrative
 appeals for those leases for which the MMS has issued orders to
 pay.

The enforceability of the price threshold provisions in leases
 granted pursuant to Section 304 of the RRA is currently
 being litigated in several administrative appeals filed by other
 companies in addition to Mariner, as well as in Kerr-McGee
 Oil Gas Corp. v. Allred ,
 No. 08-30069 
 (5th Cir.). In the Kerr-McGee litigation, the district
 court in the Western District of Louisiana granted
 Kerr-McGee s motion for summary judgment, ruling that the
 price threshold provisions are unlawful and unenforceable under
 Section 304 of the RRA. Kerr-McGee Oil Gas
 Corp. v. Allred , No. 2:06 CV 0439 (W.D. La.) (Mem.
 Ruling filed Oct. 30, 2007). The Department of the Interior
 appealed that judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for
 the Fifth Circuit. On January 12, 2009, the Fifth Circuit
 affirmed the district court s judgment that the price
 provisions are unlawful based on Section 304 of the RRA.
 Kerr-McGee Oil Gas Corp. v.
 U.S. Dep t of Interior , 
 F.3d , 2009 WL 57883 (5th Cir. Jan. 12, 2009).
 Until the appeals process is complete, Mariner will continue to
 monitor the case. Given the judicial history of the case,
 Mariner determined that as of December 31, 2008, it no
 longer will record a liability for its estimated exposure to the
 MMS on leases granted to Mariner pursuant to Section 304 of
 the RRA. At December 31, 2008, this liability would have
 been 57.3 million, including interest. In addition, as of
 December 31, 2008, Mariner began including in its estimated
 proved reserves those reserves attributable to these RRA
 Section 304 leases which, at December 31, 2008, was
 approximately 18.1 Bcfe.

Litigation The Company, in the ordinary
 course of business, is a claimant
 and/or a
 defendant in various legal proceedings, including proceedings as
 to which the Company has insurance coverage and those that may
 involve the filing of liens against the Company or its assets.
 The Company does not consider its exposure in these proceedings,
 individually or in the aggregate, to be material.

Letters of Credit Mariner s bank credit
 facility has a letter of credit subfacility of up to
 50 million that is included as a use of the borrowing
 base. As of December 31, 2008, five such letters of credit
 totaling 7.2 million were outstanding of which
 4.2 million is required for plugging and abandonment
 obligations at certain of Mariner s offshore fields.

On March 2, 2006, Mariner obtained a dedicated letter of
 credit under its bank credit facility. It was not included as a
 use of the borrowing base. The dedicated letter of credit was
 issued in favor of Forest to secure performance of our
 obligation to drill and complete 150 wells under a
 drill-to-earn 
 program. The dedicated letter of credit reduced periodically by
 an amount equal to the product of 0.5 million times the
 number of wells exceeding 75 that were drilled and completed. As
 of January 2008, the dedicated letter of credit had been reduced
 to zero and cancelled as all 150 wells had been drilled and
 completed as of December 31, 2007. The dedicated letter of
 credit balance as of December 31, 2007 was
 3.2 million.

Fair
 Value Measurement 

Certain of Mariner s assets and liabilities are reported at
 fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such
 assets and liabilities include amounts for both financial and
 nonfinancial instruments. The carrying values of cash and cash
 equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable (including
 income taxes payable and accrued expenses) approximated fair
 value at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007.
 These assets and liabilities are not included in the following
 tables.

SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
 prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
 fair value. As presented in the table below, the hierarchy
 consists of three broad levels. Level 1 inputs on the
 hierarchy consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
 for identical assets and liabilities and have the highest
 priority. Level 2 inputs are market-based and are directly
 or indirectly observable but not considered Level 1 quoted
 prices, including quoted prices for similar instruments in
 active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
 instruments in markets that are not active; or valuation
 techniques whose inputs are observable. Where observable inputs
 are available, directly or indirectly, for substantially the
 full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is
 categorized in Level 2. Level 3 inputs are
 unobservable (meaning they reflect Mariner s own
 assumptions regarding how market participants would price the
 asset or liability based on the best available information) and
 therefore have the lowest priority. A financial
 instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based
 on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair
 value measurement. Mariner believes it uses appropriate
 valuation techniques based on the available inputs to measure
 the fair values of its assets and liabilities.

SFAS 157 requires a credit adjustment for non-performance
 in calculating the fair value of financial instruments. The
 credit adjustment for derivatives in an asset position is
 determined based on the credit rating of the counterparty and
 the credit adjustment for derivatives in a liability position is
 determined based on Mariner s credit rating.

The following table provides fair value measurement information
 for the Company s derivative financial instruments as of
 December 31, 2008.

NOTES TO
 THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
 STATEMENTS (Continued) 

For the
 Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 

At December 31, 2008, the Company had federal and state net
 operating loss carry forwards of approximately
 500.8 million and 21.0 million, respectively, which
 will expire in varying amounts between 2019 and 2027 and are
 subject to certain limitations on an annual basis. A valuation
 allowance has been established against state net operating
 losses where it is more likely than not that, such losses will
 expire before they are utilized. The current portion of deferred
 tax liabilities is 23.1 million.

The Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,
 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
 interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 
 FIN 48 ), which clarifies the accounting and
 disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions, as defined.
 FIN 48 seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated
 with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related
 to accounting for income taxes. The Company adopted FIN 48
 and applied the guidance of
 FIN 48-1 
 as of January 1, 2007. As of the adoption date, the Company
 did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the
 adoption of FIN 48 or have any gross unrecognized tax
 benefit. At December 31, 2008, the Company did not have any
 FIN 48 liability or gross recognized tax benefit.

The Company has incurred changes of control as defined by the
 Internal Revenue Code Section 382
 Section 382 ). Accordingly, the rules of
 Section 382 will limit the utilization of our net operating
 losses. The limitation is determined by multiplying the value of
 the stock immediately before the ownership change by the
 applicable long-term exempt rate. It is estimated that
 57.3 million of net operating losses will be subject to an
 annual limitation of approximately 4.0 million, and an
 estimated 72.8 million of net operating losses will be
 subject to an annual limitation of approximately
 33.0 million. Any unused annual limitation may be carried
 over to later years. The amount of the limitation may under
 certain circumstances be increased by the built-in gains in
 assets held by us at the time of the change that are recognized
 in the five-year period after the change.

Deferred tax assets relating to tax benefits of employee
 share-based compensation have been reduced to reflect stock
 options exercised and restricted stock that vested in fiscal
 2008. Some exercises and vestings resulted in tax deductions in
 excess of previously recorded benefits based on the option value
 at the time of grant windfalls ). Although these
 additional tax benefits or windfalls are reflected
 in net operating tax carry forwards pursuant to SFAS 123(R)
 Share-Based Payment , the additional tax benefit
 associated with the windfall is not recognized until the
 deduction reduces taxes payable. Accordingly, since the tax
 benefit does not reduce our current taxes payable in fiscal 2008
 due to net operating loss carry forwards, these
 windfall tax benefits are not reflected in our net
 operating losses in deferred tax assets for fiscal 2008.
 Windfalls included in net operating loss carry forwards but not
 reflected in deferred tax assets for fiscal 2008 are
 9.2 million.

Note 11. 

Segment
 Information 

The FASB issued SFAS No. 131 Disclosures about
 Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information 
 SFAS 131 ), which establishes standards for
 reporting information about operating segments. Operating
 segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage
 in activities from which it may earn revenues and incur
 expenses. Separate financial information is available and this
 information is regularly evaluated by the chief decision maker
 for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing
 performance.

We measure financial performance as a single enterprise,
 allocating capital resources on a
 project-by-project 
 basis across our entire asset base to maximize profitability. We
 utilize a company-wide management team that administers all
 enterprise operations encompassing the exploration, development
 and production of natural gas and oil. All operations are
 located in the United States. Inasmuch as we are one enterprise,
 we do track basic operational data by area, and do not maintain
 comprehensive financial statement information by area.

Supplemental
 Guarantor Information 

On April 30, 2007, the Company sold and issued
 300 million aggregate principal amount of its
 8 Notes. On April 24, 2006, the Company sold and
 issued to eligible purchasers 300 million aggregate
 principal amount of its
 7 1 / 2 Notes.
 The Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior
 unsecured basis by the Company s existing and future
 domestic subsidiaries Subsidiary Guarantors ). The
 guarantees are full and unconditional and the guarantors are
 wholly-owned. In the future, the guarantees may be released or
 terminated under certain circumstances. Each subsidiary
 guarantee ranks senior in right of payment to any future
 subordinated indebtedness of the guarantor subsidiary, ranks
 equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior
 unsecured indebtedness of the guarantor subsidiary and
 effectively subordinate to all existing and future secured
 indebtedness of the guarantor subsidiary, including its
 guarantees of indebtedness under the Company s bank credit
 facility, to the extent of the collateral securing such
 indebtedness.

The following information sets forth our Consolidating Balance
 Sheets as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, our Condensed
 Consolidating Statements of Operations for the years ended

 Consolidating Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended

Subsequent
 Events 

Subsequent to December 31, 2008, oil and gas commodity
 prices have continued to decline. In the event that commodity
 prices continue to deteriorate throughout the first quarter of
 2009, the Company may be required to record a ceiling test
 impairment, and such impairment could be material to its
 financial position and results of operations.

Note 15. 

Oil and
 Gas Producing Activities and Capitalized Costs
 (Unaudited) 

The results of operations from the Company s oil and gas
 producing activities below exclude non-oil and gas revenues,
 general and administrative expenses, interest income and
 interest expense. Income tax expense was determined by applying
 the statutory rates to pretax operating results.

For the
 Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 

(1) 

Includes asset retirement cost in conjunction with the MGOM
 acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2008 of
 approximately 44.4 million and the Forest Merger for the
 year ended December 31, 2006 of approximately
 165.2 million. 

(2) 

Costs included capitalized general and administrative expense of
 19.8 million, 14.0 million and 11.0 million in
 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively and capitalized interest
 expense of 9.7 million, 0.5 million and
 1.5 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 

(3) 

Total costs are inclusive of non cash items such as capital
 expenditures and asset retirement obligation accruals. 

The Company capitalizes interest and internal costs associated
 with exploration and production activities in progress. The
 capitalized internal costs were approximately 46 , 25 , and 20 
 of the Company s gross general and administrative expenses,
 excluding share-based compensation expense for the years ended
 December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The following table summarizes costs related to unevaluated
 properties that have been excluded from amounts subject to
 amortization at December 31, 2008. There are no
 individually significant properties or significant development
 projects included in our unevaluated property balance. The
 Company regularly evaluates these costs to determine whether
 impairment has occurred. The majority of these costs are
 expected to be evaluated and included in the amortization base
 within three years.

Supplemental
 Oil and Gas Reserve and Standardized Measure Information
 (Unaudited) 

Estimated proved net recoverable reserves as shown below include
 only those quantities that are expected to be commercially
 recoverable at prices and costs in effect at the balance sheet
 dates under existing regulatory practices and with conventional
 equipment and operating methods. Proved developed reserves
 represent only those reserves expected to be recovered through
 existing wells. Proved undeveloped reserves include those
 reserves expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled
 acreage or from existing wells on which a relatively major
 expenditure is required for recompletion. Also included in the
 Company s proved undeveloped reserves as of
 December 31, 2008 were reserves expected to be recovered
 from wells for which certain drilling and completion operations
 had occurred as of that date, but for which significant future
 capital expenditures were required to bring the wells into
 commercial production.

Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and may change as
 additional information becomes available. Furthermore, estimates
 of oil and gas reserves, of necessity, are projections based on
 engineering data, and there are uncertainties inherent in the
 interpretation of such data as well as in the projection of
 future rates of production and the timing of development
 expenditures. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of
 estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that
 cannot be measured exactly, and the accuracy of any reserve
 estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of
 engineering and geological interpretation and judgment.
 Accordingly, estimates of the economically recoverable
 quantities of oil and

natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties,
 classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery and
 estimates of the future net cash flows expected there from as
 prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at
 different times may vary substantially. There also can be no
 assurance that the reserves set forth herein will ultimately be
 produced or that the proved undeveloped reserves set forth
 herein will be developed within the periods anticipated. It is
 likely that variances from the estimates will be material. In
 addition, the estimates of future net revenues from estimated
 proved reserves of the Company and the present value thereof are
 based upon certain assumptions about future production levels,
 prices and costs that may not be correct when judged against
 actual subsequent experience. The Company emphasizes with
 respect to the estimates prepared by independent petroleum
 engineers that the discounted future net cash flows should not
 be construed as representative of the fair market value of the
 estimated proved reserves owned by the Company since discounted
 future net cash flows are based upon projected cash flows, which
 do not provide for changes in oil and natural gas prices from
 those in effect on the date indicated or for escalation of
 expenses and capital costs subsequent to such date. The
 meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the
 accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based. Actual
 results will differ, and are likely to differ materially, from
 the results estimated.

The following is a summary of a Standardized Measure of
 discounted net future cash flows related to the Company s
 proved oil and gas reserves. The information presented is based
 on a calculation of estimated proved reserves using discounted
 cash flows based on year-end prices, costs and economic

Evaluation
 of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Mariner maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are
 designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
 its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 SEC are recorded, processed, summarized and
 reported within the time period specified in the SEC s
 rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
 communicated to management, including its chief executive
 officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
 timely decisions regarding required disclosures based on the
 definition of disclosure controls and procedures as
 defined in
 Rule 13a-15(e) 
 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
 amended (the Exchange Act ). In designing and
 evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
 has recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how
 well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
 assurance, not absolute assurance, of achieving the desired
 control objectives, and management is required to apply judgment
 in evaluating its controls and procedures. As of the end of the
 period covered by this report, and under the supervision and
 with the participation of management, including the
 Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
 Officer, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design
 and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures. Based
 on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer
 and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the
 Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
 as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
