FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

Certain
statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are deemed to be forward-looking statements (within the meaning
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations.
Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or
achievements of the Registrant to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied
by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve
numerous risks and uncertainties. The Registrant s plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the
continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things,
future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to
predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Registrant. Although the Registrant believes its assumptions
underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there
can be no assurance the forward-looking statements included in this Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant
uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded
as a representation by the Registrant or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Registrant will be achieved.

1. Description of Business 

General 

Savvy
Business Support, Inc. (the Company, we, us, Savvy, our, 
and similar terms) is engaged in the business of offering general business services/support to start-up companies, small and medium
business planning to expand, individuals, and other business and organizations. We offer comprehensive services tailored to the
client s desired goal and needs. The documentation we produce may be for a client s internal use, compliance reporting
or documentation supporting a business opportunity. The advantage we have over the competition is that we offer an all-encompassing
solution with emphasis on due diligence, competition analysis, strategy and implementation, market analysis and wide-ranging pro-forma
financial projections. 

Organizational
History 

We
were incorporated in State of Nevada on April 30, 2010. Because we currently have nominal operations and minimal assets, we are
currently considered to be a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, as amended. Because the Company is considered
a shell company, the securities previously sold in past offerings can only be resold through registration under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ); Section 4(1) of the Securities Act, if available, for non-affiliates;
or by meeting the conditions of Rule 144(i) of the Securities Act. 

The
Company is authorized to issue one hundred ten million (110,000,000) shares of capital stock, one hundred million (100,000,000)
shares of which are designated as Common Stock, and ten million (10,000,000) shares of preferred stock, 0.0001 par value, which
can be designated by the Board of Directors in one or more classes with voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and
such designations, preferences, limitations or restrictions 

At
September 30, 2012, we had 5,055,000 shares of Common Stock outstanding. As described under Subsequent Events below, there are
currently an aggregate of 2,355,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock issued and outstanding, 2,310,000 of which are
held by our sole officer and director. 

On
September 24, 2012, our Board designated 4,500,000 shares of Preferred Stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock 
and we filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada therein designating and establishing
the class of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. On September 25, 2012, the Company sold 4,500,000 shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock to the Selling Stockholders for an aggregate purchase price of 450 under Section 4(2) under the Securities Act.
Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible by the holder thereof for 20 shares of Common Stock of the Company;
provided, however, that the holder is prohibited from converting such number of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
that would result in the stockholder beneficially owning more than 9.9 of the Common Stock of the Company. The holders of the
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall vote only on a share for share basis with our Common Stock on any matter, including
but not limited to, the election of directors, name changes, increases in the authorized common shares and for which such preferred
stock or series has such rights and as otherwise provided by the Nevada law and is superior upon the liquidation of the Company.
On September 26, 2012, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No: 333-184110) therein registering an aggregate of
90,000,000 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act on behalf of the Selling Stockholder named in the Registration Statement.
We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Common Stock on behalf of the Selling Stockholder. 

Subsequent
Events: 

On
November 7, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared the Registration Statement registering an aggregate of 90,000,000
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of 4,500,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on behalf of the
Selling Stockholder named therein effective under the Securities Act. 

3 

On
November 8, 2012, our Board designated 100 shares of Preferred Stock as Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock 
and we filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada therein designating and establishing
the class of Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock. On November 8, 2012, the Company sold 100 shares of Series B Non-Convertible
Preferred Stock to Virginia K. Sourlis for an aggregate purchase price of 10 under Section 4(2) under the Securities Act. 

The
outstanding shares of Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock shall vote together with the shares of Common Stock and other voting
securities of the Corporation as a single class and, regardless of the number of shares of Series B Non-Convertible Preferred
Stock outstanding and as long as at least one of such shares of Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock is outstanding, shall
represent eighty percent (80 of all votes entitled to be voted at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation
or action by written consent of stockholders. Each outstanding share of the Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock shall represent
its proportionate share of the 80 which is allocated to the outstanding shares of Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock. 

On
November 8, 2012, the Company sold a five month promissory note in the principal amount of 193,000 bearing interest at the rate
of 8 per annum. The Company may prepay the outstanding principal and interest of the promissory note without penalty. On
November 9, 2012, the Company redeemed an aggregate of 2,700,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company held by Virginia K. Sourlis
for 189,000. 

Business
Overview 

Located
in Red Bank, New Jersey, the Company offers general business services/support to start-up companies, small and medium business
planning to expand, individuals, and other business and organizations. We offer comprehensive services tailored to the client s
desired goal and needs. The documentation we produce may be for a client s internal use, compliance reporting or documentation
supporting a business opportunity. We believe that the advantage we have over the competition is that we offer an all-encompassing
solution with emphasis on due diligence, research on competitor analysis, strategy and implementation, market analysis and wide-ranging
pro-forma financial projections. 

The
Company believes it has formulated a business model to succeed in a downsizing corporate America and a turbulent economy the country
has been recently experiencing. We have conducted the necessary due diligence and we believe that we have tailored a multifaceted
business model to compete in the business services sector. 

As
corporate America downsizes, there are more and more skilled/talented people looking for employment. We use the words skilled/talented
to represent people with defined skill sets including auditing, corporate accounting, bookkeeping, public company compliance reporting,
finance, business writing, and research and development. 

Even
though corporate America is downsizing and firing employees, U.S. reporting companies continue to have duties and reporting requirements
that require compliance. Our multifaceted business model has identified a number of these duties and plans to offer these services
to business on an as needed basis. 

Regardless
of the service required, the Company has already identified skilled individuals to complete the services. The Company has identified
several individuals that have the necessary skills/talents to launch the Company in its initial phase. As of the date of this
Annual Report, we have not contact or approached such individuals about the prospect of working for us. We have also not adopted
any guidelines for contracting with such individuals, and believe that that the contractual arrangement between our Company and
such individuals will be determined on a case-by-case basis, based upon the skill-set of such individual and the market demand
for a particular field. We are confident that the Company will always be able to find skilled/talented people to perform virtually
any task because of the diversity of the local talent pool.

Fees 

Revenues
are expected be derived from fees we will charge our clientele in the form of cash and on a case-by-case basis. In certain favorable
circumstances, we may negotiate with the client and receive all or a portion of payment in the form of equity in such client s
company. We intend to offer clients our comprehensive services for a flat monthly fee, or on a project-by-project 
la carte basis. At no time will we charge any client for referrals of market makers. 

5 

At
the present time, we intend to charge clients a flat rate fee per month for comprehensive services. The amount of the monthly
fee will vary and may increase based on the size and complexity of such client, the amount and skill of work involved, and based
on individual negotiations with a particular client. 

Fees
for clients who elect to retain our services on a project-by-project basis shall be individually negotiated and will vary based
on the size and complexity of such client, the amount and skill of work involved, and with consideration to rates being charged
throughout the industry for similar services. 

Our
fee structure is subject to current market conditions and is therefore subject to change. However, at no point will the client
be unaware of any rate change. 

Product
and service development will be conducted under the direction of our sole Officer and Director, Virginia K. Sourlis, a practicing
attorney with a joint JD/MBA degree received in 1991 from Villanova Law and Villanova School of Business Alumni. Ms. Sourlis received
her undergraduate degree from Stanford University (1986) and studied at Oxford University in the United Kingdom (1985). Ms. Sourlis
possesses almost twenty years of experience in corporate and securities law as well as in mergers acquisitions. Her strong
educational background and years of experience are believed by the Company to render her extremely capable and insightful towards
bringing the Company s business plan to fruition. Under her direction, the Company is focused on product development based
on the client needs and direction of the marketplace. The Company offers general business consulting/services consisting of compliance
reporting, bookkeeping, business writing, finance, and research and development. In addition, we offer business plan writing services
for individuals interested in starting a new business and welcome referrals from accountants, lawyers and other business professionals.
The Company s mission is to offer competent and complete satisfaction to its customers. 

Industry
Analysis 

Competition
in the general field of business consulting is quite intense. Although numerous established companies offer a variety of services
to different customer segments, the Company believes competition in the small and medium size businesses marketplace to be modest.
It is our belief that customers in this segment strongly rely on a referral consultant s professional qualifications and
the ability to come up with viable solutions in a time and cost-effective manner to satisfy their clients needs. 

Marketing 

The
Company will adopt a focused marketing strategy based on the identified four major classifications of market segmentation to target
and adopted a focused marketing strategy. These classifications include: 

Individual
 Entrepreneurs; 

Small
 
 Large
 Privately
 Held
 Companies; 

Small
 to
 Large
 Publicly
 Traded
 Corporations;
 and 

Small
 to
 Large
 Going
 Public
 Companies. 

Individual
Entrepreneurs 

Marketing
to this segment poses challenges because success will depend upon an ambitious campaign including word-of-mouth and personal relationships.
Despite the challenges associated with cultivating business from this segment, the Company performed due diligence on the market
classifications and the results indicate that this is the fastest growing segment. 

Small
 Large Privately Held Companies 

The
classification of this segment includes businesses with 25 to 5,000 employees. Based on our classifications, marketing to this
segment will require a strategy similar to individual proprietors. The marketing strategy will emphasize networking with individuals,
business acquaintances and professionals. The goal to attracting business is by offering our services as a value added benefit
to their clients needs. 

Small
to Large Going Public Companies 

Procuring
business from this segment will be somewhat more conventional and we have plans for a frugal marketing campaign that is target
market driven. Due diligence performed by the Company revealed that this market segment has the most potential to generate revenue
consistently on a short-term and long-term basis. 

The
Company s primary planned marketing strategy targets building long-term customer relationships, which will result in repeat
business. Since our core business is business services/consulting, we plan to market our company as a competent and reliable referral
source. We will place emphasis on our services that address the needs of smaller clients that the Company may not have the resources
to satisfy internally or which they have not found a competent and reliable referral source. 

6 

Small
to Large Publicly Traded Corporations 

Savvy
is finalizing a marketing strategy to attract clients and business from this segment. We will guarantee the same competent end
services as the firms with the recognizable well-known names. Retaining clientele from companies already publicly traded could
prove challenging, as such companies typically have consultants and third party service provides already in place and under contract. 

Growth
Strategy of the Company 

Our
mission is to maximize shareholder value through expanding the scope of services offered while continually evaluating and cultivating
new and alternative revenue generating opportunities. While a strategic and wisely executed referral based marketing campaign
is vital to expanding our client base, providing superior service and reliability will ensure a solid operation built for long-term
success. 

The
overall objective is to focus efforts towards our specialized services and to become a leader in this service driven sector. Generating
sufficient cash flow to finance future growth and development is a key factor to growing and expanding the business at a rate
that is both challenging and manageable. 

Competitive
Analysis 

The
Company has many potential competitors in the business consulting services industry. We consider the competition to be competent,
experienced, and they have greater financial and marketing resources than we do at the present time. Our ability to compete may
be adversely affected by the ability of these competitors to devote greater resources to the marketing of their services than
are available to our Company. Some of the Company s competitors also offer a wider scope of services and have greater name
recognition. Our competitors include large accounting firms that also have extensive customer bases. 

The
Company has identified, analyzed, and broke down the competition into three major classes. These include individual consultants
who devote their fulltime to marketing themselves to potential clients, small to large accounting businesses who operate business
consulting divisions in addition to their primary accounting and auditing businesses, and large consulting companies that have
a substantial amount of skilled and experienced employees under contract.

Patents
and Trademarks 

At
the present we do not have any patents or trademarks. 

Need
for any Government Approval of Products or Services 

We
do not require any government approval for our services. 

Government
and Industry Regulation 

We
will be subject to federal laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to our operations including securities laws.
We will also be subject to common business and tax rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of our business. 

Research
and Development Activities 

Other
than time spent researching our proposed business, the Company has not spent any funds on research and development activities
to date. The Company plans to spend funds on Services Development as detailed in sections titled Description of Business 
and Management s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation. 

Environmental
Laws 

Our
operations are not subject to any environmental laws. 

Employees
and Employment Agreements 

We
currently have one employee, our executive officer, Ms. Virginia K. Sourlis who is responsible for the primary operation of our
business. There are no formal employment agreements between the Company and our current employee. The loss of Ms. Sourlis 
services would have a material adverse and catastrophic impact on our business operations, which should be considered a high risk
of investment. 

In
the event our Company does not have adequate cash on hand, our sole Officer and Director, Ms. Sourlis, has verbally agreed to
fund the Company for an indefinite period of time. The funding of the Company by Ms. Sourlis will create a further liability to
the Company to be reflected on the Company s financial statements. Ms. Sourlis commitment to personally fund the
Company is not contractual and could cease at any moment in her sole and absolute discretion. 

Future
contributions by Ms. Sourlis to the Company, pursuant to the verbal and non-binding agreement, will be reflected on the financial
statements of the Company as liabilities. 

Penny
Stock Rules 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in
penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than 5.00 (other than securities registered on
certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with
respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). 

A
purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to sell the stock. Our shares of Common Stock constitute penny stock
under the Securities and Exchange Act. The shares will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future. The classification of penny
stock makes it more difficult for a broker-dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which makes it more difficult for
a purchaser to liquidate his/her investment. Any broker-dealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her
shares in us will be subject to Rules 15g-1 through 15g-10 of the Securities and Exchange Act. Rather than creating a need to
comply with those rules, some broker-dealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny stock. 

8 

The
penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver
a standardized risk disclosure document, which: 

Contains
a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stock in both Public offerings and secondary trading; 

Contains
a description of the broker s or dealer s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer
with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended; 

- Contains
 a
 brief,
 clear,
 narrative
 description
 of
 a
 dealer
 market,
 including
 bid 
 and
 ask 
 price
 for
 the
 penny
 stock
 and
 the
 significance
 of
 the
 spread
 between
 the
 bid
 and
 ask
 price; 

- Contains
 a
 toll-free
 number
 for
 inquiries
 on
 disciplinary
 actions; 

- Defines
 significant
 terms
 in
 the
 disclosure
 document
 or
 in
 the
 conduct
 of
 trading
 penny
 stocks;
 and 

- Contains
 such
 other
 information
 and
 is
 in
 such
 form
 (including
 language,
 type,
 size
 and
 format)
 as
 the
 Securities
 and
 Exchange
 Commission
 shall
 require
 by
 rule
 or
 regulation. 

The
broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, to the customer: 

- The
 bid
 and
 offer
 quotations
 for
 the
 penny
 stock; 

- The
 compensation
 of
 the
 broker-dealer
 and
 its
 salesperson
 in
 the
 transaction; 

- The
 number
 of
 shares
 to
 which
 such
 bid
 and
 ask
 prices
 apply,
 or
 other
 comparable
 information
 relating
 to
 the
 depth
 and
 liquidity
 of
 the
 market
 for
 such
 stock;
 and 

- Monthly
 account
 statements
 showing
 the
 market
 value
 of
 each
 penny
 stock
 held
 in
 the
 customer s
 account. 

In
addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the
broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive
the purchaser s written acknowledgement of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions
involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements will have
the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock
rules. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling their securities. 

Executive
Offices and Telephone Number 

Our
executive office is currently located The Courts of Red Bank, 130 Maple Avenue, Suite 9B2, Red Bank New Jersey 07701. Our main
telephone number is (732) 530-9007. Our fax number is (732) 530-9008. Our Officer, Virginia K. Sourlis, may also be reached at
any time by email at Virginia@SourlisLaw.com . 

This
space is provided to us free of charge by our sole director and officer. The loss of services of Ms. Sourlis would result in the
Company being required to obtain outside office space at a potentially high cost. 

We
anticipate that we will require additional office space to facilitate the implementation of our business plan once sufficient
revenues are attained which would allow such an action. We have recently undertaken a comprehensive review of additional office
space available in the Red Bank, New Jersey area and found that many suitable commercial office spaces are perpetually available,
and that prices range from approximately 25.00 - 30.00 per square foot. Management of the Company believes that office space
of approximately one thousand square feet will be sufficient for current operations, but anticipates that continued growth or
expansion could require larger space.

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS 

In
addition to the other information in this report, the following risks should be considered carefully in evaluating our business
and prospects: 

Because
we have nominal assets and minimal operations, we are considered a shell company and our business is difficult to evaluate. 

Because
we have nominal operations and minimal assets, we are considered to be a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Because the company is considered a shell company, the securities previously sold in past offerings
can only be resold through registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ); Section
4(1) of the Securities Act, if available, for non-affiliates; or by meeting the conditions of Rule 144(i) of the Securities Act. 

To
eliminate our status as a shell company, we are actively pursuing new clients thereby producing revenue and assets. This may be
accomplished through our own initiatives and business strategies. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational
efforts and in pursuing clients. 

As
the Company is currently a shell company with nominal assets and operations, there is a risk that we will be unable to continue
as a going concern. The Company may have minimal operations or revenues or earnings from operations for several months. We currently
do not have any significant assets or revenue. We anticipate we will sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues.
This may result in our incurring a net operating loss that will increase continuously until we can generate revenues. There is
no guarantee that we will develop and sustain a suitable business operation. 

We
are not currently profitable and may not become profitable. 

At
September 30, 2012, we had 450 in cash on hand and a deficit accumulated during the Company s development stage of 45,973
and has not generated any revenues to date. In their report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 included in this Annual
Report, our auditors have expressed that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We have
incurred operating losses since our formation and expect to incur losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable
future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability. We expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and
may never become profitable. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures for the next several
years and anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future. We also expect to experience negative
cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures. As a result, we will need to generate
significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve
profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our Common
Stock. 

Subject
to negotiation, our fees may be paid in the form of restricted stock of our clients. 

In
certain situations, we may negotiate with our clients to receive all or a portion of payment owed to us for services rendered
in the form of equity in that client s company. Such determination will be made by our sole officer, Virginia K. Sourlis.
While we generally prefer to receive cash compensation, our officer may believe that certain situations require the receipt of
restricted equity as compensation. Risks associated with receiving restricted equity compensation include, but are not limited
to, 1) problems of liquidity where no market exists for such equity and therefore the Company cannot sell such equity and realize
cash; 2) the client goes out of business and such equity is rendered worthless; 3) the equity is sold for less than the value
of services provided by us to the client. 

We
believe that it is necessary to receive a limited amount of equity in order to hedge the associated risks involved with such form
of payment. However, any loss we experience related to equity compensation could have a material effect on our ability to become
profitable, and in the long term, to continue as a going concern. 

We
are subject to all of the complications and difficulties associated with new enterprises. 

We
have a limited history upon which an evaluation of our prospects and future performance can be made. Our proposed operations are
subject to all business risks associated with new enterprises. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the
problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with the expansion of a business
operation in an emerging industry, and the continued development of advertising, promotions, and a corresponding customer base.
There is a possibility that we could sustain losses in the future, and there are no assurances that we will ever operate profitably. 

We
are a consulting company and while our management believes that it can implement our business plan, attract highly talented personnel
and develop a market for its products and services, our plan of operations are subject to changing needs of target clientele,
market conditions and various other factors out of our control. For these and other reasons, the purchase of the Shares should
only be made by persons who can afford to lose their entire investment. 

10 

Virginia
K. Sourlis, the sole officer and director of the Company, currently is a fulltime attorney devoting approximately 40 hours a week
to outside matters which could result in her inability to properly manage company affairs, resulting in our remaining a start-up
company with no revenues or profits. 

Our
business plan does not provide for the hiring of any additional employees until revenue will support the expense, which is estimated
to be the third quarter of operations. Until that time, the responsibility of developing the Company s business, offering
and selling of the shares, and fulfilling the reporting requirements of a public company all fall upon Virginia K. Sourlis, who
has limited time to manage the affairs of the Company. We have not formulated a plan to resolve any possible conflict of interest
with her other business activities. In the event she is unable to fulfill any aspect of her duties to the Company we may experience
a shortfall or complete lack of revenue resulting in little or no profits and eventual closure of the business. 

We
are highly dependent on the services of Virginia K. Sourlis, our sole officer and sole director. 

Our
success depends on the efforts and abilities of Virginia K. Sourlis, our sole officer and sole director. Ms. Virginia is a licensed
attorney and Managing Partner of The Sourlis Law Firm, a boutique law firm specializing in Corporate and Securities Law, located
in Red Bank, New Jersey. The loss of the services of Ms. Sourlis would have a material adverse effect on us. Our success also
depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel required to fully implement our business plan. There can be
no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts. In addition, Virginia Sourlis provides us office space in her professional
business office free of charge. Our loss of her services would require us to obtain alternative office space for which we could
expect to incur substantial lease fees. Furthermore, Ms. Sourlis law firm is representing the Company free of charge. Should
we lose Ms. Sourlis as an Officer of the Company, we would immediately start to incur legal fees which could be substantial. 

There
is a pending SEC matter involving Virginia K. Sourlis that could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition.

On
February 10, 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission amended its complaint in SEC v. Greenstone Holdings, Inc., et al.,
10 civ. 1302 (S.D.N.Y.), to add as a defendant Virginia K. Sourlis, our Principal Executive and Principal Financial and Accounting
Officer. The amended complaint alleged that Ms. Sourlis violated Sections 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities
Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder
and aided and abetted defendant Greenstone s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.
The SEC is seeking injunctive relief and financial penalties, disgorgement, and a penny stock bar from Ms. Sourlis. 

On
November 20, 2012, the Court granted partial summary judgment (on liability only) against Ms. Sourlis for aiding and abetting
the defendants 10b violation; however, Ms. Sourlis intends to file an appeal at the conclusion of the case. At the hearing,
the Court also denied the SEC s motion for summary judgment regarding its 10b primary liability claim against Ms. Sourlis.
The Court also reserved decision on the SEC s non-fraud claim that Ms. Sourlis violated Section 5 of the Securities Act;
but rather asked for further briefing regarding the SEC s aiding and abetting claim under Section 5. 

On
the basis of the Court s November 20 liability holding, the SEC intends to seek from the Court against Ms. Sourlis injunctive
relief, financial penalties, disgorgement, and a penny stock bar. In the event the Commission prevails in its charges against
Ms. Sourlis and successfully prevents Ms. Sourlis from deriving income from practicing securities law for a given period of time,
our Company s operations and financial position would be adversely affected due to the fact that Ms. Sourlis currently has
a verbal non-binding agreement with the Company to fund its operations for an indefinite period of time. Also, if the SEC prevails,
it would be more difficult for the Company to attract investors and/or business partners, which would have a material adverse
effect on the Company s business and operations, due to the fact that Ms. Sourlis is the sole director and officer (President,
Chief Executive Officer) of the Company and the very nature of the Company s business is to provide consulting services
to start-up companies and public companies on various matters, from entity formation and financing structures to support for filing
FINRA s Form 211 and complying with SEC regulations. If the SEC prevails and prevent Ms. Sourlis from practicing securities
law for a significant amount of time, it would in effect put the Company out of business unless the Company can retain new qualified
employees, of which there can be no assurances that it will be able to do so. 

As
our business grows, we will need to attract additional employees which we might not be able to do. 

In
order to grow and implement our business plan, we would need to add managerial talent to support our business plan. There is no
guarantee that we will be successful in adding such managerial talent. 

Our
business referrals may be subject to conflicts of interest, which could result in the loss of clients. 

Much
of our services to clients involve referring clients to outside third party service providers. Referrals made by our Company to
clients may involve certain conflicts of interest between the Company, Ms. Sourlis individually, Ms. Sourlis law firm,
and the client. We will make every attempt to ensure that all known and possible conflicts of interest are disclosed to each client
upon making such referral and, if not waived by the client, cease working with the client in one or more capacities. 

11 

Failure
on our part to identify and properly notify a client of any potential conflict of interest could result in legal proceedings,
harm to our reputation and goodwill, and generally could have an overall material adverse effect on our business. 

Our
ability to become profitable and continue as a going concern will be dependent on our ability to attract, employ and retain highly
skilled individuals to serve our clients. 

The
nature of our business requires that we employ skilled persons , to perform highly skilled and specialized tasks
for our clientele. We define skilled persons as professionals with defined skill sets including auditing, corporate
accounting, bookkeeping, public company compliance reporting, finance, business writing, and research and development. 

While
we have identified several skilled persons that we plan on contacting for employment with our Company, as of the date of this
Annual Report, we have not contacted nor have we entered into any agreements with any skilled persons, as we do not yet have the
funds to retain them. 

Our
failure to retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to offer services to clientele, and could
potentially have a negative effect on our business. While we are confident that we will be able to find such persons, there is
no guarantee that skilled persons will be available and willing to work for us in the future, nor is there any guarantee that
we could afford to retain them if they are available at a future time. 

We
may not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors. 

Savvy
Business Support, Inc. has many potential competitors in the business support industry. We will compete, in our current and proposed
businesses, with other companies, some of which have far greater marketing and financial resources and experience than we do.
We cannot guarantee that we will be able to penetrate our intended market and be able to compete profitably, if at all. In addition
to established competitors, there is ease of market entry for other companies that choose to compete with us. Effective competition
could result in price reductions, reduced margins or have other negative implications, any of which could adversely affect our
business and chances for success. Competition is likely to increase significantly as new companies enter the market and current
competitors expand their services. Many of these potential competitors are likely to enjoy substantial competitive advantages,
including: larger staffs, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and substantially greater financial, marketing, technical
and other resources. To be competitive, we must respond promptly and effectively to the challenges of financial change, evolving
standards and competitors innovations by continuing to enhance our services and sales and marketing channels. Any pricing
pressures, reduced margins or loss of market share resulting from increased competition, or our failure to compete effectively,
could fatally damage our business and chances for success. 

We
may not be able to manage our growth effectively. 

We
must continually implement and improve our products and/or services, operations, operating procedures and quality controls on
a timely basis, as well as expand, train, motivate and manage our work force in order to accommodate anticipated growth and compete
effectively in our market segment. Successful implementation of our strategy also requires that we establish and manage a competent,
dedicated work force and employ additional key employees in corporate management, product design, client service and sales. We
can give no assurance that our personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our existing and future
operations. If we fail to implement and improve these operations, there could be a material, adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition. 

If
we do not continually update our services, they may become obsolete and we may not be able to compete with other companies. 

We
cannot assure you that we will be able to keep pace with advances or that our services will not become obsolete. We cannot assure
you that competitors will not develop related or similar services and offer them before we do, or do so more successfully, or
that they will not develop services and products more effective than any that we have or are developing. If that happens, our
business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected. 

We
have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors against lawsuits to the fullest extent of the law. 

We
are a Nevada corporation. Nevada law permits the indemnification of officers and directors against expenses incurred in successfully
defending against a claim. Nevada law also authorizes Nevada corporations to indemnify their officers and directors against expenses
and liabilities incurred because of their being or having been an officer or director. Our organizational documents provide for
this indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by law. 

We
currently do not maintain any insurance coverage. In the event that we are found liable for damage or other losses, we would incur
substantial and protracted losses in paying any such claims or judgments. We have not maintained liability insurance in the past,
but intend to acquire such coverage immediately upon resources becoming available. There is no guarantee that we can secure such
coverage or that any insurance coverage would protect us from any damages or loss claims filed against it. 

12 

If
we engage in any acquisition, we will incur a variety of costs and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. 

We
may attempt to acquire businesses, technologies, services or products or license technologies that we believe are a strategic
fit with our business. We have limited experience in identifying acquisition targets, and successfully completing and integrating
any acquired businesses, technologies, services or products into our current infrastructure. The process of integrating any acquired
business, technology, service or product may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert significant
management attention from our ongoing business operations. As a result, we will incur a variety of costs in connection with an
acquisition and may never realize our anticipated benefits. 

We
may engage in transactions that present conflicts of interest. 

The
Company s officers and directors may enter into agreements with the Company from time to time which may not be equivalent
to similar transactions entered into with an independent third party. A conflict of interest arises whenever a person has an interest
on both sides of a transaction. While we believe that it will take prudent steps to ensure that all transactions between the Company
and any officer or director is fair, reasonable, and no more than the amount it would otherwise pay to a third party in an arms -length 
transaction, there can be no assurance that any transaction will meet these requirements in every instance. 

Risks
Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock 

There
is no active market for our Common Stock. 

On
May 31, 2011, the Company s Common Stock was cleared for trading on the OTC Bulletin Board under the trading symbol SVYB .
There exists only a very limited trading market for the Company s Common Stock with limited or no volume and thus the Company
cannot accurately obtain an accurate bid or ask price for a share of its Common Stock. Any investor who purchases the Company s
Common Stock is not likely to find any liquid trading market for the Common Stock and there can be no assurance that any liquid
trading market will ever develop, or if developed, be maintained. Due to the lack of a trading market for our securities, investors
may have difficulty selling any shares they purchase. 

Any
trading market that may develop in the future for our Common Stock will most likely be very volatile; and numerous factors beyond
our control may have a significant effect on the market. 

Our
Common Stock is deemed a penny stock, which could make it more difficult for our investors to sell their shares. 

Our
Common Stock is subject to the penny stock rules adopted under Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act. The penny
stock rules generally apply to companies whose Common Stock is not listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market or other national
securities exchange and trades at less than 4.00 per share, other than companies that have had average revenue of at least 6,000,000
for the last three years or that have tangible net worth of at least 5,000,000 2,000,000 if the company has been operating
for three or more years). These rules require, among other things, that brokers who trade penny stock to persons other than established
customers complete certain documentation, make suitability inquiries of investors and provide investors with certain information
concerning trading in the security, including a risk disclosure document and quote information under certain circumstances. Many
brokers have decided not to trade penny stocks because of the requirements of the penny stock rules and, as a result, the number
of broker-dealers willing to act as market makers in such securities is limited. If we remain subject to the penny stock rules
for any significant period, it could have an adverse effect on the market, if any, for our securities and investors will find
it more difficult to dispose of our securities. 

We
have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and we cannot provide assurance that additional
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting
or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent
fraud or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial
information and may lead to a decline in our stock price. 

We
are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ),
and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ). The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly
and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition, proxy statement, and other information. The Sarbanes-Oxley
Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls
and procedures for financial reporting. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 (the 2012
Form 10-K ), we have disclosed that our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report were not effective in ensuring
that material information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Also, in this 2012 Form 10-K, we
disclosed that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2012. A material
weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. To date, none of the identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
have been corrected nor have we changed our disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that they are effective. We will need
to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other financial personnel in order to develop and implement appropriate
internal controls and reporting procedures. As a result, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. Furthermore,
the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management s attention from implementing
our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations and financial condition. The measures
we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. If we fail to timely achieve and maintain the adequacy
of our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to produce reliable financial reports or help prevent fraud.
Our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could prevent us from filing our periodic
reports on a timely basis which could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements,
harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.

The
price of our shares of Common Stock in the future may be volatile. 

If
a market ever develops for our Common Stock, of which no assurances can be given, the market price of our Common Stock will likely
be volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
technological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors; additions or departures of key personnel; sales
of our Common Stock; our ability to integrate operations, technology, products and services; our ability to execute our business
plan; operating results below expectations; loss of any strategic relationship; industry developments; economic and other external
factors; and period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results. Because we have a very limited operating history with no
revenues to date, you may consider any one of these factors to be material. Our stock price may fluctuate widely as a result of
any of the above. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations
that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely
affect the market price of our Common Stock. 

Our
undesignated preferred stock may inhibit potential acquisition bids; this may adversely affect the market price for our Common
Stock and the voting rights of holders of our Common Stock. 

Our
certificate of incorporation provides our Board of Directors with the authority to issue up 10,000,000 shares of undesignated
preferred stock and to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imported upon these
shares without further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change
in control transaction without further action by our stockholders. As a result, the market price of our Common Stock may be adversely
affected. In addition, if we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our Common Stock with respect to the
payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that
dilute the voting power of our Common Stock, the rights of holders of our Common Stock or the market price of our Common Stock
could be adversely affected . 

We
have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited
to the value of our Common Stock. 

We
have never paid cash dividends on our Common Stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends
on our Common Stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such
time as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our Common Stock may be less valuable because
a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.

Our
executive office is currently located The Courts of Red Bank, 130 Maple Avenue, Suite 9B2, Red Bank New Jersey 07701. Our main
telephone number is (732) 530-9007. Our fax number is (732) 530-9008. Our Officer, Virginia K. Sourlis, may also be reached at
any time by email at Virginia@SourlisLaw.com . 

This
space is provided to us free of charge by our sole director and officer. The loss of services of Ms. Sourlis would result in the
Company being required to obtain outside office space at a potentially high cost. 

We
anticipate that we will require additional office space to facilitate the implementation of our business plan once sufficient
revenues are attained which would allow such an action. We have recently undertaken a comprehensive review of additional office
space available in the Red Bank, New Jersey area and found that many suitable commercial office spaces are perpetually available,
and that prices range from approximately 25.00 - 30.00 per square foot. Management of the Company believes that office space
of approximately one thousand square feet will be sufficient for current operations, but anticipates that continued growth or
expansion could require larger space.

3. Legal Proceedings 

On
February 10, 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission amended its complaint in SEC v. Greenstone Holdings, Inc., et al.,
10 civ. 1302 (S.D.N.Y.), to add as a defendant Virginia K. Sourlis, our Principal Executive and Principal Financial and Accounting
Officer. The amended complaint alleged that Ms. Sourlis violated Sections 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities
Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder
and aided and abetted defendant Greenstone s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.
The SEC is seeking injunctive relief and financial penalties, disgorgement, and a penny stock bar from Ms. Sourlis. 

14 

On
November 20, 2012, the Court granted partial summary judgment (on liability only) against Ms. Sourlis for aiding and abetting
the defendants 10b violation; however, Ms. Sourlis intends to file an appeal at the conclusion of the case. At the hearing,
the Court also denied the SEC s motion for summary judgment regarding its 10b primary liability claim against Ms. Sourlis.
The Court also reserved decision on the SEC s non-fraud claim that Ms. Sourlis violated Section 5 of the Securities
Act; but rather asked for further briefing regarding the SEC s aiding and abetting claim under Section 5. 

On
the basis of the Court s November 20 liability holding, the SEC intends to seek from the Court against Ms. Sourlis injunctive
relief, financial penalties, disgorgement, and a penny stock bar. In the event the Commission prevails in its charges against
Ms. Sourlis and successfully prevents Ms. Sourlis from deriving income from practicing securities law for a given period of time,
our Company s operations and financial position would be adversely affected due to the fact that Ms. Sourlis currently has
a verbal non-binding agreement with the Company to fund its operations for an indefinite period of time. Also, if the SEC prevails,
it would be more difficult for the Company to attract investors and/or business partners, which would have a material adverse
effect on the Company s business and operations, due to the fact that Ms. Sourlis is the sole director and officer (President,
Chief Executive Officer) of the Company and the very nature of the Company s business is to provide consulting services
to start-up companies and public companies on various matters, from entity formation and financing structures to support for filing
FINRA s Form 211 and complying with SEC regulations. If the SEC prevails and prevent Ms. Sourlis from practicing securities
law for a significant amount of time, it would in effect put the Company out of business unless the Company can retain new qualified
employees, of which there can be no assurances that it will be able to do so.

There

The
Company s Common Stock was approved for trading on the OTC Bulletin Board on January 6, 2011 under the symbol, SVYB .
Since then it has only traded sporadically and with only limited and minimal interest by market makers. 

Any
investor who purchases the Company s Common Stock is not likely to find any liquid trading market for the Common Stock and
there can be no assurance that any liquid trading market will ever develop. While at September 30, 2012, we had 5,055,000 shares
of our Common Stock outstanding, only 50,000 shares of our Common Stock were freely tradable securities (as that
term is used in the Securities Act of 1933) and the remaining 5,005,000 shares were restricted securities since
they are held by our President Virginia K. Sourlis. As of the date hereof, we have 2,355,000 shares of Common Stock outstanding,
50,000 shares of which are freely tradable securities and 2,310,000 shares are held by Virginia K. Sourlis. 

The

The
Company has followed the policy of reinvesting earnings, if any, and, consequently, has not paid any cash dividends. At the present
time, no change in this policy is under consideration by the Board of Directors. The payment of cash dividends in the future will
be determined by the Board of Directors in light of conditions then existing, including the Company s earnings, financial
requirements and condition, opportunities for reinvesting earnings, business conditions and other factors. 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in
penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than 5.00, other than securities registered on
certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with
respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or quotation system. 

The
penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure
document prepared by the SEC, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks
in both public offerings and secondary trading; (b) contains a description of the broker s or dealer s duties to the
customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements
of Securities laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices
for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (d) contains a toll-free telephone number for
inquiries on disciplinary actions; (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny
stocks; and (f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type, size and format, as the Securities
and Exchange Commission shall require by rule or regulation. The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction
in a penny stock, the customer with: (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer
and its salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information
relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and (d) monthly account statements showing the market value
of each penny stock held in the customer s account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction
in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny
stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a
risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a suitably
written statement. 

These
disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock if it becomes
subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, if our common stock becomes subject to the penny stock rules, stockholders may
have difficulty selling those securities.

to be voted on by stockholders must be approved by a majority (or, in the case of election of directors, by a plurality) of the
votes entitled to be cast by all shares of our Common Stock that are present in person or represented by proxy, subject to any
voting rights granted to holders of any preferred stock. Holders of our Common Stock representing one-percent (1 of our capital
stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, are necessary to constitute a quorum at any
meeting of our stockholders. A vote by the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares is required to effectuate certain fundamental

do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors. 

16 

Subject
to any preferential rights of any outstanding series of preferred stock created by our board of directors from time to time, the
holders of shares of our Common Stock will be entitled to such cash dividends as may be declared from time to time by our board
of directors from funds available therefore. 

Subject
to any preferential rights of any outstanding series of preferred stock created from time to time by our board of directors, upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, the holders of shares of our Common Stock will be entitled to receive,
on a pro rata basis, all assets of our company available for distribution to such holders. 

In
the event of any merger or consolidation of our company with or into another company in connection with which shares of our Common
Stock are converted into or exchangeable for shares of stock, other securities or property (including cash), all holders of our
Common Stock will be entitled to receive the same kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property (including
cash), on a pro rata basis. 

Holders
of our Common Stock have no pre-emptive rights, no conversion rights and there are no redemption provisions applicable to our
Common Stock.

Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock 

On
September 24, 2012, our Board designated 4,500,000 shares of Preferred Stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock 
and we filed a Certificate of Designations with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada therein designating and establish
the class of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. On September 25, 2012, the Company sold 4,500,000 shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock to the Selling Stockholders for an aggregate purchase price of 450 under Section 4(2) under the Securities Act.

Below
is a summary of the Certificate of Designations of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. 

1. DESIGNATIONS
AND AMOUNT . Four Million Five Hundred Thousand (4,500,000) shares of the Preferred Stock of the Company, 0.0001 par value
per share, shall constitute a class of Preferred Stock designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock with a face value of 0.0001 per share (the Face Amount ). After the
initial issuance of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, no additional shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
may be issued by the Company except as provided in SECTION 7 hereof. 

2. CONVERSION. 

(a) CONVERSION
AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER . Each holder of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall have the right, at such holder s
option, at any time or from time to time from and after the day immediately following the date the Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock is first issued, to convert each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into Twenty (20) fully-paid and non-assessable
shares of Common Stock, par value 0.0001 per share. In connection with any conversion hereunder, each Holder of Series A Stock

than 9.9 of the Common Stock of the Company. 

(b) MECHANICS
OF CONVERSION . In order to effect a Conversion, a Holder shall: (x) fax (or otherwise deliver) a copy of the fully executed
Notice of Conversion (attached hereto) to the Company for the Common Stock and (y) surrender or cause to be surrendered the original
certificates representing the Series A Stock being converted (the Preferred Stock Certificates ), duly endorsed,
along with a copy of the Notice of Conversion as soon as practicable thereafter to the Company or the transfer agent. The Company
shall not be obligated to issue shares of Common Stock upon a conversion unless either the Preferred Stock Certificates are delivered
to the Company or the transfer agent as provided above, or the Holder notifies the Company or the transfer agent that such certificates
have been lost, stolen or destroyed (subject to the requirements of SECTION 11). 

Conversion
Date means the date specified in the Notice of Conversion in the form attached hereto, so long as the copy of the Notice
of Conversion is faxed (or delivered by other means resulting in notice) to the Company before Midnight, Eastern U.S. time, on
the Conversion Date indicated in the Notice of Conversion. If the Notice of Conversion is not so faxed or otherwise delivered
before such time, then the Conversion Date shall be the date a Holder faxes or otherwise delivers the Notice of Conversion to
the Company. 

(i) Delivery
of Common Stock upon Conversion . Upon the surrender of Preferred Stock Certificates from a Holder of Series A Stock accompanied
by a Notice of Conversion (attached hereto), the Company shall, no later than the ten business days following the later of (a)

representing the number of shares of Series A Stock not being converted, if any.

(c) PARTIAL
CONVERSION . In the event some but not all of the shares of Series A Stock represented by a certificate(s) surrendered by
a holder are converted, the Company shall execute and deliver to or on the order of the holder, at the expense of the Company,
a new certificate representing the number of shares of Series A Stock which were not converted.

of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series A Stock;
and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion
of all then outstanding shares of the Series A Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the holder of
such Series A Stock, the Company shall take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase,
and shall increase, its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such
purposes. 

(e) NO
REISSUANCE OF SERIES A STOCK . In the event any shares of Series A Stock shall be converted pursuant to this SECTION 2 or
otherwise reacquired by the Company, the shares so converted or reacquired shall be canceled. The Certificate of Incorporation
of the Company may be appropriately amended from time to time to effect the corresponding reduction in the Company s authorized
capital stock. 

(f) In
the event of any taking by the Company of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the
holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise
acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Company shall
mail to each holder of Series A Stock, at least 20 days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which
any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend,
distribution or right. 

18

carrying out of all the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary
or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the holders of the Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock against impairment.

long as any shares of Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not (i) alter or change
any of the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock, or (ii) amend the provisions
of this Section 6; in each case, without first obtaining the approval by vote or written consent, in the manner provided by law,
of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock, as to changes affecting
the Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock. 

Dividend
Policy 

We
have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to
finance the expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

Share
Purchase Warrants 

We
have not issued and do not have outstanding any warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. 

Options 

We
have not issued and do not have outstanding any options to purchase shares of our Common Stock 

Convertible
Securities 

Other
than the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock described above, we have not issued and do not have outstanding any securities convertible
into shares of our Common Stock or any rights convertible or exchangeable into shares of our Common Stock. 

Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities 

On
September 25, 2012, we sold 4,500,000 shares of Series A stock for 0.0001 per share generating proceeds of 450.00. 

On
November 8, 2012, we sold 100 shares of Series B stock for an aggregate purchase price of 10.00. 

On
November 8, 2012, the Company sold a five month promissory note in the principal amount of 193,000 bearing interest at the rate
of 8 per annum. The Company may prepay the outstanding principal and interest of the promissory note without penalty. 

The
above securities qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act since the issuance securities by us did not
involve a public offering. The offering was not a public offering as defined in Section 4(2) due to the insubstantial
number of persons involved in the deal, size of the offering, manner of the offering and number of securities offered. The Company
did not undertake an offering in which we sold a high number of securities to a high number of investors. In addition, these stockholders
had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since they agreed to and received share certificates bearing a
legend stating that such securities are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act. This restriction ensures that these
securities would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a public offering. 
Based on an analysis of the above factors, the Company has met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of
the Securities Act for this transaction.

Magri, Esq. of The Sourlis Law Firm has assisted us in the preparation of this Report and will provide counsel with respect to

DISCLOSURE
OF COMMISSION POSITION OF 

 INDEMNIFICATION
FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES 

Our
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide no director shall be liable to the corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except with respect to (1) a breach of the director s duty of loyalty
to the corporation or its stockholders, (2) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law, (3) liability which may be specifically defined by law or (4) a transaction from which the director derived
an improper personal benefit, it being the intention of the foregoing provision to eliminate the liability of the corporation s
directors to the corporation or its stockholders to the fullest extent permitted by law. The corporation shall indemnify to the
fullest extent permitted by law each person that such law grants the corporation the power to indemnify. 

We
have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act is against
public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification
against such liabilities is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities
being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our legal counsel, submit the question of whether such indemnification is
against public policy to a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

You

statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which
involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many
factors, including the factors we describe under Risk Factors, Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
and elsewhere in this report. 

Forward
Looking Statements 

Some
of the information in this section contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can
identify these statements by forward-looking words such as may, will, expect, anticipate, 
 believe, estimate and continue, or similar words. You should read statements that contain
these words carefully because they: 

discuss
 our
 future
 expectations; 

contain
 projections
 of
 our
 future
 results
 of
 operations
 or
 of
 our
 financial
 condition;
 and 

state
 other
 forward-looking 
 information. 

We
believe it is important to communicate our expectations. However, there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately
predict or over which we have no control. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors, 
 Business and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Risk Factors. 

Unless
stated otherwise, the words we, us, our, the Company or Savvy

General
Information about the Company 

Savvy
Business Support, Inc. (the Company or Savvy was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 30,
2010. The Company is offering general business services/support to start-up companies, small and medium business planning to expand,
individuals, and other business and organizations. From the date of formation, the Company commenced operations, discussing and
offering its business consulting services to prospective clients. Because we currently have nominal operations and minimal assets,
we are currently considered to be a shell company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Therefore, an investment
in our Company should be considered extremely risky, and an investment suitable only for those who can afford to lose the entirety
of their investment. 

22 

We
offer comprehensive services tailored to the client s desired goal and needs. The documentation we intend to produce may
be for a client s internal use, compliance reporting or documentation supporting a business opportunity. The advantage we
have over the competition is that we offer an all-encompassing solution with emphasis on due diligence, competition analysis,
strategy and implementation, market analysis and wide-ranging pro-forma financial projections. 

The
Company s operations to date have been devoted primarily to start-up and development activities, which include the following: 

1. Formation
 of
 the
 Company; 

2. Development
 of
 the
 Savvy
 Business
 Support,
 Inc.
 business
 plan; 

3. Initiated
 working
 on
 sales
 and
 marketing
 material; 

4. Conducted
 due
 diligence
 and
 identified
 four
 major
 classifications
 of
 market
 segmentation
 to
 target
 and
 adopted
 a
 focused
 marketing
 strategy.
 These
 classifications
 include: 

Individual
 Entrepreneurs 

Small
 
 Large
 Privately
 Held
 Companies 

Small
 to
 Large
 Publicly
 Traded
 Corporations

 to
 Large
 Going
 Public
 Companies 

Savvy
Business Support, Inc. anticipates sales to begin approximately within one year following this Annual Report. In order to generate
revenues, Savvy Business Support, Inc. must address the following areas: 

1. Finalize
 and
 implement
 our
 marketing
 plan :
 In
 order
 to
 effectively
 market
 our
 services,
 the
 Company
 has
 adopted
 a
 focused
 marketing
 strategy
 that
 it
 needs
 to
 finalize
 and
 implement.
 This
 all-encompassing
 strategy
 is
 broken
 down
 into
 four
 major
 market
 segmentations.
 While
 client
 satisfaction
 is
 paramount
 and
 an
 underscoring
 philosophy,
 the
 marketing
 strategy
 varies
 based
 on
 the
 size
 of
 the
 targeted
 client. 

2. Promoting
 our
 services
 as
 mutually
 beneficial :
 Referral
 relationships
 will
 be
 one
 key
 to
 our
 success.
 One
 of
 our
 strategies
 is
 to
 offer
 our
 services
 to
 business
 where
 their
 clients
 require
 services
 that
 are
 beyond
 their
 internal
 manpower.
 Savvy
 will
 portray
 a
 professional
 image
 and
 complete
 the
 services
 efficiently
 and
 cost
 effectively.
 Conducting
 business
 in
 this
 manner
 will
 result
 in
 a
 positive
 reflection
 on
 our
 Company
 as
 well
 as
 the
 referring
 client. 

3. Constantly
 monitor
 our
 market :
 We
 plan
 to
 constantly
 monitor
 our
 targeted
 market
 segmentations
 and
 adapt
 to
 consumers 
 needs,
 wants
 and
 desires.
 To
 be
 successful
 we
 plan
 to
 evolve
 and
 diversify
 or
 expand
 our
 scope
 of
 services
 to
 satisfy
 our
 clients. 

The
Company believes that raising 200,000 through the sale of common equity will be sufficient for the Company to become operational
and sustain operations through the next twelve (12) months. We believe that the recurring revenues from services performed will
be sufficient to support ongoing operations. Unfortunately, this can be no assurance that the actual expenses incurred will not
materially exceed our estimates or that cash flow from services will be adequate to maintain our business. 

Our
independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in the independent auditors 
report to the financial statements as of September 30, 2012 included in this the Report, and for the period April 30, 2010 (date
of inception) to September 30, 2012. 

Savvy
Business Support, Inc. has administrative offices located at The Courts of Red Bank, 130 Maple Avenue, Suite 9B2, Red Bank NJ
07701. We use this office space free of charge from our sole director and officer. 

Status
as a Shell Company 

As
of September 30, 2012, because we have nominal operations and minimal assets, we are considered to be a shell company under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Because the Company is considered a shell company, the securities sold in previous
offerings can only be resold through registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act );
Section 4(1) of the Securities Act, if available, for non-affiliates; or by meeting the conditions of Rule 144(i) of the Securities
Act. 

23 

Therefore,
an investment in our Company should be considered extremely risky and an investment suitable only for those who can afford to
lose the entirety of their investment. 

The
Company has a very specific business purpose and a bona fide plan of operations. Its business plan and purpose is to provide a
broad range of business support and consulting services, including specific business advice, and third party service provider
and financing referrals to entrepreneurs, small, medium and large companies, including both privately held and publicly traded
entities. The Company offers comprehensive services tailored to each client s desired goals and needs. The Company offers
an all-encompassing solution to every potential client s need with emphasis on due diligence, research on competitor analysis,
strategy and implementation, market analysis and wide-ranging pro-forma financial projections. 

Revenues
will be derived from fees we will charge our clientele in the form of cash and on a case-by-case basis. In certain favorable circumstances,
we may negotiate with the client and receive all or a portion of payment in the form of equity in such client s company.
We intend to offer clients our comprehensive services for a flat monthly fee, or on a project-by-project la carte 
basis. At no time will we charge any client for referrals of market makers. 

At
the present time, we intend to charge clients a flat rate fee per month for comprehensive services. The amount of the monthly
fee will vary and may increase based on the size and complexity of such client, the amount and skill of work involved, and based
on individual negotiations with a particular client. 

Fees
for clients who elect to retain our services on a project-by-project basis shall be individually negotiated and will vary based
on the size and complexity of such client, the amount and skill of work involved, and with consideration to rates being charged
throughout the industry for similar services. 

Our
fee structure is subject to current market conditions and is therefore subject to change. However, at no point will the client
be unaware of any rate change. 

As
of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has not generated revenues, as it has only been operating for a relatively short
period of time. However, the Company is in contact with and has been actively negotiating with potential clients. Upon the receipt
of adequate funding, the Company intends to implement a wider marketing campaign in an effort to generate further business leads
and expand its base of clientele, and intends to hire personnel who can devote their efforts on a fulltime basis. Lastly, the
Company does not have any plans or intentions to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies or
other entity or person. 

Organizational
History 

We
were incorporated in State of Nevada on April 30, 2010. Because we currently have nominal operations and minimal assets, we are
currently considered to be a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, as amended. 

The
Company is authorized to issue one hundred ten million (110,000,000) shares of capital stock, one hundred million (100,000,000)
shares of which are designated as Common Stock, and ten million (10,000,000) shares of preferred stock, 0.0001 par value, which
can be designated by the Board of Directors in one or more classes with voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and
such designations, preferences, limitations or restrictions. 

As
of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, we had 5,055,000 shares of Common Stock outstanding. As described under Subsequent
Events below, there are currently an aggregate of 2,355,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock issued and outstanding,
2,310,000 of which are held by our sole officer and director. 

On
September 24, 2012, our Board designated 4,500,000 shares of Preferred Stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock 
and we filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada therein designating and establishing
the class of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. On September 25, 2012, the Company sold 4,500,000 shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock to the Selling Stockholders for an aggregate purchase price of 450 under Section 4(2) under the Securities Act.
Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible by the holder thereof for 20 shares of Common Stock of the Company;
provided, however, that the holder is prohibited from converting such number of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
that would result in the stockholder beneficially owning more than 9.9 of the Common Stock of the Company. The holders of the
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall vote only on a share for share basis with our Common Stock on any matter, including
but not limited to, the election of directors, name changes, increases in the authorized common shares and for which such preferred
stock or series has such rights and as otherwise provided by the Nevada law and is superior upon the liquidation of the Company.
On September 26, 2012, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No: 333-184110) therein registering an aggregate of
90,000,000 shares of the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act on behalf of the Selling Stockholder named in the Registration Statement.
We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Common Stock on behalf of the Selling Stockholder. 

Subsequent
Events: 

On
November 7, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared the Registration Statement registering an aggregate of 90,000,000
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of 4,500,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on behalf of the
Selling Stockholder named therein effective under the Securities Act. 

24 

On
November 8, 2012, our Board designated 100 shares of Preferred Stock as Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock 
and we filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada therein designating and establishing
the class of Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock. On November 8, 2012, the Company sold 100 shares of Series B Non-Convertible
Preferred Stock to Virginia K. Sourlis for an aggregate purchase price of 10 under Section 4(2) under the Securities Act. 

The
outstanding shares of Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock shall vote together with the shares of Common Stock and other voting
securities of the Corporation as a single class and, regardless of the number of shares of Series B Non-Convertible Preferred
Stock outstanding and as long as at least one of such shares of Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock is outstanding, shall
represent eighty percent (80 of all votes entitled to be voted at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation
or action by written consent of stockholders. Each outstanding share of the Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock shall represent
its proportionate share of the 80 which is allocated to the outstanding shares of Series B Non-Convertible Preferred Stock.

November 8, 2012, the Company sold a five month promissory note in the principal amount of 193,000 bearing interest at the rate
of 8 per annum. The Company may prepay the outstanding principal and interest of the promissory note without penalty. On
November 9, 2012, the Company redeemed an aggregate of 2,700,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company held by Virginia K. Sourlis
for 189,000.

Referrals
made by our Company to clients may involve certain conflicts of interest between the Company, Ms. Sourlis individually, Ms. Sourlis 
law firm, and the client. We will make every attempt to ensure that all known and possible conflicts of interest are disclosed
to each client upon making such referral and, if not waived by the client, cease working with the client in one or more capacities. 

Our
Company believes that we have formulated a business model to succeed in a downsizing corporate America and a turbulent economy.
We have conducted the necessary due diligence and we believe we tailored a multifaceted business model to compete in the business
services sector. 

Fees 

Revenues
will be derived from fees we will charge our clientele in the form of cash and on a case-by-case basis. In certain favorable circumstances,
we may negotiate with the client and receive all or a portion of payment in the form of equity in such client s company.
We intend to offer clients our comprehensive services for a flat monthly fee, or on a project-by-project la carte 
basis. At no time will we charge any client for referrals of market makers. 

At
the present time, we intend to charge clients a flat rate fee per month for comprehensive services. The amount of the monthly
fee will vary and may increase based on the size and complexity of such client, the amount and skill of work involved, and based
on individual negotiations with a particular client. 

Fees
for clients who elect to retain our services on a project-by-project basis shall be individually negotiated and will vary based
on the size and complexity of such client, the amount and skill of work involved, and with consideration to rates being charged
throughout the industry for similar services. 

Our
fee structure is subject to current market conditions and is therefore subject to change. However, at no point will the client
be unaware of any rate change. 

In
certain situations, we may negotiate with our clients to receive all or a portion of payment owed to us for services rendered
in the form of equity in that client s company. Such determination will be made by our sole officer, Virginia K. Sourlis.
While we generally prefer to receive cash compensation, our officer may believe that certain situations require the receipt of
restricted equity as compensation. Risks associated with receiving restricted equity compensation include, but are not limited
to, 1) problems of liquidity where no market exists for such equity and therefore the Company cannot sell such equity and realize
cash; 2) the client goes out of business and such equity is rendered worthless; 3) the equity is sold for less than the value
of services provided by us to the client. 

We
believe that it is necessary to receive a limited amount of equity in order to hedge the associated risks involved with such form
of payment. However, any loss we experience related to equity compensation could have a material effect on our ability to become
profitable, and in the long term, to continue as a going concern. 

Going
Concern 

At
September 30, 2012, we had 450 in cash on hand and an accumulated deficit of 45,973 and have not generated any revenues to date.
In their report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, our auditors have expressed that there is substantial doubt as to
our ability to continue as a going concern. 

26 

The
future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development
of its planned business. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty. 

The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in
existence. 

Proposed
Milestones to Implement Business Operations 

The
following milestones are based on the estimates made by management. The working capital requirements and the projected milestones
are approximations and subject to adjustments. Our sole Officer and Director, Virginia K. Sourlis, has committed to personally
fund our venture for an indefinite period of time to facilitate our ability to attain the following operational milestones. 

The
funding of the Company by Ms. Sourlis will create a further liability to the Company to be reflected on the Company s financial
statements. Ms. Sourlis commitment to personally fund the Company is not contractual and could cease at any moment in her
sole and absolute discretion. 

If
we begin to generate profits, we will increase our marketing and sales activity accordingly. We estimate generating initial revenues
approximately within the next six to twelve months. The costs associated with operating as a public company are included in our
budget. Management believes that the costs of operating as a public company (as opposed to a private company) could have a material
negative impact on the company s results of operations and liquidity and could place a significant drain on capital resources.
Management will be responsible for the preparation of the required documents to keep the costs to a minimum. We plan to complete
our milestones as follows: 

0-
3 MONTHS 

Management
will continue the word-of-mouth campaign with Individual Proprietors and potential referral candidates. Marketing efforts will
also consist of due diligence on small to large private and going public companies. During this timeframe, we plan to identify
small to large private and going public companies that could use our services. We plan to purchase a computer, programs, and printer
for 2,000 that is budgeted in the Office Equipment and Furniture line item in the Use of Proceeds. We have budgeted 500 in Sales
and Marketing to secure a web domain and research and place an initial deposit with a web designer. The Company has budgeted 2,000
for Sales and Marketing material including brochures and flyers that we expect to finalized during this timeframe. Our goal for
this timeframe continues with initiating due diligence to identify referral source persons and finalizing our short-list of contract
labor. 

4-6
MONTHS 

Savvy
plans to finalize the web site development at an additional cost of 500 budgeted in the Sales and Marketing line item. The Company
plans to continue with the direct marketing and word-of-mouth campaigns. In addition, we plan to establish a direct marketing
campaign to attract business small to large private and going public companies. Most of the expenditures associated with these
efforts will amount to lunches, entertainment and related incidentals. We have budgeted 1,800 in the Sales and Marketing line
item to address the costs. We have budgeted 3,000 in the Salaries/Contractors line item pay our employees/contractors. 

7-9
MONTHS 

The
Company plans to further expand relationships with small to large private and going public companies. By this stage of operations,
we anticipate finding additional potential revenue generating business services that we intend to pursue. We have budgeted 5,000
for targeted and tailored marketing material and related activities. During this period, the Company has budgeted 5,000 for the
salaries of employees and or contractors. Additional planned responsibilities include initiating a two-year overall business plan. 

10-12
MONTHS 

By
the fourth quarter of operations, we expect to begin generating revenues through an established base of clients to sustain operations.
In the Salaries/Contractors budget, we have budgeted 3,000 to pay for any administrative employee expenses incurred as a result
of performing duties for our clients. We have budgeted 3,200 in the Sales and Marketing line item for expenses incurred tailoring
any marketing material to target opportunities and to cover any related expenses. During this timeframe, we plan to analyze our
past nine months of operations including our web sites lead/revenue generating effectiveness. In addition, we plan to evaluate
our need to hire employees or use contract labor. This review of our operations to date will allow the Company to make the necessary
adjustments and changes to further nurture the growth of the Company. In addition, this review will provide valuable information
for finalizing a two-year overall business plan with emphasis on sales and marketing 

Note :
The amounts allocated to each line item in the above milestones are subject to change at the sole discretion of the Company s
management. Any line item amounts not expended completely, as detailed in the Use of Proceeds, shall be held in reserve as working
capital and subject to reallocation to other line item expenditures as required for ongoing operations.

Results
of Operations 

Fiscal
Year Ended September 30, 2012 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 

At
September 30, 2012, our total assets consisted solely of cash on hand which was 450 compared to 4 at September 30, 2011. 

At
September 30, 2012, our total current liabilities were 35,473 and consisted of 9,790 in accounts payable and 25,683 in amounts
due to a related party. As of September 30, 2011, our total current liabilities were 16,760 and consisted of 4,000 in accounts
payable and 12,760 in amounts due to a related party. The accounts payable primarily consist of audit and SEC filing fees as
the Company commenced its SEC reporting requirements after the SEC declared the Company s Registration Statement on Form
S-1 (File No.: 333-16713) on August 12, 2010. 

Our
Total Stockholders Deficit was 35,023 as of September 30, 2012, compared to 16,756 at September 30, 2011. 

Revenues.
 We had no revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011. Since April 30, 2010 (date of inception), we have not realized
any revenues. 

Net
Loss. We had a net loss of 18,717 for the year ended September 30, 2012, compared to 17,413 for the year ended September
30, 2011. The net loss was primarily due to incurred audit and SEC filing fees as the Company commenced its SEC reporting requirements
after the SEC declared the Company s initial S-1 filing effective on August 12, 2010. 

Operating
expenses. Our total operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2012 were 18,717 compared to 17,413 for the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2012. This was primarily comprised of audit and SEC filing fees as the Company commenced its SEC reporting
requirements after the SEC declared the Company s initial S-1 filing effective on August 12, 2010. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
September 30, 2012, we had 450 in cash on hand and an accumulated deficit of 45,973 and have not generated any revenues to date.
In their report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, our auditors have expressed that there is substantial doubt as to
our ability to continue as a going concern. 

To
date, our operations have been funded by Virginia K. Sourlis, our sole officer and director, pursuant to a verbal, non-binding
agreement. Ms. Sourlis has agreed to personally fund the Company s operating and SEC reporting expenses until the Company
can achieve revenues sufficient to sustain its operational and regulatory requirements, of which there can be no assurances. Future
contributions by Ms. Sourlis to the Company, pursuant to the verbal and non-binding agreement, will be reflected on the financial
statements of the Company as current liabilities under due from related party. 

The
Company has also raised money from the public and private sales of its Common Stock. On May 20, 2010, the Company issued a total
of 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock to Ms. Sourlis for aggregate cash consideration of 5,000. Also, on May 27, 2010, the Company
filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No.: 33-167130) with the Securities and Exchange Commission therein registering
under the Securities Act an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock for sale by the Company for 0.10 per share. The SEC
declared the Registration Statement effective on August 12, 2010 The Offering was conducted on a best efforts 
basis by the Company s officers and directors. On November 15, 2010, the Company closed on the sale of 50,000 shares of
Common Stock pursuant to the Registration Statement and subsequently terminated the Offering effective November 16, 2010. The
Company received 5,000 in gross proceeds from the Offering. On September 27, 2012, the Company filed a Post-Effective Amendment
No. 1 to the Registration Statement to remove from registration the 1,950,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company which were
registered under the Securities Act pursuant to the Registration Statement but were not sold in the offering. 

On
September 25, 2012, we sold 4,500,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for 0.0001 per share, generating proceeds
of 450.00. These securities qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act since the issuance securities by
us did not involve a public offering. The offering was not a public offering as defined in Section 4(2) due to the
insubstantial number of persons involved in the deal, size of the offering, manner of the offering and number of securities offered.
The Company did not undertake an offering in which we sold a high number of securities to a high number of investors. In addition,
these stockholders had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since they agreed to and received share certificates
bearing a legend stating that such securities are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act. This restriction ensures
that these securities would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a public offering. 
Based on an analysis of the above factors, the Company has met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of
the Securities Act for this transaction. 

On
September 26, 2012, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No: 333-184110) therein registering an aggregate of 90,000,000
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the 4,500,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock sold by the
Company on September 25, 2012. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Common Stock by the Selling Stockholder named
in the Registration Statement. On November 7, 2012, the Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC. 

We
believe that we will start to generate revenue within the next 12 months and that we will need at least 200,000 to sustain our
operations during such period. 

28 

As
stated above and throughout this Annual Report, in certain situations, we may negotiate with our clients to receive all or a portion
of payment owed to us for services rendered in the form of equity in that client s company. Such determination will be made
by our sole officer, Virginia K. Sourlis. While we generally prefer to receive cash compensation, our officer may believe that
certain situations require the receipt of restricted equity as compensation. Risks associated with receiving restricted equity
compensation include, but are not limited to, 1) problems of liquidity where no market exists for such equity and therefore the
Company cannot sell such equity and realize cash; 2) the client goes out of business and such equity is rendered worthless; 3)
the equity is sold for less than the value of services provided by us to the client. 

We
believe that it is necessary to receive a limited amount of equity in order to hedge the associated risks involved with such form
of payment. However, any loss we experience related to equity compensation could have a material effect on our ability to generate
revenues, become profitable, and to continue as a going concern. 

Off
-Balance Sheet Operations 

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet operations. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
(US GAAP) for financial information and in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation S-X. They
reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of the Company s management, necessary for a fair presentation of the
financial position and operating results as of and for the period April 30, 2010 (date of inception) to September 30, 2012. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results may differ significantly
from those estimates. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2012, the Company maintained one bank account with a financial
institution located in New Jersey. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
fair value of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximates the carrying amount of these financial instruments due
to their short maturity. 

Net
Loss per Share Calculation 

Basic
net loss per common share EPS is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per shares is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the
weighted average shares outstanding, assuming all dilutive potential common shares were issued. 

Revenue
Recognition 

For
the period April 30, 2010 (inception) to September 30, 2012, the Company did not realize any revenue. 

Income
Taxes 

Income
taxes are provided for using the liability method of accounting. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary
differences between financial and tax reporting. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management,
it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are adjusted for the effect of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

November 29, 2012 

Board of Directors 

 Savvy Business Support, Inc. 

 130 Maple Ave., Suite 9B2 

 Red Bank, NJ 07701 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Savvy Business
Support, Inc. a development stage Company as of September 30, 2012 and 2011 and the related statements of operations,
stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2012 , 2011 and since inception. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration
of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2012, 2011 and since inception, and
the results of its operations and changes in stockholders deficit and its cash flows for the years ended September 30,
2012, 2011, and since inception, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

As discussed in Note 7 of the notes to the accompanying financial
statements, the financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company
has a net loss of 18,717) and net cash used in operations of 15,927) for the year ended September 30, 2012, and a working
capital deficit of 35,023) and stockholder s deficit of 35,023) at September 30, 2012. These conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regards to these matters is
also described in Note 7. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty.

NOTE
1 - Organization 

Savvy
Business Support, Inc. the Company was incorporated in State of Nevada on April 30, 2010. 

The
Company is a development stage business consulting company with a principal business of offering general business services/support
to start-up companies, small and medium business planning to expand, individuals, and other businesses and organizations. 

NOTE
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
(US GAAP) for financial information and in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation S-X. They
reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of the Company s management, necessary for a fair presentation of the
financial position and operating results as of September 30, 2012, September 30, 2011 and for the period April 30, 2010 (date
of inception) to September 30, 2012. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results may differ significantly
from those estimates. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2012, the Company maintained one bank account with a financial
institution located in New Jersey. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
fair value of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximates the carrying amount of these financial instruments due
to their short maturity. 

Net
Loss per Share Calculation 

Basic
net loss per common share EPS is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per shares is computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average shares outstanding, assuming all dilutive potential common shares were issued. 

Revenue
Recognition 

For
the period April 30, 2010 (inception) to September 30, 2012, the Company did not realize any revenue 

Income
Taxes 

Income
taxes are provided for using the liability method of accounting. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary
differences between financial and tax reporting. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management,
it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are adjusted for the effect of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

As
of September 30, 2012, the Company operated out of the premises of The Sourlis Law Firm offices on a rent-free basis for administrative

NOTE
4 Preferred Stock 

As
of September 30, 2012, the Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value of 0.0001 per share
of which 4,500,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock was issued and outstanding. 

Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock 

On
September 24, 2012, the Company s Board designated 4,500,000 shares of Preferred Stock as Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock and filed a Certificate of Designations with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. 

On
September 25, 2012, the Company sold an aggregate of 4,500,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to one individual
for 0.0001 per share thereby generating proceeds of 450.00. The Company sold these securities under Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), since the sale by did not involve a public offering of securities.
The offering was not a public offering as defined in Section 4(2) due to the insubstantial number of persons involved
in the deal, size of the offering, manner of the offering and number of securities offered. The Company did not undertake an offering
in which it sold a high number of securities to a high number of investors. In addition, the investor represented that he had
the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) and agreed to and received share certificates bearing a legend stating
that such securities are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act. This restriction ensures that these securities
would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a public offering. Based on
an analysis of the above factors, the Company has met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act for this transaction. 

NOTE
5 Common Stock 

As
of September 30, 2012, the Company was authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value of 0.0001 per share
of which 5,055,000 shares of Common Stock was issued and outstanding. 

On
May 11, 2011, the Company issued 5,000 shares of common stock for services rendered to the Company. These common shares were valued

public offering at 0.10 per share. 

On
May 20, 2010, the Company raised 5,000 from the sale of 5,000,000 common shares of the Company to the founder.

NOTE
6 Income Taxes 

The
Company utilizes the asset and liability method for financial accounting and reporting accounting of income taxes. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and
liabilities, and are measured by applying enacted rates and laws to taxable years in which such differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. Any changes in tax rates or laws are recognized in the period when such changes are enacted. 

As
of September 30, 2012, the Company has 17,929 in gross deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carry-forwards.
A valuation allowance has been recorded to fully offset these deferred tax assets because the Company s management believer
future realization of the related income tax benefits is uncertain. Accordingly, the net provision for income taxes is zero for
the period April 30, 2010 (inception) to September 30, 2012. As of September 30, 2012, the Company has federal net operating loss
carry forwards of 45,973 available to offset future taxable income through 2031, subject to the change in control provisions
under the Internal Revenue Code. 

The
difference between the tax provision at the statutory federal income tax rate on September 30, 2012 and the tax provision attributable
to loss before income taxes is as follows: 

For the period 

April 30, 2010 

(inception) through 

September 30, 2012 

Statutory federal income taxes 
 34.0 
 
 State taxes, net of federal benefits 
 5.0 
 
 Valuation allowance 
 -39.0 
 
 Effective income tax rate

As
of September 30, 2012, the Company has tax reporting requirements to the Internal Revenue Service, the State of Nevada and to
the State of New Jersey. 

NOTE
7 Going Concern 

As
of September 30, 2012, the accompanying financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern in the
development stage, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

For
the period from April 30, 2010 (inception) to September 30, 2012, the Company incurred losses of 45,973 primarily consisting
of legal and professional fees for the Company to maintain its SEC reporting requirements. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future operations
from the development of its planned business as well as to raise additional capital from the sale of common stock and, ultimately,
the achievement of significant operating revenues. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
be required should the Company be unable to recover the value of its assets or satisfy its liabilities.

NOTE
9 Contingencies and Commitments Legal Proceedings 

On
February 10, 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission amended its complaint in SEC v. Greenstone Holdings, Inc., et al.,
10 civ. 1302 (S.D.N.Y.), to add as a defendant Virginia K. Sourlis, our Principal Executive and Principal Financial and Accounting
Officer. The amended complaint alleged that Ms. Sourlis violated Sections 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities
Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder
and aided and abetted defendant Greenstone s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.
The SEC is seeking injunctive relief and financial penalties, disgorgement, and a penny stock bar from Ms. Sourlis. 

On
November 20, 2012, the Court granted partial summary judgment (on liability only) against Ms. Sourlis for aiding and abetting
the defendants 10b violation; however, Ms. Sourlis intends to file an appeal at the conclusion of the case. At the hearing,
the Court also denied the SEC s motion for summary judgment regarding its 10b primary liability claim against Ms. Sourlis.
The Court also reserved decision on the SEC s non-fraud claim that Ms. Sourlis violated Section 5 of the Securities
Act; but rather asked for further briefing regarding the SEC s aiding and abetting claim under Section 5. 

On
the basis of the Court s November 20 liability holding, the SEC intends to seek from the Court against Ms. Sourlis injunctive
relief, financial penalties, disgorgement, and a penny stock bar. In the event the Commission prevails in its charges against
Ms. Sourlis and successfully prevents Ms. Sourlis from deriving income from practicing securities law for a given period of time,
our Company s operations and financial position would be adversely affected due to the fact that Ms. Sourlis currently has
a verbal non-binding agreement with the Company to fund its operations for an indefinite period of time. Also, if the SEC prevails,
it would be more difficult for the Company to attract investors and/or business partners, which would have a material adverse
effect on the Company s business and operations, due to the fact that Ms. Sourlis is the sole director and officer (President,
Chief Executive Officer) of the Company and the very nature of the Company s business is to provide consulting services
to start-up companies and public companies on various matters, from entity formation and financing structures to support for filing
FINRA s Form 211 and complying with SEC regulations. If the SEC prevails and prevent Ms. Sourlis from practicing securities
law for a significant amount of time, it would in effect put the Company out of business unless the Company can retain new qualified
employees, of which there can be no assurances that it will be able to do so.

Item
9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 

None 

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our sole officer, sole director, Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
and Accounting Officer, Ms. Virginia K. Sourlis, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of the fiscal year ended September
30, 2012 (the Evaluation Date ). 

Based
upon that evaluation, our Management has concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective. 

Management
has identified specific remedial actions to cure our disclosure controls and procedures: 

Improve
 the
 effectiveness
 of
 the
 accounting
 group
 by
 augmenting
 our
 existing
 resources
 with
 additional
 consultants
 or
 employees
 to
 improve
 segregation
 procedures
 and
 to
 assist
 in
 the
 analysis
 and
 recording
 of
 complex
 accounting
 transactions
 and
 preparation
 of
 tax
 disclosures.
 We
 plan
 to
 mitigate
 the
 segregation
 of
 duties
 issues
 by
 hiring
 additional
 personnel
 in
 the
 accounting
 department
 once
 we
 have
 achieved
 positive
 cash
 flow
 from
 operations,
 and/or
 have
 raised
 significant
 additional
 working
 capital. 

Improve
 segregation
 procedures
 by
 strengthening
 cross
 approval
 of
 various
 functions
 including
 cash
 disbursements
 and
 quarterly
 internal
 audit
 procedures
 where
 appropriate. 

Since
the recited remedial actions will require that we hire or engage additional personnel, these material weaknesses may not be overcome
in the near term due to our limited financial resources. Until such remedial actions can be realized, we will continue to rely
on the advice of outside professionals and consultants. 

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

(a)
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrant s annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Our
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of September 30, 2012. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of The Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on that assessment
under such criteria, management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September
30, 2012 due to control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses. 

Our
Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial and Accounting Officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
had the following material weaknesses: 

We
 were
 unable
 to
 maintain
 any
 segregation
 of
 duties
 within
 our
 financial
 operations
 due
 to
 our
 reliance
 on
 limited
 personnel
 in
 the
 finance
 function.
 While
 this
 control
 deficiency
 did
 not
 result
 in
 any
 audit
 adjustments
 to
 our
 2012
 interim
 or
 annual
 financial
 statements,
 it
 could
 have
 resulted
 in
 a
 material
 misstatement
 that
 might
 have
 been
 prevented
 or
 detected
 by
 a
 segregation
 of
 duties. 

The
 Company
 lacks
 sufficient
 resources
 to
 perform
 the
 internal
 audit
 function
 and
 the
 Company s
 Board
 of
 Directors
 does
 not
 have
 a
 standing
 Audit
 Committee; 

31 

We
 do
 not
 have
 an
 independent
 Board
 of
 Directors,
 nor
 do
 we
 have
 a
 board
 member
 designated
 as
 an
 independent
 financial
 expert
 for
 the
 Company.
 The
 Board
 of
 Directors
 is
 comprised
 of
 one
 (1)
 member
 of
 management.
 As
 a
 result,
 there
 may
 be
 lack
 of
 independent
 oversight
 of
 the
 management
 team,
 lack
 of
 independent
 review
 of
 our
 operating
 and
 financial
 results,
 and
 lack
 of
 independent
 review
 of
 disclosures
 made
 by
 the
 Company;
 and 

Documentation
 of
 all
 proper
 accounting
 procedures
 is
 not
 yet
 complete. 

To
the extent reasonably possible given our limited resources, we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned material weaknesses,
including, but not limited to, the following: 

Considering
 the
 engagement
 of
 consultants
 to
 assist
 in
 ensuring
 that
 accounting
 policies
 and
 procedures
 are
 consistent
 across
 the
 organization
 and
 that
 we
 have
 adequate
 control
 over
 financial
 statement
 disclosures; 

Hiring
 additional
 qualified
 financial
 personnel
 including
 a
 Chief
 Financial
 Officer
 on
 a
 full-time
 basis; 

Expanding
 our
 current
 Board
 of
 Directors
 to
 include
 additional
 independent
 individuals
 willing
 to
 perform
 directorial
 functions
 and
 to
 establish
 a
 standing
 Audit
 Committee
 comprised
 of
 an
 independent
 directors;
 and 

Increasing
 our
 workforce
 in
 preparation
 for
 exiting
 the
 development
 stage
 and
 commencing
 revenue
 producing
 operations. 

We
are in the process of developing and implementing remediation plans to address our material weaknesses in the Company s
internal controls. 

Due
to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems,
no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

Changes
in Controls and Procedures 

There
were no significant changes made in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2012
that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect these controls. 

Attestation
Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting.

Section
16(A) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than 10 of a registered
class of our equity securities to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission initial statements of beneficial ownership,
reports of changes in ownership and annual reports concerning their ownership of our common shares and other equity securities,
on Forms 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10 stockholders are required by the Securities
and Exchange Commission regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based on our review of the
copies of such forms received by us, and to the best of our knowledge, all executive officers, directors and greater than 10 
stockholders filed the required reports in a timely manner. 

Employment
Agreements 

None 

Audit,
Nominating and Compensation Committees 

Our
Board of Directors has not formally established separate audit, nominating or compensation committees though they perform many
of the functions that would otherwise be delegated to such committees. Currently, our Board of Directors believes that the cost
of establishing such committees, including the costs necessary to recruit and retain qualified independent directors to serve
on our Board of Directors and such committees and the legal costs to properly form and document the authority, policies and procedures
of such committees are not justified under our current circumstances. However, we anticipate that our Board of Directors will
seek qualified independent directors to serve on the Board and ultimately form standing nominating and compensation committees
and nominate other directors to serve on its audit committee. 

Code
of Ethics 

Our
Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Ethics.

Related
Party and Certain Transactions 

There
have been no related-party transactions, or any other transactions or relationships required to be disclosed pursuant to Item
404 of Regulation S-K. 

Director
Independence 

Our
determination of independence of our directors is made using the definition of independent director contained under
Rule 5065(a) (2) of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, even though such definitions do not currently apply to us because we are not
listed on NASDAQ. None of the members of our Board of Directors qualify as independent pursuant to this Rule. 

35 

Indemnification 

Pursuant
to the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to
any proceeding, including a law suit, because of his position, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed
to be in our best interest. In certain cases, we may advance expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding. To the extent
that the officer or director is successful on the merits in any such proceeding as to which such person is to be indemnified,
we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorney s fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity
may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is
judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the
State of Nevada. 

Insofar
as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling
persons pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable. 

In
the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid
by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted
by one of our directors, officers, or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in
the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
the question whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed
by the final adjudication of such issue.

Maker
will be in default under this Note if (i) Maker fails to make a payment of principal and/or interest hereunder when due; or (ii)
Maker breaches any other covenant or agreement under this Note; or (iii) Maker defaults under any other provision of this Note
or under any guarantee or other agreement providing security for the payment of this Note; or (iv) Maker breaches any representation
or warranty under this Note or any such guarantee or other agreement; or (v) there occurs the liquidation, dissolution, death
or incompetency of the Maker or any individual, corporation, partnership or other entity guaranteeing or providing security for

The Holder s remedies provided in this Note shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available to the Holder
under this Note, at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief), no remedy of
the Holder contained herein shall be deemed a waiver of compliance with the provisions giving rise to such remedy and nothing
herein shall limit the Holder s right to pursue actual damages for any failure by the Maker to comply with the terms of
this Note. No remedy conferred under this Note upon the Holder is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy available to the
Holder, pursuant to the terms of this Note or otherwise. No single or partial exercise by the Holder of any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof. The failure of the Holder to exercise any right or remedy under
this Note or otherwise, or delay in exercising such right or remedy, shall not operate as a waiver thereof. Every right and remedy
of the Holder under any document executed in connection with this transaction may be exercised from time to time and as often
as may be deemed expedient by the Holder. The Maker acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable
harm to the Holder and that the remedy at law for any such breach may be inadequate. The Maker therefore agrees that, in the event
of any such breach or threatened breach, the Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to an injunction
restraining any breach, and specific performance without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other
security being required.
