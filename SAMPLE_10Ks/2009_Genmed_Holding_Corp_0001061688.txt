FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ; This annual report contains certain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, that involve risks and uncertainties. In addition, Genmed Holding
Corp., (formerly Satellite Newspapers Corp.) (the Company ), may from time to
time make oral forward-looking statements. Actual results are uncertain and may
be impacted by many factors. In particular, certain risks and uncertainties that
may impact the accuracy of the forward-looking statements with respect to
revenues, expenses and operating results include without imitation; cycles of
customer orders, general economic and competitive conditions and changing
customer trends, technological advances and the number and timing of new product
introductions, shipments of products and components from foreign suppliers, and
changes in the mix of products ordered by customers. As a result, the actual
results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements. 

Because
of these and other factors that may affect the Company s operating results, past
financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future
performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate
results or trends in future periods. 

Summary 

The
Company is actively seeking to develop its business of the sale and distribution
of generic drugs through its wholly owned subsidiary Genmed B.V. 

Previous
Operations General 

Genmed
Holding Corp. was originally formed as Beck Co., Inc., a Nevada
corporation on April 14, 1998, to operate as a specialty retailer of fine
jewelry. Subsequent to its formation, the Company engaged in several
acquisitions, name changes, and changes in the Company s
operations. From July 29, 2000 until August 27, 2002, the Company
developed fuel cell technologies for commercial and industrial use as GreenVolt
Corp., an Ontario, Canada corporation. On August 27, 2002, Satellite
Holdings, Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of Turks Caicos,
acquired a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company,
and on August 28, 2002, the Company changed its name to Satellite Enterprises
Corp. 

On June
20, 2003, the Company entered into a Rights Agreement with Satellite Newspapers
Worldwide NV, a corporation organized under the laws of The Netherlands
(hereinafter, Satellite Newspapers whereby the Company was the exclusive
distributor to promote the sale and/or lease of Satellite Newspapers newspaper
kiosks and the associated content distribution technology for which Satellite
Newspapers had developed the technology and owned the patents. In
October 2003, Satellite Newspapers sold its patents, software and trademarks to
Media Finance en Suisse Holding GmbH, a Swiss corporation (hereinafter, Media
Finance ). Thereafter, Media Finance set up an operating subsidiary, Satellite
Newspapers Suisse GmbH, a Swiss corporation (hereinafter, Satellite Swiss ).
Media Finance granted Satellite Swiss a twenty-year exclusive license to
distribute all satellite derived contents for the purpose of commercializing
their product under a revenue sharing arrangement and on November 26, 2003, the
Company entered into a Stock Purchase Option Agreement with Media Finance for
the purchase of 100 of Satellite Swiss. On February 15, 2004, the Company
exercised its option and acquired 100 of Satellite Swiss. Satellite Swiss
consisted of two subsidiaries, Satellite Newspapers Content BV, a Dutch
corporation, and Satellite Newspapers Trading BV, a Dutch corporation, which had
the production rights to produce and sell the kiosks. 

In June
2005, Swiss Satellite incorporated two new Swiss subsidiary entities. Satellite
Newspapers Content GmbH and Satellite Newspapers Trading GmbH. Except for the
Development and Network Management, the Swiss Companies took over all activities
from the Dutch Companies. On November 30, 2005, the Company changed its name
from Satellite Enterprises Corp. to Satellite Newspapers Corp. and the Company s
quotation symbol on the OTC Bulletin Board changed from SENR to
SNWP. 

On
October 1, 2006, Satellite Newspapers Suisse GmbH, Satellite Newspapers Content
GmbH, Satellite Newspapers Trading GmbH, the Swiss operating company s of
Satellite, ceased operations. Such companies were unable to fund their ongoing
operations and cover their expenses. From October 1, 2006 to April 17,
2008, the Company has had no operations and generated no revenue. On January 23,
2007, Satellite Newspapers Suisse GmbH, Satellite Newspapers Content GmbH, and
Satellite Newspapers Trading GmbH were declared bankrupt by the court in Zug,
Switzerland.

On March
21, 2007, the Company executed a Memorandum Agreement with International
Creative Property Belgium, N.V. and Andreas Yanakopoulos ICPB ), an
operator and provider of elderly care services in Belgium. Under such
Memorandum Agreement, the Company agreed to purchase from ICPB, subject to due
diligence by all parties, all of the operations of ICPB including certain
properties, land, and operations. On August 20, 2007, after conducting its due
diligence, the Company rejected the March 21, 2007 Memorandum Agreement
executed with ICPC. 

On October 22, 2007, the Company's
board of directors and majority of its shareholders approved by means of a
written resolution to effect a 2000-to-1 reverse stock split of the Company's
issued and outstanding common stock, par value .001 per share, pursuant to
which each two thousand (2000) shares of the Company s issued and outstanding
Common Stock would be combined and consolidated into one share of common stock
and to authorize the board of directors of the Company to amend its Articles of
Incorporation by issuing, without further shareholder action, one or more series
of preferred stock from its authorized 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. On
January 28, 2008, the reverse stock split of the Company became
effective. 

On December 12, 2007, the Company's
board of directors and majority of its shareholders approved a change of the
Company s corporate name from Satellite Newspapers Corp. to Genmed Holding Corp.
by filing an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of
State of the State of Nevada on December 12, 2007. 

On April 17, 2008, the Company
acquired, by a Stock Exchange Agreement, GenMed B.V. Genmed B.V. ), a company
organized in The Netherlands, which is engaged in the production and
distribution of generic drugs. Genmed B.V. maintains a network of
manufacturing and distribution relationships in The Netherlands, Belgium,
Luxembourg, United Kingdon, Ireland, Germany and France as well as some other
countries located outside the European Union to supply low cost generic drugs to
retail chains. Genmed B.V. s most popular product is Paracetamol
(acetaminophen), a generic form of Tylenol. Genmed B.V. currently has
distribution contracts with retail chains in The Netherlands, and is seeking
contracts with retail chains and government agencies and multi-national
corporations. 

Genmed is
currently seeking to develop its business of the sale and distribution of
generic drugs through its wholly owned subsidiary Genmed B.V. 

Governmental
Regulation 

The Company is, and will continue to
be, subject to several and varying governmental regulations. In general, as a
generic drug seller and distributor, the Company is subject it to
environmental, public health and safety, land use, trade and other governmental
regulations, and national, state, or local taxation or tariffs. The
Company s management will endeavor to ascertain and comply with all applicable
to the business of the Company. However, it may not be possible to predict with
any degree of accuracy all applicable regulations or the impact of government
regulation, and, compliance with such regulation will require certain efforts
and resources of the Company. 

Employees 

The Company presently has no employees
other than its officers. Management of the Company expects to use consultants,
attorneys, and accountants as necessary, and does not anticipate a need to
engage any full-time employees until absolutely necessary for the operations of
the Company. The need for employees and their availability will be addressed in
connection with the scope and requirements of the operations of the
Company. 

Risk
Factors 

Financial position of the Company,
working capital deficit; report of independent auditors. The Company
generated a minimum on revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008. The
Company, which is in a startup Company is currently developing its business of
the sale and distribution of generic drugs and strives to start generating
revenues through the sales of generic drugs in 2009. The Company makes no
assurances that the Company will generate sufficient revenues through its
operations and be able to continue as a going concern. 

4 

The independent accountant s report on
the Company s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008,
contains an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data, herein. 

Risks of
Leverage. The Company has, and likely will continue to, incur
substantial borrowings, notes, debentures, and/or other Company debt for the
purpose of developing Company operations and for financing the expansion and
growth of the Company, including the possible acquisition of other
companies. Any amounts borrowed will depend among other things, on
the condition of financial markets. Acquisitions of equipment,
vehicles, or other companies purchased on a leveraged basis generally can be
expected to be profitable only if they generate, at a minimum, sufficient cash
revenues to pay interest on, and to amortize, the related debt, to cover
operating expenses and to recover the equity investment. The use of
leverage, under certain circumstances, may provide a higher return to the
shareholders but will cause the risk of loss to the shareholders to be greater
than if the Company did not borrow, because fixed payment obligations must be
met on certain specified dates regardless of the amount of revenues derived by
the Company. If debt service payments are not made when due, the
Company may sustain the loss of its equity investment in the assets securing the
debt as a result of foreclosure by the secured lender. Interest
payable on Company borrowings, if any, may vary with the movement of the
interest rates charged by banks to their prime commercial
customers. An increase in borrowing costs due to a rise in the
 prime or base rates may reduce the amount of Company income and cash
availability for dividends. 

Competition. Genmed hopes to
provide the Eastern European and European countries with generic drugs at lower
prices than other suppliers. To do this, the Company intends to make agreements
with manufacturers outside the EU who produce drugs that meet EU and FDA
standards. Such manufacturers are able to offer a complete assortment of drugs,
and their factory sales prices are considerably lower than those of the generics
that are being sold in the EU at this moment. Because of this, Genmed
hopes to have a strong price advantage over its competitors. 

We expect to conduct our business with
a low overhead, lower than that of the other companies in this market. This is
possible because Genmed will execute its affairs as much as possible as an
agency in order to keep its costs low. The main activity of the agency is to
provide the registration requirements and quality control. Our buyers will take
care of the logistics, storage and marketing. Genmed will take a fee for the
registration ownership of the drugs and a commission on the delivered goods. In
the many pharmaceutical markets, this is a unique business model.

3. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS 

From time
to time, the Company may be a party to litigation or other legal proceedings
that we consider to be part of the ordinary course of our business. 

On May
2004, Fred de Vries and Renato Mariani filed suit in the Fifteenth Judicial
Circuit Court located in Palm Beach County, Florida, claiming breach of
employment agreements against the Company and against the Company s Chief
Executive Officer claiming fraud. Such lawsuit was ultimately settled by
agreement, the terms of which were completed in July 2007. See the Company s
Form 10-KSB for the year ended 2007, incorporated herein by
reference. 

The
Company has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court of
the 11 th 
Judicial Circuit in Miami-Dade County, Florida, Case No. 08-79227CA25. The
Company s former Chief Executive Officer, Jerri Palmer, has instigated the
lawsuit against the Company alleging Breach of Contract and Unjust
Enrichment. Ms. Palmer is claiming damages in excess of 15,000. Ms.
Palmer was the Company s Chief Executive Officer from December 5, 2005, until
her resignation on May 19, 2006. The Company believes that Ms. Palmer s claims
are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself. The Company has
alleged counter claims against Ms. Palmer for breach of contract and breach of
fiduciary duty.

Debentures 

Media Finance en Suisse Holding GmbH.
 On March 31, 2006, the Company s subsidiary Satellite Newspapers Suisse
GmbH of Zug, Switzerland entered into a binding Secured Debenture Purchase
Agreement whereby the Company sold 2,700,000 original principal amount of
Series A Premium Secured Convertible Debenture (the Debenture and its two
subsidiaries Satellite Newspapers Content BV and Satellite Newspapers Trading
BV, to Media Finance en Suisse Holding GmbH, for a total aggregate consideration
of Two Million Seven Hundred Thousand 2,700,000) U.S. Dollars. The Debentures
are in the principal amounts of two million seven hundred thousand 2,700,000)
US Dollars, bear interest at the annual rate of Eight (8 Percent, and are
convertible into the shares of common stock of the Company at the conversion
rate of 0.005 per share or 50 of the market price if the stock trades below

convertible debentures into Class A Preferred Stock of the Company. The

individuals related to a former Chief Executive Officer at various times for
working capital and to fund required operating expenses. Such advances are
unsecured and bear interest as the rate of 8 per year. The amount
outstanding including unpaid interest as of December 31, 2008 and December 31,
2007 aggregate 861,891 and 587,533, respectively.

granted options to purchase 24,309,000 shares of the Company's common stock to
consultants with an exercise price of 0.06 per share. Such options
vested immediately and will expire five years from the issuance
date. The options had a fair value of 244,692 based upon the
Black-Scholes options pricing model. The compensation associated with
these options was expensed in 2004. As adjusted for the Company s
2000-to-1 reverse stock split of January 28, 2008, the Company s common stock
options of December 1, 2004 equal 12,154 shares of the Company s common stock

12,154 shares of its common stock pursuant to such options, and, at December 31,

Pacific, to purchase 1,050,000 shares of the Company's common stock, and to its
wholly owned Dutch subsidiary, Satellite Newspapers Trading B.V., to purchase
2,900,000 shares of the Company's common stock. Such Regional
Distributor and subsidiary were dissolved without exercising their options and
such options were cancelled by the Company.

Overview 

On
October 1, 2006, Satellite Newspapers Suisse GmbH, Satellite Newspapers Content
GmbH, Satellite Newspapers Trading GmbH, the Swiss operating companys of
Satellite Newspapers, ceased operations. Such companies were unable to fund
their ongoing operations and cover their expenses. On January 23, 2007,
such companies were declared bankrupt by the court in Zug,
Switzerland. 

On December 12, 2007, the Company's
board of directors and majority of its shareholders approved a change of the
Company s corporate name from Satellite Newspapers Corp. to Genmed Holding Corp.
by filing an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of
State of the State of Nevada on December 12, 2007. 

On April 17, 2008, the Company
acquired, by a Stock Exchange Agreement, GenMed B.V. Genmed B.V. ), a company
organized in The Netherlands, which is engaged in the production and
distribution of generic drugs. Genmed B.V. maintains a network of
manufacturing and distribution relationships in The Netherlands, Belgium,
Luxembourg, United Kingdon, Ireland, Germany and France as well as some other
countries located outside the European Union, to supply low cost generic drugs
to retail chains. Genmed B.V. s most popular product is Paracetamol
(acetaminophen), a generic form of Tylenol. Genmed B.V. currently has
distribution contracts with retail chains in The Netherlands, and is seeking
contracts with retail chains and government agencies and multi-national
corporations. 

Genmed is
currently seeking to develop its business of the sale and distribution of
generic drugs through its wholly owned subsidiary Genmed B.V.

Results
of Operations 

Comparison of the Years
Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 

Revenues. The
Company had minimal sales and revenues during the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2008 and no sales or revenues during the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2007. The lack of sales in 2007 is a result of the Company
ceasing its prior operations in 2006, Company was seeking a business acquisition
in 2007, and because the Company has been seeking to develop its generic drug
sale and distribution business in 2008 and through the present. 

Selling, General, and Administrative
Expenses. The Company incurred selling, general, and administrative
expenses of 18,155,509 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 compared
to 244,008 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. Such
increase was due primarily to the warrants that have been issued and expensed
pursuant to the General Release and Settlement Agreement dated April 17,
2008. 

Impairment of Goodwill. The
Company incurred 19,745,570 in impairment of goodwill during the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2008, compared to no such impairment during the fiscal year

year ended December 31, 2008, compared to no such impairment during the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2007. Such new
depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily due to the depreciation on
the Medical Registration Rights, an asset that was acquired through the purchase
of Genmed B.V., our Dutch subsidiary. 

Research and
Development. The
Company incurred 78,305 in Research and Development expenses during the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to no such comparable expenses during

business acquisition in 2007.

Expenses. The Company incurred selling, general, and administrative

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
December 31, 2008, we had a working capital deficit of 1,854,465). As a result
of our working capital deficit, our auditors have raised, in their current audit
report, a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We
will be unable to continue as a going concern in the event we are not able to
raise capital and are successful in seeking a business acquisition. Until such
time as sufficient capital is raised, we intend to limit expenditures for
capital assets and other expense categories. 

The Company must currently rely on
corporate officers, directors and outside investors in order to meet its budget.
If the Company is unable to obtain financing from any of one of these
aforementioned sources, the Company would not be able to complete its financial
obligations. Limited commitments to provide additional funds have been made by
management and other shareholders. We cannot provide any assurance that any
additional funds will be made available on acceptable terms or at
all. 

Cash
Flows 

Net cash
used in operating activities was 258,239) for the year ended December 31, 2008
and 413,305) for the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was primarily
due to the impairment of goodwill accounted from in FYE 2008 and stock based
compensation. 

Net cash
provided by financing activities was 268,465 and 403,415 for the year ended
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The net cash provided by financing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 consisted primarily of loans
provided by an individual related to the Company s Chief Executive
Officer. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We have
no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a
current or future material effect on us.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Board of
Directors 

 Genmed
Holding Corp. 

 Amsterdam,
The Netherlands 

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Genmed Holding Corp. and
subsidiaries (formerly Satellite Newspapers Corp.) as of December 31, 2008 and
2007 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity
(deficit), and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December
31, 2008. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December
31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note A to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of
 53,671,911 since inception and had losses from continuing operations and
negative working capital in 2008 and 2007. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans regarding those matters are also described in Note A. The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 DECEMBER
31, 2008 

NOTE
A - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND GOING CONCERN 

Nature of
Business 

Genmed
Holding Corp. GENM or the Company through its wholly owned Dutch subsidiary
is focusing on the delivery of low cost generic medicines directly to
distribution chains throughout the world. Generic medicines, which become
available when the originator medicines patents has expired, are, due to
continuing governmental pressure and new insurance policies, increasingly used
as equally effective alternatives to higher-priced originator pharmaceuticals by
general practitioners, specialists and hospitals. 

Going
Concern 

As shown
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred
cumulative net losses of 53,671,911 
since inception, had losses from continuing operations of 38,756,676 and
 342,704 in 2008 and 2007 and has negative working capital of
 1,854,465. Management's plans include the raising of capital through
the equity markets to fund future operations and the generating of revenue
through its business. Failure to raise adequate capital and generate
adequate sales revenues could result in the Company having to curtail or cease
operations. Additionally, even if the Company does raise sufficient
capital to support its operating expenses and generate adequate revenues, there
can be no assurance that the revenue will be sufficient to enable it to develop
business to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from
operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. However, the accompanying financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the
realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern. 

NOTE
B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Consolidated Financial
Statements 

The
consolidated financial statements include the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances
have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of
Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 

Foreign Currency
Translation 

The
Company considers the EURO to be its functional
currency. Assets and liabilities were translated into US dollars US as of December 31, 2008 at the period end exchange rate of 1.00 to US 
1.4097. Statement of Operations amounts for the year ended December
31, 2008 were translated using the average rates during the periods of 1.00 to
US 1.47134. For the year ended December 31, 2007 all amounts were recorded in
US Dollars and no currency exchange rates were used. Gains and losses resulting
from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in other
comprehensive loss, a separate component of stockholders' deficit. 

Cash
Equivalents 

For
purposes of reporting cash flows, cash equivalents include investment
instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less. There
were no cash equivalents in 2008 or 2007. 

Net Loss Per Common
Share 

The
Company computes per share amounts in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share . SFAS No.
128 requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is
computed by dividing the income (loss) available to Common
Stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of shares
of Common Stock and Common Stock equivalents outstanding during the
periods.

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 DECEMBER
31, 2008 

Comprehensive
Income 

SFAS No.
130 establishes standards for the reporting and disclosure of comprehensive
income and its components which will be presented in association with a
company's financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as
the change in a business enterprise's equity during a period arising from
transactions, events or circumstances relating to non-owner sources, such as
foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on
available-for-sale securities. It includes all changes in equity
during a period except those resulting from investments by or distributions to
owners. Comprehensive income is accumulated in accumulated other
comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' deficit, in the
balance sheet. 

Stock Based
Compensation 

SFAS No.
123(R), which is a revision of the SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation , prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stock-based
compensation plans, including employee stock options, restricted stock, employee
stock purchase plans and stock appreciation rights. SFAS No. 123R
requires employee compensation expense to be recorded using the fair value
method. 

The
Company accounts for stock issued for services using the fair value method. In
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 96-18, the measurement date
of shares issued for services is the date at which the counterparty's
performance is complete. 

Revenue
Recognition 

For the
year 2008, the Company had net sales of 9,399. The Company
recognizes revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery
has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is
reasonably assured. The Company intends to provide countries within
the EU and some countries outside the EU with generic drugs at considerable
lower prices than other suppliers. For this purpose we make agreements with
manufacturers within Europe who produce drugs that meet EU and FDA standards.
The Company expects to conduct its business with a low overhead, lower than that
of the other companies in this market. This is possible because the Company will
execute its affairs as much as possible as an agency in order to keep its costs
low. The main activity of the agency is to provide the registration requirements
and quality control. The Company s buyers will take care of the logistics,
storage and marketing. The Company will take a fee for the registration
ownership of the drugs and a commission on the delivered goods. 

Research and Development
Costs 

All
research and development costs are expenses as incurred. 

Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets 

The
Company reviews property and medical registration rights for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
of . Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is
measured by comparing the carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the
assets are expected to generate. If property and medical
registration rights are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds
its estimated fair market value. There was no impairment in 2008 or
2007. 

Goodwill 

The
Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and
other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and intangibles
with indefinite lives are not amortized; rather they are tested for impairment
at least annually.

 DECEMBER
31, 2008 

In order
to test goodwill under SFAS 142, a determination of the fair value of the
Company s reporting units for its goodwill valuation and is based upon, among
other things, estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit
being valued. Changes in market conditions, among other factors may
have an impact on these estimates. 

Reclassifications 

Certain
amounts from the prior year have been reclassified to be consistent with the
current period. 

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements 

In
September 2006, the FASB No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under other accounting
pronouncements that permit or require fair value measurements, changes the
methods used to measure fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. In particular, disclosures are required to provide
information on the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and
liabilities; the inputs used to develop measurements; and the effect of certain
of the measurements on earnings (or changes in net assets). In
February 2008, the FASB approved a FASB Staff Position ("FSP") that permits
companies to partially defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The
FSP did not permit companies to defer recognition and disclosure requirements
for financial assets and financial liabilities or for nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities that are remeasured at least annually. SFAS
No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption, as of the
beginning of an entity s fiscal year, is also permitted, provided interim
financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company intends to
defer adoption of SFAS No. 157 for one year for nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The Company adopted
SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities on January 1,
2008. Adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on the
consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial
position. 

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities SFAS 159 ). SFAS 159 allows entities to measure at fair
value many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities that
are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. SFAS 159 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company
adopted SFAS 159 on January 1, 2008. Adoption of SFAS 159 did not
have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or
financial position. 

In June
2007 the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force ITF No.07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance
Payments for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development
Activities . EITF 07-3 requires non-refundable advance payments for goods
and services to be used in future research and development activities to be
recorded as an asset and the payments to be expenses when the research and
development activities are performed. EITF 07-3 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2007. The Company adopted EITF 07-3 on January 1,
2008. Adoption of EITF 07-3 did not have a material impact on the
consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.. 

In
December 2007, the FASB issued No. 141R, Business Combinations . This
standard establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes
and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the
goodwill acquired. This statement also establishes disclosure requirements which
will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business
combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective for us for acquisitions made after
November 30, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if
any, that the adoption of SFAS No. 141R will have on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Non-controlling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements . This standard outlines the accounting
and reporting for ownership interest in a subsidiary held by parties other than
the parent. SFAS No. 160 is effective for our first quarter of 2010. The Company
is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, that the adoption of SFAS
No. 160 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No.
162, "The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles." SFAS No. 162
identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting
the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements
of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. SFAS No. 162 became effective in November 2008.
Its adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated
financial statements .

NOTE
D - NOTES PAYABLE TO RELATED PARTIES 

The
Company has received advances from individuals related to the Company at various
times for working capital and to fund required operating expenses. These
advances are unsecured and bear interest at the rate of 8 per year. The amount
outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007 aggregate 848,416 and 584,944
respectively. 

NOTE E - INCOME
TAXES 

The
Company recognizes a deferred tax liability or asset for temporary differences
between the tax basis of an asset or liability and the related amount reported
on the financial statements. The principal types of differences, which are
measured at current tax rates, are net operating loss carry forwards. At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, these differences resulted in a deferred tax asset
of approximately 1,187,000 and 920,000, respectively. SFAS No. 109
requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of
realization of deferred tax assets. Since realization is not assured, he Company
has recorded a valuation allowance for the entire deferred tax asset, and the
accompanying financial statements do not reflect any net asset for deferred
taxes at December 31, 2008 and 2007. 

The
Company's net operating loss carry forwards amounted to approximately 4,000,000
at December 31, 2008, which will expire through 2028. 

On
January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). There was no impact on the
Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow at
December 31, 2006 and for the year then ended, as a result of implementing FIN
48. At the adoption date of January 1, 2007, the Company did not have
any unrecognized tax benefits. The Company s practice is to recognize interest
and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of
January 1, 2007, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties. The Company
currently has no federal or state tax examinations in progress nor has it had
any federal or state tax examinations since its inception. All of the Company s
tax years are subject to federal and state tax examination.

H - LITIGATION 

On May
2004, Fred de Vries and Renato Mariani filed suit in the Fifteenth Judicial
Circuit Court located in Palm Beach County, Florida, claiming breach of
employment agreements against the Company and against the Company s Chief
Executive Officer claiming fraud. The parties were seeking monies and benefits
owed in connection with their employment agreements as well as other
damages. 

On March
19, 2007, the Company entered into a written Settlement and Release Agreement
with DeVries and Mariani whereby in consideration of payment by the Company to
DeVries and Mariani for the combined sum of 150,000.00, DeVries and
Mariani agreed to accept said payment, and, upon receiving full payment from the
Company, to release and discharge the Company and all its current and former
principals, officers, agents, attorneys, employees, heirs, administrators,
executors, successors or assigns, and/or representatives from any and all
judgments, agreements, claims, demands, claims of action, known or unknown,
which DeVries and/or Mariani may claim against the Company, including but not
limited to the one million four hundred forty thousand 1,440,000.00) U.S.
dollars outstanding judgment in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Court located in
Palm Beach County, Florida, claiming breach of employment agreements against the
Company and against the Company s Chief Executive Officer claiming
fraud. 

The
Company paid to DeVries and Mariani 75,000.00, and agreed to bank wire to
DeVries and Mariani, on or before July 19, 2007, the remaining 75,000.00
of the total combined sum of 150,000.00. On July 19, 2007, the Company
paid the remaining 75,000 to Mssrs. DeVries and Mariani releasing the Company

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING 

 AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

There have been no disagreements
between the Company and Meyler Company, LLC MC in connection with any
services provided to us by each of them for the periods of their engagement on
any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure. 

No accountant s report on the financial
statements for the past two years contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer
of opinion or was qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or
accounting principles, except such reports did contain a going concern
qualification; such financial statements did not contain any adjustments for
uncertainties stated therein. In addition, MC did not advise the Company with
regard to any of the following: 

1. 
 That internal
 controls necessary to develop reliable financial statements did not exist;
 or 

2. 

That
 information has come to their attention, which made them unwilling to rely
 on management s representations, or unwilling to be associated with the
 financial statements prepared by management;
or 

3. 

That
 the scope of the audit should be expanded significantly, or information
 has come to the accountant s attention that the accountant has concluded
 will, or if further investigated might, materially impact the fairness or
 reliability of a previously issued audit report or the underlying
 financial statements, or the financial statements issued or to be issued
 covering the fiscal periods subsequent to the date of the most recent
 audited financial statements, and the issue was not resolved to the
 accountant s satisfaction prior to its resignation or dismissal. During
 the most recent two fiscal years and during any subsequent interim periods
 preceding the date of each engagement, we have not consulted MC regarding
 any matter requiring disclosure under Regulation S-K, Item
 304(a)(2). 

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company's Chief Executive Officer
and its Chief Financial Officer (collectively, the "Certifying Officers") are
responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
for the Company. Such officers have reviewed our disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form
10-K. The Certifying Officers have concluded that the Company's disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in this report is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management, including its principal executive officers as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Certifying Officers
also have indicated that there were no significant changes in the Company
internal controls or other factors that could significantly affect such controls
subsequent to the date of their evaluation, and that there were no corrective
actions necessary with regard to any significant deficiencies and/or material
weaknesses. 

ITEM
9A(T). CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES 

Management's
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is also responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate "internal control over financial
reporting" of the Company, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
Internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed by,
or under the supervision of, the issuer's principal executive and principal
financial officer and effected by the company's board of directors, management
and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. 

12 

Management of the Company, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008 not pursuant to any established framework other than their
review of the Company s procedures for financial reporting and their review of
the Company s current reporting obligations. In connection with this evaluation,
Company management did not identify any material deficiencies. Based upon that
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of the end
of the period covered by this report. 

Our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all
error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due
to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, have been detected. 

This annual report does not include an
attestation report of the Company's independent registered public accounting
firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report
was not subject to attestation by the Company's independent registered public
accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this
annual report. 

There was no change in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended
December 31, 2009, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The
 shares of common stock of the COMPANY issued to TOTAL LOOK pursuant to the

 49,500,000, shall be subject to the anti-dilution provisions as described
 and defined in this Section to this AGREEMENT . 

(b) 

The
 shares of common stock of the COMPANY issued to TOTAL LOOK pursuant to the
 Section 4 to this AGREEMENT , totaling
 13,178,826, shall be subject to the anti-dilution provisions as described
 and defined in this Section to this AGREEMENT . 

(c) 

The
 shares of common stock of the COMPANY retained by the CALIFORNIA
 SHAREHOLDERS and LFG after execution of this AGREEMENT as described
 in Section 3, part (c) herein, shall be subject to the anti-dilution
 provisions as described and defined in this Section to this AGREEMENT . 

(d) 

The
 shares of common stock of the COMPANY issued to the DUTCH SHAREHOLDERS
 pursuant to the SEA (30,000,000 shares
 owned by BOUWENS, and 6,000,000 shares owned by DE METZ, MNH, and
 BLIJLEVEN, each) shall be subject to the anti-dilution provisions as
 described and defined in this Section to this AGREEMENT . 

(e) 

This
 anti-dilution provision requires that the company issue shares of
 restricted common stock of the COMPANY to the CALIFORNIA SHAREHOLDERS,
 LFG, TOTAL LOOK, and the DUTCH SHAREHOLDERS in the event that the COMPANY
 engage in any diluting event such as a forward or reverse stock split, any
 issuance of shares of common stock,, warrants or other
 securities convertible into common stock, stock consolidation, exchange of
 shares, reverse, reorganization or similar event that would dilute the
 ownership percentage of common stock of the COMPANY of the CALIFORNIA
 SHAREHOLDERS, LFG, TOTAL LOOK, or the DUTCH SHAREHOLDERS. In the event of
 such a diluting event, the COMPANY shall issue shares of common stock of
 the COMPANY, or identical securities of such issuance is of any security
 other than common stock (such as warrants or preferred stock) to the
 CALIFORNIA SHAREHOLDERS, LFG, TOTAL LOOK, or the DUTCH SHAREHOLDERS in
 such amounts as would make such parties ownership percentage the same, or
 approximately the same, percentage ownership as each party held prior to
 the diluting event. 

(f) 

It
 is hereby agreed by the COMPANY, the CALIFORNIA SHAREHOLDERS, LFG, TOTAL
 LOOK, and the DUTCH SHAREHOLDERS that the anti-dilution provisions herein
 shall not apply, and any anti-dilution rights shall be and are hereby
 waived by the CALIFORNIA SHAREHOLDERS, LFG, TOTAL LOOK, and the DUTCH
 SHAREHOLDERS, in the event of the issuance of shares of common
 stock pursuant to a bonafide financing, an acquisition of another entity
 or property, or as part of a settlement of a lawsuit, arbitration, or
 other legal conflict; provided, however , that
 this exception shall not apply to any acquisition or settlement unless
 each of the following conditions are
satisfied: 

(i) 

The
 acquisition or settlement is with a party that is not an officer or
 director or ten percent or more shareholder of the Company, or any party
 to this Agreement; 

(ii) 

The
 acquisition or settlement is negotiated in good faith, in an arm s length
 negotiation, on terms that are fair and reasonable to the
 Company; 

(iii) 

The
 Company shall offer to sell to CALIFORNIA SHAREHOLDERS, LFG, TOTAL LOOK,
 and the DUTCH SHAREHOLDERS, a number of shares of common stock, at the
 price per share reasonably attributed to the consideration received by the
 Company for the shares issued pursuant to the acquisition or settlement,
 equal to the percentage of shares owned by each such shareholder as a
 percentage of the total number of shares held by all such
 shareholders. Thus, for example only, assume the total number
 of shares of common stock of the Company owned by all of CALIFORNIA
 SHAREHOLDERS, LFG, TOTAL LOOK, and the DUTCH SHAREHOLDERS is 1,000,000
 shares, and TOTAL LOOK owns 200,000 of such shares. The Company
 then issues 100,000 shares pursuant to a settlement or acquisition in
 which the shares of common stock are valued at 0.10 per
 share. In such case, TOTAL LOOK would have the right to
 purchase 20,000 shares for 0.10 per share. A shareholder shall
 have thirty days to accept and purchase its allotment of shares, starting
 from the date of its receipt of (i) written notice by the Company of such
 shareholders right to purchase shares, including the number of shares and
 the purchase price of such shares, and a reasonable description of the
 event triggering such right, and (ii) a copy of the relevant acquisition
 or settlement agreement. 

(g) 

Bonafide
 financing consists of an event where by the COMPANY issues shares of
 common stock of the COMPANY in exchange for capital investment made into
 the COMPANY including offers and sales of COMPANY common stock made
 pursuant to an exemption from registration pursuant to the United States
 Securities and Exchange Commission, public or private offerings for the
 purpose of raising capital for the COMPANY, or other similar such capital
 raising activities. Bonafide financing does not include the trading of
 COMPANY shares now registered and trading on any exchange. In
 the event of a Bonafide financing, the Company shall offer to each of
 CALIFORNIA SHAREHOLDERS, LFG, TOTAL LOOK, and the DUTCH SHAREHOLDERS, the
 right to purchase shares pursuant to such offering at the lowest price as
 is offered to or accepted from any other
party. 

(h) 

The
 shares subject to the anti-dilution provisions will be non-dilutable as
 long as such shares are owned by the CALIFORNIA SHAREHOLDERS, LFG, TOTAL
 LOOK and the DUTCH SHAREHOLDERS. If such shares are sold,
 gifted, transferred, traded, lost, encumbered by a third-party or
 otherwise become no longer in the possession and control of such original
 shareholder (the CALIFORNIA SHAREHOLDERS, LFG, TOTAL LOOK or the DUTCH
 SHAREHOLDERS), or subject to the control or interest of a third-party,
 then the CALIFORNIA SHAREHOLDERS, LFG, TOTAL LOOK and the DUTCH
 SHAREHOLDERS hereby agree that the anti-dilution provisions described
 herein for such shares no longer apply. For clarification, any
 shares transferred or sold in a private transaction to an affiliate of the
 transferor, such as a trust or other entity owned in whole or in part by
 the transferor or its affiliates, shall not be deemed to terminate the
 anti-dilution rights described
herein. 

Section
6. Sales Commission

SHAREHOLDERS, and LFG hereby memorialize their desire to enter into subsequent
sale commission agreements as follows. 

(a)

(b) 

Each
 such sales commission shall be memorialized and further described and
 defined in separate agreements made with regard to each sale or customer
 that the CALIFORNIA SHAREHOLDERS or LFG introduce to the
 COMPANY.
