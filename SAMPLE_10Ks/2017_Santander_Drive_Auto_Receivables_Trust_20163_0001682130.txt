 Item 1115(b) of Regulation AB. Certain Derivatives Instruments (Financial Information). 
 Nothing to report. Item 1117 of
Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as the indenture trustee, has provided the following information: On
June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee under 276 residential mortgage backed
securities RMBS trusts, which was later amended on July 18, 2014, to increase the number of trusts to 284 RMBS trusts. On November 24, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the state court action
without prejudice. That same day, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., alleging claims against the bank in its
capacity as trustee for 274 residential mortgage backed securities RMBS trusts (the Complaint ). In December 2014, the plaintiffs motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court action was granted. As
with the prior state court action, the Complaint is one of six similar complaints filed contemporaneously against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and US Bank) by a group of institutional investor
plaintiffs. The Complaint against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. alleges that the trustee caused losses to investors and asserts causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee s alleged failure to (i) enforce repurchase
obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged events of default purportedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers, and (iii) abide by appropriate
standards of care following alleged events of default. Relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and equitable relief. Other cases alleging similar causes of action have been filed against Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. and other trustees by RMBS investors in these and other transactions. 
 2 

There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or the possible impact of the
litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of any losses to investors,
and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs claims vigorously.

 Santander Consumer USA Inc. SC is party to, or is periodically otherwise involved in, reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and
informal), and information-gathering requests, by government and self-regulatory agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve ), the CFPB, the U.S. Department of Justice (the
 DOJ ), the SEC, the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC and various state regulatory agencies. Since July 2014, SC has received civil subpoenas and civil investigative demands from various federal and state agencies, including
from the DOJ under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, the SEC and several state attorneys general, requesting the production of documents and communications that, among other things, relate to the origination,
underwriting and securitization of auto loans for varying time periods since 2007. Investigations, litigation proceedings and/or information-gathering requests that SC or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates are involved in, or may become involved
in, may result in adverse consequences to SC including, without limitation, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other actions. 
 In October 2016, the parent of SC, Santander Consumer Holdings USA Inc. SC Holdings ), filed amendments to certain periodic reports previously
filed with the SEC after determining that its previously issued audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, and previously issued unaudited financial statements contained in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, June 30, 2015 and 2014 and September 30, 2015 and 2014 should no longer be relied on and should be restated due to certain errors identified
in such financial statements relating to (i) SC Holdings methodology for accreting dealer discounts, subvention payments from manufacturers and capitalized origination costs, (ii) SC Holdings lack of consideration of net
discounts when estimating the allowance for credit losses and (iii) the discount rate used in determining the impairment for loans accounted for as troubled debt restructurings. SC Holdings has reviewed all critical relationships and does not
foresee a material interruption in, or change to, normal business activities related to the delayed and amended filings. The financial statement errors relate to non-cash items and have no material impact on
net cash from operating activities, investing activities or financing activities. Additional information about SC Holdings, including information contained in required annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, is on file with the SEC under the name Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. and file number 001-36270.

 Substitute information provided in accordance with General Instruction J to Form
 10-K: Item 1119 of Regulation AB. Affiliations and Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions. Information required by Item 1119 of Regulation AB has been omitted from this report on Form 10-K in reliance on the Instruction to Item 1119. Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Compliance with
Applicable Servicing Criteria. Each of SC, the Subservicer and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (each, a Servicing
Participant have been identified by the issuing entity as parties participating in the servicing function with respect to the pool assets held by the issuing entity. Each of the Servicing Participants has completed a report on an
assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it (each, a Report on Assessment ), which Reports on Assessment are attached as exhibits to this Form 10-K. In addition, each
of the Servicing Participants has provided an attestation report (each, an Attestation Report by one or more registered public accounting firms, which reports are also attached as exhibits to this Form
 10-K. Management s Assessment of Compliance for SC has identified a material instance of
noncompliance related to the servicing criterion set forth in Item 1122(d)(3)(i) reports to investors, including those to be filed with the Commission, were not maintained in accordance with the transaction agreements and applicable Commission
requirements. Specifically, reports to investors provided information that was not calculated in accordance with the terms specified in the transaction agreements. This material instance of noncompliance does not relate to the asset-backed
securities covered in this Form 10-K and issued by the Issuer. The instance relates to two separate matters: 
 (1) Under the transaction agreements for the Platform, SC, as Servicer, is entitled to receive all Supplemental Servicing Fees as
additional servicing compensation, and such Supplemental Servicing Fees do not constitute Available Funds. However, SC included Supplemental Servicing Fees for certain transactions in the Platform under other amounts received and
included such amounts as part of Available Funds in the investor reports; for these transactions, Supplemental Servicing Fees were distributed in accordance with the payment priorities set forth in the related transaction agreements
rather than being retained by the Servicer. To address this issue and the related instance of noncompliance, SC will stop including
Supplemental Servicing Fees as other amounts received for all transactions in the Platform beginning with the March 2017 collection period and will retain such amounts as additional servicing compensation as specified in the transaction
agreements. SC believes that the inclusion of Supplemental Servicing Fees as available funds did not result in any material adverse effect on security holders or the amounts or timing of payments to security holders. 
 6 

(2) Under the transaction agreements for the Platform, SC, as Servicer, is required to pay
all expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities as servicer other than expenses in connection with the sale of a repossessed vehicle, which may be netted from liquidation proceeds from such sale. For certain transactions in the
Platform, SC did not net external costs associated with repossession expenses attributable to financed vehicles sold after the related receivables have become defaulted receivables; for these transactions, SC paid such repossession expenses and the
 Liquidation Proceeds included in the investor reports and distributed in accordance with the payment priorities set forth in the related transaction agreements were greater than they would have been had SC reduced the liquidation
proceeds by the external costs associated with repossession expenses in accordance with the transaction agreements for those transactions. 
 To address this issue and the related instance of noncompliance, SC will amend the transaction agreements for the effected transactions in the
Platform to memorialize the agreement of the Servicer to pay such external costs of repossessions rather than netting such amounts from sale proceeds from the disposition of repossessed financed vehicles. SC believes that the payment of
external costs associated with repossession expenses by the Servicer and the failure to report Liquidation Expenses on the investor reports net of such repossession expenses for certain transactions did not result in any material adverse effect on
security holders or the amounts or timing of payments to security holders. With respect to the matters described in paragraphs (1) and (2)
above, SC has already implemented additional policies and procedures to confirm that calculations included in investor reports are completed as set forth in the amended agreements, and is in the process of implementing greater management oversight
of reporting and implementing enhanced quality assurance controls. Item 1123 of Regulation AB. Servicer Compliance Statements. 
 SC and the Subservicer have been identified by the issuing entity as the servicers with respect to the asset pool held by the issuing
entity. Each of SC and the Subservicer have completed a statement of compliance with applicable servicing criteria (each, a Compliance Statement signed by an authorized officer. The Compliance Statements are attached as
exhibits to this Form 10-K.

Exhibit 33.1 

Management s Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria 

1. 
 Santander Consumer USA Inc. SC is responsible for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it under paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB as of and for the year ended

criteria which SC determined are not applicable to the activities performed by SC or through its vendors with respect to the Platform: 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),

that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the portion of the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. SC is solely responsible for determining that it meets the requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC
Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations. 

6. 
 With respect to servicing criterion set forth in Item 1122(d)(3)(i), reports to investors, including those to be filed with the Commission, were not maintained in accordance with the transactions agreements and
applicable Commission requirements. Specifically, reports to investors provided information that was not calculated in accordance with the terms specified in the transaction agreements. The affected transactions included in the Platform are
identified on Appendix A with an asterisk. 

7. 
 Except for the material instance of noncompliance described in the paragraph above, SC has complied, in all material respects, with the applicable servicing criteria for which it is responsible, as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2016, with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

8. 
 SC has not identified and is not aware of any material instance of noncompliance by the vendors with regard to the applicable servicing criteria, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, with respect to the
Platform taken as a whole.

respect to the Platform taken as a whole.

Exhibit 33.2 
 ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 
 The management Management of the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the
 Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that
the servicing criteria are applicable in regards to the servicing platform for the period as follows: Period : As of and for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2016 (the Period ). Platform : The platform consists of asset-backed securities ABS transactions for which the Company provides trustee (except Delaware trustee or owner trustee) and/or paying agent services and for which (i) some or all of the offered securities for such ABS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a
registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (ii) the offered securities for such ABS transactions were privately issued pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation under the
transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes (a) any transactions for which the securities issued are
mortgage-backed securities or mortgage-related asset-backed securities and (b) certain transactions for which the issuing entity has a fiscal year that ends on a date other than the end of the calendar year (the ABS
Platform ). Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the ABS Platform for the Period. 
 Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) applicable to the Company s obligations in the related
transaction agreements with respect to the ABS Platform for the Period, except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(1)(v), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v),
1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not applicable to the Company s obligations in the
related transaction agreements with respect to the ABS Platform for the Period; provided however that, with respect to the ABS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(i)(A) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s obligation
to distribute or make available to investors, in accordance with the timeframes set forth in the transaction agreements, the relevant investor reports received by the Company from the entity preparing such reports; (b) servicing criterion
1122(d)(3)(ii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s obligation to make remittances to investors in accordance with the transaction agreements; and (c) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the
Company s obligation to obtain an Officer s Certificate from the servicer and report any additions, removals and substitutions to investors on the relevant investor report, in each case, in accordance with the transaction agreements (the
 Applicable Servicing Criteria ). With respect to the ABS Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the
Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 1. Management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with
the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 2. Management has assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. In performing this
assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 3.
With respect to applicable servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), Management has determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with respect to the ABS Platform, because there were no occurrences
of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 4. Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material
respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to
Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Exhibit 34.1 
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Management of Santander Consumer USA Inc. 
 We have examined Santander Consumer USA Inc. s compliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange
Commission s Regulation AB for all publicly registered transactions backed by auto loans for which Santander Consumer USA Inc. is the servicer (the Platform described in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Compliance
with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, as of December 31, 2016 and for the year then ended, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), and 1122(d)(4)(ix) through 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has determined
are not applicable to the servicing activities performed by it with respect to the Platform. As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vi),
1122(d)(4)(vii) and 1122(d)(4)(viii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered servicers as defined in Item
1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of
Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies
and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets
the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06.
Appendix A to management s assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. Our examination was
conducted in accordance with attestation standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities
related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions
and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have
affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on
the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

Our examination disclosed the following material noncompliance with the servicing criterion set forth in Item
1122(d)(3)(i) of Regulation AB applicable to the Company during the year ended December 31, 2016. As required by Item 1122(d)(3)(i) of Regulation AB, reports to investors, including those to be filed with the Commission, were not maintained in
accordance with the transaction agreements and applicable Commission requirements. In our opinion, except for the material noncompliance described in the
preceding paragraph, Santander Consumer USA Inc. complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 for all publicly registered transactions backed by auto loans for which
Santander Consumer USA Inc. is the servicer, in all material respects. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

however that, with respect to the ABS Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(i)(A) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s obligation to distribute or make available to investors, in accordance with the timeframes set forth
in the transaction agreements, the relevant investor reports received by the Company from the entity preparing such reports; (b) servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(ii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s obligation to make

report any additions, removals and substitutions to investors on the relevant investor report, in each case, in accordance with the transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). With respect to applicable servicing criteria
1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), management has determined that there were no activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 with respect to the ABS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events
that would require the Company to perform such activities. Appendix A to the Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies the individual transactions defined by management as constituting the ABS Platform. Management is
responsible for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assessment about the Company s compliance based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the ABS Platform, testing
selected servicing activities related to the ABS Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were
limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our
tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. In our opinion,
management s assessment that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to
detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our
examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that Santander Consumer International Puerto Rico, LLC complied with
the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2016 and for the period from July 15, 2016 to December 31, 2016 for all publicly registered transactions backed by auto loans for which Santander Consumer USA Inc. is
the servicer is fairly stated, in all material respects. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
