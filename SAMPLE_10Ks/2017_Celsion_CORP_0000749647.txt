OVERVIEW 
 
 Celsion is a fully-integrated , development stage oncology drug company focused on developing a portfolio of innovative cancer treatments, including directed chemotherapies, DNA-mediated immunotherapy and RNA based therapies. Our lead product candidate is ThermoDox , a proprietary dosage form of doxorubicin based on a heat-activated liposomal platform technology, currently in a Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of non-resectable hepatocellular carcinoma HCC ), also known as primary liver cancer, and a Phase II clinical trial for recurrent chest wall breast cancer. Our pipeline also includes GEN-1, a DNA-based immunotherapy currently in a Phase I clinical trial for the localized treatment of ovarian cancer and pre-clinical development for brain cancer. GEN-1 is based on a platform technology for the development of treatments using novel nucleic acid-based immunotherapies and other anti-cancer DNA or RNA therapies. We are working to develop and commercialize more efficient, effective and targeted oncology therapies based on our technologies, with the goal of developing novel therapeutics that maximize efficacy while minimizing side-effects common to cancer treatments. 
 
 ThermoDox 
 
 ThermoDox is being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial, in combination with a standardized radiofrequency ablation RFA ), for primary liver cancer (the OPTIMA Study and a Phase II clinical trial for recurrent chest wall breast cancer (the DIGNITY Study ). ThermoDox is a heat sensitive liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin, an approved and frequently used oncology drug for the treatment of a wide range of cancers. Localized heat at hyperthermia temperatures (greater than 40 degrees Celsius) releases the encapsulated doxorubicin from the liposome enabling high concentrations of doxorubicin to be deposited preferentially in and around the targeted tumor. 
 
 The OPTIMA Study. The OPTIMA Study represents an evaluation of ThermoDox in combination with a first line therapy, RFA, for newly diagnosed, intermediate stage HCC patients. HCC incidence globally is approximately 850,000 new cases per year and is the third largest cancer indication globally. Approximately 30 of newly diagnosed patients can be addressed with RFA alone. 
 
 On February 24, 2014, we announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA ), after its customary 30-day review period, provided clearance for the OPTIMA Study, which is a pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial of ThermoDox , in combination with standardized RFA, for the treatment of primary liver cancer. The trial design of the OPTIMA Study is based on the comprehensive analysis of data from an earlier clinical trial called the HEAT Study (the HEAT Study ), which is described below. The OPTIMA Study is supported by a hypothesis developed from an overall survival analysis of a large subgroup of patients from the HEAT Study. 
 
 We initiated the OPTIMA Study in the first half of 2014. The OPTIMA Study was designed with extensive input from globally recognized hepatocellular carcinoma HCC researchers and expert clinicians and after receiving formal written consultation from the FDA. The OPTIMA Study is expected to enroll up to 550 patients globally at up to 65 sites in the U.S., Canada, European Union, China and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and will evaluate ThermoDox in combination with standardized RFA, which will require a minimum of 45 minutes across all investigators and clinical sites for treating lesions three to seven centimeters, versus standardized RFA alone. The primary endpoint for this clinical trial is overall survival OS ), and the secondary endpoints are progression free survival and safety. The statistical plan calls for two interim efficacy analyses by an independent Data Monitoring Committee. 
 
 On December 16, 2015, we announced that we had received the clinical trial application approval from the China Food and Drug Administration (the CFDA to conduct the OPTIMA Study in China. This clinical trial application approval will allow Celsion to enroll patients at up to 20 clinical sites in China. With the addition of these Chinese clinical sites, the Company expects to complete enrollment in the OPTIMA Study during the first half of 2018. On April 26, 2016, we announced that the first patient in China had been enrolled in the OPTIMA Study. Results from the OPTIMA Study, if successful, will provide the basis for a global registration filing and marketing approval. 
 
 Post-hoc data analysis from the Company s earlier Phase III HEAT Study suggest that ThermoDox may substantially improve OS, when compared to the control group, in patients if their lesions undergo a 45 minute RFA procedure standardized for a lesion greater than 3 cm in diameter. Data from nine OS sweeps have been conducted since the top line progression free survival PFS data from the HEAT Study were announced in January 2013, with each data set demonstrating substantial improvement in clinical benefit over the control group with statistical significance. On August 15, 2016, the Company announced updated results from its final retrospective OS analysis of the data from the HEAT Study. These results demonstrated that in a large, well bounded, subgroup of patients with a single lesion (n=285, 41 of the HEAT Study patients), treatment with a combination of ThermoDox and optimized RFA provided an average 54 risk improvement in OS compared to optimized RFA alone. The Hazard Ratio HR at this analysis is 0.65 (95 CI 0.45 - 0.94) with a p-value of 0.02. Median OS for the ThermoDox group has been reached which translates into a two year survival benefit over the optimized RFA group (projected to be greater than 80 months for the ThermoDox plus optimized RFA group compared to less than 60 months projection for the optimized RFA only group). 

2

Additional findings from this most recent analysis specific to the Chinese patient cohort of 223 patients are summarized below: 

In the population of 154 patients with a single lesion who received optimized RFA treatment for 45 minutes or more showed a 53 risk improvement in OS (HR = 0.66) when treated with ThermoDox plus optimized RFA. 

These data continue to support and further strengthen ThermoDox s potential to significantly improve OS compared to an RFA control in patients with lesions that undergo optimized RFA treatment for 45 minutes or more. The clinical benefit seen in the intent-to-treat Chinese patient cohort further confirms the importance of RFA heating time as 72 of patients in this large patient cohort in China received an optimized RFA treatment. 
 
 While this information should be viewed with caution since it is based on a retrospective analysis of a subgroup, we also conducted additional analyses that further strengthen the evidence for the HEAT Study sub-group. We commissioned an independent computational model at the University of South Carolina Medical School. The results unequivocally indicate that longer RFA heating times correlate with significant increases in doxorubicin concentration around the RFA treated tissue. In addition, we conducted a prospective preclinical study in 21 pigs using two different manufacturers of RFA and human equivalent doses of ThermoDox that clearly support the relationship between increased heating duration and doxorubicin concentrations. 
 
 On November 29, 2016, the Company announced the results of an independent analysis conducted by the National Institutes of Health (the NIH from the HEAT Study which reaffirmed the correlation between increased RFA burn time per tumor volume and improvements in overall survival. The NIH analysis, which sought to evaluate the correlation between RFA burn time per tumor volume (min/ml) and clinical outcome, concluded that increased burn time per tumor volume significantly improved overall survival in patients treated with RFA plus ThermoDox compared to patients treated with RFA alone. 
 
 The HEAT Study . On January 31, 2013, the Company announced that the HEAT Study, ThermoDox in combination with RFA, did not meet the primary endpoint, PFS, of a Phase III clinical trial enrolling 701 patients with primary liver cancer. This determination was made after conferring with the HEAT Study independent Data Monitoring Committee, that the HEAT Study did not meet the goal of demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in progression free survival. In the trial, ThermoDox was well-tolerated with no unexpected serious adverse events. Following the announcement of the HEAT Study results, we continued to follow patients for OS, the secondary endpoint of the HEAT Study. We have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the data from the HEAT Study to assess the future strategic value and development strategy for ThermoDox . 
 
 The DIGNITY Study. On December 14, 2015, we announced final data from our ongoing DIGNITY study, which is an open-label, dose-escalating Phase II trial of ThermoDox in patients with recurrent chest wall RCW breast cancer. The DIGNITY Study was designed to establish a safe therapeutic dose in Phase I, and to demonstrate local control in Phase II, including complete and partial responses, and stable disease as its primary endpoint. The DIGNITY Study was also designed to evaluate kinetics in ThermoDox produced from more than one manufacturing site. Of the 28 patients enrolled and treated, 21 patients were eligible for evaluation of efficacy. Approximately 62 of evaluable patients experienced a local response, including six complete responses and seven partial responses. 
 
 The Euro-DIGNITY Stud y. We anticipate that a Phase II study of RadioTherapy, HyperThermia and ThermoDox to treat patients with local-regional recurrent chest wall breast cancer will be initiated by five to six clinical sites located in Italy, Israel, Poland and the Czech Republic (the Euro-DIGNITY Study ). The Euro-DIGNITY Study is expected to commence in 2017 and is expected to enroll up to 70 patients affected by recurrent breast adenocarcinoma on the chest wall with/without nodes over a period of two years. 
 
 The primary objectives of the Euro-DIGNITY Study will be (i) to evaluate efficacy in patients after 3 cycles of ThermoDox plus Hyperthermia measuring tumor diameter as a response to therapy and (ii) to evaluate loco-regional breast tumor control in patients who undergo ThermoDox /hyperthermia/radiotherapy as measured by target lesion clinical response rate combining a RECIST criteria with digital photography to gauge response. 

3

Secondary objectives of the Euro-DIGNITY Study will be (i) to evaluate the safety of the combination of ThermoDox /Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy among patients with local-regional recurrence LRR breast cancer, (ii) to evaluate the duration of local control complete response, partial response and stable disease following treatment with ThermoDox /Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy up to 24 months among patients with LRR breast cancer and (iii) to assess Patient Reported Quality of Life using the FACT-B and Brief Pain Inventory following treatment with ThermoDox /Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy among patients with LRR breast cancer. 
 
 Acquisition of EGEN Assets 
 
 On June 20, 2014, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Egen, Inc., an Alabama corporation, which has changed its company name to EGWU, Inc. after the closing of the acquisition EGEN ), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated as of June 6, 2014, by and between EGEN and Celsion (the Asset Purchase Agreement). We acquired all of EGEN s right, title and interest in and to substantially all of the assets of EGEN, including cash and cash equivalents, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, clinical data, certain contracts, licenses and permits, equipment, furniture, office equipment, furnishings, supplies and other tangible personal property. In addition, CLSN Laboratories assumed certain specified liabilities of EGEN, including the liabilities arising out of the acquired contracts and other assets relating to periods after the closing date. 
 
 The total purchase price for the asset acquisition is up to 44.4 million, including potential future earnout payments of up to 30.4 million contingent upon achievement of certain earnout milestones set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement. At the closing, we paid approximately 3.0 million in cash after the expense adjustment and issued 2,712,188 shares of our common stock to EGEN. The shares of common stock were issued in a private transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof. In addition, 670,070 shares of common stock were held back by us at the closing and are issuable to EGEN pending certain potential adjustments for expenses or in relation to EGEN s indemnification obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement. 
 
 The earnout payments of up to 30.4 million will become payable, in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our option, upon achievement of three major milestone events as follows: 

12.4 million will become payable upon achieving certain specified development milestones relating to an ovarian cancer study of GEN-1 (formerly known as EGEN-001) to be conducted by us or our subsidiary; 

12.0 million will become payable upon achieving certain specified development milestones relating to a GEN-1 glioblastoma multiforme brain cancer study to be conducted by us or our subsidiary; and 

up to 6.0 million will become payable upon achieving certain specified milestones relating to the TheraSilence technology acquired from EGEN in the acquisition. 
 
 Our obligations to make the earnout payments will terminate on the seventh anniversary of the closing date. In the acquisition, we purchased GEN-1, a DNA-based immunotherapy for the localized treatment of ovarian and brain cancers, and two platform technologies for the development of treatments for those suffering with difficult-to-treat forms of cancer, novel nucleic acid-based immunotherapies and other anti-cancer DNA or RNA therapies, including TheraPlas and TheraSilence . 
 
 GEN-1 
 
 GEN-1 is a DNA-based immunotherapeutic product for the localized treatment of ovarian and brain cancers by intraperitoneally administering an Interleukin-12 IL-12 plasmid formulated with our proprietary TheraPlas delivery system. In this DNA-based approach, the immunotherapy is combined with a standard chemotherapy drug, which can potentially achieve better clinical outcomes than with chemotherapy alone. We believe that increases in IL-12 concentrations at tumor sites for several days after a single administration could create a potent immune environment against tumor activity and that a direct killing of the tumor with concomitant use of cytotoxic chemotherapy could result in a more robust and durable antitumor response than chemotherapy alone.

GEN-1 OVATION Study. In February 2015, we announced that the FDA accepted, without objection, the Phase I dose-escalation clinical trial of GEN-1 in combination with the standard of care in neo-adjuvant ovarian cancer (the OVATION Study ). On September 30, 2015, we announced enrollment of the first patient in the OVATION Study. The OVATION Study will seek to identify a safe, tolerable and potentially therapeutically active dose of GEN-1 by recruiting and maximizing an immune response and is designed to enroll three to six patients per dose level and will evaluate safety and efficacy and attempt to define an optimal dose for a follow-on Phase I/II study combining GEN-1 with Avastin and Doxil . In addition, the OVATION Study establishes a unique opportunity to assess how cytokine-based compounds such as GEN-1, directly affect ovarian cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment in newly diagnosed patients. The study is designed to characterize the nature of the immune response triggered by GEN-1 at various levels of the patients immune system, including: 

infiltration of cancer fighting T-cell lymphocytes into primary tumor and tumor microenvironment including peritoneal cavity, which is the primary site of metastasis of ovarian cancer; 

changes in local and systemic levels of immuno-stimulatory and immunosuppressive cytokines associated with tumor suppression and growth, respectively; and 

expression profile of a comprehensive panel of immune related genes in pre-treatment and GEN-1-treated tumor tissue. 
 
 We have initiated the OVATION Study at four clinical sites at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Oklahoma University Medical Center, Washington University in St. Louis and the Medical College of Wisconsin. During 2016 and 2017, we announced data from the first four cohorts of patients in the OVATION Study, respectively. The first four cohorts each enrolled three patients. Enrollment of three additional patients in the fourth cohort is ongoing, and Celsion expects to complete the OVATION Study in the first half of 2017. Future studies of GEN-1 may include a Phase I/II study combining GEN-1 with Avastin and Doxil . The results of the OVATION Study to date are as follows: 
 
 Totali ty of Results in the First Four Cohorts 

Of the first twelve patients dosed, one (1) patient demonstrated a complete response CR ), eight (8) patients demonstrated partial response PR and three patients demonstrated stable disease SD ), as measured by RECIST criteria. This translates to a 100 disease control rate DCR and 75 objective response rate ORR ). 

Eleven patients had successful resections of their tumors, with six (6) patients having an R0 resection, which indicates a microscopically margin-negative resection in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the tumor bed, and four (4) patients with a R1 resection, indicating microscopic residual tumor. One patient had an R2, indicating macroscopic residual tumor. One patient in the second cohort was ineligible for debulking surgery due to a medical complication unrelated to the study or the study drug. 

Of the eleven surgically treated and evaluable patients, one patient demonstrated a complete pathological response cPR ), five (5) patients demonstrated a micro pathological response microPR ), and five (5) patients demonstrated a macroPR. These data compare favorably to historical data, which indicate that cPRs are typically seen in less than 7 of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. cPRs have been associated with a median overall survival of 72 months, which is more than three years longer than those who do not experience a cPR. In addition, microPRs are seen in approximately 30 of patients, and are associated with a median overall survival of 38 months. 

All eleven patients who completed treatment follow-up experienced a dramatic (greater than 90 drop in their CA-125 protein levels as of their most recent study visit. CA-125 is used to monitor certain cancers during and after treatment. CA-125 is present in greater concentrations in ovarian cancer cells than in other cells. A 50 reduction in CA-125 levels is considered meaningful.

Top Line Translational Data from First Two Cohorts 
 
 Celsion also reported initial translational data from the first two cohorts of patients. Tumor and blood samples collected before the start of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy NACT and after the completion of GEN-1 treatment at debulking surgery are being analyzed for immune cell populations. Top line data demonstrates intriguing immunological changes in the tumor that are consistent with the activation of the immune system. Specifically, 

In tumor tissue, there was an increase in cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell density in three out of four evaluable patients at debulking surgery. There was a decrease in immunosuppressive FoxP3+ T-cells in two out of those 4 patients. The ratio of CD8+/FoxP3+ cells was increased in all four evaluable patients. High tumor infiltrating CD8+ T-cell density, low FoxP3+ T-cell density or high CD8+/FoxP3+ ratio demonstrate a potential shift in tumor environment to favoring immune stimulation following NACT + GEN-1 therapy. For the remaining two patients the post-treatment tumor tissue was not available. In one of those two patients there was complete pathological response hence no tumor tissue was present to provide a post-treatment comparison. In the other patient the debulking surgery was not performed due to disease related complications. 

In plasma samples, there was no significant change in T-cell density following the treatment. The density of myeloid derived suppressor cells that are associated with immunosuppression in ovarian cancer were either decreased or did not increase in post-treatment samples. 
 
 Additional immune analysis of biological tissue including cytokine ELISA from the first two patient cohorts and a complete analysis of the two higher dose cohorts is in progress. We expect to report the final clinical and translational data from the OVATION Study in mid-2017. 
 
 GEN-1 Plus Doxil and Avastin Trial. On April 29, 2015, we announced the expansion of our ovarian cancer development program to include a Phase I dose escalating trial to evaluate GEN-1 in combination with Avastin and Doxil in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients. This new combination study in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is supported by three preclinical studies indicating that the combination of GEN-1 with Avastin may result in significant clinical benefit with a favorable safety profile. Specifically: 

In two preclinical studies using an animal model of disseminated ovarian cancer, GEN-1 in combination with Avastin led to a significant reduction in tumor burden and disease progression. The effectiveness of the combined treatment was seen when GEN-1 was combined with various dose levels of Avastin (low-medium-high). Additionally, it was shown that GEN-1 treatment alone resulted in anti-tumor activity that was as good as or better than Avastin treatment alone. 

The preclinical studies indicated that no obvious overt toxicities were associated with the combined treatments of GEN-1 and Avastin . The preclinical data are also consistent with the mechanism of action for GEN-1, which exhibits certain anti-angiogenic properties and suggests that combining GEN-1 with lower doses of Avastin may enhance efficacy and help reduce the known toxicities associated with this anti-VEGF drug. 

The distinct biological activities of GEN-1 (immune stimulation) and Avastin (inhibition of tumor blood vessel formation) also suggests scientific rationale for this combination approach. Additionally, the anti-angiogenic activity of GEN-1 mediated through up regulation of the interferon gamma IFN-g pathway may help to explain the synergy between GEN-1 and Avastin and potentially addresses the VEGF escape mechanisms associated with resistance to Avastin therapy. 
 
 TheraPlas Technology Platform. TheraPlas is a technology platform for the delivery of DNA and messenger RNA mRNA therapeutics via synthetic non-viral carriers and is capable of providing cell transfection for double-stranded DNA plasmids and large therapeutic RNA segments such as mRNA. There are two components of the TheraPlas system, a plasmid DNA or mRNA payload encoding a therapeutic protein and a delivery system. The delivery system is designed to protect the DNA/RNA from degradation and promote trafficking into cells and through intracellular compartments. We designed the delivery system of TheraPlas by chemically modifying the low molecular weight polymer to improve its gene transfer activity without increasing toxicity. We believe TheraPlas is a viable alternative to current approaches to gene delivery due to several distinguishing characteristics, including enhanced molecular versatility that allows for complex modifications to improve activity and safety. 
 
 Technology Development and Licensing Agreements. Our current efforts and resources are applied on the development and commercialization of cancer drugs including tumor-targeting chemotherapy treatments using focused heat energy in combination with heat-activated drug delivery systems, immunotherapies and RNA-based therapies. To support our research and development, we raised gross proceeds of approximately 127.2 million in equity financings and warrant and option exercises in the years 2010 through 2015. During 2016, we raised gross proceeds of 7.8 million through two registered direct equity financings with several institutional investors. We had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and interest receivable totaling 4.3 million at December 31, 2016. We have one credit facility for a total principle amount of up to 20 million and have drawn down 10 million under this credit facility.

In June 2012, Celsion and Zhejiand Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd Hisun signed a long-term commercial supply agreement for the production of ThermoDox . Hisun is one the largest manufacturers of chemotherapy agents globally, including doxorubicin. In July 2013, the ThermoDox collaboration was expanded to focus on next generation liposomal formulation development with the goal of creating safer, more efficacious versions of marketed cancer chemotherapeutics. During 2015, Hisun successfully completed the manufacture of three registration batches for ThermoDox and has obtained regulatory approvals to supply ThermoDox to participating clinical trial sites in all of the countries of South East Asia, Europe and North America, as well as to the European Union countries allowing for early access to ThermoDox . The future manufacturing of clinical and commercial supplies by Hisun will result in a cost structure allowing Celsion to profitably access all global markets, including third world countries, and help accelerate the Company s product development program in China for ThermoDox in primary liver cancer and other approved indications. 
 
 On August 8, 2016, we signed a Technology Transfer, Manufacturing and Commercial Supply Agreement (the GEN-1 Agreement with Hisun to pursue an expanded partnership for the technology transfer relating to the clinical and commercial manufacture and supply of GEN-1, for the greater China territory, with the option to expand into other countries in the rest of the world after all necessary regulatory approvals are obtained. The GEN-1 Agreement will help to support supply for both ongoing and planned clinical studies in the U.S., and for potential future studies of GEN-1 in China. GEN-1 is currently being evaluated by Celsion in first line ovarian cancer patients. 
 
 Key provisions of the GEN-1 Agreement are as follows: 

the GEN-1 Agreement has targeted unit costs for clinical supplies of GEN-1 that are substantially competitive with the Company s current suppliers; 

once approved, the cost structure for GEN-1 will support rapid market adoption and significant gross margins across global markets; 

Celsion will provide Hisun a certain percentage of China s commercial unit demand, and separately of global commercial unit demand, subject to regulatory approval; 

Hisun and Celsion will commence technology transfer activities relating to the manufacture of GEN-1, including all studies required by CFDA for site approval; and 

Hisun will collaborate with Celsion around the regulatory approval activities for GEN-1 with the CFDA. A local China partner affords Celsion access to accelerated CFDA review and potential regulatory exclusivity for the approved indication. 
 
 As a result of the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, among others, we are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when, if ever, and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product. Our inability to complete any of our research and development activities, preclinical studies or clinical trials in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements when appropriate could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity. While our estimated future capital requirements are uncertain and could increase or decrease as a result of many factors, including the extent to which we choose to advance our research, development activities, preclinical studies and clinical trials, or if we are in a position to pursue manufacturing or commercialization activities, we will need significant additional capital to develop our product candidates through development and clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and manufacture and commercialize approved products, if any. We do not know whether we will be able to access additional capital when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future success of our business. 
 
 As a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, our business and our ability to execute our strategy to achieve our corporate goals are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Material risks and uncertainties relating to our business and our industry are described in " Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors " in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

THERMODOX (DOXORUBICIN ENCAPSULATED IN HEAT-ACTIVATED LIPOSOME) 
 
 Liposomes are manufactured submicroscopic vesicles consisting of a discrete aqueous central compartment surrounded by a membrane bilayer composed of naturally occurring lipids. Conventional liposomes have been designed and manufactured to carry drugs and increase residence time, thus allowing the drugs to remain in the bloodstream for extended periods of time before they are removed from the body. However, the current existing liposomal formulations of cancer drugs and liposomal cancer drugs under development do not provide for the immediate release of the drug and the direct targeting of organ specific tumors, two important characteristics that are required for improving the efficacy of cancer drugs such as doxorubicin. A team of research scientists at Duke University developed a heat-sensitive liposome that rapidly changes its structure when heated to a threshold minimum temperature of 39.5 to 42 Celsius. Heating creates channels in the liposome bilayer that allow an encapsulated drug to rapidly disperse into the surrounding tissue. Through a perpetual, world-wide, exclusive development and commercialization license from Duke University, Celsion has licensed this novel, heat-activated liposomal technology that is differentiated from other liposomes through its unique low heat-activated release of encapsulated chemotherapeutic agents. 
 
 We are using several available focused-heat technologies, such as radio frequency ablation (RFA), microwave energy and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), to activate the release of drugs from our novel heat sensitive liposomes. 
 
 THERMODOX IN RELATION TO PRIMARY LIVER CANCER 
 
 Liver Cancer Overview 
 
 Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC) is one of the most common and deadliest forms of cancer worldwide. It ranks as the third most common solid tumor cancer. It is estimated that up to 90 of liver cancer patients will die within five years of diagnosis. The incidence of primary liver cancer is approximately 30,000 cases per year in the U.S., approximately 40,000 cases per year in Europe and is rapidly growing worldwide at approximately 850,000 cases per year. HCC has the fastest rate of growth of all cancers and is projected to be the most prevalent form of cancer by 2020. HCC is commonly diagnosed in patients with longstanding hepatic disease and cirrhosis (primarily due to hepatitis C in the U.S. and Europe and hepatitis B in Asia). 
 
 At an early stage, the standard first line treatment for liver cancer is surgical resection of the tumor. Up to 80 of patients are ineligible for surgery or transplantation at time of diagnosis because early stage liver cancer generally has few symptoms and when finally detected the tumor frequently is too large for surgical resection. There are few alternative treatments, since radiation therapy and chemotherapy are largely ineffective in treating liver cancer. For tumors generally up to 5 centimeters in diameter, RFA has emerged as the standard of care treatment which directly destroys the tumor tissue through the application of high temperatures administered by a probe inserted into the core of the tumor. Local recurrence rates after RFA directly correlate to the size of the tumor. For tumors 3 cm or smaller in diameter the recurrence rate has been reported to be 10 20 ; however, for tumors greater than 3 cm, local recurrence rates of 40 or higher have been observed. 
 
 Celsion s Approach 
 
 While RFA uses extremely high temperatures (greater than 80 Celsius) to ablate the tumor, it may fail to treat micro-metastases in the outer margins of the ablation zone because temperatures in the periphery may not be high enough to destroy cancer cells. Celsion s ThermoDox treatment approach is designed to utilize the ability of RFA devices to ablate the center of the tumor while simultaneously thermally activating our ThermoDox liposome to release its encapsulated doxorubicin to kill remaining viable cancer cells throughout the heated region, including the tumor ablation margins. This novel treatment approach is intended to deliver the drug directly to those cancer cells that survive RFA. This approach is designed to increase the delivery of the doxorubicin at the desired tumor site while potentially reducing drug exposure distant to the tumor site. 
 
 Phase I Clinical Trial - Primary Liver Cancer 
 
 In the second quarter of 2007, we completed our first Phase I single dose escalation clinical trial that investigated ThermoDox in combination with RFA for the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancer. The study was carried out at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong. 
 
 In 2007 we initiated a second Phase I dose escalation study designed to investigate simplification of the current RFA/ThermoDox treatment regimen including a single vial formulation of ThermoDox designed for commercial distribution. The study also permitted multiple dosing in liver cancer patients. This clinical trial was completed in 2008.

701 Patient Phase III Global Clinical Trial - Primary Liver Cancer (The HEAT Study) 
 
 The HEAT Study for ThermoDox , in combination with RFA, was conducted in patients with primary liver cancer under a Special Protocol Assessment agreed to with the FDA. The Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreed to with the FDA specified PFS as the HEAT Study s primary endpoint. We scheduled a meeting with the HEAT Study independent Data Monitoring Committee iDMC on January 30, 2013 in order to conduct an analysis of the HEAT Study s PFS endpoint. Following review by the iDMC, on January 31, 2013, we announced that ThermoDox in combination with RFA did not meet the HEAT Study s primary endpoint of PFS. Specifically, we determined, after conferring with the iDMC, that the HEAT Study did not meet the goal of demonstrating persuasive evidence of clinical effectiveness that could form the basis for regulatory approval in the population chosen for the HEAT Study. The HEAT Study was designed to show a 33 percent improvement in PFS with 80 percent power and a p-value = 0.05. In the trial, ThermoDox was well-tolerated with no unexpected serious adverse events. 
 
 As provided for in the SPA, we continued to follow patients enrolled in the HEAT Study to the secondary endpoint of Overall Survival (OS). We have evaluated data from nine sweeps of OS since the announcement of the HEAT Study s primary endpoint result, with each showing progressive improvement in statistical significance. The most recent post-hoc OS analysis from the HEAT Study (as of July 15, 2016 and announced on August 15, 2016) demonstrated that in a large, well bounded subgroup of patients (n=285, 41 of the study patients), the combination of ThermoDox and optimized RFA provided a 54 risk improvement in OS compared to optimized RFA alone. The Hazard Ratio at this latest OS analysis is 0.65 (95 CI 0.45 - 0.94) with a p-value of 0.02. Median OS for the ThermoDox group has been reached which translates into a two year survival benefit over the optimized RFA group (projected to be greater than 80 months for the ThermoDox plus optimized RFA group compared to less than 60 months projection for the optimized RFA only group). These data continue to strongly suggest that ThermoDox may significantly improve OS compared to a RFA control in patients whose lesions undergo optimized RFA treatment for 45 minutes or more as well as support the protocol for our Phase III OPTIMA Study as described below. 
 
 While this information should be viewed with caution since it is based on a retrospective analysis of a subgroup, we also conducted additional analyses that may further strengthen the evidence for the HEAT Study sub-group. We commissioned an independent computational model at the University of South Carolina Medical School. The results unequivocally indicate that longer RFA heating times correlate with significant increases in doxorubicin concentration around the RFA treated tissue. In addition, we conducted a prospective preclinical study in 21 pigs using two different manufacturers of RFA and human equivalent doses of ThermoDox that clearly support the relationship between increased heating duration and doxorubicin concentrations. 
 
 550 Patient Phase III Global Clinical Trial - Primary Liver Cancer (The OPTIMA Study) 
 
 Based on the OS data from the post-hoc analysis of results from the HEAT Study discussed above, we submitted our proposed pivotal Phase III clinical protocol for FDA review in the fourth quarter of 2013. On February 24, 2014, we announced that the FDA, after its customary 30 day review period, accepted without comment, subject to compliance with regulatory standards, clearance for the OPTIMA Study, our pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial of ThermoDox in combination with standardized RFA in primary liver cancer. The OPTIMA Study represents an evaluation of ThermoDox in combination with a first line therapy, RFA, for newly diagnosed, intermediate stage HCC patients. HCC incidence globally is approximately 800,000 new cases per year. Approximately only 30 of newly diagnosed patients can be addressed with RFA alone. The OPTIMA Study is supported with a convincing hypothesis developed from an overall survival analysis of a large subgroup of patients from the HEAT Study. 
 
 Designed with extensive input from globally recognized HCC researchers and clinicians and after formal written consultation with the FDA, the OPTIMA Study was launched in the first half of 2014. The OPTIMA Study is expected to enroll up to 550 patients globally at up to 75 sites in the U.S., Canada, European Union, China and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region, and will evaluate ThermoDox in combination with standardized RFA, which will require a minimum of 45 minutes across all investigators and clinical sites for treating lesions 3 to 7 centimeters, versus standardized RFA alone. The primary endpoint for the trial is Overall Survival, and the secondary endpoints for the trial are PFS and safety. The OPTIMA Study is 80 powered to show a 33 improvement in OS. The statistical plan calls for two interim efficacy analyses by an independent iDMC. 

9

On December 16, 2015, we announced that we had received the clinical trial application approval from the CFDA to conduct the OPTIMA Study in China. This clinical trial application approval will now allow Celsion to enroll patients at up to 20 clinical sites in China. With the addition of these Chinese clinical sites, the Company expects to complete enrollment in the OPTIMA Study during the first half of 2018. On April 26, 2016, we announced that the first patient in China has been enrolled in the OPTIMA Study. Results from the OPTIMA Study, if successful, will provide the basis for a global registration filing and marketing approval. 
 
 On November 29, 2016, the Company announced the results of an independent analysis conducted by the National Institutes of Health (the NIH from the HEAT Study which reaffirmed the correlation between increased RFA burn time per tumor volume and improvements in overall survival. The NIH analysis, which sought to evaluate the correlation between RFA burn time per tumor volume (min/ml) and clinical outcome, concluded that increased burn time per tumor volume significantly improved overall survival in patients treated with RFA plus ThermoDox compared to patients treated with RFA alone. 
 
 We will continue with partnerships, such as our arrangement with Hisun and Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd. Yakult to the extent feasible. In addition, we have assessed our product pipeline and research and development priorities. As we evaluate strategic alternatives, we will need to consider a number of factors, including investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, technologies or products, possible capital raising transactions, partnering opportunities and working capital requirements. However, as demonstrated by the HEAT Study results announced on January 31, 2013, drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval. The timing and the outcome of clinical results is extremely difficult to predict. Clinical development successes and failures can have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects, financial prospects, financial condition and market value. 
 
 THERMODOX IN RELATION TO CANCERS OTHER THAN PRIMARY LIVER CANCER 
 
 Recurrent Chest Wall (RCW) Breast Cancer Overview 
 
 Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in both the U.S. and the world. Despite a variety of therapeutic approaches, up to 40 of the estimated 95,000 patients in the U.S. undergoing a mastectomy as their primary treatment will develop locally recurrent RCW breast cancer. There is currently no effective chemotherapeutic standard of care for RCW breast cancer and as a result, many of these patients will die within two years of the recurrence. Patients with RCW breast cancer suffer from disfiguring tumors and other symptoms including pain, foul-smelling wounds, and a very visual reminder of tumor progression. 
 
 Celsion s Approach 
 
 We have been actively seeking a targeted localized treatment for breast cancer using ThermoDox in conjunction with localized microwave hyperthermia to treat RCW breast cancer. Studies at Duke University and other centers have indicated that heat may improve the therapeutic action of non-temperature sensitive liposomal doxorubicin formulations in advanced loco-regional breast cancer. Our liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin is released by heat generated from an external microwave tissue hyperthermia device that is placed on a woman s chest. The microwave hyperthermia heats the target to a temperature adequate to activate ThermoDox but not to ablate the tissue like RFA. Upon heating to 39.5 to 42 C, a significant concentration of doxorubicin is released directly to the tumor. As in our liver cancer program, we use a commercially available thermotherapy device to heat the target tissue and activate ThermoDox at the desired target site. 
 
 Microwave hyperthermia as a separate standalone treatment has been found to have the ability to kill breast cancer cells. Because breast cancer cells have higher water content than surrounding normal cells, the tumor is heated to a greater extent than normal breast tissue and is selectively destroyed. Therefore, heating cancer cells with a microwave device for sixty minutes at 43 C has been found to be tumoricidal. We expect that the combination of microwave hyperthermia and ThermoDox will be more efficacious than microwave hyperthermia alone or treatment with existing non-heat activated liposomal formulations. 
 
 Breast Cancer Phase I/II Clinical Trial - The DIGNITY Study 
 
 In 2009, the Company commenced an open label, dose-escalating ThermoDox Phase I/Phase II clinical trial for patients with RCW breast cancer (the DIGNITY Study). The DIGNITY Study is designed to establish a safe therapeutic dose in Phase I, and in Phase II to demonstrate local control, including complete and partial responses, and stable disease as its primary endpoint. The DIGNITY Study is also planned to evaluate kinetics in ThermoDox produced from more than one manufacturing site. 

10

The Company completed enrollment of the Phase I portion of the study in 2010. The enrollment of the Phase II portion of the DIGNITY Study commenced in the first quarter of 2013 and completed in mid-2015. The trial evaluated ThermoDox in combination with mild hyperthermia and enrolled 28 patients at five clinical sites in the U.S. in both phases of the study. On December 14, 2015, we announced final data from the DIGNITY Study of ThermoDox in RCW Breast Cancer at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Of the 28 patients enrolled and treated, 21 patients were eligible for evaluation of efficacy. Thirteen patients, representing approximately 62 of the evaluable patients, experienced a local response, including six complete responses and seven partial responses. These data are consistent with the combined clinical data from the two previous Phase I trials discussed below. 
 
 Duke University also conducted a Phase I dose escalating ThermoDox study in patients with RCW breast cancer and has presented preliminary results from the 16 enrolled patients that characterize the safety of the drug in RCW patients and the feasibility of ThermoDox administration in these patients. In December 2013, we announced combined clinical data from our DIGNITY study and the Duke University sponsored Phase I trial of ThermoDox plus hyperthermia in RCW breast cancer. The two similarly designed Phase I studies enrolled patients with highly resistant tumors found on the chest wall and who had progressed on previous therapy including chemotherapy, radiation therapy and hormone therapy. ThermoDox in combination with mild hyperthermia was evaluated in these patients in up to six cycles. Both studies employed an open label 3+3 dose escalation study design to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose, evaluate safety and determine early effects of ThermoDox in combination with mild hyperthermia. There were 29 patients treated in the two trials, including 11 patients in the DIGNITY Study and 18 patients in the Duke study. Of the 29 patients, 23 were eligible for evaluation of efficacy. A local response rate of over 60 percent was reported in 14 of the 23 evaluable patients with five complete responses and nine partial responses. 
 
 Breast Cancer Phase II Clinical Trial - The Euro-DIGNITY Study 
 
 The Company anticipates that a Phase II study of RadioTherapy, HyperThermia and ThermoDox to treat patients with local-regional recurrent chest wall breast cancer will be initiated by five to six clinical sites located in Italy, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, and the Czech Republic (the Euro-DIGNITY Study). The Euro-DIGNITY Study is expected to commence in 2017 and is expected to enroll up to 70 patients affected by recurrent breast adenocarcinoma on the chest wall with/without nodes over a period of two years. 
 
 The primary objectives of the Euro-DIGNITY Study will be (i) to evaluate efficacy in patients after 3 cycles of ThermoDox plus Hyperthermia measuring tumor diameter as a response to therapy and (ii) to evaluate loco-regional breast tumor control in patients who undergo ThermoDox /hyperthermia/radiotherapy as measured by target lesion clinical response rate combining a RECIST criteria with digital photography to gauge response. 
 
 Secondary objectives of the Euro-DIGNITY Study will be (i) to evaluate the safety of the combination of ThermoDox /Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy among patients with local-regional recurrence (LRR) breast cancer, (ii) to evaluate the duration of local control complete response, partial response and stable disease following treatment with ThermoDox /Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy up to 24 months among patients with LRR breast cancer and (iii) to assess Patient Reported Quality of Life using the FACT-B and Brief Pain Inventory following treatment with ThermoDox /Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy among patients with LRR breast cancer. 
 
 GEN-1 (IL-12 DNA PLASMID VECTOR ENCASED IN A NANOPARTICLE DELIVERY SYSTEM) 
 
 On June 20, 2014, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of EGEN. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, CLSN Laboratories acquired all of EGEN s right, title and interest in and to substantially all of the assets of EGEN, including cash and cash equivalents, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, clinical data, certain contracts, licenses and permits, equipment, furniture, office equipment, furnishings, supplies and other tangible personal property. In addition, CLSN Laboratories assumed certain specified liabilities of EGEN, including the liabilities arising out of the acquired contracts and other assets relating to periods after the closing date. The Asset Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties regarding EGEN and Celsion, covenants regarding the conduct of EGEN s business prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, indemnification provisions, termination and other provisions customary for transactions of this nature. 
 
 In the acquisition, we acquired GEN-1, an IL-12 DNA plasmid vector encased in a nanoparticle delivery system which enables cell transfection followed by persistent, local secretion of the IL-12 protein, and two platform technologies for the development of treatments for those suffering with difficult-to-treat forms of cancer, novel nucleic acid-based immunotherapies and other anti-cancer DNA or RNA therapies, including TheraPlas and TheraSilence.

Ovarian Cancer Overview 
 
 Ovarian cancer is the most lethal of gynecological malignancies among women with an overall five year survival rate of 45 . This poor outcome is due in part to the lack of effective prevention and early detection strategies. There were approximately 22,000 new cases of ovarian cancer in the U.S. in 2014 with an estimated 14,000 deaths. Mortality rates for ovarian cancer declined very little in the last forty years due to the unavailability of detection tests and improved treatments. Most women with ovarian cancer are not diagnosed until Stages III or IV, when the disease has spread outside the pelvis to the abdomen and areas beyond causing swelling and pain, where the five-year survival rates are 25 to 41 percent and 11 percent, respectively. First-line chemotherapy regimens are typically platinum-based combination therapies. Although this first line of treatment has an approximate 80 percent response rate, 55 to 75 percent of women will develop recurrent ovarian cancer within two years and ultimately will not respond to platinum therapy. Patients whose cancer recurs or progresses after initially responding to surgery and first-line chemotherapy have been divided into one of the two groups based on the time from completion of platinum therapy to disease recurrence or progression. This time period is referred to as platinum-free interval. The platinum-sensitive group has a platinum-free interval of longer than six months. This group generally responds to additional treatment with platinum-based therapies. The platinum-resistant group has a platinum-free interval of shorter than six months and is resistant to additional platinum-based treatments. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, and Avastin are the only approved second-line therapies for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The overall response rate for these therapies is 10 to 20 percent with median overall survival of eleven to twelve months. Immunotherapy is an attractive novel approach for the treatment of ovarian cancer particularly since ovarian cancers are considered immunogenic tumors. IL-12 is one of the most active cytokines for the induction of potent anti-cancer immunity acting through the induction of T-lymphocyte and natural killer cell proliferation. The precedence for a therapeutic role of IL-12 in ovarian cancer is based on epidemiologic and preclinical data. 
 
 Celsion s Approach 
 
 Celsion s GEN-1 approach for IL-12 delivery is designed to achieve local concentrations of IL-12 at the tumor site with minimal increases in systemic circulation. This DNA-based approach involves intraperitoneal administration of an IL-12 plasmid formulated with a proprietary lipopolymer delivery system PEG-PEI-Cholesterol. In this approach, our GEN-1 immunotherapy is combined with standard chemotherapy drugs to achieve better clinical outcome than with chemotherapy alone. Increases in IL-12 concentrations at the tumor site for several days (up to one week) after a single administration will create a potent immune environment against the tumor and a direct killing of the tumor with concomitant use of cytotoxic chemotherapy together will result in more robust and durable antitumor response than chemotherapy alone. The activation of the body s immune system will potentially eliminate the chemotherapy resistant cells and lower the risk of recurrence. 
 
 GEN-1 OVATION Study 
 
 We have initiated a Phase I dose-escalation clinical trial of GEN-1 in combination with the standard of care in neo-adjuvant ovarian cancer (the OVATION Study) at four clinical sites, including the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Oklahoma University Medical Center, Washington University in St. Louis and the Medical College of Wisconsin. The OVATION Study will seek to identify a safe, tolerable and therapeutically active dose of GEN-1 in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients who will be undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of their tumors. The trial is expected to enroll three to six patients per dose level and will evaluate safety and efficacy and attempt to define an optimal dose for a follow-on Phase I/II study combining GEN-1 with Avastin and Doxil . In addition, the OVATION Study establishes a unique opportunity to assess how cytokine-based compounds such as GEN-1, directly affects ovarian cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment in newly diagnosed patients. The study is designed to characterize the nature of the immune response triggered by GEN-1 at various levels of the patient s immune system, including: 

infiltration of cancer fighting T-cell lymphocytes into primary tumor and tumor microenvironment including peritoneal cavity, which is the primary site of metastasis of ovarian cancer; 

changes in local and systemic levels of immuno-stimulatory and immunosuppressive cytokines associated with tumor suppression and growth, respectively; and 

expression profile of a comprehensive panel of immune related genes in pre-treatment and GEN-1-treated tumor tissue. 

12

These extensive mechanistic studies will assist in the design of novel combination approaches with immunotherapies and other anti-cancer agents driven by potential synergistic action mechanisms, and define an enhanced patient population based on molecular characteristics inherent to tumor tissue or the immune system. 
 
 In 2016 and early 2017, we announced data from the first four cohorts of patients in the OVATION Study. The OVATION Study is designed to enroll three to six patients per dose cohort and will continue into 2017 with the goal to identify a safe, tolerable and therapeutically active dose of GEN-1 by recruiting and maximizing an immune response. The first four cohorts each enrolled three patients. Enrollment of three additional patients in the fourth cohort is ongoing, and Celsion expects to complete the OVATION Study in the first half of 2017. Future studies of GEN-1 will include a Phase I/II study combining GEN-1 with Avastin and Doxil . The results of the OVATION Study to date are as follows: 
 
 Totali ty of Results in the First Four Cohorts 

Of the first twelve patients dosed, one (1) patient demonstrated a complete response CR ), eight (8) patients demonstrated partial response PR and three patients demonstrated stable disease SD ), as measured by RECIST criteria. This translates to a 100 disease control rate DCR and 75 objective response rate ORR ). 

Eleven patients had successful resections of their tumors, with six (6) patients having an R0 resection, which indicates a microscopically margin-negative resection in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the tumor bed, and four (4) patients with a R1 resection, indicating microscopic residual tumor. One patient had an R2, indicating macroscopic residual tumor. One patient in the second cohort was ineligible for debulking surgery due to a medical complication unrelated to the study or the study drug. 

Of the eleven surgically treated and evaluable patients, one patient demonstrated a complete pathological response cPR ), five (5) patients demonstrated a micro pathological response microPR ), and five (5) patients demonstrated a macroPR. These data compare favorably to historical data, which indicate that cPRs are typically seen in less than 7 of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. cPRs have been associated with a median overall survival of 72 months, which is more than three years longer than those who do not experience a cPR. In addition, microPRs are seen in approximately 30 of patients, and are associated with a median overall survival of 38 months. 

All eleven patients who completed treatment follow-up experienced a dramatic (greater than 90 drop in their CA-125 protein levels as of their most recent study visit. CA-125 is used to monitor certain cancers during and after treatment. CA-125 is present in greater concentrations in ovarian cancer cells than in other cells. A 50 reduction in CA-125 levels is considered meaningful. 
 
 Top Line Translational Data from First Two Cohorts 
 
 Celsion also reported initial translational data from the first two cohorts of patients. Tumor and blood samples collected before the start of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy NACT and after the completion of GEN-1 treatment at debulking surgery are being analyzed for immune cell populations. Top line data demonstrates intriguing immunological changes in the tumor that are consistent with the activation of the immune system. Specifically, 

In tumor tissue, there was an increase in cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell density in three out of four evaluable patients at debulking surgery. There was a decrease in immunosuppressive FoxP3+ T-cells in two out of those 4 patients. The ratio of CD8+/FoxP3+ cells was increased in all four evaluable patients. High tumor infiltrating CD8+ T-cell density, low FoxP3+ T-cell density or high CD8+/FoxP3+ ratio demonstrate a potential shift in tumor environment to favoring immune stimulation following NACT + GEN-1 therapy. For the remaining two patients the post-treatment tumor tissue was not available. In one of those two patients there was complete pathological response hence no tumor tissue was present to provide a post-treatment comparison. In the other patient the debulking surgery was not performed due to disease related complications. 

In plasma samples, there was no significant change in T-cell density following the treatment. The density of myeloid derived suppressor cells that are associated with immunosuppression in ovarian cancer were either decreased or did not increase in post-treatment samples. 

13

Additional immune analysis of biological tissue including cytokine ELISA from the first two patient cohorts and a complete analysis of the two higher dose cohorts is in progress. We expect to report the final clinical and translational data from the OVATION Study in mid-2017. 
 
 GEN-1 + Avastin + Doxil Combination Study in Platinum Resistant Ovarian Cancer 
 
 In April 2015, we announced plans to expand our ovarian cancer development program to include a Phase 1 dose escalating trial evaluating GEN-1 in combination with Avastin and Doxil in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients. 
 
 This new combination study in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is supported by three preclinical studies indicating that the combination of GEN-1 with Avastin may result in clinical benefit with a favorable safety profile, as well as the prior Phase 1b trial of GEN-1 plus Doxil in platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients. Specifically: 

In two preclinical studies using an animal model of disseminated ovarian cancer, GEN-1 in combination with Avastin led to a significant reduction in tumor burden and disease progression. The effectiveness of the combined treatment was seen when GEN-1 was combined with various dose levels of Avastin (low-medium-high). Additionally, it was shown that GEN-1 treatment alone resulted in anti-tumor activity that was as good as or better than Avastin treatment alone. 

The preclinical studies indicated that no obvious overt toxicities were associated with the combined treatments. The preclinical data are also consistent with the mechanism of action for GEN-1, which exhibits certain anti-angiogenic properties and suggests that combining GEN-1 with lower doses of Avastin may enhance efficacy and help reduce the known toxicities associated with this anti-VEGF drug. 

The distinct biological activities of GEN-1 (immune stimulation) and Avastin (inhibition of tumor blood vessel formation) makes a sound scientific rationale for this combination approach. Additionally, the anti-angiogenic activity of GEN-1 mediated through up regulation of the interferon gamma (IFN-g) pathway may help to explain the remarkable synergy between GEN-1 and Avastin and potentially addresses the VEGF escape mechanisms associated with resistance to Avastin therapy. 

In a 16-patient Phase 1b study of GEN-1 in combination study in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, there were no overlapping toxicities between GEN-1 and pegylated doxorubicin (Doxil ). Biological activity and clinical efficacy results, including disease control rates, translational data and survival rates, have been submitted for presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncologist (ASCO) Annual Meeting. 
 
 On October 12, 2015, we announced the results of an additional preclinical study to support an Investigational New Drug filing with the FDA for the planned Phase I/II combination study. The study will be designed to optimize the dosing regimen for GEN-1 in combination with Avastin + Doxil and is expected to enroll approximately 12 to 18 patients. Results from the comprehensive preclinical studies showed that GEN-1 when combined with Avastin and Doxil , standard of care for platinum resistant patients, indicated a greater than 98 reduction in tumor burden when compared to the untreated control group. The findings represent a reduction in tumor burden and disease progression when compared to the combination of Avastin and Doxil in a SKOV3 human cell line implanted into immunocompromised (nude) mice. The study was designed to evaluate in a mouse model of disseminated ovarian cancer, the efficacy of a combined treatment regimen that consisted of weekly administrations of GEN-1 with therapeutically relevant doses of Doxil and Avastin . 

14

In the study, the combination of GEN-1 with Avastin and Doxil showed a robust anti-tumor advantage compared to untreated animals as well as a statistically significant improvement over the combination of Avastin and Doxil as summarized below:

Analysis of serum chemistry and hematology suggested no overt toxicities associated with the combined treatments. The preclinical data are consistent with the mechanism of action for GEN-1, which exhibits certain anti-angiogenic properties in addition to its well-characterized immunomodulatory activities. 
 
 THERAPLAS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM 
 
 TheraPlas is a technology platform for the delivery of DNA and mRNA therapeutics via synthetic non-viral carriers and is capable of providing cell transfection for double-stranded DNA plasmids and large therapeutic RNA segments such as mRNA. There are two components of the TheraPlas system, a plasmid DNA or mRNA payload encoding a therapeutic protein, and a delivery system. The delivery system is designed to protect the DNA/RNA from degradation and promote trafficking into cells and through intracellular compartments. We designed the delivery system of TheraPlas by chemically modifying the low molecular weight polymer to improve its gene transfer activity without increasing toxicity. We believe that TheraPlas is a viable alternative to current approaches to gene delivery due to several distinguishing characteristics, including enhanced molecular versatility that allows for complex modifications to improve activity and safety. 
 
 The design of TheraPlas delivery systems is based on molecular functionalization of polyethyleneimine (PEI), a cationic delivery polymer with a distinct ability to escape from the endosomes due to heavy protonation. The transfection activity and toxicity of PEI is tightly coupled to its molecular weight therefore the clinical application of PEI is limited. We have used molecular functionalization strategies to improve the activity of low molecular weight PEIs without augmenting their cytotoxicity. In one instance, chemical conjugation of a low molecular weight branched BPEI1800 with cholesterol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to form PEG-PEI-Cholesterol (PPC) dramatically improved the transfection activity of BPEI1800 following in vivo delivery. Together, the cholesterol and PEG modifications produced approximately 20-fold enhancement in transfection activity. Biodistribution studies following intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration of DNA/PPC nanocomplexes showed DNA delivery localized primarily at the injection site with only small amount escaped into systemic circulation. PPC is the delivery component of our lead TheraPlas product, GEN-1, which is in clinical development for the treatment ovarian cancer and in preclinical development for the treatment of glioblastoma. The PPC manufacturing process has been scaled up from bench scale (1-2 g) to 0.6Kg, and several cGMP lots have been produced with reproducible quality. 
 
 Another approach to improve PEI activity involved crosslinking low-molecular-weight PEIs through degradable linkages to create larger and degradable structures. Two cross-linked polymers have been synthesized with this approach and optimized for transfection activity. Both cross-linked polymers expressed several fold higher transfection activity than their respective monomers and lower cyotoxicity than a commercially available 25 kDa polymer. One embodiment of the polymer is being developed for in vivo delivery of plasmid DNA and mRNA. Intravenous administration of the nanoparticles carrying DNA or mRNA payload in mice has produced expression with high degree of lung specificity. The lung specificity and safety for mRNA delivery following intravenous administration in mice has been confirmed in non-human primates. These results demonstrate potential clinical utility for delivery of therapeutic DNA and RNA for lung diseases and pulmonary disorders. 
 
 TheraPlas has emerged as a viable alternative to current approaches due to several distinguishing characteristics such as excellent molecular versatility that allows for complex modifications to improve activity and safety with little difficulty. The biocompatibility of these polymers reduces the risk of adverse immune response, thus allowing for repeated administration. Compared to naked DNA or cationic lipids, TheraPlas is generally safer, more efficient, and cost effective. We believe that these advantages place Celsion in an excellent position to capitalize on the technology.

BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN 
 
 We have not generated and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales in the next several years, if at all. An element of our business strategy has been to pursue, as resources permit, the research and development of a range of product candidates for a variety of indications. We may also evaluate licensing cancer products from third parties for cancer treatments to expand our current product pipeline. This is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures. To the extent we are unable to maintain a broad range of product candidates, our dependence on the success of one or a few product candidates would increase and results such as those announced in relation to the HEAT study on January 31, 2013 will have a more significant impact on our financial prospects, financial condition and market value. We may also consider and evaluate strategic alternatives, including investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, technologies or products. As demonstrated by the HEAT Study results, drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval. The timing and the outcome of clinical results are extremely difficult to predict. The success or failure of any preclinical development and clinical trial can have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, prospects and market value. 
 
 Our current business strategy includes the possibility of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates. In the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one or more of our product candidates, the estimated completion date would largely be under the control of that third party rather than us. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products or indications, if any, will be subject to future collaborative arrangements, in whole or in part, and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements. We may also apply for subsidies, grants or government or agency-sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs. 
 
 As of December 31, 2016, we have 4.3 million dollars in cash and short term investments. Given our development plans, we anticipate cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operations into mid-2017 and the Company has no committed sources of additional capital. The Company has a Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement (the ATM Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. (see Note 10). As a result of the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, among others, we are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when, if ever, and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product if one of our product candidates receives regulatory approval for marketing, if at all. Our inability to complete any of our research and development activities, preclinical studies or clinical trials in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements when appropriate could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity. While our estimated future capital requirements are uncertain and could increase or decrease as a result of many factors, including the extent to which we choose to advance our research and development activities, preclinical studies and clinical trials, or whether we are in a position to pursue manufacturing or commercialization activities, we will need significant additional capital to develop our product candidates through development and clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and manufacture and commercialize approved products, if any. We do not know whether we will be able to access additional capital when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future success of our business. Based on the above, management has determined there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph which expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation s for additional information regarding the Company s financial condition, liquidity and capital resources. 
 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES 
 
 We are engaged in a limited amount of research and development in our own facilities and have sponsored research programs in partnership with various research institutions, including the National Cancer Institute and Duke University. We are currently, with minimal cash expenditures, sponsoring clinical and pre-clinical research at the University of Oxford, University of Utrecht, Brigham and Women s Hospital and the University of Washington. The majority of the spending in research and development is for the funding of ThermoDox clinical trials. Research and development expenses were approximately 14.6 million and 14.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation s for additional information regarding expenditures related to our research and development programs.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 
 Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, quality control, approval, manufacturing, labeling, post-approval monitoring and reporting, recordkeeping, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources 
 
 Regulation in the United States 
 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable FDA requirements at any time pre- or post-approval may result in a delay of approval or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA's imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 The vehicle by which FDA approves a new pharmaceutical product for sale and marketing in the U.S. is a New Drug Application NDA ). The steps ordinarily required before a new drug can be marketed in the U.S. include (a) completion of pre-clinical and clinical studies; (b) submission and FDA acceptance of an Investigational New Drug application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence; (c) completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product to support each of its proposed indications; (d) submission and FDA acceptance of a NDA; and (e) FDA review and approval of the NDA. 
 
 Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies, to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. Pre-clinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA regulations regarding good laboratory practice. The results of pre-clinical tests are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and are reviewed by the FDA before the commencement of human clinical trials. Submission of an IND will not necessarily result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials, and the absence of FDA objection to an IND does not necessarily mean that the FDA will ultimately approve an NDA or that a product candidate otherwise will come to market. 
 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices under protocols submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and with patient informed consent. Also, each clinical trial must be approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB), and is subject to ongoing IRB monitoring. 
 
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase I clinical trials may be conducted in patients or healthy volunteers to evaluate the product's safety, dosage tolerance and pharmacokinetics and, if possible, seek to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase II clinical trials usually involve controlled trials in a larger but still relatively small number of subjects from the relevant patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks; and provide a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of the drug for specific indications. Phase III clinical trials are typically conducted in a significantly larger patient population and are intended to further evaluate safety and efficacy, establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. 
 
 There can be no assurance that any of our clinical trials will be completed successfully within any specified time period or at all. Either the FDA or we may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including among other things, if we, the FDA, or our independent DMC conclude that clinical subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA inspects and reviews clinical trial sites, informed consent forms, data from the clinical trial sites (including case report forms and record keeping procedures) and the performance of the protocols by clinical trial personnel to determine compliance with good clinical practices. The conduct of clinical trials is complex and difficult, and there can be no assurance that the design or the performance of the pivotal clinical trial protocols of any of our current or future product candidates will be successful. 

17

The results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, if successful, are submitted to FDA in the form of an NDA. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted for any product at any time, according to any schedule, or at all. The FDA may refuse to accept or approve an application if it determines that applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. The FDA may also require additional testing for safety and efficacy. Even, if regulatory approval is granted, the approval will be limited to specific indications. There can be no assurance that any of our current product candidates will receive regulatory approvals for marketing or, if approved, that approval will be for any or all of the indications that we request. 
 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 
 In 2009, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for ThermoDox for the treatment of HCC. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. However, if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug designation can also provide opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and FDA user-fee benefits. 
 
 Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity 
 
 The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety. During the exclusivity period, the FDA generally may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA referencing the new chemical entity may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. 
 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 
 After FDA approval of a product is obtained, we and our contract manufacturers are required to comply with various post-approval requirements, including establishment registration and product listing, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, providing updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling. As a condition of approval of an NDA, the FDA may require the applicant to conduct additional clinical trials or other post market testing and surveillance to further monitor and assess the drug's safety and efficacy. The FDA can also impose other post-marketing controls on us as well as our products including, but not limited to, restrictions on sale and use, through the approval process, regulations and otherwise. The FDA also has the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in manufacture. A governmentally mandated recall, or a voluntary recall by us, could result from a number of events or factors, including component failures, manufacturing errors, instability of product or defects in labeling. 
 
 In addition, manufacturing establishments in the U.S. and abroad are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and must comply with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). To maintain compliance with cGMP, manufacturers must expend funds, time and effort in the areas of production and quality control. 
 
 Regulation Outside of the U.S. 
 
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to regulations of other countries governing any clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union and China, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 

18

Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes and is optional for those medicines that are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 
 
 In 2011, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation for ThermoDox for the treatment of HCC in Europe. As established by the European Medicines Agency EMA ), orphan drug designation provides for scientific advice and regulatory assistance from the EMA, direct access to centralized marketing authorization and certain financial incentives, such as reduction of fees associated with pre-authorization inspections and marketing authorization application fees. The orphan drug designation in Europe also provides 10 years of market exclusivity subsequent to product approval. 
 
 MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY 
 
 We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of preclinical, clinical or commercial quantities of any of our product candidates. We currently contract with third party contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) for our preclinical and clinical trial supplies, and we expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical and any clinical requirements of our product candidates. We have agreements for the supply of such drug materials with manufacturers or suppliers that we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands. In addition, we believe that adequate alternative sources for such supplies exist. However, there is a risk that, if supplies are interrupted, it would materially harm our business. We typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements. 
 
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our CMOs manufacture our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) conditions. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans. 
 
 SALES AND MARKETING 
 
 Our current focus is on the development of our existing portfolio, the completion of clinical trials and, if and where appropriate, the registration of our product candidates. We currently do not have marketing, sales and distribution capabilities. If we receive marketing and commercialization approval for any of our product candidates, we intend to market the product either directly or through strategic alliances and distribution agreements with third parties. The ultimate implementation of our strategy for realizing the financial value of our product candidates is dependent on the results of clinical trials for our product candidates, the availability of regulatory approvals and the ability to negotiate acceptable commercial terms with third parties. 
 
 PRODUCT LIABILITY AND INSURANCE 
 
 Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products. We presently have product liability insurance limited to 10 million per incident, and if we were to be subject to a claim in excess of this coverage or to a claim not covered by our insurance and the claim succeeded, we would be required to pay the claim out of our own limited resources. 
 
 COMPETITION 
 
 Competition in the discovery and development of new methods for treating and preventing disease is intense. We face, and will continue to face, competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies both in the U.S. and abroad. We face significant competition from organizations pursuing the same or similar technologies used by us in our drug discovery efforts and from organizations developing pharmaceuticals that are competitive with our product candidates. 

19

Most of our competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs than we do. In addition, most of these organizations, either alone or together with their collaborators, have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products, undertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products, and manufacturing and marketing products. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among our competitors. These companies, as well as academic institutions, governmental agencies, and private research organizations, also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants. Our ability to compete successfully with other companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology field also depends on the status of our collaborations and on the continuing availability of capital to us. 
 
 ThermoDox 
 
 Although there are many drugs and devices marketed and under development for the treatment of cancer, the Company is not aware of any other heat activated drug delivery product either being marketed or in human clinical development. In addition, the Company is not aware of any other Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of HCC or primary liver cancer. 
 
 GEN-1 
 
 Studied indications for GEN-1 include ovarian cancer and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) brain cancer. In evaluating the competitive landscape for both indications, early stage indications are treated with chemotherapy (temozolomide, BCNU, CCNU for brain cancer; docetaxel, doxil and cisplatinum for ovarian cancer), while later stage ovarian and GBM cancer are treated with Bevacizumab - Avastin , an anti-angiogenesis inhibitor. Avastin is currently also being evaluated for early stage disease. 
 
 In product positioning for both indications, there currently is no direct immunotherapy competitor for GEN-1, which will be studied as an adjuvant to both chemotherapy standard of care regimens, as well as anti-angiogenesis compounds. To support these cases, we have conducted clinical studies in combination with chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, and preclinical studies in combination with both temozolomide and Bevacizumab-Avastin . 
 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 
 Licenses 
 
 Duke University License Agreement 
 
 In 1999, we entered into a license agreement with Duke University under which we received exclusive rights, subject to certain exceptions, to commercialize and use Duke s thermo-liposome technology. In relation to these liposome patents licensed from Duke University, we have filed two additional patents related to the formulation and use of liposomes. We have also licensed from Valentis, CA certain global rights covering the use of pegylation for temperature sensitive liposomes. 
 
 In 2003, our obligations under the license agreement with Duke University with respect to the testing and regulatory milestones and other licensed technology performance deadlines were eliminated in exchange for a payment of shares of our common stock. The license agreement continues to be subject to agreements to pay a royalty based upon future sales. In conjunction with the patent holder, we have filed international applications for a certain number of the U.S. patents. 
 
 Our rights under the license agreement with Duke University extend for the longer of 20 years or the end of any term for which any relevant patents are issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Currently we have rights to Duke s patent for its thermo-liposome technology in the U.S., which expires in 2018, and to future patents received by Duke in Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia, where it has patent applications have been granted. The European grant provides coverage in the European Community. For this technology, our license rights are worldwide, including the U.S., Canada, certain European countries, Australia, Hong Kong, and Japan. 
 
 Patents and Proprietary Rights 
 
 Celsion holds an exclusive license agreement with Duke University for its temperature-sensitive liposome technology that covers the ThermoDox formulation. Celsion also has issued patents which pertain specifically to methods of storing stabilized, temperature-sensitive liposomal formulations and will assist in the protection of global rights. These patents will extend the overall term of the ThermoDox patent portfolio to 2026. These patents are the first in this family, which includes pending applications in the U.S., Europe and additional key commercial geographies in Asia. This extended patent runway to 2026 allows for the evaluation of future development activities for ThermoDox and Celsion's heat-sensitive liposome technology platform. 

20

For the ThermoDox technology, we either exclusively license or own U.S. and international patents with claims and methods and compositions of matters that cover various aspects of lysolipid thermally-sensitive liposomes technology, with expiration dates ranging from 2018 to 2026. 
 
 For the TheraPlas technology, we own three U.S. and international patents and related applications with claims and methods and compositions of matters that cover various aspects of TheraPlas and GEN-1 technologies, with expiration dates ranging from 2020 to 2028. 
 
 There can be no assurance that an issued patent will remain valid and enforceable in a court of law through the entire patent term. Should the validity of a patent be challenged, the legal process associated with defending the patent can be costly and time consuming. Issued patents can be subject to oppositions, interferences and other third party challenges that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant or broad coverage). Competitors may be able to circumvent our patents. Development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays and it is possible that at the time of commercialization any patent covering the product has expired or will be in force for only a short period of time following commercialization. We cannot predict with any certainty if any third party U.S. or foreign patent rights, other proprietary rights, will be deemed infringed by the use of our technology. Nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. Should we need to defend ourselves and our partners against any such claims, substantial costs may be incurred. Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the U.S. and abroad, and could result in the award of substantial damages. In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our partners may be required to obtain one or more licenses from a third party. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license on a reasonable basis should we deem it necessary to obtain rights to an alternative technology that meets our needs. The failure to obtain a license may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 In addition to the rights available to us under completed or pending license agreements, we rely on our proprietary know-how and experience in the development and use of heat for medical therapies, which we seek to protect, in part, through proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants and others. There can be no assurance that these proprietary information agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that these agreements, even if fully enforced, will be adequate to prevent third-party use of the Company s proprietary technology. Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including, but not limited to, We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that technology rights licensed to us by others will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by third parties, or that the rights granted will provide us with adequate protection. Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including, but not limited to, Our business depends on licensing agreements with third parties to permit us to use patented technologies. The loss of any of our rights under these agreements could impair our ability to develop and market our products.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 We are providing the following cautionary discussion of risk factors, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are relevant to our business. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ significantly from expected or historical results and our forward-looking statements. We note these factors for investors as permitted by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties that may impact our business. Moreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all of these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 
 
 We have a history of significant losses from operations and expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Since our inception, our expenses have substantially exceeded our revenue, resulting in continuing losses and an accumulated deficit of 241 million at December 31, 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred a net loss of 22.1 million, and 22.5 million, respectively. We currently have no product revenue and do not expect to generate any product revenue for the foreseeable future. Because we are committed to continuing our product research, development, clinical trial and commercialization programs, we will continue to incur significant operating losses unless and until we complete the development of ThermoDox , GEN-1 and other new product candidates and these product candidates have been clinically tested, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and successfully marketed. The amount of future losses is uncertain. Our ability to achieve profitability, if ever, will depend on, among other things, us or our collaborators successfully developing product candidates, obtaining regulatory approvals to market and commercialize product candidates, manufacturing any approved products on commercially reasonable terms, establishing a sales and marketing organization or suitable third party alternatives for any approved product and raising sufficient funds to finance business activities. If we or our collaborators are unable to develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates or if sales revenue from any product candidate that receives approval is insufficient, we will not achieve profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 Drug development is an inherently uncertain process with a high risk of failure at every stage of development. Our lead drug candidate failed to meets its primary endpoint in our earlier Phase III clinical trial. 
 
 On January 31, 2013, we announced that our lead product ThermoDox in combination with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) failed to meet the primary endpoint of the Phase III clinical trial for primary liver cancer, known as the HEAT study. We have not completed our final analysis of the data and do not know the extent to which, if any, the failure of ThermoDox to meet its primary endpoint in the Phase III trial could impact our other ongoing studies of ThermoDox including a pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial of ThermoDox in combination with RFA in primary liver cancer, known as the OPTIMA study, which we launched in the first half of 2014. The trial design of the OPTIMA study is based on the overall survival data from the post-hoc analysis of results from the HEAT study. ThermoDox is also being evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial for recurrent chest wall breast cancer and other preclinical studies. In addition, we have initiated a Phase I dose-escalation clinical trial of GEN-1 in combination with the standard of care in neo-adjuvant ovarian cancer, known as the OVATION Study, and plan to expand our ovarian cancer development program to include a Phase I dose escalating trial evaluating GEN-1 in combination with Avastin and Doxil in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients. 
 
 Preclinical testing and clinical trials are long, expensive and highly uncertain processes and failure can unexpectedly occur at any stage of clinical development, as evidenced by the failure of ThermoDox to meet its primary endpoint in the HEAT study. Drug development is inherently risky and clinical trials take us several years to complete. The start or end of a clinical trial is often delayed or halted due to changing regulatory requirements, manufacturing challenges, required clinical trial administrative actions, slower than anticipated patient enrollment, changing standards of care, availability or prevalence of use of a comparator drug or required prior therapy, clinical outcomes including insufficient efficacy, safety concerns, or our own financial constraints. The results from preclinical testing or early clinical trials of a product candidate may not predict the results that will be obtained in later phase clinical trials of the product candidate. We, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons, including a belief that subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects. We may not have the financial resources to continue development of, or to enter into collaborations for, a product candidate if we experience any problems or other unforeseen events that delay or prevent regulatory approval of, or our ability to commercialize, product candidates. The failure of one or more of our drug candidates or development programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We will need to raise additional capital to fund our planned future operations, and we may be unable to secure such capital without dilutive financing transactions. If we are not able to raise additional capital, we may not be able to complete the development, testing and commercialization of our product candidates. If we are not able to raise additional capital when needed, there would continue to be substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 

22

We have not generated significant revenue and have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had a net loss of 22.1 million and used 18.4 million to fund operations. We have incurred approximately 241 million of cumulated net losses. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 4.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. We have substantial future capital requirements to continue our research and development activities and advance our product candidates through various development stages. For example, ThermoDox is being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial in combination with RFA for the treatment of primary liver cancer, a Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of recurrent chest wall breast cancer and other preclinical studies. We initiated a Phase I dose-escalation clinical trial of GEN-1 in combination with the standard of care in neo-adjuvant ovarian cancer in the second half of 2015 and plan to expand our ovarian cancer development program to include a Phase I dose escalating trial evaluating GEN-1 in combination with Avastin and Doxil in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients . 
 
 To complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we will need to raise substantial amounts of additional capital to fund our operations. Our future capital requirements will depend upon numerous unpredictable factors, including, without limitation, the cost, timing, progress and outcomes of clinical studies and regulatory reviews of our proprietary drug candidates, our efforts to implement new collaborations, licenses and strategic transactions, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures and other unforeseen uses of cash. We do not have any committed sources of financing and cannot assure you that alternate funding will be available in a timely manner, on acceptable terms or at all. We may need to pursue dilutive equity financings, such as the issuance of shares of common stock, convertible debt or other convertible or exercisable securities. Such dilutive equity financings could dilute the percentage ownership of our current common stockholders and could significantly lower the market value of our common stock. In addition, a financing could result in the issuance of new securities that may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. 
 
 We continue to seek additional financial resources to fund the further development of our product candidates. If we are unable to obtain additional capital on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, reduce or terminate our research and development programs and preclinical studies or clinical trials, if any, limit strategic opportunities or undergo corporate restructuring activities. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, product candidates or potential markets or that could impose onerous financial or other terms. As explained in the notes to our financial statements, if the Company is not able to raise additional funds when needed, there would continue to be substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Furthermore, if we cannot fund our ongoing development and other operating requirements, particularly those associated with our obligations to conduct clinical trials under our licensing agreements, we will be in breach of these licensing agreements and could therefore lose our license rights, which could have material adverse effects on our business. Based on the above, management has determined there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph which expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 If we do not obtain or maintain FDA and foreign regulatory approvals for our drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or if the terms of any approval impose significant restrictions or limitations on use, we will be unable to sell those products and our business, results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected. 
 
 To obtain regulatory approvals from the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, we must conduct clinical trials demonstrating that our products are safe and effective. We may need to amend ongoing trials or the FDA and/or foreign regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional trials beyond those we planned. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and resources, and generally takes a number of years to complete. The time to complete testing and obtaining approvals is uncertain, and the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion, at any phase of development, to terminate clinical studies, require additional clinical studies or other testing, delay or withhold approval, and mandate product withdrawals, including recalls. In addition, our drug candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restricted label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by regulatory authorities. Even if we receive regulatory approval of a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed. The failure to obtain timely regulatory approval of product candidates, the imposition of marketing limitations, or a product withdrawal would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We do not expect to generate revenue for the foreseeable future. 

23

We have devoted our resources to developing a new generation of products and will not be able to market these products until we have completed clinical trials and obtain all necessary governmental approvals. Our lead product candidate, ThermoDox and the product candidates we purchased in our acquisition of EGEN, including GEN-1, are still in various stages of development and trials and cannot be marketed until we have completed clinical testing and obtained necessary governmental approval. Following our announcement on January 31, 2013 that the HEAT Study failed to meet its primary endpoint of progression free survival, we continued to follow the patients enrolled in the HEAT Study to the secondary endpoint, overall survival. Based on the overall survival data from the post-hoc analysis of results from the HEAT Study, we launched a pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial of ThermoDox in combination with RFA in primary liver cancer, known as the OPTIMA Study, in the first half of 2014. ThermoDox is currently also being evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of recurrent chest wall breast cancer, known as the DIGNITY Study, and other preclinical studies. GEN-1 is currently in an early stage of clinical development for the treatment of ovarian cancer. We initiated a Phase I dose-escalation clinical trial of GEN-1 in combination with the standard of care in neo-adjuvant ovarian cancer in the second half of 2015 and plan to expand our ovarian cancer development program to include a Phase I dose escalating trial evaluating GEN-1 in combination with Avastin and Doxil in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients . The delivery technology platforms, TheraPlas and TheraSilence, are in preclinical stages of development. Accordingly, our revenue sources are, and will remain, extremely limited until our product candidates are clinically tested, approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies and successfully marketed. We cannot guarantee that any of our product candidates will be approved by the FDA or any foreign regulatory agency or marketed, successfully or otherwise, at any time in the foreseeable future or at all. 

We may not successfully engage in future strategic transactions, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates, impact our cash position, increase our expense and present significant distractions to our management. 
 
 In the future, we may consider strategic alternatives intended to further the development of our business, which may include acquiring businesses, technologies or products, out- or in-licensing product candidates or technologies or entering into a business combination with another company. Any strategic transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures and pose significant integration or implementation challenges or disrupt our management or business. These transactions would entail numerous operational and financial risks, including exposure to unknown liabilities, disruption of our business and diversion of our management s time and attention in order to manage a collaboration or develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies, incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay transaction consideration or costs, higher than expected collaboration, acquisition or integration costs, write-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges, increased amortization expenses, difficulty and cost in facilitating the collaboration or combining the operations and personnel of any acquired business, impairment of relationships with key suppliers, manufacturers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership and the inability to retain key employees of any acquired business. Accordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete may be subject to the foregoing or other risks and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Conversely, any failure to enter any strategic transaction that would be beneficial to us could delay the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and have a negative impact on the competitiveness of any product candidate that reaches market. 
 
 Strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, partnerships and collaborations, including the EGEN acquisition, involve numerous risks, including: 

the failure of markets for the products of acquired businesses, technologies or product lines to develop as expected; 

uncertainties in identifying and pursuing acquisition targets; 

the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits expected from acquisitions; 

the risk that the financial returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures incurred to acquire such businesses or the capital expenditures needed to develop such businesses; 

difficulties in assimilating the acquired businesses, technologies or product lines; 

the failure to successfully manage additional business locations, including the additional infrastructure and resources necessary to support and integrate such locations; 

the existence of unknown product defects related to acquired businesses, technologies or product lines that may not be identified due to the inherent limitations involved in the due diligence process of an acquisition; 

24

the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns; 

risks associated with entering markets or conducting operations with which we have no or limited direct prior experience; 

risks associated with assuming the legal obligations of acquired businesses, technologies or product lines; 

risks related to the effect that internal control processes of acquired businesses might have on our financial reporting and management s report on our internal control over financial reporting; 

the potential loss of key employees related to acquired businesses, technologies or product lines; and 

the incurrence of significant exit charges if products or technologies acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful. 
 
 We may never realize the perceived benefits of the EGEN acquisition or potential future transactions. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any transactions, and our inability to do so could significantly harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. These transactions could dilute a stockholder s investment in us and cause us to incur debt, contingent liabilities and amortization/impairment charges related to intangible assets, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our effective tax rate for future periods could be negatively impacted by the EGEN acquisition or potential future transactions. 
 
 Our business depends on license agreements with third parties to permit us to use patented technologies. The loss of any of our rights under these agreements could impair our ability to develop and market our products. 
 
 Our success will depend, in a substantial part, on our ability to maintain our rights under license agreements granting us rights to use patented technologies. For instance, we are party to license agreements with Duke University, under which we have exclusive rights to commercialize medical treatment products and procedures based on Duke s thermo-sensitive liposome technology. The Duke University license agreement contains a license fee, royalty and/or research support provisions, testing and regulatory milestones, and other performance requirements that we must meet by certain deadlines. If we breach any provisions of the license and research agreements, we may lose our ability to use the subject technology, as well as compensation for our efforts in developing or exploiting the technology. Any such loss of rights and access to technology could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 Further, we cannot guarantee that any patent or other technology rights licensed to us by others will not be challenged or circumvented successfully by third parties, or that the rights granted will provide adequate protection. We may be required to alter any of our potential products or processes, or enter into a license and pay licensing fees to a third party or cease certain activities. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternate technology. If a license is not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be significantly harmed and we may be prevented from developing and commercializing the product. Litigation, which could result in substantial costs, may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us or to determine the scope and validity of others claimed proprietary rights. 
 
 If any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection. 
 
 The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues. We own various U.S. and international patents and have pending U.S. and international patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies. There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be held valid and enforceable in a court of law through the entire patent term. Even for patents that are held valid and enforceable, the legal process associated with obtaining such a judgment is time consuming and costly. Additionally, issued patents can be subject to opposition, interferences or other proceedings that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant or broad coverage). Further, our competitors may be able to circumvent and otherwise design around our patents. Even if a patent is issued and enforceable, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire early and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following the commercialization of products encompassed by our patents. We may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in a loss of the patent and/or substantial cost to us. 

25

We have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our technologies and our proprietary product candidates. There can be no assurance that the patent applications for which we apply would actually issue as patents, or do so with commercially relevant or broad coverage. The coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. The scope of our claim coverage can be critical to our ability to enter into licensing transactions with third parties and our right to receive royalties from our collaboration partnerships. Since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind the date of such discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first inventor of inventions covered by our patents or patent applications. In addition, there is no guarantee that we will be the first to file a patent application directed to an invention. 
 
 An adverse outcome in any judicial proceeding involving intellectual property, including patents, could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from or to third parties or require us to cease using the technology in dispute. In those instances where we seek an intellectual property license from another, we may not be able to obtain the license on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all, thereby raising concerns on our ability to freely commercialize our technologies or products. 
 
 We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We rely on trade secrets and confidential information that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, collaborators, employees and consultants. We cannot assure you that these agreements are adequate to protect our trade secrets and confidential information or will not be breached or, if breached, we will have adequate remedies. Furthermore, others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology. Any loss of trade secret protection or other unpatented proprietary rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Our products may infringe patent rights of others, which may require costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages or limit our ability to commercialize our products. 
 
 Our commercial success depends on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. There may be third party patents that relate to our products and technology. We may unintentionally infringe upon valid patent rights of third parties. Although we currently are not involved in any material litigation involving patents, a third party patent holder may assert a claim of patent infringement against us in the future. Alternatively, we may initiate litigation against the third party patent holder to request that a court declare that we are not infringing the third party s patent and/or that the third party s patent is invalid or unenforceable. If a claim of infringement is asserted against us and is successful, and therefore we are found to infringe, we could be required to pay damages for infringement, including treble damages if it is determined that we knew or became aware of such a patent and we failed to exercise due care in determining whether or not we infringed the patent. If we have supplied infringing products to third parties or have licensed third parties to manufacture, use or market infringing products, we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for damages they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses they may sustain. 
 
 We can also be prevented from selling or commercializing any of our products that use the infringing technology in the future, unless we obtain a license from such third party. A license may not be available from such third party on commercially reasonable terms, or may not be available at all. Any modification to include a non-infringing technology may not be possible or if possible may be difficult or time-consuming to develop, and require revalidation, which could delay our ability to commercialize our products. Any infringement action asserted against us, even if we are ultimately successful in defending against such action, would likely delay the regulatory approval process of our products, harm our competitive position, be expensive and require the time and attention of our key management and technical personnel. 
 
 We rely on third parties to conduct all of our clinical trials. If these third parties are unable to carry out their contractual duties in a manner that is consistent with our expectations, comply with budgets and other financial obligations or meet expected deadlines, we may not receive certain development milestone payments or be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner. 
 
 We do not independently conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party clinical investigators, clinical research organizations (CROs), clinical data management organizations and consultants to design, conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical trials. 

26

Because we do not conduct our own clinical trials, we must rely on the efforts of others and have reduced control over aspects of these activities, including, the timing of such trials, the costs associated with such trials and the procedures that are followed for such trials. We do not expect to significantly increase our personnel in the foreseeable future and may continue to rely on third parties to conduct all of our future clinical trials. If we cannot contract with acceptable third parties on commercially reasonable terms or at all, if these third parties are unable to carry out their contractual duties or obligations in a manner that is consistent with our expectations or meet expected deadlines, if they do not carry out the trials in accordance with budgeted amounts, if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, or if they fail to maintain compliance with applicable government regulations and standards, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated or may become significantly more expensive, we may not receive development milestone payments when expected or at all, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. 
 
 Despite our reliance on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires clinical trials to be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov , within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. If we or a third party we rely on fails to meet these requirements, we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing authorizations for our drug candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our drug candidates. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 Because we rely on third party manufacturing and supply partners, our supply of research and development, preclinical and clinical development materials may become limited or interrupted or may not be of satisfactory quantity or quality. 
 
 We rely on third party supply and manufacturing partners to supply the materials and components for, and manufacture, our research and development, preclinical and clinical trial drug supplies. We do not own manufacturing facilities or supply sources for such components and materials. There can be no assurance that our supply of research and development, preclinical and clinical development drugs and other materials will not be limited, interrupted, restricted in certain geographic regions or of satisfactory quality or continue to be available at acceptable prices. Suppliers and manufacturers must meet applicable manufacturing requirements and undergo rigorous facility and process validation tests required by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities in order to comply with regulatory standards, such as current Good Manufacturing Practices. In the event that any of our suppliers or manufacturers fails to comply with such requirements or to perform its obligations to us in relation to quality, timing or otherwise, or if our supply of components or other materials becomes limited or interrupted for other reasons, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which we currently do not have the capabilities or resources, or enter into an agreement with another third party, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. 
 
 Our business is subject to numerous and evolving state, federal and foreign regulations and we may not be able to secure the government approvals needed to develop and market our products. 
 
 Our research and development activities, pre-clinical tests and clinical trials, and ultimately the manufacturing, marketing and labeling of our products, are all subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies. Pre-clinical testing and clinical trial requirements and the regulatory approval process typically take years and require the expenditure of substantial resources. Additional government regulation may be established that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. Delays or rejections in obtaining regulatory approvals would adversely affect our ability to commercialize any product candidates and our ability to generate product revenue or royalties. 
 
 The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require that the safety and efficacy of product candidates be supported through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. If the results of pivotal clinical trials do not establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to the satisfaction of the FDA and other foreign regulatory agencies, we will not receive the approvals necessary to market such product candidates. Even if regulatory approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. 

27

We are subject to the periodic inspection of our clinical trials, facilities, procedures and operations and/or the testing of our products by the FDA to determine whether our systems and processes, or those of our vendors and suppliers, are in compliance with FDA regulations. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form 483 and warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection. 
 
 Failure to comply with the FDA and other governmental regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA s review of product applications, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Under certain circumstances, the FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted product approvals. Although we have internal compliance programs, if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if our compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 
 We are also subject to recordkeeping and reporting regulations. These regulations require, among other things, the reporting to the FDA of adverse events alleged to have been associated with the use of a product or in connection with certain product failures. Labeling and promotional activities also are regulated by the FDA. We must also comply with record keeping requirements as well as requirements to report certain adverse events involving our products. The FDA can impose other post-marketing controls on us as well as our products including, but not limited to, restrictions on sale and use, through the approval process, regulations and otherwise. 
 
 Many states in which we do or may do business, or in which our products may be sold, if at all, impose licensing, labeling or certification requirements that are in addition to those imposed by the FDA. There can be no assurance that one or more states will not impose regulations or requirements that have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products. 
 
 In many of the foreign countries in which we may do business or in which our products may be sold, we will be subject to regulation by national governments and supranational agencies as well as by local agencies affecting, among other things, product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. There can be no assurance that one or more countries or agencies will not impose regulations or requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products. 
 
 We may seek Orphan Drug Designation for some of our product candidates, and we may be unsuccessful or may be unable to maintain the benefits associated with Orphan Drug Designation, including the potential for market exclusivity. 
 
 As part of our business strategy, we may seek Orphan Drug Designation for our product candidates, and we may be unsuccessful. Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the U.S. and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the U.S., or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the U.S. where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the U.S. 
 
 Even if we obtain Orphan Drug Designation for our product candidates in specific indications, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval of these product candidates for the orphan-designated indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated indication or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan product is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan Drug Designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. In addition, while we may seek Orphan Drug Designation for our product candidates, we may never receive such designations.

Legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business. 
 
 Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. There have been a number of government and private sector initiatives during the last few years to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements. It is uncertain whether or when any legislative proposals will be adopted or what actions federal, state, or private payors for health care treatment and services may take in response to any healthcare reform proposals or legislation. We cannot predict the effect healthcare reforms may have on our business and we can offer no assurances that any of these reforms will not have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, uncertainty remains regarding proposed significant reforms to the U.S. health care system. 
 
 The success of our products may be harmed if the government, private health insurers and other third-party payers do not provide sufficient coverage or reimbursement. 
 
 Our ability to commercialize our new cancer treatment systems successfully will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. The reimbursement status of newly approved medical products is subject to significant uncertainty. We cannot guarantee that adequate third-party insurance coverage will be available for us to establish and maintain price levels sufficient for us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in developing new therapies. Government, private health insurers and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products approved for marketing by the FDA. Accordingly, even if coverage and reimbursement are provided by government, private health insurers and third-party payors for uses of our products, market acceptance of these products would be adversely affected if the reimbursement available proves to be unprofitable for health care providers. 
 
 Our products may not achieve sufficient acceptance by the medical community to sustain our business. 
 
 The commercial success of our products will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community and third-party payors as clinically useful, cost effective and safe. Any or our drug candidates may prove not to be effective in practice. Our testing and clinical practice may not confirm the safety and efficacy of our product candidates or even if further testing and clinical practice produce positive results, the medical community may view these new forms of treatment as effective and desirable or our efforts to market our new products may fail. Market acceptance depends upon physicians and hospitals obtaining adequate reimbursement rates from third-party payors to make our products commercially viable. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The commercial potential of a drug candidate in development is difficult to predict. If the market size for a new drug is significantly smaller than we anticipate, it could significantly and negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 It is very difficult to predict the commercial potential of product candidates due to important factors such as safety and efficacy compared to other available treatments, including potential generic drug alternatives with similar efficacy profiles, changing standards of care, third party payor reimbursement standards, patient and physician preferences, the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the long drug development process or after commercial introduction, and the availability of generic versions of our successful product candidates following approval by government health authorities based on the expiration of regulatory exclusivity or our inability to prevent generic versions from coming to market by asserting our patents. If due to one or more of these risks the market potential for a drug candidate is lower than we anticipated, it could significantly and negatively impact the revenue potential for such drug candidate and would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We have no internal sales or marketing capability. If we are unable to create sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into alliances with others possessing such capabilities to perform these functions, we will not be able to commercialize our products successfully. 
 
 We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. We intend to market our products, if and when such products are approved for commercialization by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, either directly or through other strategic alliances and distribution arrangements with third parties. If we decide to market our products directly, we will need to commit significant financial and managerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution, administration and compliance capabilities. If we rely on third parties with such capabilities to market our products, we will need to establish and maintain partnership arrangements, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into third-party marketing or distribution arrangements on acceptable terms or at all. To the extent that we do enter into such arrangements, we will be dependent on our marketing and distribution partners. In entering into third-party marketing or distribution arrangements, we expect to incur significant additional expenses and there can be no assurance that such third parties will establish adequate sales and distribution capabilities or be successful in gaining market acceptance for our products and services.

Technologies for the treatment of cancer are subject to rapid change, and the development of treatment strategies that are more effective than our technologies could render our technologies obsolete. 
 
 Various methods for treating cancer currently are, and in the future are expected to be, the subject of extensive research and development. Many possible treatments that are being researched, if successfully developed, may not require, or may supplant, the use of our technologies. The successful development and acceptance of any one or more of these alternative forms of treatment could render our technology obsolete as a cancer treatment method. 
 
 We may not be able to hire or retain key officers or employees that we need to implement our business strategy and develop our product candidates and business, including those purchased in the EGEN asset acquisition. 
 
 Our success depends significantly on the continued contributions of our executive officers, scientific and technical personnel and consultants, including those retained in the EGEN acquisition, and on our ability to attract additional personnel as we seek to implement our business strategy and develop our product candidates and businesses. Our operations associated with the EGEN acquisition are located in Huntsville, Alabama. Key employees may depart if we fail to successfully manage this additional business location or in relation to any uncertainties or difficulties of integration with Celsion. We cannot guarantee that we will retain key employees to the same extent that we and EGEN retained each of our own employees in the past, which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our integration of EGEN and ability to operate in the fields we acquired from EGEN may be more difficult if we lose key employees. Additionally, during our operating history, we have assigned many essential responsibilities to a relatively small number of individuals. However, as our business and the demands on our key employees expand, we have been, and will continue to be, required to recruit additional qualified employees. The competition for such qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of services of certain key personnel or our inability to attract additional personnel to fill critical positions could adversely affect our business. Further, we do not carry key man insurance on any of our personnel. Therefore, loss of the services of key personnel would not be ameliorated by the receipt of the proceeds from such insurance. 
 
 Our success will depend in part on our ability to grow and diversify, which in turn will require that we manage and control our growth effectively. 
 
 Our business strategy contemplates growth and diversification. Our ability to manage growth effectively will require that we continue to expend funds to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. In addition, we must effectively expand, train and manage our employees. We will be unable to manage our business effectively if we are unable to alleviate the strain on resources caused by growth in a timely and successful manner. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our growth and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 We face intense competition and the failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products. 
 
 There are many companies and other institutions engaged in research and development of various technologies for cancer treatment products that seek treatment outcomes similar to those that we are pursuing. We believe that the level of interest by others in investigating the potential of possible competitive treatments and alternative technologies will continue and may increase. Potential competitors engaged in all areas of cancer treatment research in the U.S. and other countries include, among others, major pharmaceutical, specialized technology companies, and universities and other research institutions. Most of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources, and may also have far greater experience than do we, both in pre-clinical testing and human clinical trials of new products and in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals. One or more of these companies or institutions could succeed in developing products or other technologies that are more effective than the products and technologies that we have been or are developing, or which would render our technology and products obsolete and non-competitive. Furthermore, if we are permitted to commence commercial sales of any of our products, we will also be competing, with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing, with companies having substantially greater resources and experience in these areas.

We may be subject to significant product liability claims and litigation. 
 
 Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products. We presently have product liability insurance limited to 10 million per incident and 10 million annually. If we were to be subject to a claim in excess of this coverage or to a claim not covered by our insurance and the claim succeeded, we would be required to pay the claim with our own limited resources, which could have a severe adverse effect on our business. Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation, such litigation would harm the business by diverting the attention and resources of our management, consuming substantial amounts of our financial resources and by damaging our reputation. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain our product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all. 
 
 Our internal computer systems, or those of our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. 
 
 Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could cause interruptions of our operations. For instance, the loss of preclinical data or data from any clinical trial involving our product candidates could result in delays in our development and regulatory filing efforts and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the development of our product candidates could be delayed. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES 
 
 The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for investors and subject us to securities class action litigation. 
 
 The trading price for our common stock has been, and we expect it to continue to be, volatile. Our January 31, 2013 announcement that the HEAT Study failed to meet its primary endpoint has resulted in significant volatility and a steep decline in the price of our common stock, a level of decline that could result in securities litigation. Plaintiffs securities litigation firms have publicly announced that they are investigating potential securities fraud claims that they may wish to make against us. The price at which our common stock trades depends upon a number of factors, including our historical and anticipated operating results, our financial situation, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, our ability or inability to raise the additional capital we may need and the terms on which we raise it, and general market and economic conditions. Some of these factors are beyond our control. Broad market fluctuations may lower the market price of our common stock and affect the volume of trading in our stock, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospect. The closing price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Capital Market had a high price of 3.15 and a low price of 1.65 in the 52-week period ended December 31, 2015 and a high price of 1.93 and a low price of 0.3 0 in the 52-week period ended December 31, 2016. Among the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this Risk Factors section and other factors, including: 

results of preclinical and clinical studies of our product candidates or those of our competitors; 

regulatory or legal developments in the U.S. and other countries, especially changes in laws and regulations applicable to our product candidates; 

actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our product candidates, clinical studies, manufacturing process or sales and marketing terms; 

introductions and announcements of new products by us or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements; 

announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or other strategic transactions or capital commitments; 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results or the operating results of our competitors; 

variance in our financial performance from the expectations of investors; 

31

changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets; 

changes in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect our financial results; 

failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success; 

conditions and trends in the markets we serve; 

changes in general economic, industry and market conditions; 

success of competitive products and services; 

changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors; 

changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors; 

changes in legislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions; 

the commencement or outcome of litigation involving our company, our general industry or both; 

recruitment or departure of key personnel; 

changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt; 

actual or anticipated changes in earnings estimates or changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally; 

actual or expected sales of our common stock by our stockholders; 

acquisitions and financings, including the EGEN acquisition; and 

the trading volume of our common stock. 
 
 In addition, the stock markets, in general, The NASDAQ Capital Market and the market for pharmaceutical companies in particular, may experience a loss of investor confidence. Such loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our business, financial condition or results of operations. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and expose us to securities class action litigation. Such litigation, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and divert management s attention and resources, which could further materially harm our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall. 
 
 Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. As of March 23, 2017, we had 55,466,492 shares of common stock outstanding, all of which shares, other than shares held by our directors and certain officers, were eligible for sale in the public market, subject in some cases to compliance with the requirements of Rule 144, including the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements. In addition, all of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration upon issuance. 
 
 Our stockholders may experience significant dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances and exercise of outstanding options and warrants. 
 
 In order to raise additional capital or pursue strategic transactions, we may in the future offer, issue or sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock, including the issuance of common stock in relation to the achievement, if any, of milestones triggering our payment of earn-out consideration in connection with the EGEN acquisition. Our stockholders may experience significant dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances. Investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. As of March 23, 2017, we have a significant number of securities convertible into, or allowing the purchase of, our common stock, including 35,062,319 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants outstanding, 2,547,289 options to purchase shares of our common stock and restricted stock awards outstanding, and 890,908 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our stock incentive plans. Under the Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement entered into with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. on February 1, 2013, we may offer and sell, from time to time through at-the-market offerings, up to an aggregate of 25 million of shares of our common stock. We have only sold 7.6 million in gross proceeds under the Sales Agreement as of March 23, 2017. 

32

We may be unable to maintain compliance with The NASDAQ Marketplace Rules which could cause our common stock to be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market. This could result in the lack of a market for our common stock, cause a decrease in the value of an investment in us, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our common stock is currently listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. To maintain the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, among others, either: (i) a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share, a market value of publicly held shares (excluding shares held by our executive officers, directors and 10 or more stockholders) of at least 1 million and stockholders equity of at least 2.5 million; or (ii) a minimum closing bid price of 1.00 per share, a market value of publicly held shares (excluding shares held by our executive officers, directors and 10 or more stockholders) of at least 1 million and a total market value of listed securities of at least 35 million. As of March 23 , 2017, the closing sale price per share of our common stock was 0.27, the total market value of our publicly held shares of our common stock (excluding shares held by our executive officers, directors and 10 or more stockholders) was approximately 14.8 million and the total market value of our listed securities was approximately 15.0 million. There is no assurance that we will continue to meet the minimum closing price requirement and other listing requirements. As of December 31, 2016, we had stockholders equity of approximately 6.7 million. 
 
 On December 15, 2016, we received a letter from NASDAQ indicating that the closing bid price of our common stock fell below 1.00 per share for the previous 30 consecutive business days, and that we are therefore not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued inclusion on The NASDAQ Capital Market and our common stock could be subject to delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market. If our common stock is delisted, trading of the stock will most likely take place on an over-the-counter market established for unlisted securities, such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. An investor is likely to find it less convenient to sell, or to obtain accurate quotations in seeking to buy, our common stock on an over-the-counter market, and many investors may not buy or sell our common stock due to difficulty in accessing over-the-counter markets, or due to policies preventing them from trading in securities not listed on a national exchange or other reasons. In addition, as a delisted security, our common stock would be subject to SEC rules regarding penny stock, which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers. The regulations relating to penny stocks, coupled with the typically higher cost per trade to investors in penny stocks due to factors such as broker commissions generally representing a higher percentage of the price of a penny stock than of a higher priced stock, would further limit the ability and willingness of investors to trade in our common stock. For these reasons and others, delisting would adversely affect the liquidity, trading volume and price of our common stock, causing the value of an investment in us to decrease and having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to attract and retain qualified executives and employees and to raise capital. 
 
 The adverse capital and credit market conditions could affect our liquidity. 
 
 Adverse capital and credit market conditions could affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, as well as our access to capital and cost of capital. The capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent years. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and capital position could be materially adversely affected by continued disruptions in the capital and credit markets. 
 
 Our ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income are subject to certain limitations. 
 
 We currently have significant net operating losses (NOLs) that may be used to offset future taxable income. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. During 2016, 2015, 2014 and years prior, we performed analyses to determine if there were changes in ownership, as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code that would limit our ability to utilize certain net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. We determined we experienced an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, in connection with certain common stock offerings in 2011, 2013, and 2015. As a result, the utilization of our federal tax net operating loss carry forwards generated prior to the ownership changes is limited. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code, which would significantly limit our ability to utilize NOLs to offset future taxable income. 

33

We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock in the past and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. 
 
 We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future for holders of our common stock. 
 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control. 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable by authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock. This preferred stock may be issued by our Board of Directors on such terms as it determines, without further stockholder approval. Therefore, our Board of Directors may issue such preferred stock on terms unfavorable to a potential bidder in the event that our Board of Directors opposes a merger or acquisition. In addition, our Board of Directors may discourage such transactions by increasing the amount of time necessary to obtain majority representation on our Board of Directors. Certain other provisions of our bylaws and of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us, even if such action were beneficial to some, or even a majority, of our stockholders.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
 
 In 2011, we entered into a lease with Brandywine Operating Partnership, L.P. (Brandywine), a Delaware limited partnership for a 10,870 square foot premises located in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. In October 2011, we relocated our offices to Lawrenceville, New Jersey from Columbia, Maryland. The lease has a remaining term of 4 months. As required by the lease, we provided the landlord with an irrevocable and unconditional standby letter of credit for 250,000, which we secured with an escrow deposit at our banking institution of this same amount. The lease stipulated standby letter of credit will be reduced by 50,000 on each of the 19th, 31st and 43rd months from the initial term, with the remaining 100,000 amount remaining until the term of the lease has expired. In connection with three 50,000 reductions of the standby letter of credit in April 2013, 2014 and 2015, we reduced the escrow deposit by 50,000 each time. In late 2015, Lenox Drive Office Park LLC, purchased the real estate and office building and assumed the lease. The Company is currently in negotiations with the landlord to extend the lease term and reduce the square footage by approximately 30 . 
 
 In connection with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of EGEN, Inc., an Alabama corporation, in June 2014, we assumed the existing lease with another landlord for an 11,500 square foot premises located in Huntsville Alabama. This lease has a remaining term of 13 months with monthly rent payments of approximately 23,200. 
 
 We believe our existing facilities are suitable and adequate to conduct our business.

 Overview 
 
 Celsion is a fully-integrated, development stage oncology drug company focused on developing a portfolio of innovative cancer treatments, including directed chemotherapies, DNA-mediated immunotherapy and RNA based therapies. Our lead product candidate is ThermoDox , a proprietary heat-activated liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin, currently in a Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of primary liver cancer (the OPTIMA Study) and a Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of recurrent chest wall breast cancer (the DIGNITY Study). Second in our pipeline is GEN-1, a DNA-mediated immunotherapy for the localized treatment of ovarian and brain cancers. 
 
 We have three platform technologies providing the basis for the future development of a range of therapeutics for difficult-to-treat forms of cancer including: Lysolipid Thermally Sensitive Liposomes, a heat sensitive liposomal based dosage form that targets disease with known therapeutics in the presence of mild heat, TheraPlas, a novel nucleic acid-based treatment for local transfection of therapeutic plasmids, and TheraSilence, a systemic dosage form for lung directed anti-cancer RNA With these technologies we are working to develop and commercialize more efficient, effective and targeted oncology therapies that maximize efficacy while minimizing side-effects common to cancer treatments. 
 
 Significant Events 
 
 ThermoDox 
 
 ThermoDox is being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial for primary liver cancer (the OPTIMA Study which was initiated in 2014 and a Phase II clinical trial for recurrent chest wall breast cancer (the DIGNITY Study ). ThermoDox is a liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin, an approved and frequently used oncology drug for the treatment of a wide range of cancers. Localized heat at hyperthermia temperatures (greater than 40 Celsius) releases the encapsulated doxorubicin from the liposome enabling high concentrations of doxorubicin to be deposited preferentially in and around the targeted tumor. 
 
 The HEAT Study. On January 31, 2013, we announced that ThermoDox in combination with radio frequency ablation RFA did not meet the primary endpoint of progression free survival PFS for the 701 patient clinical trial in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), also known as primary liver cancer (the HEAT Study). We determined, after conferring with the HEAT Study s independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC), that the HEAT Study did not meet the goal of demonstrating persuasive evidence of clinical effectiveness, that being a clinically meaningful improvement in progression free survival (PFS), that could form the basis for regulatory approval. In the trial, ThermoDox was well-tolerated with no unexpected serious adverse events. Following the announcement of the HEAT Study results, we continued to follow patients for overall survival (OS), the secondary endpoint of the HEAT Study. We have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the data from the HEAT Study to assess the future strategic value and development strategy for ThermoDox . 

36

Findings from the HEAT Study post-hoc data analysis suggest that ThermoDox may substantially improve overall survival, when compared to the control group, in patients if their lesions undergo a 45 minute RFA procedure standardized for a lesion greater than 3 cm in diameter. Data from nine OS sweeps have been conducted since the top line PFS data from the HEAT Study were announced in January 2013, with each data set demonstrating progressive improvement in clinical benefit and statistical significance. On August 15, 2016, the Company announced the most recent post-hoc OS analysis from the HEAT Study. These results demonstrated that in a large, well bounded subgroup of patients with a single lesion (n=285, 41 of the HEAT Study patients), the combination of ThermoDox and optimized RFA provided an average 54 risk improvement in OS compared to optimized RFA alone. The Hazard Ratio at this latest OS analysis is 0.65 (95 CI 0.45 - 0.94) with a p-value of 0.02. Median OS for the ThermoDox group has been reached which translates into a two year survival benefit over the optimized RFA group (projected to be greater than 80 months for the ThermoDox plus optimized RFA group compared to less than 60 months projection for the optimized RFA only group). These data continue to strongly suggest that ThermoDox may significantly improve Overall Survival compared to a RFA control in patients whose lesions undergo optimized RFA treatment for 45 minutes or more as well as support the protocol for our Phase III OPTIMA Study as described below. 
 
 Findings from the HEAT Study post-hoc data analysis have shown to be well balanced and not diminished in anyway by other factors. Supplementary computational modeling and prospective preclinical animal studies have shown additional support the relationship between heating duration and clinical outcomes. These data have been presented, without objection, at multiple scientific and medical conferences in 2013 through 2016 by key HEAT Study investigators and leading liver cancer experts. The presentations include: 

World Conference on Interventional Oncology in May 2013; 

European Conference on Interventional Oncology in June 2013 and April 2014; 

International Liver Cancer Association (ILCA) Annual Conference in September 2013, 2014 and 2015; 

American Society of Clinical Oncology 50 th Annual Meeting in June 2014; 

Asian Conference on Tumor Ablation in October 2015 and 2016; and 

Asia-Pacific Primary Liver Cancer Expert (APPLE) Meeting in July 2016 
 
 The OPTIMA Study. On February 24, 2014, we announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), after its customary 30 day review period, accepted our IND without comment, subject to compliance with regulatory standards, for our pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial of ThermoDox , our proprietary heat-activated liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin in combination with RFA in primary liver cancer, also known as HCC (the OPTIMA Study). The OPTIMA Study trial design is based on the comprehensive analysis of data from the HEAT study, which, as described previously, demonstrated that treatment with ThermoDox resulted in a 54 risk improvement in overall survival in a large number of HCC patients that received an optimized RFA treatment for longer than 45 minutes. Designed with extensive input from globally recognized HCC researchers and clinicians and, after formal written consultation with the FDA, the OPTIMA Study was launched in the first half of 2014. The OPTIMA Study is expected to enroll up to 550 patients globally at up to 75 sites in the U.S., Canada, European Union, China and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region, and will evaluate ThermoDox in combination with standardized RFA, which will require a minimum of 45 minutes across all investigators and clinical sites for treating lesions 3 to 7 centimeters, versus standardized RFA alone. The primary endpoint for the trial is OS, and the secondary endpoints for the trial are PFS and safety. The statistical plan calls for two interim efficacy analyses by an independent DMC. 
 
 On December 16, 2015, we announced that we had received the clinical trial application approval from the CFDA to conduct the OPTIMA Study in China. This clinical trial application approval will now allow Celsion to enroll patients at up to 20 additional clinical sites in China. With the addition of these Chinese clinical sites, the Company expects to complete enrollment in the OPTIMA Study during the first quarter of 2018. Results from the OPTIMA Study, if successful, will provide the basis for a global registration filing and marketing approval. 
 
 On November 29, 2016, the Company announced the results of an independent analysis conducted by the National Institutes of Health (the NIH from the HEAT Study which reaffirmed the correlation between increased RFA burn time per tumor volume and improvements in overall survival. The NIH analysis, which sought to evaluate the correlation between RFA burn time per tumor volume (min/ml) and clinical outcome, concluded that increased burn time per tumor volume significantly improved overall survival in patients treated with RFA plus ThermoDox compared to patients treated with RFA alone. 

37

The DIGNITY Study. On December 14, 2015, we announced final data from the Phase I/II study of ThermoDox in recurrent chest wall (RCW) breast cancer (the DIGNITY Study) at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. The DIGNITY Study is designed to establish a safe therapeutic dose in Phase I, and in Phase II to demonstrate local control, including complete and partial responses, and stable disease as its primary endpoint. The DIGNITY Study is also planned to evaluate kinetics in ThermoDox produced from more than one manufacturing site. Of the 28 patients enrolled and treated, 21 patients were eligible for evaluation of efficacy. Approximately 62 of evaluable patients experienced a local response, including six complete responses and seven partial responses. 
 
 These data are consistent with the combined clinical data from two Phase I trials, our Phase I DIGNITY Study and the Duke University sponsored Phase I trial of ThermoDox plus hyperthermia in RCW breast cancer in December 2013. The two similarly designed Phase I studies enrolled patients with highly resistant tumors found on the chest wall and who had progressed on previous therapy including chemotherapy, radiation therapy and hormone therapy. There were 29 patients treated in the two trials, including 11 patients in the DIGNITY Study and 18 patients in the Duke study. Of the 29 patients treated, 23 were eligible for evaluation of efficacy. A local response rate of over 60 percent was reported in 14 of the 23 evaluable patients with five complete responses and nine partial responses. 
 
 The Euro-DIGNITY Study . The Company anticipates a Phase II study of RadioTherapy, HyperThermia and ThermoDox to treat patients with local-regional recurrent chest wall breast cancer will be initiated by five to six clinical sites located in Italy, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, and the Czech Republic (the Euro-DIGNITY Study). The Euro-DIGNITY Study will be Phase II study enrolling up to 70 patients affected by recurrent breast adenocarcinoma on the chest wall with/without nodes over a period of two years. 
 
 The primary objectives of the Euro-DIGNITY Study will be (i) to evaluate efficacy in patients after 3 cycles of ThermoDox plus Hyperthermia measuring tumor diameter as a response to therapy and (ii) to evaluate loco-regional breast tumor control in patients who undergo ThermoDox /hyperthermia/radiotherapy as measured by target lesion clinical response rate combining a RECIST criteria with digital photography to gauge response. 
 
 Secondary objectives of the Euro-DIGNITY Study will be (i) to evaluate the safety of the combination of ThermoDox /Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy among patients with local-regional recurrence (LRR) breast cancer, (ii) to evaluate the duration of local control complete response, partial response and stable disease following treatment with ThermoDox /Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy up to 24 months among patients with LRR breast cancer and (iii) to assess Patient Reported Quality of Life using the FACT-B and Brief Pain Inventory following treatment with ThermoDox /Hyperthermia/Radiotherapy among patients with LRR breast cancer. 
 
 Acquisition of EGEN 
 
 On June 20, 2014, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of EGEN, Inc., an Alabama corporation (EGEN), pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement. CLSN Laboratories, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (CLSN Laboratories), acquired all of EGEN s right, title and interest in and to substantially all of the assets of EGEN, including cash and cash equivalents, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, clinical data, certain contracts, licenses and permits, equipment, furniture, office equipment, furnishings, supplies and other tangible personal property. In addition, CLSN Laboratories assumed certain specified liabilities of EGEN, including the liabilities arising out of the acquired contracts and other assets relating to periods after the closing date. The consideration of the acquisition includes an initial payment of approximately 3.0 million in cash plus 2.7 million shares of Celsion s common stock. Additional consideration included contingent value rights totaling 30.4 million, payable in cash, shares of Celsion common stock or a combination thereof, at Celsion s option, upon achievement of three major milestone events as follows: 

a) 
 
 12.4 million will become payable upon achieving certain specified development milestones relating to an ovarian cancer study of GEN-1 to be conducted by the Company or its subsidiary; 

b) 
 
 12.0 million will become payable upon achieving certain specified development milestones relating to a glioblastoma multiforme brain cancer study of GEN-1 to be conducted by the Company or its subsidiary; and 

c) 
 
 Up to 6.0 million will become payable upon achieving certain specified milestones relating to the TheraSilence technology. 

38

Our obligations to make the Earn-Out Payments will terminate on the seventh anniversary of the closing date. 
 
 On June 9, 2014, we borrowed an additional 5.0 million pursuant to a certain Loan and Security Agreement dated as of November 25, 2013, by and between Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. and us. We used the loan proceeds to pay the upfront cash payment to EGEN at closing and certain transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition. 
 
 The acquisition of EGEN was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting which required the Company to perform an allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the consideration transferred for the acquisition is approximately 27.6 million. 
 
 Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to EGEN s net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The table below summarizes the preliminary estimated fair values of EGEN s net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities on the acquisition date. The purchase price allocations are preliminary and subject to change as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information with respect to the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired becomes available.

The purchase price exceeds the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired by approximately 2.0 million which was recorded as goodwill. 
 
 Acquired In-Process Research and Development (IPR D) 
 
 With the acquisition, we obtained GEN-1, a DNA-based immunotherapy for the localized treatment of ovarian and brain cancers, and three platform technologies for the development of treatments for those suffering with difficult-to-treat forms of cancer, novel nucleic acid-based immunotherapies and other anti-cancer DNA or RNA therapies, including TheraPlas and TheraSilence . 
 
 Acquired IPR D consists of EGEN's drug technology platforms: GEN-1, TheraPlas and TheraSilence. The fair value of the IPR D drug technology platforms was estimated to be 24.2 million as of the acquisition date using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method (MPEEM) which is a form of the income approach. Under the MPEEM, the fair value of an intangible asset is equal to the present value of the asset s incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) remaining after deducting the market rates of return on the estimated value of contributory assets (contributory charge) over its remaining useful life. 
 
 To calculate fair value of the IPR D programs under the MPEEM, we used projected cash flows discounted at a rate considered appropriate given the significant inherent risks associated with drug development by development-stage companies. Cash flows were calculated based on estimated projections of revenues and expenses related to the IPR D programs and then reduced by a contributory charge on requisite assets employed. Contributory assets included debt-free working capital, net fixed assets and assembled workforce. Rates of return on the contributory assets were based on rates used for comparable market participants. Cash flows were assumed to extend through a seven-year market exclusivity period. The resultant cash flows were then discounted to present value using a weighted-average cost of equity capital for companies with profiles substantially similar to that of Celsion, which we believe represents the rate that market participants would use to value the assets. The projected cash flows were based on significant assumptions, including the indication in which we will pursue development of IPR D programs, the time and resources needed to complete the development and regulatory approval of IPR D programs, estimates of revenue and operating profit related to the program considering its stage of development, the life of the potential commercialized product, market penetration and competition, and risks associated with achieving commercialization, including delay or failure to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical studies, failure of clinical studies, delay or failure to obtain required market clearances, and intellectual property litigation. 

39

At the closing of the acquisition, the IPR D was considered indefinite lived intangible assets and was not amortized. The IPR D is reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if there appears to be an indication of impairment. At December 31, 2016, the Company determined one of the IPR D assets related to the development of its RNA delivery system being developed with collaborators using their RNA product candidates, valued at 1.4 million, was impaired. Therefore, the Company wrote off the value of this IPR D asset incurring a non-cash charge of 1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In connection with the write-off of this IPR D asset, the Company concluded there was no probability of payments of the earn-out milestones associated with this asset and therefore reduced the earn-out milestone liability by 0.7 million at the same time. The Company concluded none of the other IPR D assets from the EGEN acquisition were impaired at December 31, 2016. 
 
 Covenant Not To Compete (CNTC) 
 
 Pursuant to the EGEN Purchase Agreement, EGEN provided certain covenants Covenant Not To Compete to the Company whereby EGEN agreed, during the period ending on the seventh anniversary of the closing date of the acquisition on June 20, 2014, not to enter into any business, directly or indirectly, which competes with the business of the Company nor will it contact, solicit or approach any of the employees of the Company for purposes of offering employment. 
 
 At the end of 2016, the Company concluded the CNTC which was valued at approximately 1.6 million at the date of the EGEN acquisition had a definitive life and should be amortized on a straight line basis over its life of 7 years. Therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a non-cash adjustment of 568,290 representing the cumulative amount of amortization expense from the date of acquisition through the end of 2016. The fair value of the CNTC was 1,022,924 net of 568,290 accumulated amortization as of December 31, 2016 and 1,591,214 as of December 31, 2015. 
 
 GEN-1 OVATION Study. In February 2015, we announced that the FDA accepted, without objection, the Phase I dose-escalation clinical trial of GEN-1 in combination with the standard of care in neo-adjuvant ovarian cancer (the OVATION Study). On September 30, 2015, we announced enrollment of the first patient in the OVATION Study. The OVATION Study will seek to identify a safe, tolerable and potentially therapeutically active dose of GEN-1 by recruiting and maximizing an immune response and is designed to enroll three to six patients per dose level and will evaluate safety and efficacy and attempt to define an optimal dose for a follow-on Phase I/II study combining GEN-1 with Avastin and Doxil . In addition, the OVATION Study establishes a unique opportunity to assess how cytokine-based compounds such as GEN-1, directly affect ovarian cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment in newly diagnosed patients. The study is designed to characterize the nature of the immune response triggered by GEN-1 at various levels of the patients' immune system, including: 

infiltration of cancer fighting T-cell lymphocytes into primary tumor and tumor microenvironment including peritoneal cavity, which is the primary site of metastasis of ovarian cancer; 

changes in local and systemic levels of immuno-stimulatory and immunosuppressive cytokines associated with tumor suppression and growth, respectively; and 

expression profile of a comprehensive panel of immune related genes in pre-treatment and GEN-1-treated tumor tissue. 
 
 We have initiated the OVATION Study at four clinical sites at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Oklahoma University Medical Center, Washington University in St. Louis and the Medical College of Wisconsin. During 2016 and 2017, we announced data from the first four cohorts of patients in the OVATION Study, respectively. The OVATION Study is designed to enroll three to six patients per dose cohort and will continue into 2017 with the goal to identify a safe, tolerable and therapeutically active dose of GEN-1 by recruiting and maximizing an immune response. The first four cohorts each enrolled three patients. Enrollment of three additional patients in the fourth cohort is ongoing, and Celsion expects to complete the OVATION Study in the first half of 2017. Future studies of GEN-1 will include a Phase I/II study combining GEN-1 with Avastin and Doxil . The results of the OVATION Study to date are as follows: 
 
 Totali ty of Results in the First Four Cohorts 

Of the first twelve patients dosed, one (1) patient demonstrated a complete response CR ), eight (8) patients demonstrated partial response PR and three patients demonstrated stable disease SD ), as measured by RECIST criteria. This translates to a 100 disease control rate DCR and 75 objective response rate ORR ). 

Eleven patients had successful resections of their tumors, with six (6) patients having an R0 resection, which indicates a microscopically margin-negative resection in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the tumor bed, and four (4) patients with a R1 resection, indicating microscopic residual tumor. One patient had an R2, indicating macroscopic residual tumor. One patient in the second cohort was ineligible for debulking surgery due to a medical complication unrelated to the study or the study drug. 

Of the eleven surgically treated and evaluable patients, one patient demonstrated a complete pathological response cPR ), five (5) patients demonstrated a micro pathological response microPR ), and five (5) patients demonstrated a macroPR. These data compare favorably to historical data, which indicate that cPRs are typically seen in less than 7 of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. cPRs have been associated with a median overall survival of 72 months, which is more than three years longer than those who do not experience a cPR. In addition, microPRs are seen in approximately 30 of patients, and are associated with a median overall survival of 38 months. 

All eleven patients who completed treatment follow-up experienced a dramatic (greater than 90 drop in their CA-125 protein levels as of their most recent study visit. CA-125 is used to monitor certain cancers during and after treatment. CA-125 is present in greater concentrations in ovarian cancer cells than in other cells. A 50 reduction in CA-125 levels is considered meaningful. 

40

Top Line Translational Data from First Two Cohorts 
 
 Celsion also reported initial translational data from the first two cohorts of patients. Tumor and blood samples collected before the start of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy NACT and after the completion of GEN-1 treatment at debulking surgery are being analyzed for immune cell populations. Top line data demonstrates intriguing immunological changes in the tumor that are consistent with the activation of the immune system. Specifically, 

In tumor tissue, there was an increase in cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell density in three out of four evaluable patients at debulking surgery. There was a decrease in immunosuppressive FoxP3+ T-cells in two out of those 4 patients. The ratio of CD8+/FoxP3+ cells was increased in all four evaluable patients. High tumor infiltrating CD8+ T-cell density, low FoxP3+ T-cell density or high CD8+/FoxP3+ ratio demonstrate a potential shift in tumor environment to favoring immune stimulation following NACT + GEN-1 therapy. For the remaining two patients the post-treatment tumor tissue was not available. In one of those two patients there was complete pathological response hence no tumor tissue was present to provide a post-treatment comparison. In the other patient the debulking surgery was not performed due to disease related complications. 

In plasma samples, there was no significant change in T-cell density following the treatment. The density of myeloid derived suppressor cells that are associated with immunosuppression in ovarian cancer were either decreased or did not increase in post-treatment samples. 
 
 Additional immune analysis of biological tissue including cytokine ELISA from the first two patient cohorts and a complete analysis of the two higher dose cohorts is in progress. We expect to report the final clinical and translational data from the OVATION Study in mid-2017. 
 
 GEN-1 Plus Doxil and Avastin Trial. On April 29, 2015, we announced the expansion of our ovarian cancer development program to include a Phase I dose escalating trial to evaluate GEN-1 in combination with Avastin and Doxil in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients. This new combination study in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is supported by three preclinical studies indicating that the combination of GEN-1 with Avastin may result in significant clinical benefit with a favorable safety profile. Specifically: 

In two preclinical studies using an animal model of disseminated ovarian cancer, GEN-1 in combination with Avastin led to a significant reduction in tumor burden and disease progression. The effectiveness of the combined treatment was seen when GEN-1 was combined with various dose levels of Avastin (low-medium-high). Additionally, it was shown that GEN-1 treatment alone resulted in anti-tumor activity that was as good as or better than Avastin treatment alone. 

The preclinical studies indicated that no obvious overt toxicities were associated with the combined treatments. The preclinical data are also consistent with the mechanism of action for GEN-1, which exhibits certain anti-angiogenic properties and suggests that combining GEN-1 with lower doses of Avastin may enhance efficacy and help reduce the known toxicities associated with this anti-VEGF drug. 

The distinct biological activities of GEN-1 (immune stimulation) and Avastin (inhibition of tumor blood vessel formation) makes a sound scientific rationale for this combination approach. Additionally, the anti-angiogenic activity of GEN-1 mediated through up regulation of the interferon gamma (IFN-g) pathway may help to explain the remarkable synergy between GEN-1 and Avastin and potentially addresses the VEGF escape mechanisms associated with resistance to Avastin therapy.

Business Plan and Going Concern 
 
 As a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, our business and our ability to execute our strategy to achieve our corporate goals are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Material risks and uncertainties relating to our business and our industry are described in "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 4.3 million in cash and short term investments. Given our development plans, we anticipate cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operations into mid-2017 and the Company has no committed sources of additional capital. The Company has a Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement (the ATM Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. (see Note 10). As a result of the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, among others, we are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when, if ever, and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product. Our inability to complete any of our research and development activities, preclinical studies or clinical trials in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements when appropriate could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity. While our estimated future capital requirements are uncertain and could increase or decrease as a result of many factors, including the extent to which we choose to advance our research, development activities, preclinical studies and clinical trials, or if we are in a position to pursue manufacturing or commercialization activities, we will need significant additional capital to develop our product candidates through development and clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and manufacture and commercialized approved products, if any. We do not know whether we will be able to access additional capital when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future success of our business. Based on the above, management has determined there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph which expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

From February 1, 2013 through February 25, 2013, the Company sold and issued an aggregate of 1,195,927 shares of common stock under the ATM, receiving approximately 6.8 million in net proceeds. The Company did not have any sales under the ATM from February 25, 2013 through September 30, 2015. On October 2, 2015, the Company filed a prospectus supplement whereby it registered 7.5 million of the remaining availability under the ATM. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company sold an aggregate of 283,608 shares for gross proceeds of 0.6 million. 

42

Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement on February 14, 2017 whereby it sold, in a public offering (the February 14, 2017 Public Offering), an aggregate of 19,385,869 shares of common stock of the Company at an offering price of 0.23 per share. In addition, the Company sold Series AA Warrants (the Series AA Warrants) to purchase up to 16,489,402 shares of common stock and Pre-Funded Series BB Warrants (the Pre-Funded Series BB Warrants) to purchase up to 2,600,000 shares of common stock. The Series AA Warrants have an exercise price of 0.23 per share, have a five year life and are immediately exercisable. The Pre-Funded Series BB Warrants were offered at 0.22 per share, are immediately exercisable for 0.01 per share of common stock, do not have an expiration date and were issued in lieu of shares of common stock to the extent that the purchase of common stock would cause the beneficial ownership of the Purchaser, together with its affiliates and certain related parties, to exceed 9.99 of our common stock. The Company received approximately 5.0 million in gross proceeds (excluding the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the warrants) in the February 14, 2017 Public Offering. 
 
 On June 20, 2014, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of EGEN, Inc. At the closing, we paid approximately 3.0 million in cash and issued 2,712,188 shares of its common stock to EGEN. In addition, 670,070 shares of common stock are issuable to EGEN pending satisfactory resolution of any post-closing adjustments of expenses and EGEN s indemnification obligations under the EGEN Purchase Agreement 
 
 In November 2013, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (Hercules) which permits up to 20 million in capital to be distributed in multiple tranches (the Hercules Credit Agreement). The Company drew the first tranche of 5 million upon closing of the Hercules Credit Agreement in November 2013 and used approximately 4 million of the proceeds to repay the outstanding obligations under its loan agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Horizon Technology Finance Corporation as discussed further below. On June 10, 2014, the Company closed the second 5 million tranche under the Hercules Credit Agreement. The proceeds were used to fund the 3.0 million upfront cash payment associated with Celsion's acquisition of EGEN, as well as the Company s transaction costs associated with the EGEN acquisition. Upon the closing of this second tranche, the Company has drawn down a total of 10 million under the Hercules Credit Agreement. The obligations under the Hercules Credit Agreement are in the form of secured indebtedness bearing interest at a calculated prime-based variable rate (11.25 per annum since inception through December 17, 2015, 11.50 from December 18, 2015 through December 15, 2016 and 11.75 since). Payments under the loan agreement were interest only for the first twelve months after loan closing, followed by a 30-month amortization period of principal and interest through the scheduled maturity date of June 1, 2017. 
 
 Please refer to Note 2 of the Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K. Also refer to Item IA, Risk Factors , including, but not limited to , We will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our planned future operations, and we may be unable to secure such capital without dilutive financing transactions. If we are not able to raise additional capital, we may not be able to complete the development, testing and commercialization of our product candidates. If we were not able to raise additional capital when needed, there would be substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our financial statements, which appear at Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require that we make certain assumptions and estimates and, in connection therewith, adopt certain accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are set forth in Note 1 to our financial statements. Of those policies, we believe that the policies discussed below may involve a higher degree of judgment and may be more critical to an accurate reflection of our financial condition and results of operations. 

43

Stock-Based Compensation 
 
 We follow the provisions of ASC topic 718 Compensation which requires the expense recognition over a service period for the fair value of share based compensation awards, such as stock options, restricted stock and performance based shares. This standard allows us to establish modeling assumptions as to expected stock price volatility, option terms, forfeiture and dividend rates, which directly impact estimated fair value as determined. Our practice is to utilize reasonable and supportable assumptions which are reviewed with our Board of Directors and its appropriate committee. 
 
 In-Process Research and Development, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill 
 
 During 2014, the Company acquired certain assets of EGEN, Inc. As more fully described in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, the acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting which required the Company to perform an allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. 
 
 We review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies on an ongoing basis to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosure system provides accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. As part of the process, the Company reviews the selection, application and communication of critical accounting policies and financial disclosures. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We review our estimates and the methods by which they are determined on an ongoing basis. However, actual results could differ from our estimates. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 Comparison of Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2016 and Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2015. 
 
 Licensing Revenue 
 
 In January 2013, we entered into a technology development contract with Hisun, pursuant to which Hisun paid us a non-refundable technology transfer fee of 5.0 million to support our development of ThermoDox in the China territory. The 5.0 million received as a non-refundable payment from Hisun in the first quarter 2013 has been recorded to deferred revenue and will be amortized over the ten year term of the agreement; therefore we recognized revenue of 500,000 in each of the years 2016 and 2015. 
 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 
 Research and development expenses remained unchanged at 14.6 million in 2016 and 2015. Costs associated with the Phase III OPTIMA Study were 5.6 million in 2016 compared to 3.6 million in 2015. Increased costs in the OPTIMA Study are due to higher patient enrollment costs, investigator grants and site initiation expenses. Costs associated with the HEAT Study decreased to 0.4 million in 2016 from 0.6 million in 2015. Costs associated with the HEAT Study are expected to be minimal as the Company has completed its final post-hoc overall survival analysis in 2016 and is in the process of closing out the study. Costs associated with our RCW breast cancer clinical trial were 0.3 million in 2016 compared to 0.5 million in 2015. Other clinical costs were 3.2 million in 2016 compared to 2.0 million in 2015. The increase of other clinical costs is associated with activities to support the Company s ThermoDox studies in Europe. Other research and development costs related to preclinical operations and regulatory affairs were 0.4 million in 2016 compared to 0.3 million in 2015. During 2015, the Company signed an amendment to a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the NIH which resulted in a 0.8 million downward adjustment to previously accrued contract liability costs in the current year. 
 
 Costs associated with the production of ThermoDox to support the OPTIMA Study decreased to 1.5 million in 2016 from 3.4 million incurred in 2015. Costs associated with CLSN Laboratories (which includes research and development activities and clinical studies for GEN-1, TheraPlas and TheraSilence) were 3.2 million in 2016 compared to 4.2 million in 2015. In 2015, the Company produced sufficient quantities of clinical supplies and the related components to fulfill its TheromDox requirements in the OPTIMA Study through enrollment and its GEN-1 clinical study requirements into 2017. 

44

General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 0.2 million to 6.5 million in 2016 compared to 6.7 million in 2015. This decrease is primarily the result of reductions in personnel costs of 0.4 million (including 0.1 million of non-cash stock compensation costs) and reductions in professional fees of 0.3 million offset by 0.6 million of non-cash amortization expense related to other intangible assets from the June 2014 EGEN acquisition. 
 
 Change in Earn-out Milestone Liability 
 
 The total aggregate purchase price for the acquisition of assets from EGEN included potential future earn-out payments contingent upon achievement of certain milestones. The difference between the aggregate 30.4 million in future earn-out payments and the 13.9 million included in the fair value of the acquisition consideration at June 20, 2014 was based on the Company's risk-adjusted assessment of each milestone and utilizing a discount rate based on the estimated time to achieve the milestone. These milestone payments are fair valued at the end of each quarter and any change in their value will be recognized in the financial statement. At December 31, 2016, the Company fair valued the earn-out milestone liability at 13.2 million and recognized a non-cash gain of 0.7 million during 2016 as a result of the change in the fair value of earn-out milestone liability of 13.9 million at December 31, 2015. Included in the non-cash gain during 2016, was the 0.7 million reduction of the liability during the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the write down of one of the in-process research and development assets (see Note 5) as the Company believes there is no probability of the payout of the related earn-out milestone liabilities. 
 
 Impairment of IPR D 
 
 At December 31, 2016, the Company concluded one of the IPR D assets related to the development of its RNA delivery system being developed with collaborators using their RNA product candidates, valued at 1.4 million, was impaired. Therefore, the Company wrote off the value of this IPR D asset incurring a non-cash charge of 1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. As previously mentioned above, the Company concluded there was no probability of payment of the earn-out milestones associated with this asset and therefore reduced the earn-out milestone liability by 0.7 million at the same time. The Company concluded none of the other IPR D assets were impaired at December 31, 2016. 
 
 Investment income and interest expense 
 
 In connection with its debt facilities the Company incurred 0.7 million and 1.4 million in interest expense in 2016 and 2015, respectively. This decrease was due to lower principle balances outstanding under the Company s current debt facilities with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. 
 
 Other (expense) income 
 
 Other (expense) income for 2016 and 2015 was not significant. 
 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Since inception we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. We have financed our operations primarily through the net proceeds from the sales of equity, credit facilities and amounts received under our product licensing agreement with Yakult and our technology development agreement with Hisun. The process of developing and commercializing ThermoDox , GEN-1 and other product candidates and technologies requires significant research and development work and clinical trial studies, as well as significant manufacturing and process development efforts. We expect these activities, together with our general and administrative expenses to result in significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our expenses have significantly and regularly exceeded our revenue, and we had an accumulated deficit of 241 million at December 31, 2016. 
 
 At December 31, 2016, we had total current assets of 4.5 million (including cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and related interest receivable on short term investments of 4.3 million) and current liabilities of 8.4 million, resulting in net working deficit of 4.1 million. At December 31, 2015 we had total current assets of 20.3 million (including cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and related interest receivable on short term investments of 20.1 million) and current liabilities of 9.3 million, resulting in net working capital of 11.0 million. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities for 2016 was 18.4 million. Our 2016 net loss included 1.5 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, 0.7 million in a non-cash benefit based on the change in the earn-out milestone liability and 0.6 million in non-cash amortization expense related to other intangible assets from the June 2014 EGEN acquisition. The 18.4 million net cash used in operating activities was mostly funded from cash and short term investments. At December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and related interest receivable on short term investments of 4.3 million. 

45

Net cash provided by financing activities was 6.8 million during 2016, 6.8 million of which resulted from net proceeds from sales of our common stock in June and December, 2016, which was partially offset by 4.1 million in debt service payments under the Hercules Credit Agreement. 
 
 In February 2013, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement (ATM) with Cantor Fitzgerald Co., as sales agent (Cantor), pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through Cantor, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 25.0 million (the ATM Shares) pursuant to our previously filed and effective Registration Statement on Form S-3. Under the ATM Agreement, Cantor may sell ATM Shares by any method deemed to be an at-the-market offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on The NASDAQ Capital Market, on any other existing trading market for the our common stock or to or through a market maker. We will pay Cantor a commission of three percent of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of ATM Shares. We have sold and issued an aggregate of 1,479,535 shares under the ATM Agreement so far, receiving approximately 7.6 million in gross proceeds. 
 
 On February 14, 2017 the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement whereby it sold, in a public offering (the February 14, 2017 Public Offering), an aggregate of 19,385,869 shares of common stock of the Company at an offering price of 0.23 per share. In addition, the Company sold Series AA Warrants (the Series AA Warrants) to purchase up to 16,489,402 shares of common stock and Pre-Funded Series BB Warrants (the Pre-Funded Series BB Warrants) to purchase up to 2,600,000 shares of common stock, which were issued in lieu of shares of common stock to the extent that the purchase of common stock would cause a beneficial ownership of such purchaser, together with its affiliates and certain related parties, to exceed 9.99 of our common stock. The Company received approximately 5.0 million in gross proceeds (excluding the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the warrants) in the February 14, 2017 Public Offering. 
 
 We had cash and investment resources of 4.3 million on hand at December 31, 2016 and have remaining availability of 17.4 million under the ATM. However, our future capital requirements will depend upon numerous unpredictable factors, including, without limitation, the cost, timing, progress and outcomes of clinical studies and regulatory reviews of our proprietary drug candidates, our efforts to implement new collaborations, licenses and strategic transactions, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures and other unforeseen uses of cash. 
 
 We may seek additional capital through further public or private equity offerings, debt financing, additional strategic alliance and licensing arrangements, collaborative arrangements, or some combination of these financing alternatives. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted and the newly issued equity securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. If we raise funds through the issuance of debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our common stock. If we seek strategic alliances, licenses, or other alternative arrangements, such as arrangements with collaborative partners or others, we may need to relinquish rights to certain of our existing or future technologies, product candidates, or products we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own, or to license the rights to our technologies, product candidates, or products on terms that are not favorable to us. The overall status of the economic climate could also result in the terms of any equity offering, debt financing, or alliance, license, or other arrangement being even less favorable to us and our stockholders than if the overall economic climate were stronger. We also will continue to look for government sponsored research collaborations and grants to help offset future anticipated losses from operations and, to a lesser extent, interest income. 
 
 If adequate funds are not available through either the capital markets, strategic alliances, or collaborators, we may be required to delay or, reduce the scope of, or terminate our research, development, clinical programs, manufacturing, or commercialization efforts, or effect additional changes to our facilities or personnel, or obtain funds through other arrangements that may require us to relinquish some of our assets or rights to certain of our existing or future technologies, product candidates, or products on terms not favorable to us. 
 
 Based on the above, Management has determined there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph which expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Contractual Obligations 
 
 In 2011, we entered into a lease with Brandywine Operating Partnership, L.P. (Brandywine), a Delaware limited partnership for a 10,870 square foot premises located in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. In October 2011, we relocated our offices to Lawrenceville, New Jersey from Columbia, Maryland. The lease has a remaining term of 4 months. As required by the lease, we provided Brandywine with an irrevocable and unconditional standby letter of credit for 250,000, which we secured with an escrow deposit at our banking institution of this same amount. The lease stipulated standby letter of credit will be reduced by 50,000 on each of the 19th, 31st and 43rd months from the initial term, with the remaining 100,000 amount remaining until the term of the lease has expired. In connection with three 50,000 reductions of the standby letter of credit in April 2013, 2014 and 2015, we reduced the escrow deposit by 50,000 each time. In late 2015, Lenox Drive Office Park LLC, purchased the real estate and office building and assumed the lease. The Company is currently in negotiations with the landlord to extend the lease term and to reduce the square footage by approximately 30 . 
 
 In connection with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of EGEN, Inc., an Alabama corporation, in June 2014, we assumed the existing lease with another landlord for an 11,500 square foot premises located in Huntsville Alabama. This lease has a remaining term of 13 months with monthly rent payments of approximately 23,200.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 The primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-prevailing rate and the interest rate later rises, the principal amount of our investment will probably decline. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2016 by an immaterial amount. To minimize this risk in the future, we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, government and non-government debt securities and/or money market funds that invest in such securities. We have no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments. As of December 31, 2016, our investments consisted of investments in corporate notes and obligations or in money market accounts and checking funds with variable market rates of interest. We believe our credit risk is immaterial.

 The financial statements, supplementary data and report of independent registered public accounting firm are filed as part of this report on pages F-1 through F-32 and incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
 None. 
 
 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) under the supervision, and with the participation, of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of December 31, 2016, which is the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 
 (b) Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework . Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2016. 
 
 Pursuant to Regulation S-K Item 308(b), this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their cost. 
 
 (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016, which were identified in connection with our management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
 of Celsion Corporation: 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Celsion Corporation (the Company as of December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of their internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has accumulated deficit that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

CELSION CORPORATION 
 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015 
 
 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 Description of Business 
 
 Celsion Corporation, a Delaware corporation based in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, and its wholly owned subsidiary, CLSN Laboratories, Inc., also a Delaware corporation, referred to herein as Celsion , we , or the Company, as the context requires, is a fully-integrated, development stage oncology drug company focused on developing a portfolio of innovative cancer treatments, including directed chemotherapies, immunotherapies and RNA- or DNA-based therapies. Our lead program is ThermoDox , a proprietary heat-activated liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin, currently in Phase III development for the treatment of primary liver cancer. Our pipeline also includes GEN-1, a DNA-based immunotherapy for the localized treatment of ovarian and brain cancers. We have three platform technologies for the development of treatments for those suffering with difficult-to-treat forms of cancer, novel nucleic acid-based immunotherapies and other anti-cancer DNA or RNA therapies, including TheraPlas and TheraSilence. We are working to develop and commercialize more efficient, effective and targeted oncology therapies based on our technologies, with the goal to develop novel therapeutics that maximize efficacy while minimizing side-effects common to cancer treatments. 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Celsion have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the United States and include the accounts of the Company and CLSN Laboratories, Inc. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the amount reported in the Company s financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 
 
 Events and conditions arising subsequent to the most recent balance sheet date through the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements have been evaluated for their possible impact on the financial statements and accompanying notes. No events and conditions would give rise to any information that required accounting recognition or disclosure in the financial statements other than those arising in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 At the inception of each collaborative agreement that includes milestone payments, the Company evaluates whether each milestone is substantive on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone, specifically reviewing factors such as the scientific and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone, as well as the level of effort and investment required. Milestones that are not considered substantive and that do not meet the separation criteria are accounted for as license payments and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of performance. Payments received or reasonably assured after performance obligations are met completely are recognized as earned. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. A portion of these funds are not covered by FDIC insurance. 
 
 Fair Value of Investment Securities 
 
 The carrying values of investment securities approximate their respective fair values. 

F-10

Short Term Investments 
 
 The Company classifies its investments in marketable securities with readily determinable fair values as investments available-for-sale in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities . Available-for-sale securities consist of debt and equity securities not classified as trading securities or as securities to be held to maturity. The Company has classified all of its investments as available-for-sale. Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as a net amount in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss in stockholders equity until realized. Gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined using the specific identification method. The Company s short term investments consist of corporate bonds and government agency bonds. 
 
 Property and Equipment 
 
 Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from three to seven years, using the straight-line method. Amortization is recognized over the lesser of the life of the asset or the lease term. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized at cost and ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged against operating expenses as incurred. Depreciation expense was approximately 455,000 and 425,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 
 The Company reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset, if any, exceeds its fair value determined using a discounted cash flow model. 
 
 Deposits 
 
 Deposits include real property security deposits and other deposits which are contractually required and of a long-term nature. 
 
 In-Process Research and Development, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill 
 
 During 2014, the Company acquired certain assets of EGEN, Inc. As more fully described in Note 5, the acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting which required the Company to perform an allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. 
 
 Patent Licenses 
 
 The Company has purchased several licenses for rights to patented technologies. Patent license costs of 75,000 have been capitalized and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the related patent. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the total accumulated amortization expense is 75,000 and 69,375, respectively. The weighted-average amortization period for these assets is 10 years. 
 
 Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
 
 ASC 220, Comprehensive Income , establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income (loss) and its components in the Company s consolidated financial statements. The objective of ASC 220 is to report a measure (comprehensive income (loss)) of all changes in equity of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events in a period other than transactions with owners. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Equipment and facilities acquired for research and development activities that have alternative future uses are capitalized and charged to expense over their estimated useful lives. 

F-11

Net Loss Per Common Share 
 
 Basic and diluted net loss per common share was computed by dividing net loss for the year by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, both basic and diluted, during each period. The impact of common stock equivalents has been excluded from the computation of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding in periods where there is a net loss, as their effect is anti-dilutive. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, the total number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants and equity awards was 23,831,883. The Pre-funded Series B Warrants (as more fully described in Note 10 of these financial statements) are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock totaling 1,850,000 are considered issued in calculating basic loss per share. For the year ended December 31, 2016, diluted loss per common share was the same as basic loss per common share as the other 21,984,210 warrants and equity awards that were convertible into shares of the Company s common stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2015, the total number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants and equity awards was 8,116,015. For the year ended December 31, 2015, diluted loss per common share was the same as basic loss per common share as all options and all warrants that were convertible into shares of the Company s common stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings attributable to common stockholders per common share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax asset and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in results of operations in the period that the tax rate change occurs. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position taken would be sustained in a tax examination, presuming that a tax examination will occur. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in the income tax expense category. 
 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 
 Compensation costs for all stock-based awards are measured at fair value on the date of the grant and recognized over the service period for awards expected to vest. The estimation of stock-based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from the current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as cumulative adjustments in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. 
 
 Reclassifications 
 
 Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to classifications used in the current year. These classifications had no impact on net loss, stockholders equity or cash flows as previously reported. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, or do not apply to our operations. 

F-12

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes all existing revenue recognition requirements, including most industry-specific guidance. . The new standard requires a company to recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 was originally going to be effective on January 1, 2017; however, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to January 1, 2018. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-8, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations. The amendments in this ASU do not change the core principle of ASU No. 2014-09 but the amendments clarify the implementation guidance on reporting revenue gross versus net. The effective date for the amendments in this ASU is the same as the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing), to clarify the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing. The standard allows for either full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these standards and at this point, nothing has come to the Company s attention that would indicate the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, however the adoption of these standards may have a material impact on the Company s disclosures. 
 
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern . This ASU requires entities to evaluate for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable.) The ASU was effective for annual reporting periods after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03 Interest Imputation of Interest (ASU Subtopic 835-30). The new standard requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU Subtopic 835-30 became effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016 and was applied retrospectively. This adoption resulted in the reclassification of unamortized deferred financing fees related to the Company s notes payable from other assets totaling 3,517 and 26,131 as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
 
 In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which requires that most equity investments be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income (other than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting). This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires that lessees recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms greater than twelve months in the statement of financial position. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. This update also requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The new standard simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods; however, early adoption is allowed. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of the new standard on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

2. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND GOING CONCERN 
 
 Since inception, the Company has incurred substantial operating losses, principally from expenses associated with the Company s research and development programs, clinical trials conducted in connection with the Company s product candidates, and applications and submissions to the Food and Drug Administration. We have not generated significant revenue and have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had a net loss of 22.1 million and used 18.4 million to fund operations. We have incurred approximately 241 million of cumulated net losses. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 4.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. We have substantial future capital requirements to continue our research and development activities and advance our product candidates through various development stages. The Company believes these expenditures are essential for the commercialization of its technologies. 
 
 The Company expects its operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future as it continues its product development efforts, and when it undertakes marketing and sales activities. The Company s ability to achieve profitability is dependent upon its ability to obtain governmental approvals, produce, and market and sell its new product candidates. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to commercialize its technology successfully or that profitability will ever be achieved. The operating results of the Company have fluctuated significantly in the past. The Company expects that its operating results will fluctuate significantly in the future and will depend on a number of factors, many of which are outside the Company s control. 
 
 The Company will need substantial additional funding in order to complete the development, testing and commercialization of its oncology product candidates and we have made a significant commitment to heat-activated liposome research and development projects. It is our intention at least to maintain the pace and scope of these development activities. 
 
 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. In making this assessment, management conducted a comprehensive review of the Company s business plan including, but not limited to: 

the Company s financial position for the year ended December 31, 2016; 

significant events and transaction the Company has entered into since December 31, 2016; 

the Company s cash flow and cash usage forecasts for the period one year from the issuance date of the this Annual Report on Form 10-K; 

the impact of the monthly payments of the note payable totaling 2.6 million at December 31, 2016; 

the Company s capitalization structure including common stock outstanding and common stock issuable on exercise of warrants and equity awards, and other common stock issuable under equity plans; and 

continued support of the Company s stockholders and lender. 
 
 As a result of the uncertainties involved in our business, we are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when, if ever, and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product. Our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements, when appropriate, could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity. These uncertainties could force us to seek additional, external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy. Our inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us, would jeopardize the future success of our business. Our estimated future capital requirements are uncertain and could change materially as a result of many factors, including the progress of our research, development, clinical, manufacturing, and commercialization activities. 
 
 Management has determined the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit that raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from our issuance date. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph, which expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty. 
 
 A fundamental component of the ability to continue as a going concern is the Company s ability to raise capital as required, as to which no assurances can be provided. To address the additional funding requirements of the Company, management has undertaken the following initiatives: 

on February 14, 2017, the Company raised approximately 5.0 million in gross proceeds through a public offering of its common stock and warrants to purchase common stock (see Note 18); 

the Company will request an increase of its authorized shares sufficient to allow for the funding of its clinical programs at its next Annual Meeting of Stockholders; 

the Company has 7.5 million under a controlled equity offering facility (see Note 10) 

it has assessed its current expenditures and will be reducing the current spending requirements where necessary; 

it will pursue additional capital funding in the public and private markets through equity sales and/or debt facilities; 

it will pursue possible partnerships and collaborations; and 

it will pursue potential out licensing for its drug candidates. 

F-14

Our ability to continue as a going concern may depend on our ability to raise additional capital, attain further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures, and, ultimately, to generate revenue. There are no assurances that these future funding and operating efforts will be successful. If management is unsuccessful in these efforts, our current capital is not expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. 
 
 3. SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS AVAILABLE FOR SALE 
 
 Short term investments available for sale of 1,680,000 and 10,799,890 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, consist of money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and government agency debt securities. They are valued at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
 
 Securities available for sale are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary. The term other than temporary is not intended to indicate a permanent decline in value. Rather, it means that the prospects for near term recovery of value are not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to, or greater than, the carrying value of the security. Management reviews criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline, as well as the reasons for the decline, to predict whether the loss in value is other than temporary. Once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized.

 4. FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
 FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Section 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes a three tier level hierarchy for fair value measurements which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
 
 Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) or identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 
 
 Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
 
 Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity s own assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
 
 The fair values of securities available for sale are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized exchanges (Level 1 inputs) or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents, other current assets, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities are reflected in the balance sheets at their estimated fair values primarily due to their short-term nature. There were no transfers of assets of liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 and no transfers in or out of Level 3 during 2016 or 2015 except for the change in the earn-out milestone liability included in earnings.

5. ACQUISITION OF EGEN, INC. 
 
 On June 20, 2014, Celsion completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of EGEN, Inc., an Alabama Corporation (EGEN) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (EGEN Purchase Agreement). CLSN Laboratories, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celsion (CLSN Laboratories), acquired all of EGEN s right, title and interest in and to substantially all of the assets of EGEN, including cash and cash equivalents, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, clinical data, certain contracts, licenses and permits, equipment, furniture, office equipment, furnishings, supplies and other tangible personal property. In addition, CLSN Laboratories assumed certain specified liabilities of EGEN, including the liabilities arising out of the acquired contracts and other assets relating to periods after the closing date. 
 
 The total aggregate purchase price for the acquisition is up to 44.4 million, which includes potential future payments of up to 30.4 million contingent upon achievement of certain milestones set forth in the EGEN Purchase Agreement (Earn-Out Payments). At the closing, Celsion paid approximately 3.0 million in cash after expense adjustment and issued 2,712,188 shares of its common stock to EGEN. The shares of Celsion s common stock were issued in a private transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof. In addition, 670,070 shares of Celsion common stock are issuable to EGEN pending satisfactory resolution of any post-closing adjustments of expenses and EGEN s indemnification obligations under the EGEN Purchase Agreement (Holdback Shares). A Registration Statement (File No. 333-198786) was filed on September 16, 2014 and declared effective on September 30, 2014 for the resale of the shares of common stock issued and issuable to EGEN under the EGEN Purchase Agreement. 
 
 The Earn-Out Payments of up to 30.4 million will become payable, in cash, shares of Celsion common stock or a combination thereof, at Celsion s option, as follows: 

12.4 million will become payable upon achieving certain specified development milestones relating to an ovarian cancer study of GEN-1 to be conducted by the Company or its subsidiary; 

12.0 million will become payable upon achieving certain specified development milestones relating to a glioblastoma multiforme brain cancer study of GEN-1 to be conducted by the Company or its subsidiary; and 

Up to 6.0 million will become payable upon achieving certain specified milestones relating to the TheraSilence technology. 

F-17

On June 9, 2014, Celsion borrowed an additional 5 million pursuant to a certain Loan and Security Agreement dated as of November 25, 2013, by and between Celsion and Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (see Note 8). Celsion used the loan proceeds to pay the upfront cash payment at closing and certain transaction costs incurred by Celsion in connection with the acquisition. 
 
 The EGEN Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties regarding EGEN and Celsion, covenants regarding the conduct of EGEN s business prior to the consummation of the acquisition, indemnification provisions, termination and other provisions customary for transactions of this nature. 
 
 The acquisition of EGEN was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting which required the Company to perform an allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the consideration transferred for the acquisition was approximately 27.6 million. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price was allocated to EGEN s net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the fair values of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the acquisition.

Acquired in-process research and development (IPR D) consists of EGEN's drug technology platforms: TheraPlas and TheraSilence. The fair value of the IPR D drug technology platforms was estimated to be 24.2 million as of the acquisition date. As of the closing of the acquisition, the IPR D is considered indefinite lived intangible assets and will not be amortized. IPR D is reviewed for impairment at least annually as of our third quarter ended September 30, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets might not be recoverable. 

As of September 30, 2016, after our assessment of the totality of the events that could impair IPR D, it was the Company s conclusion it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. Therefore, the Company was not required to calculate the fair value of the intangible assets and perform a quantitative impairment test. 

At December 31, 2016, the Company determined one of the IPR D assets related to the development of its RNA delivery system being developed with collaborators using their RNA product candidates may be impaired. After reassessment of the September 30, 2016 analysis above, the Company concluded that this asset, valued at 1.4 million, was impaired. Therefore, the Company wrote off the value of this IPR D asset incurring a non-cash charge of 1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In connection with the writeoff of this IPR D asset, the Company concluded there was no probability of payments of the earn-out milestones associated with this asset and therefore reduced the earn-out milestone liability by 0.7 million at the same time. The Company concluded none of the other IPR D assets were impaired at December 31, 2016. 
 
 Pursuant to the EGEN Purchase Agreement, EGEN provided certain covenants Covenant Not To Compete to the Company whereby EGEN agreed, during the period ending on the seventh anniversary of the closing date of the acquisition on June 20, 2014, not to enter into any business, directly or indirectly, which competes with the business of the Company nor will it contact, solicit or approach any of the employees of the Company for purposes of offering employment. 
 
 At the end of 2016, the Company concluded the Covenant Not To Compete which was valued at approximately 1.6 million at the date of the EGEN acquisition had a definitive life and should be amortized on a straight line basis over its life of 7 years. Therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a non-cash adjustment of 568,290 representing the cumulative amount of amortization expense from the date of acquisition through the end of 2016. The fair value of the Covenant Not To Compete was 1,022,924 net of 568,290 accumulated amortization as of December 31, 2016 and 1,591,214 as of December 31, 2015.

The purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired by approximately 2.0 million which was recorded as Goodwill. Goodwill represents the difference between the total purchase price for the net assets purchased from EGEN and the aggregate fair values of tangible and intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually as of our third quarter ended September 30 or sooner if we believe indicators of impairment exist. 

As of September 30, 2016, after our assessment of the totality of the events that could impair goodwill, it is the Company s conclusion it is not more likely than not that the Goodwill is impaired. Therefore, the Company was not required to conduct a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. 

At December 31, 2016, as a result of the substantial doubt in the Company s ability to continue as a going concern (Note 2), we again reviewed Goodwill for impairment by comparing the Company s fair value to see if it exceeded its carrying value, known as the Step 1 approach. We concluded that the Company s fair value exceeded its carrying value, and that measurement for an amount of an impairment loss, known as Step 2, was not required as Goodwill is considered not to be impaired.

8. NOTES PAYABLE 
 
 Hercules Credit Agreement 
 
 In November 2013, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (Hercules) which permits up to 20 million in capital to be distributed in multiple tranches (the Hercules Credit Agreement). The Company drew the first tranche of 5 million upon closing of the Hercules Credit Agreement in November 2013 and used approximately 4 million of the proceeds to repay the outstanding obligations under its loan agreement with Oxford Finance LLC and Horizon Technology Finance Corporation as discussed further below. On June 10, 2014, the Company closed the second 5 million tranche under the Hercules Credit Agreement. The proceeds were used to fund the 3.0 million upfront cash payment associated with Celsion's acquisition of EGEN, as well as the Company s transaction costs associated with the EGEN acquisition. Upon the closing of this second tranche, the Company has drawn down a total of 10 million under the Hercules Credit Agreement. 
 
 The obligations under the Hercules Credit Agreement are in the form of secured indebtedness bearing interest at a calculated prime-based variable rate (11.25 per annum since inception through December 17, 2015, 11.50 from December 18, 2015 through December 15, 2016 and 11.75 since). Payments under the loan agreement were interest only for the first twelve months after loan closing, followed by a 30-month amortization period of principal and interest through the scheduled maturity date of June 1, 2017. 
 
 In connection with the Hercules Credit Agreement, the Company incurred cash expenses of 122,378 which were recorded as deferred financing fees. These deferred financing fees are being amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the loan. Also in connection with the Hercules Credit Facility, the Company paid loan origination fees of 230,000 which has been classified as debt discount. This amount is being amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the loan. 
 
 As a fee in connection with the Hercules Credit Agreement, the Company issued Hercules a warrant for a total of 97,493 shares of the Company s common stock (the Hercules Warrant) at a per share exercise price of 3.59, exercisable for cash or by net exercise from November 25, 2013. Upon the closing of the second tranche on June 10, 2014, this warrant became exercisable for an additional 97,493 shares of the Company s common stock. The Hercules Warrant will expire November 25, 2018. Hercules has certain rights to register the common stock underlying the Hercules Warrant pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement with the Company dated November 25, 2013. The registration rights expire on the date when such stock may be sold under Rule 144 without restriction or upon the first year anniversary of the registration statement for such stock, whichever is earlier. The common stock issuable pursuant to the Hercules Warrant was filed pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933 on the Prospectus for Registration Statement No. 333-193936 and was declared effective on September 30, 2014. 

F-19

The Company valued the Hercules Warrant issued at the inception of the loan using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recorded 521,763 in 2013 as deferred financing fees. In calculating the value of the warrants, the Company assumed a volatility rate of 102 , risk free interest rate of 1.37 , an expected life of 5 years, a stock price of 3.55 (closing price on date of the Hercules Warrant) and no expected forfeitures nor dividends. In the second quarter of 2014, the Company reassessed the classification of the warrants and concluded the original amount should be reclassified from deferred financing fees and equity. Therefore, other assets and additional paid in capital were both reduced by the 521,763. The Company then valued the warrant for the initial 97,493 shares of the Company s common stock as of the inception of the loan and recorded 260,928 as a debt discount to be amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the loan and recognized a warrant liability for this amount. In connection with the closing of the second 5 million tranche on June 9, 2014, the Company then valued the warrant for the additional 97,493 shares of the Company s common stock which became available and exercisable as of the date and recorded 215,333 as a debt discount to be amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the loan and recognized a warrant liability for this amount. In calculating the value of the warrant for the additional shares of the Company s common stock on June 10, 2014, the Company assumed a volatility rate of 104 , risk free interest rate of 1.69 , an expected remaining life of 4.5 years, a stock price of 3.07 (closing price June 9, 2014) and no expected forfeitures nor dividends. In 2014, the warrant liability was fair valued at the end of each quarter and the resulting change in fair value will be recognized in net income. 
 
 In the second quarter of 2015, the Company concluded the warrant provision which provided for the exercise price to be adjusted downward as described above had expired. Therefore, the Company valued the warrant at 336,254 immediately prior to this event and recorded non-cash charges to net income of 18,018 and 61,246 in the second quarter and year to date periods of 2015, respectively. The Company also reduced the liability to zero and increased equity by 336,254 at this time. 
 
 Also in connection with each of the 5.0 million tranches, the Company will be required to pay an end of term charge equal to 3.5 of each original loan amount at time of maturity. Therefore, these amounts totaling 350,000 are being amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the loan. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred 486,327 in interest expense and amortized 236,666 as interest expense for deferred fees, debt discount and end of term charges in connection with the Hercules Credit Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred 918,465 in interest expense and amortized 438,717 as interest expense for deferred fees, debt discount and end of term charges in connection with the Hercules Credit Agreement. 
 
 The Hercules Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the Company s ability to grant liens, incur indebtedness, make certain restricted payments, merge or consolidate and make dispositions of assets. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Hercules Credit Agreement, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Hercules Credit Agreement, declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and foreclose on or liquidate the Company s assets that comprise the lenders collateral. The Hercules Credit Agreement specifies a number of events of default (some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods), including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, a material adverse effect on the Company or its assets, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and material judgment defaults. The Company has maintained compliance with these covenants.

The evaluation of the realizability of such deferred tax assets in future periods is made based upon a variety of factors that affect the Company s ability to generate future taxable income, such as intent and ability to sell assets and historical and projected operating performance. At this time, the Company has established a valuation reserve for all of its deferred tax assets. Such tax assets are available to be recognized and benefit future periods.

During 2016, 2015 and in prior years, the Company performed analyses to determine if there were changes in ownership, as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code that would limit its ability to utilize certain net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. The Company determined that it experienced an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, in connection with certain common stock offerings on July 25, 2011, February 5, 2013, June 3, 2013 and on June 1, 2015. As a result, the utilization of the Company's federal tax net operating loss carry forwards generated prior to the ownership changes are limited. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has net operating loss carry forwards for U.S. federal and state tax purposes of approximately 85.6 million, before excluding net operating losses that have been limited as a result of Section 382 limitations. The annual limitation due to Section 382 for net operating loss carry forward utilization is approximately 4.9 million per year for approximately 90 million in net operating loss carry forwards existing at the ownership change occurring on July 25, 2011, approximately 1.4 million per year for approximately 34 million of additional net operating losses occurring from July 2011 to the ownership change that occurred on February 5, 2013, and approximately 1.5 million per year for approximately 34 million of additional net operating losses occurring from February 5, 2013 to the ownership change that occurred on June 3, 2013 and approximately 1.6 million per year for approximately 31 million of additional net operating losses occurring from June 3, 2013 to the ownership change that occurred on June 1, 2015. The utilization of these net operating loss carry forwards may be further limited if the Company experiences future ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.

The fair values of stock options granted were estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes model was originally developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have different characteristics from Celsion s nonqualified stock options. The model is also sensitive to changes in assumptions, which can materially affect the fair value estimate. The Company used the following assumptions for determining the fair value of options granted under the Black-Scholes option pricing model:

Expected volatilities utilized in the model are based on historical volatility of the Company s stock price. The risk free interest rate is derived from values assigned to U.S. Treasury strips as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect at the time of grant. The model incorporates exercise, pre-vesting and post-vesting forfeiture assumptions based on analysis of historical data. The expected life of the fiscal 2016 and 2015 grants was generated using the simplified method as allowed under Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. 
 
 12. EARN-OUT MILESTONE LIABILITY 
 
 The total aggregate purchase price for the EGEN Acquisition included potential future Earn-out Payments contingent upon achievement of certain milestones. The difference between the aggregate 30.4 million in future Earn-out Payments and the 13.9 million included in the fair value of the acquisition consideration at June 20, 2014 was based on the Company's risk-adjusted assessment of each milestone (10 to 67 and utilizing a discount rate based on the estimated time to achieve the milestone (1.5 to 2.5 years). The earn-out milestone liability will be fair valued at the end of each quarter and any change in their value will be recognized in the financial statements. 
 
 At December 31, 2016, the Company fair valued the earn-out milestone liability at 13.2 million and recognized a non-cash gain of 0.7 million during 2016 as a result of the change in the fair value of earn-out milestone liability of 13.9 million at December 31, 2015. Included in the non-cash gain during 2016, was the reduction of the liability by 0.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the write down of one of the in-process research and development assets (see Note 5) as the Company believes there is no probability of the payout of the related earn-out milestone liabilities. The fair value of the remaining earn-out milestone liabilities at December 31, 2016 was based on the Company's risk-adjusted assessment of each milestone (50 to 80 utilizing a discount rate based on the estimated time to achieve the milestone (2.0 to 2.5 years). At December 31, 2015, the Company fair valued the earn-out milestone liability at 13.9 million and recognized a non-cash loss of 257,702 during 2015 as a result of the change in the fair value of earn-out milestone liability from 13.7 million at June 30, 2015. The fair value of the earn-out milestone liability at December 31, 2015 was based on the Company's risk-adjusted assessment of each milestone (10 to 67 and utilizing a discount rate based on the estimated time to achieve the milestone (1.2 to 6.5 years). 
 
 The following is a summary of the changes in the earn-out milestone liability for 2015 and 2016:

13. WARRANTS 
 
 As more fully described in Note 10, the Company completed a series of equity financing transactions in 2016 and 2015 that included the issuance of warrants to purchase 16,066,371 and 1,950,000 shares, respectively, of the Company s common stock. In connection with the Hercules Credit Agreement entered into in November 2013 as more fully described in Note 8, the Company issued warrants to purchase 194,986 shares of the Company s common stock. We did not have any option or warrant exercises during 2015 through 2016 other than 250,000 shares during the third quarter of 2016 related to the Pre-funded Series B Warrants as discussed more fully in Note 10.

14. CELSION EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
 
 Celsion maintains a defined-contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan covers substantially all employees over the age of 21. Participating employees may defer a portion of their pretax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit. Commencing in the fourth quarter for 2008, the Company began making a matching contribution up to a maximum of 3 of an employee s annual salary and the Company s total contribution for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 82,391 and 80,408 respectively. The Company s contribution was made in the form of our common stock. 
 
 15. LICENSES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS 
 
 On November 10, 1999, the Company entered into a license agreement with Duke University Duke under which the Company received worldwide exclusive rights (subject to certain exceptions) to commercialize and use Duke s thermally sensitive liposome technology. The license agreement contains annual royalty and minimum payment provisions due on net sales. The agreement also required milestone-based royalty payments measured by various events, including product development stages, FDA applications and approvals, foreign marketing approvals and achievement of significant sales. However, in lieu of such milestone-based cash payments, Duke agreed to accept shares of the Company s common stock to be issued in installments at the time each milestone payment is due, with each installment of shares to be calculated at the average closing price of the common stock during the 20 trading days prior to issuance. 
 
 The total number of shares issuable to Duke under these provisions is subject to adjustment in certain cases, and Duke has piggyback registration rights for public offerings taking place more than one year after the effective date of the license agreement. On January 31, 2003, the Company issued 253,691 shares of common stock to Duke University valued at 2.2 million as payment for milestone based royalties under this license agreement. An amendment to the Duke license agreement contains certain development and regulatory milestones, and other performance requirements that the Company has met with respect to the use of the licensed technologies. The Company will be obligated to make royalty payments based on sales to Duke upon commercialization, until the last of the Duke patents expire. 

F-29

For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has not incurred any expense under this agreement and will not incur any future liabilities until commercial sales commence. 
 
 Under the November 1999 license agreement with Duke, the Company has rights to the thermally sensitive liposome technology, including Duke s US patents covering the technology as well as all foreign counter parts and related pending applications. Foreign counterpart applications have been issued in Europe, Hong Kong, Australia and Canada and have been allowed in Japan. The European patent has been validated in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, Spain and Switzerland. In addition, the Duke license agreement provides the Company with rights to multiple issued and pending US patents related to the formulation, method of making and use of heat sensitive liposomes. The Company s rights under the license agreement with Duke extend for the life of the last-to-expire of the licensed patents. 
 
 The Company has licensed from Valentis, CA certain global rights covering the use of pegylation for temperature sensitive liposomes. 
 
 In addition to the rights available to the Company under completed or pending license agreements, the Company is actively pursuing patent protection for technologies developed by the Company. Among these patents is a family of pending US and international patent applications which seek to protect the Company s proprietary method of storing ThermoDox which is critical for worldwide distribution channels. 
 
 ThermoDox is a registered trademark in the U.S., Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, Columbia, the European Communities: (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, UK), Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. The Company has registered transliterations of ThermoDox in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. The Company has an additional 14 trademark protection applications pending for ThermoDox in countries world-wide. 
 
 Finally, through proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants and others, the Company seeks to protect its own proprietary know-how and trade secrets. The Company cannot offer assurances that these confidentiality agreements will not be breached, that the Company will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that these agreements, even if fully enforced, will be adequate to prevent third-party use of the Company s proprietary technology. Similarly, the Company cannot guarantee that technology rights licensed to it by others will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by third parties, or that the rights granted will provide the Company with adequate protection. 
 
 16. TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS 
 
 On May 7, 2012 the Company entered into a long term commercial supply agreement with Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Hisun) for the production of ThermoDox in the China territory. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, Hisun will be responsible for providing all of the technical and regulatory support services, including the costs of all technical transfer, registration and bioequivalence studies, technical transfer costs, Celsion consultative support costs and the purchase of any necessary equipment and additional facility costs necessary to support capacity requirements for the manufacture of ThermoDox . Celsion will repay Hisun for the aggregate amount of these development costs and fees commencing on the successful completion of three registration batches of ThermoDox . Hisun is also obligated to certain performance requirements under the agreement. The agreement will initially be limited to a percentage of the production requirements of ThermoDox in the China territory with Hisun retaining an option for additional global supply after local regulatory approval in the China territory. In addition, Hisun will collaborate with Celsion around the regulatory approval activities for ThermoDox with the China State Food and Drug Administration (CHINA FDA). During the first quarter of 2015, Hisun completed the successful manufacture of three registration batches of ThermoDox and the Company accrued 685,787 for the aggregate development costs and fees associated with these batches in March 2015. This amount was paid in April 2015. 
 
 On January 18, 2013, we entered into a technology development contract with Hisun, pursuant to which Hisun paid us a non-refundable research and development fee of 5 million to support our development of ThermoDox in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau (the China territory). Following our announcement on January 31, 2013 that the HEAT study failed to meet its primary endpoint, Celsion and Hisun have agreed that the Technology Development Contract entered into on January 18, 2013 will remain in effect while the parties continue to collaborate and are evaluating the next steps in relation to ThermoDox , which include the sub-group analysis of patients in the Phase III HEAT Study for the hepatocellular carcinoma clinical indication and other activities to further the development of ThermoDox for the Greater China market. The 5.0 million received as a non-refundable payment from Hisun in the first quarter 2013 has been recorded to deferred revenue and will continue to be amortized over the 10 year term of the agreement, until such time as the parties find a mutually acceptable path forward on the development of ThermoDox based on findings of the ongoing post-study analysis of the HEAT Study data. 

F-30

On July 19, 2013, the Company and Hisun entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to pursue ongoing collaborations for the continued clinical development of ThermoDox as well as the technology transfer relating to the commercial manufacture of ThermoDox for the China territory. This expanded collaboration includes development of the next generation liposomal formulation with the goal of creating safer, more efficacious versions of marketed cancer chemotherapeutics. 
 
 Among the key provisions of the Celsion-Hisun Memorandum of Understanding are: 

Hisun will provide the Company with non-dilutive financing and the investment necessary to complete the technology transfer of its proprietary manufacturing process and the production of registration batches for the China territory; 

Hisun will collaborate with the Company around the clinical and regulatory approval activities for ThermoDox as well as other liposomal formations with the CHINA FDA; and 

Hisun will be granted a right of first offer for a commercial license to ThermoDox for the sale and distribution of ThermoDox in the China territory. 
 
 On August 8, 2016, we signed a Technology Transfer, Manufacturing and Commercial Supply Agreement GEN-1 Agreement with Hisun to pursue an expanded partnership for the technology transfer relating to the clinical and commercial manufacture and supply of GEN-1, Celsion s proprietary gene mediated, IL-12 immunotherapy, for the greater China territory, with the option to expand into other countries in the rest of the world after all necessary regulatory approvals are in effect. The GEN-1 Agreement will help to support supply for both ongoing and planned clinical studies in the U.S., and for potential future studies of GEN-1 in China. GEN-1 is currently being evaluated by Celsion in first line ovarian cancer patients. 
 
 Key provisions of the GEN-1 Agreement are as follows: 

the GEN-1 Agreement has targeted unit costs for clinical supplies of GEN-1 that are substantially competitive with the Company s current suppliers; 

once approved, the cost structure for GEN-1 will support rapid market adoption and significant gross margins across global markets; 

Celsion will provide Hisun a certain percentage of China s commercial unit demand, and separately of global commercial unit demand, subject to regulatory approval; 

Hisun and Celsion will commence technology transfer activities relating to the manufacture of GEN-1, including all studies required by CFDA for site approval; and 

Hisun will collaborate with Celsion around the regulatory approval activities for GEN-1 with the CFDA. A local China partner affords Celsion access to accelerated CFDA review and potential regulatory exclusivity for the approved indication. 
 
 17. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS 
 
 In July 2011, the Company executed a lease (the Lease with Brandywine Operating Partnership, L.P. (Brandywine), a Delaware limited partnership for a 10,870 square foot premises located in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. In October 2011, the Company relocated its offices to Lawrenceville, New Jersey from Columbia, Maryland. The lease has a term of 66 months and provides for 6 months of rent free, with the first monthly rent payment of approximately 23,000 due and paid in April 2012. Also, as required by the Lease, the Company provided Brandywine with an irrevocable and unconditional standby letter of credit for 250,000, which the Company secured with an escrow deposit at its banking institution of this same amount. The standby letter of credit will be reduced by 50,000 on each of the 19th, 31st and 43rd months from the initial term, with the remaining 100,000 amount remaining until the Lease term has expired. In connection with three 50,000 reductions of the standby letter of credit in April 2013 and 2014 and 2015, the Company reduced the escrow deposit by 50,000 each time. In late 2015, Lenox Drive Office Park LLC, purchased the real estate and office building and assumed the lease. The Company is currently in negotiations with the landlord to extend the lease term and to reduce the square footage by approximately 30 . 

F-31

In connection with the EGEN Asset Purchase agreement in June 2014, the Company assumed the existing lease with another landlord for an 11,500 square foot premises located in Huntsville Alabama. This lease has a remaining term of 13 months with rent payments of approximately 23,200 per month. 
 
 The Company paid 575,516 and 570,078 in connection with these leases in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Following is a summary of the future minimum payments required under leases that have initial or remaining lease terms of one year or more as of December 31, 2016:

In addition, the Company sold Series AA Warrants (the Series AA Warrants) to purchase up to 16,489,402 shares of common stock and Pre-Funded Series BB Warrants (the Pre-Funded Series BB Warrants) to purchase up to 2,600,000 shares of common stock. The Series AA Warrants have an exercise price of 0.23 per share, have a five year life and are immediately exercisable. The Pre-Funded Series BB Warrants were offered at 0.22 per share, are immediately exercisable for 0.01 per share of common stock, do not have an expiration date and were issued in lieu of shares of common stock to the extent that the purchase of common stock would cause the beneficial ownership of the purchaser of such shares, together with its affiliates and certain related parties, to exceed 9.99 of our common stock. The Company received approximately 5.0 million in gross proceeds before the deduction of the placement agent fees and offering expenses (excluding any proceeds from the exercise of the warrants) in the February 14, 2017 Public Offering. 
 
 In connection with the February 14, 2017 Public Offering, the Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-215321) on December 23, 2016, as amended by Pre-Effective Amendment No. 1 filed with the Commission on January 20, 2017, as further amended by Pre-Effective Amendment No. 2 filed with the Commission on February 13, 2017, as further amended by Pre-Effective Amendment No. 3 filed with the Commission on February 13, 2017 and as further amended by Pre-Effective Amendment No. 4 filed with the Commission on February 14, 2017 for the registration of the securities issued and sold under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
