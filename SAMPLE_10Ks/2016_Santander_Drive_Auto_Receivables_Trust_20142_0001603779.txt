Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas DBTCA ), as the indenture trustee, has
provided the following information: DBTCA has been named as a defendant in civil litigation concerning its role as trustee of certain residential mortgage backed securities RMBS trusts. On June 18, 2014, a group of
investors Plaintiff Investors filed a civil action against DBTCA and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company DBNTC in New York State Supreme Court purportedly on behalf of and for the benefit of 544 private-label
RMBS trusts asserting claims for alleged violations of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on DBTCA s and DBNTC s alleged failure to perform their obligations as trustees for
the trusts (the NY Derivative Action ). An amended complaint was filed on July 16, 2014, adding Plaintiff Investors and RMBS trusts to the NY Derivative Action. On November 24, 2014, the Plaintiff Investors moved to voluntarily
dismiss the NY Derivative Action without prejudice. Also on November 24, 2014, substantially the same group of Plaintiff Investors filed a civil action against DBTCA and DBNTC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (the SDNY Action ), making substantially the same allegations as the New York Derivative Action with respect to 564 RMBS trusts (542 of which were at issue in the NY Derivative Action). The SDNY Action is styled both as a
derivative action on behalf of the named RMBS Trusts and, in the alternative, as a putative class action on behalf of holders of RMBS representing interests in those RMBS trusts. DBTCA is reviewing these newly-filed pleadings. DBTCA has no
pending legal proceedings (including, based on DBTCA s preliminary evaluation, the litigation disclosed in this paragraph) that would materially affect its ability to perform its duties as Trustee on behalf of the Certificate-holders.

Exhibit 33.1 
 Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria 

1. 
 Santander Consumer USA Inc. (the Asserting Party is responsible for Assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it under paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the Reporting Period ). The transactions covered by this report include the Asserting Party s publicly offered registered SDART transactions consisting of auto loans (the
 Platform ). See Appendix A. 

2. 
 The Asserting Party used the criteria set forth in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB (See Appendix B) to assess the compliance with the applicable servicing criteria except for the following criteria
which the Asserting Party determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Asserting Party with respect to the Platform: 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii),
and 1122(d)(4)(xiii). 

3. 
 There were no external enhancements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

4. 
 With respect to servicing criterion, Item 1122(d)(1)(iii), some of the transactions included in the FY15 Regulation AB Platform require the Company to utilize a backup servicer when certain events, which are
specified within the transaction agreements, occur. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, the events that would require a backup servicer as listed in the transaction documents did not occur, and therefore the requirement for a backup
servicer does not apply. 

5. 
 With respect to servicing criterion Item 1122(d)(2)(i), we have engaged various vendors to serve as repositories for customer payments (i.e. a lockbox bank and a third party money wire transfer provider) as
required by the servicing criterion. We have determined that none of the vendors are a servicer as defined in Item 1101 (j) of Regulation AB, and we elect to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 (formerly SEC Manual Telephone Interpretation 17.06). These
outsourced activities themselves are immaterial, we do not believe that the Asserting Party is required to provide an assessment of its compliance with those oversight procedures pursuant to Item 1122(d)(1)(ii). We have policies and
procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that each vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Asserting Party has taken responsibility for assessing compliance with
regards to C DI 200.06 with the portion of the servicing criterion performed by those vendors. We are solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria.

6. 
 The Asserting Party has complied, in all material respects, with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

7. 
 The Asserting Party has not identified and is not aware of any material instance of non-compliance by the vendors with regard to the applicable servicing criteria, or performance of certain functions with regard to the
servicing criteria, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

8. 
 The Asserting Party has not identified any material deficiency in its policies and procedures to monitor the compliance by the vendors with the applicable servicing criteria, as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2015 with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

9. 
 Deloitte Touche LLP, a registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Asserting Party s assessment of compliance with all the applicable servicing criteria as of
December 31, 2015 and for the Reporting Period. March 29, 2016

Exhibit 34.1 
 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 The Audit Committee of Santander Consumer USA Inc. Dallas, Texas
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB
Servicing Criteria, that Santander Consumer USA Inc. (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for SCUSA s publicly offered
registered SDART transactions consisting of auto loans (the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi),
1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. Appendix A to management s assertion identifies the individual asset-backed
transactions defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the
Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing
activities related to the Platform, determining whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed
transaction included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or
reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria. As described in management s assertion for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform certain
activities required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 (formerly SEC Manual Telephone
Interpretation 17.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the
servicing criteria applicable to this vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no
procedures with respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned applicable
servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects. /s/ Deloitte

Management s Assertion of Compliance indicates that there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2015 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to
perform such activities. The Company has determined the following servicing criteria to be applicable only to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform as described below: 

Servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(iii) is applicable only with respect to the Company s continuing obligation to act as, or locate a, successor servicer under the circumstances referred to in certain transaction
agreements. It is management s interpretation that the Company has no other active back-up servicing responsibilities in regards to servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(iii) as of and for the year ended

accurate aggregation of information received from servicers and the accurate conveyance of such information within reports to investors. 

Servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform only as it relates to the Company s obligation to report additions, removals or substitutions on
reports to investors in accordance with the transaction agreements. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the
servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the attestation standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included
testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected
transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this
report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this
report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria. In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria, as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2015, is fairly stated, in all material respects. /s/ KPMG LLP
