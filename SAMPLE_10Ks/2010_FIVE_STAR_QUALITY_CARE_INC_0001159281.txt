WARNING CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

 THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K CONTAINS STATEMENTS AND IMPLICATIONS WHICH CONSTITUTE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE
MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND OTHER FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. ALSO, WHENEVER WE USE WORDS SUCH AS "BELIEVE", "EXPECT", "ANTICIPATE", "INTEND", "PLAN",
"ESTIMATE" OR SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS, WE ARE MAKING FORWARD LOOKING
STATEMENTS. THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON OUR PRESENT INTENT, BELIEFS OR EXPECTATIONS, BUT FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO OCCUR AND MAY NOT OCCUR. FORWARD LOOKING
STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT RELATE TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING: 

OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES AND REHABILITATION HOSPITALS PROFITABLY, 
 OUR ABILITY TO INTEGRATE NEW ACQUISITIONS AND LEASE OR PURCHASE ADDITIONAL SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES AND REHABILITATION
HOSPITALS, 
 OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, 
 OUR ABILITY TO COMPLY AND TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND OTHER RATE SETTING AND REGULATORY
REQUIREMENTS, 
 THE FINANCIAL CAPACITY OF UBS AG, OR UBS, TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS TO US AND TO PURCHASE OUR AUCTION RATE SECURITIES, OR
ARS, 
 OUR ABILITY TO RAISE DEBT OR EQUITY CAPITAL, 
 THE FUTURE AVAILABILITY OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, 
 OUR EXPECTATION THAT WE WILL BENEFIT FINANCIALLY BY PARTICIPATING IN THE INSURANCE COMPANY WITH REIT MANAGEMENT 
RESEARCH LLC, OR RMR, AND COMPANIES TO WHICH RMR PROVIDES MANAGEMENT SERVICES, AND 
 OTHER MATTERS. 

OUR
ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN OR IMPLIED BY OUR FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS. FACTORS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT ON OUR FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND UPON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CASH FLOWS, LIQUIDITY AND PROSPECTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED
TO: 

THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS ON US AND OUR RESIDENTS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS, 

Table of Contents 

COMPETITION WITHIN THE SENIOR LIVING INDUSTRY AND OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, 
 INCREASES IN INSURANCE AND TORT LIABILITY COSTS, 
 CHANGES IN MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PAYMENTS WHICH COULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF RATES OR A FAILURE OF THESE RATES TO MATCH
OUR COST INCREASES, 
 ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WITH OUR MANAGING DIRECTORS, SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST, OR SNH, AND RMR
AND ITS RELATED ENTITIES, AND 
 CHANGES IN PERSONNEL OR THE LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, 
 COMPLIANCE WITH, AND CHANGES TO, FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR SERVICES. 

FOR
EXAMPLE: 

THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K STATES THAT THE TERMS OF OUR LEASE REALIGNMENT AGREEMENT WERE NEGOTIATED AND
APPROVED BY SPECIAL COMMITTEES OF OUR AND SNH'S BOARDS COMPOSED ONLY OF OUR DIRECTORS AND SNH TRUSTEES WHO ARE NOT ALSO DIRECTORS OR TRUSTEES OF THE OTHER COMPANY. THE IMPLICATION OF THIS STATEMENT
MAY BE THAT THIS AGREEMENT WAS NEGOTIATED ON AN ARMS LENGTH BASIS AND MAY NOT BE LEGALLY CHALLENGED BECAUSE THIS AGREEMENT PROVIDES A FAIR EXCHANGE OF CONSIDERATION BETWEEN US AND SNH. IN FACT,
(I) WE WERE FORMERLY A 100 OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF SNH AND WE BECAME A SEPARATELY OWNED PUBLIC COMPANY AS A RESULT OF A SPIN OFF TO SNH SHAREHOLDERS IN 2001; (II) RMR PROVIDES MANAGEMENT
SERVICES TO BOTH US AND SNH; (III) BOTH SNH AND CERTAIN OF OUR OFFICERS ARE ALSO OFFICERS OF RMR; (IV) RMR AND ITS OFFICERS PROVIDED INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE TO BOTH OUR AND SNH'S
SPECIAL COMMITTEES; (V) THE MEMBERS OF BOTH OUR AND SNH'S SPECIAL COMMITTEES ALSO SERVE AS DIRECTORS OR TRUSTEES OF OTHER COMPANIES MANAGED BY RMR; AND (VI) WE AND SNH HAVE EXTENSIVE AND
CONTINUING BUSINESS WITH EACH OTHER. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEASE REALIGNMENT AGREEMENT IS FAIR TO US, IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MULTIPLE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN US AND SNH, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT
LITIGATION MAY BE BROUGHT ALLEGING THAT THIS AGREEMENT IS UNFAIR TO US OR SNH. LITIGATION MAY BE EXPENSIVE AND DISTRACTING TO MANAGEMENT. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ENTRY INTO THE LEASE
REALIGNMENT AGREEMENT WILL NOT CAUSE US TO BECOME INVOLVED IN LITIGATION THAT CHALLENGES THE FAIRNESS OF THIS LEASE REALIGNMENT AGREEMENT. SUCH ALLEGATIONS OR LITIGATION COULD CAUSE OUR SHARE TRADING
PRICE TO DECLINE AND THE OUTCOME OF SUCH LITIGATION IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT, 
 IF THE AVAILABILITY OF DEBT CAPITAL BECOMES MORE RESTRICTED, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REPAY OUR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS WHEN THEY
BECOME DUE OR TO REFINANCE OR OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON TERMS WHICH ARE AS FAVORABLE AS WE NOW HAVE, 
 UBS MAY BE UNABLE TO PURCHASE OUR ARS AS A RESULT OF ITS FINANCIAL CAPACITY AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL, 
 PARTICIPATION IN AFFILIATES INSURANCE COMPANY, OR AIC, INVOLVES POTENTIAL FINANCIAL RISKS AND REWARDS TYPICAL OF ANY START
UP 

Table of Contents 

BUSINESS
VENTURE AS WELL AS OTHER FINANCIAL RISKS AND REWARDS SPECIFIC TO INSURANCE COMPANIES. AMONG THE RISKS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO INSURANCE COMPANIES IS THE RISK THAT AIC MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
ADEQUATELY PAY CLAIMS. TO THE EXTENT WE PURCHASE INSURANCE FROM AIC IN THE FUTURE AND AIC IS UNABLE TO FUND CLAIMS, WE COULD BE UNDERINSURED AND FACE INCREASED COSTS FOR CLAIMS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE
HAVE BEEN FUNDED IF INSURANCE WAS PURCHASED FROM MORE FINANCIALLY SECURE INSURERS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR EXPECTED FINANCIAL BENEFITS FROM OUR INITIAL OR FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN AIC MAY BE DELAYED OR MAY NOT
OCCUR AND AIC MAY REQUIRE A LARGER INVESTMENT THAN WE EXPECT, 

WE EXPECT TO OPERATE OUR REHABILITATION HOSPITALS AND PHARMACIES PROFITABLY. HOWEVER, WE HAVE HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED
LOSSES FROM THESE OPERATIONS AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OPERATE THESE BUSINESSES PROFITABLY, 
 OUR RESIDENTS MAY BE UNABLE TO AFFORD OUR SERVICES WHICH COULD RESULT IN DECREASED OCCUPANCY AND REVENUES AT OUR SENIOR
LIVING COMMUNITIES AND REHABILITATION HOSPITALS, AND 
 OTHER RISKS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT US, AS DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN THIS REPORT UNDER "ITEM IA. RISK FACTORS". 

THESE
RESULTS COULD OCCUR DUE TO MANY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS NATURAL DISASTERS OR CHANGES IN OUR RESIDENTS' ABILITY TO AFFORD OUR
SERVICES, CHANGES IN LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR OPERATIONS, OR CHANGES IN CAPITAL MARKETS OR THE ECONOMY GENERALLY. 

 THE
INFORMATION CONTAINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OR INCORPORATED HEREIN IDENTIFIES OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE DIFFERENCES FROM OUR FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENTS. 

 YOU
SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE UPON FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS. 

 EXCEPT
AS REQUIRED BY LAW, WE DO NOT INTEND TO UPDATE OR CHANGE ANY FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE.

Item 1. Business 

 GENERAL 

 We operate senior living communities, including independent living or congregate care communities, assisted living communities and
skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs. As of December 31, 2009, we leased or owned and operated 217 senior living communities containing 22,905 living units, including 170 primarily independent
and assisted living communities with 18,627 living units and 47 SNFs with 4,278 living units. 

 Of
our 170 primarily independent and assisted living communities, we: 

leased 143 communities containing 16,451 living units from SNH, our former parent; 
 leased four communities with 200 living units from Health Care Property Investors, or HCPI; and 
 owned 23 communities with 1,976 living units. 

Of
our 47 SNFs, we: 

leased 45 facilities from SNH with 4,007 living units; and 
 owned two facilities with 271 living units. 

In
aggregate, our 217 senior living communities included 6,315 independent living apartments, 10,352 assisted living suites and 6,238 skilled nursing units. Excluded from the preceding
data are two assisted
living communities containing 173 living units, leased from SNH, that have been classified as discontinued operations. 

 We
also own and operate five institutional pharmacies and we operate two rehabilitation hospitals with 321 beds that we lease from SNH. Our two rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient
services at the two hospitals and three satellite locations. In addition, we operate 13 outpatient clinics affiliated with these rehabilitation hospitals. 

We
were created by SNH in April 2000 to operate 54 SNFs and two assisted living communities repossessed from former SNH tenants. We were incorporated in Delaware in April 2000 and
reincorporated in Maryland on September 17, 2001. On December 31, 2001, SNH distributed substantially all of our then outstanding shares to its shareholders and we became a separate,
publicly owned company listed on the American Stock Exchange (now the NYSE Amex). 

 Our
principal executive offices are located at 400 Centre Street, Newton, Massachusetts 02458, and our telephone number is (617) 796-8387. 

TYPES OF PROPERTIES 

 Our present business plan contemplates the ownership, leasing and management of independent living apartments or congregate care
communities, assisted living communities, SNFs and rehabilitation hospitals. Some of our properties combine more than one type of service in a single building or campus. 

 Independent Living Apartments or Congregate Care Communities. Independent living apartments or congregate care communities provide high
levels of
privacy to residents and require residents to be capable of relatively high degrees of independence. An independent living apartment usually bundles several services as part of a regular monthly
charge. For example, the base charge may include one or two meals per day in a central dining room, weekly maid service or services of a social director. Additional services are generally available
from staff employees on a fee for service basis. In some 

 1 

Table of Contents 

independent
living communities, separate parts of the community are dedicated to assisted living or nursing services. As of December 31, 2009, our business included 6,315 independent living
apartments in 53 communities. 

 Assisted Living Communities. Assisted living communities are typically comprised of one bedroom units which include private bathrooms
and efficiency
kitchens. Services bundled within one charge usually include three meals per day in a central dining room, daily housekeeping, laundry, medical reminders and 24 hour availability of assistance
with the activities of daily living such as dressing and bathing. Professional nursing and healthcare services are usually available at the community as requested or at regularly scheduled times. As
of December 31, 2009, our business included 10,352 assisted living suites in 154 communities. 

Skilled Nursing Facilities. SNFs generally provide extensive nursing and healthcare services similar to those available in hospitals,
without the
high costs associated with operating theaters, emergency rooms or intensive care units. A typical purpose built SNF generally includes one or two beds per room with a separate bathroom in each room
and shared dining facilities. SNFs are staffed by licensed nursing professionals 24 hours per day. As of December 31, 2009, our business included 6,238 skilled nursing beds in 78
communities. 

 Rehabilitation Hospitals. Rehabilitation hospitals, also known as inpatient rehabilitation facilities, or IRFs, provide intensive
physical therapy,
occupational therapy and speech language pathology services beyond the capabilities customarily available in SNFs. Patients in IRFs generally receive a minimum of three hours of rehabilitation
services daily. IRFs also provide onsite pharmacy, radiology, laboratory, telemetry, hemodialysis and orthotics/prosthetics services. Outpatient satellite clinics are often included as part of the
services offered by IRFs. As of December 31, 2009, our two rehabilitation hospitals had 321 beds available for inpatient services and provided services at three satellite locations. In
addition, these two hospitals operate 13 affiliated outpatient clinics where patients discharged from hospitals can continue their therapy programs and receive amputee, brain injury,
neurorehabilitation, cardio-pulmonary, orthopedic, spinal cord injury and stroke rehabilitation services. 

Institutional Pharmacies. Institutional pharmacies provide large quantities of drugs at locations where patients with recurring pharmacy
requirements
are concentrated. Our institutional pharmacies included in continuing operations are located in six leased commercial spaces and one owned commercial space containing a total of approximately 71,659
square feet plus parking areas for our employees and delivery vehicles. 

 OUR HISTORY 

Senior living acquisitions and initiation of long term leases 

 We
have grown our business through acquisitions and through initiation of long term leases of independent and assisted living communities where residents'
private resources account for a large majority of revenues. 

 In
2009, we commenced operations at 11 senior living communities with a total of 952 living units that we leased from SNH. Ten of these communities are assisted living communities and
one community is a continuing care retirement community which offers independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing services. 

Institutional Pharmacies 

 In
December 2007, we decided to sell one institutional pharmacy located in California and our mail order pharmacy located in Nebraska. We sold the
institutional pharmacy located in California in two separate transactions in 2009, which resulted in a gain on sale of 1.2 million. We were unable to 

 2 

Table of Contents 

sell
the mail order pharmacy on acceptable terms and we ceased its operations on March 31, 2009. Accordingly, the operating results of these two businesses are now included in discontinued
operations. 

 Rehabilitation Hospitals 

 In
October 2006, we began to operate two rehabilitation hospitals located in Braintree and Woburn, Massachusetts that provide extensive inpatient and
outpatient health rehabilitation services. These hospitals are leased from SNH through June 30, 2026. 

Discontinued Operations 

 During
2007, we agreed with SNH that it should sell two assisted living communities located in Pennsylvania, which we lease from SNH. We and SNH are in the
process of selling these assisted living communities and, upon their sale, our annual rent payable to SNH will decrease by approximately 9.0 of the net proceeds of the sale. 

 As
discussed above, during 2009, we sold one institutional pharmacy located in California and closed our mail order pharmacy located in Nebraska. 

 During
2009, with our approval, SNH sold two SNFs, which we leased from SNH. On October 1, 2009, SNH sold a SNF located in Iowa to an unaffiliated party for approximately 473,000
and our rent payable to SNH decreased by approximately 47,300. On November 1, 2009, SNH sold a SNF located in Missouri to an unaffiliated party for net proceeds of approximately
 1.2 million and our rent payable to SNH decreased by approximately 124,700. 

 Equity and Debt Financings 

 In
2006, we issued 126.5 million principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, or the Notes. The Notes bear interest at 3.75 per annum,
payable semi-annually, and will mature on October 15, 2026. We may prepay the Notes at anytime after October 20, 2011 and the Note holders may require that we purchase all or
a portion of these Notes on each of October 15, 2013, 2016 and 2021. During 2009, we purchased and retired 76.8 million par value of our Notes for 39.9 million plus accrued
interest. As a result of these purchases we recorded a 34.6 million gain, net of related unamortized costs, on early extinguishment of debt, and 49.7 million in principal amount of the
Notes remain outstanding. 

 OUR GROWTH STRATEGY 

 We believe that the aging of the United States population will increase demand for independent living properties, assisted living
communities, SNFs, institutional pharmacies and rehabilitation services. Our principal growth strategy is to profit from this increasing demand by operating properties that provide high quality
services to seniors. 

 We
seek to improve the profitability of our existing operations by increasing revenues and improving margins. We attempt to increase revenues by increasing rates and utilization of our
facilities and services. We attempt to improve margins by limiting increases in expenses and improving operating efficiencies. 

 In
addition to managing our existing operations, we intend to continue to grow our business through acquisitions, primarily through initiation of long term leases, of independent and
assisted living communities where residents' private resources account for a large majority of revenues. 

Since
we became a public company in late 2001, we have acquired or leased, and continue to own or lease and operate, 169 primarily independent and assisted living communities that as of
December 31, 2009 generated approximately 85.8 of their revenue from residents' private resources, 

 3 

Table of Contents 

rather
than from Medicare or Medicaid. We prefer to acquire communities which have achieved or are close to achieving stabilized operations, although we occasionally purchase turn-around
facilities where we believe we can make significant improvements in operations. We also seek to make acquisitions where we can realize cost efficiencies by adding communities to existing regional
operations. 

 Although
expansion of our free-standing SNF business is not our primary growth strategy, we consider the inclusion of skilled nursing operations in continuing care retirement
communities to be a worthwhile growth opportunity. 

 OPERATING STRUCTURE 

 We have three divisional offices. Each divisional office is responsible for multiple regions and is headed by a divisional vice
president with extensive experience in the senior living industry. We have several regional offices within each division. Each regional office is responsible for multiple communities and is headed by
a regional director of operations with extensive experience in the senior living industry. Each regional office is typically supported by a clinical or wellness director, a rehabilitation services
director, a regional accounts manager, a human resources specialist and a sales and marketing specialist. Regional staffs are responsible for all our senior living community operations within the
region, including: 

resident services; 
 Medicare and Medicaid billing; 
 marketing and sales; 
 hiring of community personnel; 
 compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements; and 
 supporting our development and acquisition plans within their region. 

In
addition, a fourth divisional vice president with extensive experience in the institutional pharmacy and rehabilitation industries oversees our institutional pharmacies and IRF
businesses from our corporate office. 

 Our
corporate office staff, located in Massachusetts, provides the following services: 

the establishment of company wide policies and procedures relating to resident care; 
 human resources policies and procedures; 
 information technology; 
 private pay billing for our independent living apartments and assisted living communities; 
 maintenance of licensing and certification; 
 legal services; 
 central purchasing; 
 budgeting and supervision of maintenance and capital expenditures; 
 implementation of our growth strategy; and 
 accounting and finance functions, including operations, budgeting, certain accounts receivable and collections functions,
accounts payable, payroll and financial reporting. 

As
described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have a business management and shared services agreement, or the business management agreement, with RMR pursuant
to which RMR 

 4 

Table of Contents 

provides
to us certain management, administrative and information system services including internal audit, investor relations and tax services. 

 STAFFING 

 Independent and Assisted Living Community Staffing. Each of the independent and assisted living communities we operate has an executive
director
responsible for the day to day operations of the community, including quality of care, resident services, sales and marketing, financial performance and staff supervision. The executive director is
supported by department heads, who oversee the care and service of the residents, a wellness director, who is responsible for coordinating the services necessary to meet the health care needs of our
residents and a marketing director, who is responsible for selling our services. Other important staff includes the dining services coordinator, the activities coordinator and the property maintenance
coordinator. 

 Skilled Nursing Facility Staffing. Each of our SNFs is managed by a state licensed administrator who is
supported by other professional personnel, including a director of nursing, an activities director, a marketing director, a social services director, a business office manager, and physical,
occupational and speech therapists. Our directors of nursing are state licensed nurses who supervise our registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and nursing assistants. Staff size and composition
vary depending on the size and occupancy of each SNF and on the type of care provided by the SNF. Our SNFs also contract with physicians who provide certain medical services. 

 Rehabilitation Hospital Staffing. Each of our IRFs is operated under the leadership of a hospital based chief executive officer with
the support of
senior staff, including a medical director, chief financial officer, director of patient care services, director of rehabilitation and director of case management. The hospitals are also staffed with
board certified physicians who primarily specialize in internal medicine, neurology or physiatry, as well as other licensed professionals, including rehabilitation nurses, physical therapists,
occupational therapists, speech and language pathologists, nutrition counselors, neuropsycologists and pharmacists. Each outpatient clinic associated with our IRFs is managed by an outpatient director
who is a registered occupational or physical therapist. 

 Institutional Pharmacy Staffing. Our institutional pharmacies provide prescriptions, medical supplies, equipment and services only to
operators and
residents of senior living communities. Each of our institutional pharmacies is managed by an executive director, who is responsible for the day to day operations of each institutional pharmacy,
including billings, sales and marketing, financial performance, compliance with regulatory codes regarding the dispensing of controlled substances and staff supervision. Other institutional pharmacy
personnel include licensed dispensing pharmacists, a director of pharmacy consultation, a medical records director, a nurse consultant, pharmacy technicians and billing personnel. 

 EMPLOYEES 

 As of February 19, 2010, we had approximately 22,000 employees, including 14,212 full time equivalents.
Approximately 85 employees, including approximately 68 full time equivalents, are represented under one collective bargaining agreement, which has a remaining term of approximately three
years. We have no employment agreements with our employees except for one contract entered into with a former owner operator of an institutional pharmacy which we acquired. We believe our relations
with our union and non-union employees are good.

 GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND REIMBURSEMENT 

 Our operations must comply with numerous federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Also, the healthcare industry depends
significantly upon federal and state programs for revenues and, as a result, is vulnerable to the budgetary policies of both the federal and state governments. 

 Independent Living Communities. Government benefits generally are not available for services at independent living communities and the
resident
charges in these communities are paid from private resources. However, a number of Federal Supplemental Security Income program benefits pay housing costs for elderly or disabled residents to live in
these types of residential communities. The Social Security Act requires states to certify that they will establish and enforce standards for any category of group living arrangement in which a
significant number of Supplemental Security Income residents reside or are likely to reside. Categories of living arrangements which may be subject to these state standards include independent living
communities and assisted living communities. Because independent living communities usually offer common dining facilities, in many locations they are required to obtain licenses applicable to food
service establishments in addition to complying with land use and life safety requirements. In many states, independent living communities are licensed by state or county health departments, social
service agencies or offices on aging with jurisdiction over group residential communities for seniors. To the extent that independent living communities include units in which assisted living or
nursing services are provided, these units are subject to applicable state licensing regulations, and if the communities receive Medicaid or Medicare funds, to certification standards. In some states,
insurance or consumer protection agencies regulate independent living communities in which residents pay entrance fees or prepay for services. 

 Assisted Living Communities. According to the National Center for Assisted Living, a majority of states provide or are approved to
provide Medicaid
payments for personal care and medical services to some residents in licensed assisted living communities under waivers granted by the Federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, or
under Medicaid state plans. Most other states are planning some Medicaid funding by preparing state plan amendments or requesting waivers. State Medicaid programs control costs for assisted living and
other home and community-based services by various means such as restrictive financial and functional eligibility standards, enrollment limits and waiting lists. Because rates paid to assisted living
community operators are generally lower than rates paid to nursing home operators, some states use Medicaid funding of assisted living as a means of
lowering the cost of services for residents who may not need the higher intensity of health related services provided in SNFs. States that administer Medicaid programs for services in assisted living
communities are responsible for monitoring the services at, and physical conditions of, the participating communities. Different states apply different standards in these matters, but generally we
believe these monitoring processes are similar to the concerned states' inspection processes for SNFs. 

As
a result of the large number of states using Medicaid to purchase services at assisted living communities and the growth of assisted living in recent years, a majority of states have
adopted licensing standards applicable to assisted living communities. A majority of states have licensing statutes or standards specifically using the term "assisted living" and have requirements for
communities servicing people with Alzheimer's disease or dementia. The majority of states have revised their licensing regulations recently or are reviewing their policies or revising their
regulations. State regulatory models vary; there is no national consensus on a definition of assisted living, and no uniform approach by the states to regulating assisted living communities. Most
state licensing standards apply to assisted living communities whether or not they accept Medicaid funding. Also, a few states require certificates of need from state health planning authorities
before new assisted living communities may be developed. Based on our analysis of current economic and regulatory trends, we believe that assisted living communities that become dependent upon
Medicaid or other public payments for a majority of their revenues may decline in value because Medicaid and other public rates may fail to keep up with increasing costs. We also believe that assisted
living communities located in states that adopt certificate 

 6 

Table of Contents 

of
need requirements or otherwise restrict the development of new assisted living communities may increase in value because these limitations upon development may help ensure higher occupancy and
higher non-governmental rates. 

 The
United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, and the Senate Special Committee on Aging have studied and reported on the
development of assisted living and its role in the continuum of long term care and as an alternative to SNFs. In 2003, the GAO recommended that CMS strengthen its oversight of state quality assurance
in Medicaid home and community-based services waiver programs. Since then, CMS has commenced a series of actions to increase its oversight of state quality assurance programs for assisted living
facilities and has provided guidance and technical assistance to the states to improve their ability to monitor and improve the quality of services paid for through Medicaid waiver programs. Based
upon our analysis of current economic and regulatory trends, we do not believe that the federal government is likely to have a material impact upon the current regulatory environment in which the
assisted living industry operates unless it also undertakes expanded funding obligations. Although CMS is encouraging state Medicaid programs to expand their use of home and community based services
as alternatives to institutional services, pursuant to provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, or DRA, and other authorities, we do not believe a materially increased financial commitment
from the federal government to fund assisted living is presently likely. However, we do anticipate that assisted living communities will increasingly be licensed and regulated by the various states,
and that, in the absence of federal standards, the states' policies will continue to vary widely. 

 Skilled Nursing Facilities Reimbursement. About 62 of all SNF revenues in the United States in 2008 (the most recent date for
which
information is publicly available) came from publicly funded programs, including about 41 from Medicaid programs, 19 from the Medicare program and 2 from other public programs. SNFs are among the
most highly regulated businesses in the country. The federal and state governments regularly monitor the quality of care provided at SNFs. State health departments conduct surveys of resident care and
inspect the physical condition of nursing home properties. These periodic inspections and occasional changes in life safety and physical plant requirements sometimes require nursing home operators to
make significant capital improvements. These mandated capital improvements have in the past usually resulted in Medicare and Medicaid rate adjustments, albeit on the basis of amortization of
expenditures over expected useful lives of the improvements. Under the Medicare prospective payment system, or the PPS, capital costs are part of the prospective rate and are not community specific.
The PPS and other recent legislative and regulatory actions with respect to state Medicaid rates are limiting the reimbursement levels for some nursing home services. At the same time, federal and
state enforcement and oversight of SNFs have been increasing, making licensing and certification of these communities more rigorous. 

The
PPS was intended to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare payments for SNFs. Under the current Medicare payment system, SNFs receive a fixed payment for each day of care provided to
residents who are Medicare beneficiaries. Each resident is assigned to a care group depending on that resident's medical characteristics and service needs. These care groups are known as Resource
Utilization Groups, or RUGs. Per diem payment rates are established for each of these care groups. Medicare payments cover substantially all services provided to Medicare residents in SNFs, including
ancillary services such as rehabilitation therapies. The PPS is intended to provide incentives to providers to furnish only necessary services and to deliver those services efficiently. 

 7 

Table of Contents 

 From November 1999 to January 2006, Congress and CMS provided some periodic relief from the financial effect of the PPS, through temporary increases in SNF
payment rates and temporary moratoria on some therapy limitations for skilled nursing residents covered under Medicare Part B. Effective January 1, 2006, CMS implemented changes to the
payment categories it uses to set daily payment rates for Medicare beneficiaries in SNFs. CMS introduced nine new payment categories for medically complex patients, increasing the number of categories
from 44 to 53, and made revisions to its payment rates for current RUGs. These RUG changes caused the elimination of certain temporary additional payments for certain skilled nursing care and
rehabilitation groups. The financial impact of these changes to the Medicare rates on our operations was to effectively eliminate an October 2005 Medicare 3 rate increase; but then in each of the
next three years, the Medicare rates were increased by approximately 3 , under a rule adding an annual update to account for inflation in the costs of goods and services included in a SNF stay.
Effective as of October 1, 2009, CMS has adopted rules recalibrating the Medicare prospective payment categories for SNFs for federal fiscal year 2010. CMS estimates that the recalibration will
result in a decrease of approximately 3.3 in projected SNF payments, offset by an increase of approximately 2.2 to account for inflation, and that as a result, aggregate Medicare payments to SNFs
will be reduced by approximately 1.1 in federal fiscal year 2010. 

 Under
the DRA, the federal government is slowing the growth of Medicare and Medicaid payments for nursing home services by several methods. Medicare bad debt reimbursement has been
reduced from 100 to 70 for uncollected cost sharing payments from Medicare beneficiaries who are not eligible for Medicaid. Limits on Medicare payments were also implemented for outpatient therapies
in 2006, with an exception process under which beneficiaries could request an exception from the cap and be granted the amount of services deemed medically necessary by Medicare. The Medicare
outpatient
therapy exception process has been extended under subsequent laws through December 31, 2009. This expiration of the Medicare outpatient therapy cap exception process may result in a reduction
in our outpatient therapy revenues in 2010. Proposals to reinstate and extend the exception process have been introduced in Congress, but we cannot predict whether the exception process will be
extended after December 31, 2009. 

 In
addition, the DRA increased the "look-back" period for prohibited asset transfers that disqualify individuals from Medicaid nursing home benefits from three to five years.
The period of Medicaid ineligibility begins on the date of the prohibited transfer or the date an individual has entered the nursing home and would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid coverage,
whichever occurs later, rather than on the date of the prohibited transfer, effectively extending the Medicaid penalty period and placing added burdens on SNFs to collect charges directly from
residents and their transferees. The DRA includes a five year demonstration project that in 2007 awarded competitive grants to 30 states to provide home and community based long term care services to
qualified individuals relocated from SNFs, providing an increased federal medical assistance percentage for 12 months for each qualifying beneficiary, during a grant period of at least two
years. The DRA also includes a post acute payment reform demonstration program that will compare and assess costs and outcomes of services at different long term care sites over three years. Since
January 1, 2007, states may include home and community based services as optional services under their Medicaid state plans, rather than only pursuant to waivers or demonstration projects, and
such states may cap enrollment, maintain waiting lists and offer the services in only some regions of a state, as they may with waivers. 

Skilled Nursing Facilities Survey and Enforcement. More than twenty years ago, Congress enacted major reforms to federal and state
regulatory systems for SNFs that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, under the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987. Since then, the GAO reports that, while much progress has been made,
substantial problems remain in the effectiveness of federal and state regulatory activities. Since 1999, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General has issued
several reports concerning quality of care in SNFs and the GAO has 

 8 

Table of Contents 

issued
several reports, most recently in 2009, recommending that CMS and the states strengthen their compliance and enforcement practices, including federal oversight of state actions, to better
ensure that SNFs provide adequate care and states act more consistently. The Senate Special Committee on Aging and other congressional committees have also held hearings on these issues. As a result,
CMS has undertaken an initiative to increase the effectiveness of Medicare and Medicaid nursing home survey and enforcement activities. CMS is taking steps to focus more survey and enforcement efforts
on SNFs with findings of substandard care or repeat violations of Medicare and Medicaid standards and to identify chain operated communities with patterns of noncompliance. CMS is increasing its
oversight of state survey agencies and requiring state agencies to use enforcement sanctions and remedies more promptly when substandard care or repeat violations are identified, to investigate
complaints more promptly, and to survey communities more consistently. In addition, CMS adopted regulations expanding federal and state authority to impose civil monetary penalties in instances of
noncompliance. A small number of SNFs with a history of serious quality problems, designated by CMS as "special focus facilities," or SFFs, are inspected more frequently and subject to more stringent
enforcement
actions. Homes in the SFF initiative for six months or longer are now listed on the Medicare website at www.medicare.gov . The GAO has recommended
several steps to make enforcement by CMS and the states more timely and effective, especially for SFFs. Medicare survey results, including fire safety reports and average nursing and nursing assistant
staff hours per resident for each nursing home are posted on the Medicare website at www.medicare.gov . CMS has recently added a five-star
quality rating system to the information concerning SNFs that it provides to consumers on its website. Ratings are from one to five stars, based on three factors that are separately rated health
inspections from the last three years, the average number of hours of daily care provided to each resident by nursing staff, including nursing assistants, and selected physical and clinical measures
related to quality of care. CMS issued a rule in August 2008 that requires older SNFs to install sprinkler systems within five years, by August 13, 2013. SNFs that do not have sprinklers or
hard-wired smoke detectors are required to install battery powered smoke detectors in the interim. Currently all of our SNFs except five have sprinklers and we believe the five nursing
homes without sprinklers are in compliance with the current requirements because they have a combination of hard wired and battery operated smoke detectors or hard wired smoke detector and a horn
strobe system. When deficiencies under state licensing and Medicare and Medicaid standards are identified, sanctions and remedies such as denials of payment for new Medicare and Medicaid admissions,
civil monetary penalties, state oversight, temporary management and loss of Medicare and Medicaid participation or licensure may be imposed on nursing home operators. Our communities incur sanctions
and penalties from time to time. If we are unable to cure deficiencies which have been identified or that are identified in the future, or if appeals of proposed sanctions or penalties are not
successful, additional sanctions or penalties may be imposed, and if imposed, may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and negatively affect our financial condition and
results of operations. 

 In
2000 and 2002, the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS issued reports linking nursing staffing levels with quality of care. CMS has indicated that it does not intend to
impose minimum staffing levels or to increase Medicare or Medicaid rates to cover the costs of increased staffing; however, CMS publishes the nurse and nursing assistant staffing level at each nursing
home on the internet at www.medicare.gov to create market pressure to improve nursing home operations. 

Rehabilitation Hospital Regulation and Rate Setting. Our two rehabilitation hospitals are subject to federal, state and local regulation
that affects
their business activities and determines the rates they receive for services. These IRFs are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and non-governmental agencies to ensure
continued compliance with various licensure and accreditation standards. In addition, these facilities are certified by CMS to participate in the Medicare program and receive a significant portion of
their revenues from that program.

Table of Contents 

 On
May 7, 2004, CMS issued a rule, known as the "75 Rule," establishing revised Medicare standards that IRFs are required to meet in order to participate as IRFs in the Medicare
program. An IRF that
failed to meet the requirements of the 75 Rule would be subject to reclassification as a different type of healthcare provider and the effect of such reclassification would be to lower Medicare
payment rates. The rule is now known as the "60 Rule." Under the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007, adopted in December 2007, for cost reporting periods starting on or after
July 1, 2007, the 75 requirement for IRFs was reduced to 60 , and selected secondary medical conditions are included to qualify patients under the 60 requirement. The 60 Rule now generally
provides that, to be considered an IRF and receive reimbursement for services under the IRF prospective payment system, at least 60 of a facility's total inpatient population must require intensive
rehabilitation services associated with treatment of at least one of 13 designated medical conditions. Under the 60 Rule, to maintain their revenue levels many rehabilitation hospitals have needed to
reduce the number of non-qualifying patients treated and replace them with qualifying patients, establish other sources of revenues or both. Before the 2007 amendment, the rule was being
phased in over a four year period that began on July 1, 2004. For cost reporting periods starting on and after July 1, 2006, 60 of a facility's inpatient population must have required
intensive rehabilitation services for one of CMS' designated medical conditions. For cost reporting periods starting on and after July 1, 2007, the requirement was 65 , and for cost reporting
periods starting on and after July 1, 2008, the requirement was 75 . As a result of the rollback amendment, the requirement is now 60 for these and future cost reporting periods. We believe
our hospitals have been and are operating in compliance with this rule and we are taking actions to assure continued compliance; however, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to continue
to comply with this rule, or that CMS will not make a determination that we were non-compliant in a prior year. Also pursuant to the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007, the
annual inflation increase factor for Medicare payment rates for IRFs was set at zero percent for each of federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009, except for certain payments occurring before
April 1, 2008. Our Medicare inflation increase factor for federal fiscal year 2008 had been set at approximately 3.5 effective October 1, 2007, and our rates were reduced by 3.2 
effective as of April 1, 2008. Effective October 1, 2008 CMS adopted a rule updating the Medicare IRF prospective rate formulas. The rule recalculated the weights assigned to the 13
patient case mix groups that are used to calculate rates under the IRF prospective payment system and reset the outlier threshold to maintain estimated outlier payments at 3 of total estimated IRF
payments for fiscal year 2009. CMS estimated that the changes contained in the rule would result in a decrease of 0.7 to total Medicare payments to IRFs for federal fiscal year 2009. Although the
effects of the rate freeze and the recalibration were counterbalanced by the reduction of the prior law's 65 and 75 minimum percentage requirements to 60 under current law, the net effect of these
changes adversely affected the profitability of our rehabilitation operations. Effective as of October 1, 2009, CMS has adopted rules that it estimates will increase aggregate Medicare payments
to IRFs by approximately 2.5 in federal fiscal year 2010. CMS has set the outlier payments at 3 of total estimated IRF payments for the year. CMS has also adopted rules revising and clarifying the
coverage criteria for Medicare patients in IRFs, effective as of January 1, 2010. These regulations include criteria for patient selection, treatment planning, coordination of care, and
professional training and experience. 

 Certificates of Need. Most states limit the number of SNFs and hospitals by requiring developers to obtain certificates of need before
new
communities may be built and a few states also limit the number of assisted living facilities by requiring certificates of need. Also, states such as California and Texas that have eliminated
certificate of need laws often have retained other means of limiting new development, such as the use of moratoria, licensing laws or limitations upon participation in the state Medicaid program. We
believe that these governmental limitations may make existing SNFs and hospitals more valuable by limiting competition. 

Other Matters. Federal and state efforts to target false claims, fraud and abuse and violations of anti-kickback, physician referral and
privacy laws by Medicare and Medicaid providers and providers 

 10 

Table of Contents 

under
other public and private programs have increased in recent years, as have civil monetary penalties, repayment requirements and criminal sanctions for noncompliance. In 2000, the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, or OIG, issued compliance guidelines for SNFs to assist them in developing voluntary compliance programs to prevent fraud and abuse with
supplemental guidance in 2008. The OIG issued compliance program guidance for hospitals in 1998 and supplemental guidance in 2005. CMS contractors are expanding the retroactive audits of Medicare
claims submitted by IRFs, SNFs and other providers, and recouping alleged overpayments for services determined by auditors not to have been medically necessary or not to meet Medicare coverage
criteria as billed. State Medicaid programs and other third party payors are conducting similar medical necessity and compliance audits. 

 Under
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, rules governing the privacy, use and disclosure of individually identified health information took effect
in 2003, and compliance with security rules for electronic personal health information was required by April 20, 2005 with civil monetary penalties and criminal sanctions for noncompliance.
Compliance with expanded HIPAA privacy and security requirements recently enacted by Congress, and implementing regulations, was required on various dates between February 2009 and February 2010, and
compliance with updated standards for electronic healthcare transactions and pharmacy transactions will be required on January 1, 2012. 

 Any
adverse determination concerning any of our licenses or eligibility for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or any substantial penalties, repayments or sanctions, and the increasing
costs of required compliance with applicable federal and state laws, may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of
operations. 

 Under
the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, effective January 1, 2006, Medicare beneficiaries may receive prescription drug benefits by
enrolling in private health plans or managed care organizations, or if they remain in traditional Medicare, by enrolling in stand alone prescription drug plans. As a result of the implementation of
this Medicare Part D drug program in 2006, the government's share of prescription drug expenditures has risen substantially from 28 in 2005 to 37 in 2008 (the most recent date for which this
information is publicly available). Of the government funds spent for prescription drugs, Medicare's share was 7 in 2005 and 60 in 2008, while Medicaid's share was 68 in 2005 and 23 in 2008. As of
January 2008, approximately 90 of Medicare beneficiaries had Medicare Part D drug coverage, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. Due to Medicare's growing share of
total prescription drug expenditures and increasing budget pressures on state and federal governments, we believe that government actions to control drug costs are likely to increase, reducing the
profitability of providing pharmacy products and services. 

 The
U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate have each recently passed comprehensive, but different, national healthcare reform bills that would, if adopted, dramatically change the
country's healthcare system. We are unable to predict whether healthcare reform legislation will be adopted after negotiations between the House and Senate, the form of the legislation if adopted, or
if adopted, the impact it will have on our business or financial condition. The pending bills include healthcare insurance reforms, payment systems reforms, and healthcare delivery systems reforms,
with the goals of expanding access to health insurance coverage and simultaneously reducing the growth of healthcare expenditures. Included in the bills or under consideration by Congress are mandates
that most individuals purchase health insurance, tax credits to assist those with low incomes to acquire health insurance, expansion of Medicaid eligibility to more people, mandates that most
employers pay part of the cost of health insurance for their employees, statewide insurance exchanges to expand access to health insurance, reducing or freezing Medicare and Medicaid provider payment
rates including rates of SNFs and IRFs, and various pilot projects intended to reduce or slow the growth of healthcare costs. The pending legislation includes a pilot program under which acute care
hospitals and post acute care 

 11 

Table of Contents 

providers
such as SNFs, IRFs and rehabilitation clinics would receive a single bundled Medicare payment for acute hospital and post-acute care provided to a patient. The pending
legislation also includes provisions for individuals to purchase government sponsored long term care insurance, which would entitle participating individuals after five or more years to receive
insurance benefits for long term care services such as SNF or home health care services if needed. 

 Other
legislative proposals that have been introduced in Congress, proposed by federal or state agencies or are being considered by some state governments, include the option of block
grants for states rather than federal matching money for certain state Medicaid services, additional policies encouraging state Medicaid programs to use home and community based long term care
services rather than SNFs, laws authorizing or directing Medicare to negotiate rate reductions for prescription drugs, additional Medicare and Medicaid enforcement procedures and federal and state
cost containment measures, such as freezing Medicare or Medicaid nursing home and rehabilitation hospital payment rates at their current levels and reducing or eliminating annual Medicare or Medicaid
inflation allowances or gradually reducing rates for SNFs and rehabilitation hospitals. 

 The
recent recession and current difficult economic conditions are causing budget shortfalls in most states, increasing the likelihood of Medicaid rate reductions, freezes or increases
that are insufficient to offset increasing operating costs. Pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, adopted February 17, 2009, federal payments to states for Medicaid
programs have been temporarily increased retroactively from October 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010, with greater increases for states with more unemployment. Payments to states for
Medicaid expenditures on hospitals, SNFs and other specified providers are conditioned on states paying those providers promptly. However, most states project continuing fiscal deficits. The magnitude
of the potential Medicare and Medicaid rate reductions and the impact of the failure of these programs to increase rates to match increasing expenses, as well as the impact on us of potential
healthcare reform laws and Medicare and Medicaid policy changes proposed by members of Congress cannot currently be estimated, but they may be material to our operations and may adversely affect our
future results of operations. 

 INSURANCE 

 Litigation against senior living and healthcare companies has increased during the past few years. As a result, liability insurance
costs have risen. Also, our insurance costs for workers compensation and employee healthcare have increased. To partially offset these insurance cost increases, we have taken a number of actions
including the following: 

we have become fully self insured for all health related claims of covered employees; 
 we have increased the deductible or retention amounts for which we are liable under our liability insurance; 
 we have established offshore captive insurance companies which participate in our liability and worker compensation
insurance programs. These programs may allow us to reduce our net insurance costs by allowing us to retain the earnings on our reserves, provided that our claims experience is as projected by various
statutory and actuarial formulas; 
 we have increased the amounts which some of our employees are required to pay for health insurance coverage and as
co-payments for health services and pharmaceutical prescriptions and decreased the amount of certain healthcare benefits. In October 2008, we added a high deductible health insurance plan
as an option for our employees; 
 we have hired professional advisors to help us establish programs to reduce our insured workers compensation and
professional and general liabilities, including a program to monitor and proactively settle liability claims and to reduce workplace injuries; 
 
 12 

Table of Contents 

we have hired insurance and other professionals to help us establish appropriate reserves for our retained liabilities and
captive insurance programs; and 
 in order to obtain more control over our insurance costs, we and other companies to which RMR provides management services
have recently organized a new insurance company which will soon begin to underwrite certain of our insurance requirements. 

We
partially self insure up to certain limits for workers compensation and professional liability. Claims in excess of these limits are insured with third party insurance providers up to
contractual limits, over which we are self insured. Our current insurance arrangements are generally renewable in June 2010. We do not know if our insurance charges and self insurance reserve
requirements will increase, and we cannot now predict the amount of any such increase, or to what extent, if at all, we may be able to offset any increase through use of higher deductibles, retention
amounts, self insurance or other means in the future. For more information about our new insurance initiative see Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations Related Person Transactions" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

 COMPETITION 

 The senior living services, pharmacy and the rehabilitation hospital businesses are highly competitive. We compete with service
providers offering alternate types of services, such as home healthcare services, as well as other companies providing facility based services and rehabilitation services. We have large lease
obligations and limited financeable assets. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do. We may expand our business with SNH and our relationships with SNH and RMR may provide
us with competitive advantages; however, SNH is not obligated to provide us with opportunities to lease additional properties. Some of our competitors are operated by not for profit entities which
have endowment income and may not have the same financial pressures that we experience. For all of these reasons and others, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete
successfully for business. 

 ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE CHANGE MATTERS 

 Under various laws, owners as well as tenants and operators of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up or remove
hazardous substances present at or migrating from properties they own, lease or operate and may be held liable for property damage or personal injuries that result from hazardous substances. These
laws also expose us to the possibility that we may become liable to reimburse governments for damages and costs they incur in connection with hazardous substances. Under our leases with SNH, we have
also agreed to indemnify SNH for any such liabilities related to the properties we lease from SNH. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on a contaminated site in favor of the government
for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination, which lien may be senior in priority to our debt obligations or our leases. We have reviewed environmental surveys of all of our
leased and owned communities. Based upon that review we do not believe that there are environmental conditions at any of our properties that have had or will have a material adverse effect on us.
However, no assurances can be given that conditions are not present at our properties or that costs we may be required to incur in the future to remediate contamination will not have a material
adverse effect on our business or financial condition. 

 The
current political debates about world climate changes has resulted in various existing and proposed treaties, laws and regulations which are intended to limit carbon emissions. We
believe treaties, laws and regulations which may limit carbon emissions may cause energy costs at our communities to increase. In the longer term, we believe any such increased costs will be passed
through and paid by our patients, residents and other customers in higher charges for our services. However, in the short term, these increased costs, if material in amount, could materially and
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

 Our business faces many risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know
of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs, our
business, financial condition or results of operations would suffer and the trading price of our securities could decline. Investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks and
the information contained under the heading "Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements" before deciding whether to invest in our securities. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 

 A small percentage decline in our revenues or increase in our expenses could have a material negative impact upon our operating results. 

 For the year ended December 31, 2009, our revenues were 1.19 billion and our operating expenses were
 1.18 billion. A small percentage decline in our revenues or increase in our expenses could have a material negative impact upon our operating results. 

 Circumstances that adversely affect the ability of seniors, or their families, to pay for our services could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Our residents paid approximately 69 of our senior living revenues during the year ended December 31, 2009 from their private
resources. We expect to continue to rely on the ability of our residents to pay for our services from their own financial resources. Inflation, a devalued stock market, rising unemployment, or other
circumstances that adversely affect the ability of the elderly or their families to pay for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. 

Seniors' inability to sell real estate may delay their moving into senior living facilities. 

 Recent and continuing housing price declines and reduced home mortgage availability have negatively affected the United States housing
market. Many economists now predict a prolonged period with little improvement in housing markets. These current difficulties may have a negative effect on our 

 14 

Table of Contents 

revenues
or lead to increased reliance on Medicare and Medicaid for our revenues. Specifically, if seniors have a difficult time selling their homes, fewer seniors may be able to relocate to our
senior living communities or finance their stays at our facilities with private resources. 

 The failure of Medicare and Medicaid rates to match our costs will reduce our income. 

 Some of our current operations, especially our SNFs, IRFs and pharmacy operations receive significant revenues from the Medicare and
Medicaid programs. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received approximately 31 of our senior living revenues, 64 of our hospital revenues and 47 of our pharmacy revenues from these
programs. CMS and some members of Congress have proposed Medicare and Medicaid policy changes and rate reductions to be phased in during the next several years. Health care reform bills recently
passed by each branch of Congress include provisions that would reduce or eliminate annual Medicare rate increases to account for inflation affecting SNFs and IRFs. Effective as of October 1,
2009, CMS reduced Medicare aggregate payment rates for SNFs by an estimated 1.1 for federal fiscal year 2010, as the result of a recalibration of prospective payment categories that reduced rates by
approximately 3.3 , offset by an annual increase to account for inflation of approximately 2.2 . On December 31, 2009, the process to allow medically necessary exceptions to annual caps on
Medicare Part B payments for outpatient rehabilitation services to individual patients expired, and the exceptions process has not been extended by Congress beyond that date. Proposals to
extend the exceptions process for therapy caps are included in healthcare reform bills being considered by Congress, but we cannot predict whether the exception process will be extended. Also, our
Medicare Part B outpatient therapy revenue rates are tied to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule that is scheduled to be reduced by 21 on March 1, 2010, unless Congress extends the
moratorium on the scheduled reduction. Failure to extend the moratorium would result in a similar reduction of approximately 21 to our Medicare Part B rates for outpatient therapy services in
clinics and SNFs. In addition, some of the states in which we operate either have not raised Medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs, have frozen or reduced Medicaid rates, or
are expected to freeze or reduce Medicaid rates. The current recession is causing budget shortfalls in most states, increasing the likelihood of Medicaid rate reductions, freezes or increases that are
insufficient to offset increasing operating costs. The magnitude of the potential Medicare and Medicaid rate reductions, the impact of the failure of these programs to increase rates to match
increasing expenses and the impact on us of potential Medicare and Medicaid policy changes proposed by members of Congress, cannot currently be estimated, but they may be material to our operations
and
may affect our future results of operations. We cannot now predict whether future Medicare and Medicaid rates will be sufficient to cover our future cost increases. Future Medicare and Medicaid rate
declines or a failure of these rates to cover increasing costs could result in our experiencing materially lower earnings or losses. 

 Our rehabilitation hospitals may be subject to Medicare reclassifications resulting in lower Medicare rates, or to retroactive repayments. 

 A significant amount of the revenues at our rehabilitation hospitals is paid by the Medicare program. For cost reporting periods
starting on and after July 1, 2006, 60 of an IRF's total inpatient population must require intensive rehabilitation services associated with treatment of at least one of 13 designated medical
conditions. While we believe we are in compliance with the 60 requirement, and we expect to remain in compliance with this rule, we may not be able to remain in compliance, or CMS could determine
that we were non-compliant in a prior year. Such an event would result in these hospitals being subject to Medicare reclassification to a different type of provider and our receiving lower
Medicare payment rates retroactively or prospectively. Reductions in our Medicare payments as a result of the reclassification of our rehabilitation hospitals would materially and adversely affect our
financial conditions and results of operations. Also, retroactive audits of Medicare claims submitted by IRFs and other providers are expanding, and CMS is recouping amounts paid for services
determined 

 15 

Table of Contents 

by
auditors not to have been medically necessary or not to meet Medicare criteria for coverage as billed. If our hospitals or clinics were required to make substantial retroactive repayments to
Medicare, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

 Private third party payors continue to try to reduce health care costs. 

 Private third party payors are continuing their efforts to control health care costs through direct contracts with health care
providers, increased utilization review practices and greater enrollment in managed care programs and preferred provider organizations. These third party payors increasingly are demanding discounted
fee structures and the assumption by health care providers of all or a portion of the financial risk. We could be adversely affected by these continuing efforts of third party payors to limit the
amount of payments we receive for health care services. Reimbursement payments under third party payor programs may not remain at levels comparable to present levels or be sufficient to cover the
costs allocable to patients participating in such programs. Future changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of third party payors, or the implementation of other measures to reduce payments for
our services could result in a substantial reduction in our net operating revenues. At the same time, as a result of competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price
increases to private pay patients may be limited. 

 Healthcare reform legislation could reduce our income and increase our costs. 

 The U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S Senate have each recently passed comprehensive, but different, national healthcare reform
bills that would, if adopted, dramatically change the country's healthcare system. The pending bills include healthcare insurance reforms, payment systems reforms, and healthcare delivery systems
reforms, with the goals of expanding access to health insurance coverage and reducing the growth of healthcare expenditures. Included in the bills or under consideration by Congress are mandates that
most individuals purchase health insurance, tax credits to assist those with low incomes to acquire health insurance, expansion of Medicaid eligibility to more people with low incomes, mandates that
most employers pay part of the cost of health insurance for their employees, statewide or national insurance exchanges to expand access to health insurance, reductions or freezes on Medicare and
Medicaid provider payment rates or rate increases affecting SNFs and IRFs, and various pilot projects intended to reduce or slow the growth of healthcare costs. The pending legislation includes a
pilot program under which a single bundled Medicare payment for acute hospital and post-acute hospital care provided to a patient would be made, to cover the services provided by the acute
care hospital and the post acute care providers, such as a SNF, IRF, or rehabilitation clinic, that cared for the patient after hospitalization. Health insurance generally does not provide significant
coverage for long-term care services, including SNF services. However, the pending legislation includes provisions for individuals to purchase government sponsored long term care
insurance, which would entitle participating individuals after five or more years to receive insurance benefits for long term care services such as SNF or home health care services if needed. We are
unable to predict whether healthcare reform legislation will be adopted, the form of the legislation if it is adopted, or the impact it will have on our business or financial condition. If the
legislation results in reduced reimbursement for our services, or the failure of Medicare, Medicaid or private payment rates to cover our increasing costs, our net operating revenue could be
materially and adversely affected. 

 Increases in our labor costs may have a material adverse effect on us. 

 Wages and employee benefits for the Company as a whole represented approximately 53 of our 2009 total operating costs. We compete with
other operators of senior living communities and rehabilitation hospitals with respect to attracting and retaining qualified personnel responsible for the day to day operations of each of our
communities. The market for qualified nurses, therapists and other healthcare professionals is highly competitive. Periodic and geographic area shortages of nurses or other trained personnel may
require us to increase the wages and benefits offered to our employees 

 16 

Table of Contents 

in
order to attract and retain these personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel. Also, we may have to compete for lesser skilled workers with numerous other employers. Further, when we
acquire new facilities, we may be required to pay increased compensation or offer other incentives to
retain key personnel and other employees. Employee benefits costs, including employee health insurance and workers compensation insurance costs, have materially increased in recent years. Although we
have determined our self insurance reserves with guidance from third party professionals, our reserves may be inadequate. Increasing employee health and workers compensation insurance costs and
increasing self insurance reserves for labor related insurance may materially negatively affect our earnings. No assurance can be given that our labor costs will not increase or that any increase will
be matched by corresponding increases in rates we charge to residents. Any significant failure by us to control our labor costs or to pass on any increased labor costs to residents through rate
increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

 Successful union organization of our employees may adversely affect our business performance and results of operations. 

 From time to time labor unions attempt to organize our employees. Certain of our employees have already chosen union representation. If
federal legislation modifies the labor laws to make it much easier for employee groups to unionize, then additional groups of employees may seek union representation. If more of our employees unionize
it could result in business interruptions, work stoppages, the degradation of service levels at our senior living communities and rehabilitation hospitals due to work rules, or increased operating
expenses that may adversely affect our financial results of operations. 

 Our business is subject to extensive regulation which increases our costs and may result in losses. 

 Licensing and Medicare and Medicaid laws require operators of senior living communities, rehabilitation hospitals, clinics, and
pharmacies to comply with extensive standards governing operations. There are also various federal and state laws prohibiting fraud and abuse by senior living and rehabilitation hospital and clinic
operators and pharmacy providers, including civil and criminal laws that prohibit false claims for Medicare and Medicaid coverage and that regulate patient referrals. In recent years, federal and
state governments have devoted increased resources to monitor the quality of care at senior living communities and to anti-fraud investigations. CMS contractors are expanding the
retroactive audits of Medicare claims submitted by IRFs, SNFs and other providers, and recouping alleged overpayments for services determined by auditors not to have been medically necessary or not to
meet Medicare coverage criteria as billed. State Medicaid programs and other third party payors are conducting similar medical necessity and compliance audits. When quality of care deficiencies are
identified or improper billing is uncovered, various remedies or sanctions may be imposed, including denial of new admissions, exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid program participation, monetary
penalties, restitution of overpayments, governmental oversight, temporary management, loss of licensure and criminal penalties. Our communities incur sanctions and penalties from time to time. As a
result of this extensive regulatory system and increasing enforcement initiatives, we have experienced increased costs for monitoring quality of care compliance and billing procedures, and we expect
these costs may continue to increase. Also, if we become subject to additional regulatory sanctions or repayment obligations at any of our existing facilities, or as a result of purchasing facilities
with prior deficiencies which we are unable to correct or resolve, our business may be adversely affected and we might experience financial losses. 

The nature of our business exposes us to litigation risks. 

 The nature of our business exposes us to litigation, and we are subject to lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business. In several
well publicized instances, private litigation by residents of senior living communities for alleged abuses has resulted in large damage awards against other operating 

 17 

Table of Contents 

companies.
Today, some lawyers and law firms specialize in bringing litigation against senior living companies. As a result of this litigation and potential litigation, our cost of liability insurance
has increased during the past few years. Medical liability insurance reform has become a topic of political debate and some states have enacted legislation to limit future liability awards. However,
such reforms have not been generally adopted and we expect our insurance costs may continue to increase. Although our reserves for liability self insurance have been determined with guidance from
third party professionals, our reserves may prove inadequate. Increasing liability insurance costs and increasing self insurance reserves may materially negatively affect our results of operations,
cause us to experience losses or make our financial results less consistent than they would otherwise be. 

 Our growth strategy may not succeed. 

 Since our spin off from SNH on December 31, 2001, we have grown through acquisitions and the initiation of long term leases. Our
business plan includes taking advantage of an increasing demand for senior living facilities and acquiring additional senior living communities. Our growth strategy involves risks, including the
following: 

we may be unable to locate senior living communities that receive a large percentage of their revenues from private
resources; 
 we may be unable to locate senior living communities available for purchase at acceptable prices; 
 we may be unable to access capital to make acquisitions or operate acquired businesses; 
 acquired operations may not perform in accord with our expectations; 
 we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to improve acquired facilities, including capital expenditures
that may not have been anticipated by us at the time of the acquisition; 
 we may have difficulty retaining key employees and other personnel at acquired facilities; 
 acquired operations may subject us to unanticipated contingent liabilities or regulatory problems; 
 to the extent we incur acquisition debt or leases, our operating leverage and resulting risks of debt defaults may
increase; and, to the extent we issue additional equity to fund our acquisitions, our shareholders' percentage of ownership will be diluted; and 
 combining our present operations with newly acquired operations may disrupt operations or cost more than anticipated. 

For
these reasons and others: 

our business plan to grow may not succeed; 
 the benefits which we hope to achieve by growing may not be achieved; 
 we may suffer declines in profitability or suffer recurring losses; and 
 our existing operations may suffer from a lack of management attention or financial resources if such attention and
resources are devoted to a failed growth strategy. 

When
we acquire or take on new communities, we sometimes see a decline in community occupancy and it may take a period of time for us to stabilize acquired community operations. Our
efforts to restore occupancy or stabilize acquired communities' operations may not be successful. In addition, rehabilitation hospitals and pharmacies are businesses with which we have limited
experience, and our initiatives in these areas may not be successful. 

 18 

Table of Contents 

We continue to seek acquisitions and other strategic opportunities that may require a significant amount of management resources and costs. 

 We continue to seek acquisitions and other strategic opportunities. Accordingly, we are often engaged in evaluating potential
transactions and other strategic alternatives. In addition, from time to time, we engage in preliminary discussions that may result in one or more transactions. Although there is uncertainty that any
of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transaction, we may devote a significant amount of our management resources to such transactions, which could
negatively impact our existing and continuing operations. In addition, we may incur significant costs in connection with seeking acquisitions regardless of whether these acquisitions are completed. 

 Failure to comply with laws governing the privacy and security of personal information, including information relating to health, could materially
and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

 We are required to comply with federal and state laws governing the privacy, security, use and disclosure of individually identifiable
information, including information relating to health. Under HIPAA, we are required to comply with the HIPAA privacy rule, security standards, and standards for electronic health care transactions.
State laws also govern the privacy of individual health information, and state privacy rights rules may be more stringent than HIPAA. Other federal and state laws govern the privacy of other personal
information. If we fail to comply with applicable federal or state standards, we could be subject to civil sanctions and criminal penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations. 

 Termination of assisted living resident agreements and resident attrition could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. 

 State regulations governing assisted living facilities typically require a written resident agreement with each resident. Most of these
regulations also require that each resident have the right to terminate our assisted living resident agreement for any reason on reasonable notice. Consistent with these regulations, most resident
agreements allow residents to terminate their agreements on 30 days' notice. Thus, we cannot contract with assisted living residents to stay for longer periods of time, unlike typical apartment
leasing arrangements that involve lease agreements with terms of up to a year or longer. If a large number of residents elected to terminate their resident agreements at or around the same time, our
revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the advanced ages of our senior living residents mean that the resident turnover rate in our senior living communities is
difficult to predict. 

 Our business requires us to make significant capital expenditures to maintain and improve our facilities. 

 Our communities sometimes require significant expenditures to address ongoing required maintenance and to make them attractive to
residents. Physical characteristics of senior living communities and rehabilitation hospitals are mandated by various governmental authorities; changes in these regulations may require us to make
significant expenditures. In addition, we often are required to make significant capital expenditures when we acquire new facilities. Our available financial resources may be insufficient to fund
these expenditures. In addition to capital expenditures we are making at some of our senior living communities, we expect to make certain capital expenditures at the rehabilitation hospitals. SNH has
historically provided most of the capital we need to improve the properties we lease from them; however, whenever SNH provides such capital, our rent increases and we may be unable to pay the
increased rent without experiencing losses. 

 19 

Table of Contents 

 Our business is highly competitive and we may be unable to operate profitably. 

 We compete with numerous other companies that provide senior living, rehabilitation hospital and pharmacy services, including home
healthcare companies and other real estate based service providers. Although some states require certificates of need to develop new SNFs there are fewer barriers to competition for home healthcare or
for independent and assisted living services. Many of our existing competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than us. Some of our competitors are not for profit entities which have
endowment income and may not have the same financial pressures that we face. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to attract a sufficient number of residents to our communities or
that we will be able to attract employees and keep wages and other employee benefits, insurance costs and other operating expenses at levels which will allow us to compete successfully or to operate
profitably. 

 We are subject to possible conflicts of interest; we have engaged in, and expect to continue to engage in, transactions with parties who may be
considered related parties. 

Our business is subject to possible conflicts of interest as follows: 

as of December 31, 2009, we leased from SNH 188 of our 217 senior living communities, our two rehabilitation
hospitals and two senior living communities classified as discontinued operations for total annual rent of approximately 184.4 million plus percentage rent based on increases in gross revenues
at certain properties; 
 we purchase various management services from RMR, the manager of SNH, and we lease office space from an affiliate of RMR; 
 our Chief Executive Officer, Bruce J. Mackey Jr., and our Chief Financial Officer, Paul V. Hoagland, are
also employees of RMR, our managing directors, Barry M. Portnoy and Gerard M. Martin, are directors of RMR, Mr. Portnoy is a managing trustee of SNH and is also the majority
beneficial owner and the chairman of RMR; 
 under our business management agreement with RMR, in the event of a conflict between SNH and us, RMR may act on behalf of
SNH rather than on our behalf; and 
 RMR's simultaneous contractual obligations to us and SNH create actual and potential conflicts of interest, and these
conflicts can be especially severe in periods of financial stress. 

On
December 31, 2001, SNH distributed substantially all of its ownership of our shares to its shareholders. Simultaneously with the spin off, we entered into agreements with SNH
and RMR which, among other things, limit (subject to certain exceptions) ownership of more than 9.8 of our voting shares, restrict our ability to take any action that could jeopardize the tax status
of SNH as a real
estate investment trust and limit our ability to acquire real estate of types which are owned by SNH or other businesses managed by RMR. As a result of these agreements, our leases with SNH and our
business management agreement with RMR, SNH, RMR and their respective affiliates have significant roles in our business and we do not anticipate any changes to those roles in the future. In addition,
as of December 31, 2009, SNH owned 3,235,000 shares of our common stock or approximately 9.1 of our outstanding shares. 

 We
believe our affiliations with SNH and RMR have been and will be beneficial to us. Although we do not believe the potential conflicts have adversely affected, or will adversely affect,
our business, not everyone may agree with our position. In the past, in particular following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company's securities, shareholder
litigation, dissident director nominations and dissident proposals have often been instituted against companies alleging conflicts of interest in business dealings with directors, affiliated persons
and entities. Our relationships with SNH, RMR, with Messrs. Portnoy and Martin and with RMR affiliates may precipitate such activities. These activities, if instituted against us, could result
in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources. 

 20 

Table of Contents 

Our leases of certain of our senior living communities are subordinated to mortgage debt of SNH, and a default by SNH could result in the termination
of those leases. 

 Our leases with SNH for 56 of our senior living communities, which had 2009 revenues totaling 313.9 million, are subordinated
to mortgage financing secured by such communities. As a result, in the event SNH were to default on such mortgage financing, by reason of our default under our leases or for reasons unrelated to us or
beyond our control, and its lender were to foreclose on such properties, our leases would terminate as a matter of law. While we may be able to enter into new leases with the lenders or the purchaser
or purchasers of such properties, or they may elect to continue our occupancy under the terms of the lease as if there had been no foreclosure, such parties are not obligated to elect either option;
and, if we are able to retain possession, the terms of our continued occupancy may not be as favorable to us as those contained in our leases with SNH. If we do not enter into new leases of such
communities following a foreclosure, we would lose the right to continue to operate these facilities and may incur material obligations to residents, employees and other parties as a result of such
loss, each of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. 

 Disputes with SNH and RMR and shareholder litigation against us or our directors and officers may be referred to arbitration proceedings. 

 Our contracts with SNH and RMR provide that any dispute arising under those contracts may be referred to binding arbitration
proceedings. Similarly our bylaws provide that actions by our shareholders against us or against our directors and officers may be referred to binding arbitration proceedings. As a result, our and our
shareholders would not be able to pursue litigation for these disputes in courts against SNH, RMR or our directors and officers if the disputes were referred to arbitration. In addition, the ability
to collect attorney's fees or other damages may be limited in the arbitration proceedings, which may discourage attorneys from agreeing to represent parties wishing to commence such a proceeding. 

 Climate change legislation and resulting increased energy costs at our communities could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations. 

 The current political debates about world climate changes has resulted in various existing and proposed treaties, laws and regulations
which are intended to limit carbon emissions. We believe treaties, laws and regulations which may limit carbon emissions may cause energy costs at our communities to increase. In the longer term, we
believe any such increased costs will be passed through and paid by our patients, residents and other customers in higher charges for our services. However, in the short term, these increased costs,
if material in amount, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

 RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE 

 Ownership limitations and anti-takeover provisions in our charter, bylaws and certain material agreements, as well as certain provisions
of Maryland law, may prevent our shareholders from receiving a takeover premium or implementing beneficial changes. 

 Our charter generally prohibits any shareholder from owning more than 9.8 (in number of shares or value, whichever is more
restrictive) of any class or series of our outstanding shares. This provision inhibits acquisitions of a significant stake in us and may prevent a change in our control. Additionally, many provisions
contained in our charter and bylaws under Maryland law may further deter persons from attempting to acquire control of us and implement
changes that may be beneficial to shareholders, including, for example, provisions relating to: 

the division of our directors into three classes, with the term of one class expiring each year and in each case, when
successors are elected and qualify, which could delay a change in our control; 
 
 21 

Table of Contents 

the power of our Board of Directors, without a shareholders' vote, to authorize and issue additional shares and create
classes of shares on terms that it determines; 
 required qualifications for an individual to serve as a director and a requirement that certain of our directors be
"Independent Directors" and other directors be "Managing Directors" as defined in our bylaws; 
 limitations on the ability of shareholders to propose nominees for election as directors and propose other business for a
meeting of shareholders; 
 the prohibition of direct or indirect transfers of any class of equity securities, or any warrants, rights or options to
purchase any of our securities, if that transfer would result in a person, entity or group becoming a "5-percent shareholder" of our common stock pursuant to our bylaws and based on
Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-2T(g); 
 the authority of our Board of Directors, and not our shareholders, to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws; and 
 the authority of our Board of Directors to amend to our charter without shareholder approval to increase or decrease the
number of shares of stock or the number of shares of any class or series that we have authority to issue. 

The
terms of our leases with SNH and our business management agreement with RMR provide that our rights under these agreements may be cancelled by SNH and RMR, respectively, upon the
acquisition by any person or group of more than 9.8 of our voting stock, and upon other change in control events, as defined in those documents including, in certain of the SNH leases, the adoption
of any proposal (other than a precatory proposal) or the election to our Board of Directors of any individual if such proposal or individual was not approved, nominated or appointed, as the case may
be, by vote of a majority of our directors in office immediately prior to the making of such proposal or the nomination or appointment of such individual. If the breach of these ownership limitations
causes a lease default, shareholders causing the default may become liable to us or to other shareholders for damages. Additionally, we maintain a rights agreement whereby, in the event a person or
group of persons acquires 10 or more of our outstanding common shares, our shareholders, other than such person or group, will be entitled to purchase additional shares or other securities or our
property at a discount. In addition, a termination of our business management agreement is a default under our credit facility unless approved by our lender. Also, certain provisions of Maryland law
may have an anti-takeover effect. For all of these reasons, our shareholders may be unable to realize a change of control premium for securities they own. 

 Our rights and the rights of our shareholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited. 

 Our charter limits the liability of our directors and officers to us and our shareholders for money damages to the maximum extent
permitted under Maryland law. Under current Maryland law, our directors and officers will not have any liability to us and our shareholders for money damages other than liability resulting
from: 

actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or 
 active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was established by a final judgment as being material to
the cause of action adjudicated. 

Our
charter authorizes us to indemnify our directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. However, except with
respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, we will indemnify any person referenced in the previous sentence in connection with a proceeding initiated by such person against our
company only if such proceeding is authorized by our Board of Directors. In addition, we may be obligated to pay or 

 22 

Table of Contents 

 reimburse
the expenses incurred by our present and former directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification. As a result, we and our
shareholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent the provisions in our charter or that might exist with other companies, which could limit
your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interest. 

 RISKS RELATED TO OUR NOTES AND COMMON SHARES 

 Any notes we may issue will be effectively subordinated to the debts of our subsidiaries and to our secured debt. 

 We conduct substantially all of our business through subsidiaries. Consequently, our ability to pay debt service on our outstanding
Notes and any notes we issue in the future will be dependent upon the cash flow of our subsidiaries and payments by those subsidiaries to us as dividends or otherwise. Our subsidiaries are separate
legal entities and have their own liabilities. Certain of our subsidiaries guarantee our obligations under our Notes and those subsidiaries and additional subsidiaries guarantee our obligations under
our revolving credit facility. In addition, as of December 31, 2009, our subsidiaries which have not guaranteed our Notes had approximately 12.4 million of secured indebtedness
outstanding, and we may add additional secured indebtedness that would effectively rank senior to our outstanding Notes. Our Notes are unsecured and, as such, effectively subordinated to our secured
debt. In addition, non-guarantor subsidiaries have substantial additional obligations, including trade payables and lease obligations, to which our Notes are and will be effectively
subordinated. 

 Our
right to receive assets of any of our subsidiaries upon its liquidation or reorganization will be structurally subordinated to the claims of our subsidiaries' creditors, except to
the extent that we are recognized as a creditor of such subsidiary, in which case our claims would still be subordinated to any security interests in the assets of such subsidiaries and any
indebtedness of our subsidiaries that is senior to that held by us. In the event of our insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization,
dissolution or winding up, we and the subsidiaries that guarantee our outstanding Notes, or any new notes we may issue, may not have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on any or all such notes. 

 We may be required to prepay our debts upon a change of control. 

 In certain change of control circumstances, our current and future noteholders and some of our other lenders may have the right to
require us to purchase our Notes which they own or repay our debt owing to them at their principal amount plus accrued interest and a premium. 

Our Notes may permit redemption before maturity, and our noteholders may be unable to reinvest proceeds at the same or a higher rate. 

 The terms of our outstanding Notes permit us, and the terms of future notes may permit us, to redeem all or a portion of our notes
after a certain amount of time, or up to a certain percentage of the notes prior to certain dates. Generally, the redemption price will equal the principal amount being redeemed, plus accrued interest
to the redemption date, plus any applicable premium. If a redemption occurs, our noteholders may be unable to reinvest the money they receive in the redemption at a rate that is equal to or higher
than the rate of return on the applicable notes. 

 There may be no public market for notes we may issue and one may not develop. 

 Although our outstanding Notes are traded in the Private Offerings, Resale and Trading through Automated Linkages Market of the Nasdaq,
these Notes are not listed on any securities exchange. In addition, any notes we may issue will be a new issue for which no trading market currently exists. We may not list our notes on any securities
exchange or seek approval for price quotations to be made available through any automated quotation system. There is no assurance that an active trading market for any of our notes will exist in the
future. Even if a market develops, the liquidity of the trading

market
for any of our notes and the market price quoted for any such notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for fixed income securities, by changes in our financial
performance or prospects, or by changes in the prospects for the senior living industry generally. Also, we have
purchased and retired 76.8 million face amount of our outstanding notes. These purchases reduced the number and amount of our notes outstanding and may decrease the liquidity of our notes. 

 Increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations. 

 Our total consolidated long term debt as of December 31, 2009 was approximately 62.0 million and represented
approximately 31 of our total book capitalization as of that date. In addition to our indebtedness, we have substantial lease and other obligations. The indenture governing our outstanding Notes does
not limit the amount of additional indebtedness, including senior or secured indebtedness, which we can create, incur, assume or guarantee, nor does the indenture limit the amount of indebtedness or
other liabilities that our subsidiaries can create, incur, assume or guarantee. 

 Our
level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our investors, because: 

it could affect our ability to satisfy our debt obligations; 
 the portion of our cash flows from operations required to make interest and principal payments will not be available for
operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes; 
 it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future; 
 it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and 
 it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general than a company with
less debt leverage. 

We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future. 

 We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common shares, and we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in
the foreseeable future. Because we do not anticipate paying cash dividends, holders who convert our outstanding Notes into our common shares will not realize a return on their investment unless the
trading price of our common shares appreciates. 

 The price of our common shares has fluctuated, and a number of factors may cause our common share price to decline. 

 The market price of our common shares has fluctuated and could fluctuate significantly in the future in response to various factors and
events, including, but not limited to, the risks set out in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as: 

the liquidity of the market for our common shares; 
 changes in our operating results; 
 changes in analysts' expectations; and 
 general economic and industry trends and conditions. 

In
addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.
These market fluctuations may also cause the market price of our common shares to decline. Shareholders may be unable to resell our common shares at or above the price at which they purchased our
shares.

OUR INPATIENT REHABILITATION HOSPITALS 

 As of December 31, 2009, we operated two inpatient rehabilitation hospitals that we lease from SNH. These two inpatient
rehabilitation hospitals are located in Braintree and Woburn, Massachusetts and have 321 beds dedicated to inpatient services at the two hospital locations and at three satellite locations. In
addition, we operate 13 outpatient clinics affiliated with these hospitals. For the year ended December 31, 2009 combined revenues were 100.5 million and approximately 61 of the
revenues at these hospitals came from the Medicare program, 3 came from
the Medicaid program and the 36 balance came from health insurance companies or other sources. Average occupancy at these inpatient facilities for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 60.3 .

No. 1 is comprised of four separate leases. Three of these four leases exist to accommodate mortgage financings in effect at the time SNH
acquired the properties; we have agreed to combine all four of these leases into one lease as and when these mortgage financings are paid. Excluded from the number of properties are two assisted
living communities, we leased from SNH, that we classify as discontinued operations. 

27 

Table of Contents 

(2) Lease
No. 3 exists to accommodate the mortgage financing that SNH has with the Federal National Mortgage Association, or FNMA, as further described
in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Our leases with SNH and Related Person Transactions" of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. 

Percentage Rent. Our leases with SNH require us to pay percentage rent at 183 of the 190 senior living communities we lease from SNH
(including the
two assisted living communities we lease from SNH which have been classified as discontinued operations) equal to 4 of the amount by which gross revenues, as defined in our leases, of each property
exceeds gross revenues in a specific base year. We paid total percentage rent of 3.4 million in 2009. Different base years apply to those communities that pay percentage rent. The base year is
usually the first full calendar year after each community is leased. We do not pay percentage rent for our rehabilitation hospitals. 

 Operating Costs. Each lease is a so-called "triple-net" lease which requires us to pay all costs incurred in the operation of
the properties, including the costs of maintenance, personnel, services to residents, insurance and real estate and personal property taxes. 

Rent During Renewal Term. For all but seven of the properties we lease from SNH, rent during each applicable renewal term is the same as
the minimum
rent and percentage rent payable during the initial term. For the remaining seven properties, rent during the second renewal term is based on the fair market rental value of such properties. 

 Licenses. Our leases require us to obtain, maintain and comply with all applicable permits and licenses necessary to operate the leased
properties. 

Maintenance and Alterations. We are required to operate continuously and maintain, at our expense, the leased properties in good order
and repair,
including structural and nonstructural components. We may request SNH to fund amounts needed for repairs and renovations in return for rent adjustments to provide SNH a return on its investment
according to formulas. At the end of each lease term, we are required to surrender the leased properties in substantially the same condition as existed on the commencement date of the lease, subject
to any permitted alterations and ordinary wear and tear. 

 Assignment and Subletting. SNH's consent is generally required for any direct or indirect assignment or sublease of any of the
properties. Also, in
the event of any assignment or subletting, we remain liable under the applicable lease. 

 Indemnification and Insurance. With limited exceptions, we are required to indemnify SNH from all liabilities which may arise from the
ownership or
operation of the leased properties. We generally are required to maintain commercially reasonable insurance, including captive self insurance, for: 

"all-risk" property insurance, in an amount equal to 100 of the full replacement cost of the properties; 
 business interruption insurance; 
 comprehensive general liability insurance, including bodily injury and property damage, in amounts as are generally
maintained by companies providing senior living services; 
 flood insurance, if any property is located in whole or in part in a flood plain; 
 workers compensation insurance, if required by law; and 
 such additional insurance as may be generally maintained by companies providing senior living services, including
professional and general liability insurance. 

Each
lease requires that SNH be named as an additional insured under these insurance policies. 

 28 

Table of Contents 

 Damage, Destruction, Condemnation and Environmental Matters. If any of the leased properties is damaged by fire or other casualty or
taken for a
public use, we are generally obligated to rebuild it unless the community cannot be restored. If the property cannot be restored, SNH will generally receive all insurance or taking proceeds and we are
liable to SNH for the amount of any deductible or deficiency between the replacement cost and the insurance proceeds, and our rent will be adjusted pro rata. We are also required to remove and dispose
of any hazardous substance at the leased properties in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. 

 Events of Default. Events of default under each lease generally include the following: 

our failure to pay rent or any money due under the lease when it is due, which failure continues for five business days; 
 our failure to maintain the insurance required under such lease; 
 any person or group acquiring ownership of 9.8 or more of our outstanding voting stock or any change in our control, the
adoption of any shareholder proposal (other than a precatory proposal) or the election to our board of directors of any individual if such proposal or individual was not approved, nominated or
appointed, as the case may be, by vote of a majority of our directors in office immediately prior to the making of such proposal or the nomination or appointment of such individual; 
 the occurrence of certain events with respect to our insolvency or dissolution; 
 our default under indebtedness which gives the holder the right to accelerate; 
 our being declared ineligible to receive reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid programs for any of the leased
properties which participate in such programs or the revocation of any material license required for our operations; and 
 our failure to perform any terms, covenants or agreements of such lease and the continuance thereof for a specified period
of time after written notice. 

Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any event of default, each lease provides that, among other things, SNH may, to the extent legally
permitted: 

accelerate the rents; 
 terminate the leases in whole or in part; 
 enter the property and take possession of any and all our personal property and retain or sell the same at a public or
private sale; 
 make any payment or perform any act required to be performed by us under the leases; and 
 rent the property and recover from us the difference between the amount of rent which would have been due under the lease
and the rent received from the re-letting. 

We
are obligated to reimburse SNH for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with any exercise of the foregoing remedies. 

 Management. We may not enter into any new management agreement affecting any leased property without the prior written consent of SNH.

Lease Subordination. Our leases may be subordinated to any mortgages on properties leased from SNH. As of December 31, 2009, SNH
had mortgages
on 56 of our communities to which our leases were subordinated. These 56 communities had 7,023 living units and 2009 revenues totaling 313.9 million. SNH's outstanding borrowing secured by
mortgages on these 56 communities totaled 605.1 million as of December 31, 2009.

 Financing Limitations; Security. Our leases subject to mortgage financings of SNH require SNH's consent before we incur debt secured by
our
investments in our tenant subsidiaries that lease or operate the properties subject to these leases. Further, our leases subject to mortgage financings prohibit our tenant subsidiaries from incurring
liabilities, other than operating liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business, secured by our accounts receivable or purchase money debt. We may pledge interests in our leases only if the
pledge is approved by SNH. In addition, in connection with our leases subject to mortgage financings with SNH, certain of our subsidiaries pledged to the lenders under such mortgage financings certain
tangible and intangible personal property, such as accounts receivable and contract rights, located at, or arising from the operations of, the properties subject to such leases to secure their
obligations under such leases and certain of their obligations relating to such mortgage financings. 

Non-Economic Circumstances. If we determine that continued operations of one or more properties is not economical, we may negotiate with
SNH to close or sell that community, including SNH's ownership in the property. In the event of such a sale, SNH receives the net proceeds and our rent for the remaining properties in the affected
lease is reduced according to formulas contained in the applicable lease. 

 Our Relationship with SNH. SNH is our largest landlord. We were a 100 owned subsidiary of SNH before December 31, 2001. On
December 31, 2001, SNH distributed substantially all of our then outstanding shares to its shareholders. Both we and SNH receive management services from RMR. SNH owns 3,235,000, or 9.1 , of
our outstanding common shares. For more information about our dealings with SNH, and about the risks which may arise as a result of these related person transactions, please see Item 7

The
closing price of our common shares on the NYSE Amex on February 18, 2010 was 3.00 per share. 

 As
of February 19, 2010, there were approximately 2,800 shareholders of record, and we estimate that as of such date there were in excess of 30,400 beneficial owners of our common
shares. 

 We
have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common shares. At present, we intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the operations and growth of our business.
Our future decisions concerning the payment of dividends on our common shares will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition and capital expenditure plans, as well as other factors as
our board of directors, in its discretion, may consider relevant., and the extent to which the payment of dividends may be limited by agreements we have entered.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 GENERAL INDUSTRY TRENDS 

 The senior living industry generally is experiencing growth as a result of demographic factors. According to census data, the
population in the United States over age 75 is growing much faster than the general population. A large number of independent and assisted living communities were built in the 1990s. This development
activity caused an excess supply of new, high priced communities. Longer than projected fill up periods resulted in low occupancy, price discounting and financial distress for many independent and
assisted living operators. Development activity was significantly reduced in the early part of the last decade. We believe that the nationwide supply and demand for these types of facilities is about
balanced today. We believe that the aging of the United States population and the almost complete reliance of independent and assisted living services upon revenues from residents' private resources
should mean that these types of facilities can be profitably operated. 

 The
increasing availability of assisted living facilities in the 1990s caused occupancy at many SNFs to decline. This fact, together with restrictions on development of new SNFs by most
states, has generally caused nursing care to be delivered in older facilities. We believe that many SNFs currently in operation are becoming physically obsolete and that political pressures from an
aging population will eventually cause governmental authorities to permit increased new construction. 

 Beginning
in 2007, problems in certain domestic credit markets presaged a global credit crisis that led to recession in the United States and abroad. The recession resulted in aggressive
government 

 32 

Table of Contents 

spending
in the United States, significant corporate layoffs, reduced availability of credit on reasonable terms in most markets, and lower real estate prices. This economic weakness has dampened
demand for some types of senior living communities in certain markets and our occupancy rates have modestly declined. Also, we have experienced some pricing pressures from competition. At the same
time, we believe our business to be inherently healthy and that the anticipated decline in senior housing construction soon may have an offsetting effect to any decline in demand. 

 Rehabilitation
hospitals provide intensive medical services, including physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech language services beyond the capability customarily available in
SNFs. We believe that our experience in providing high quality rehabilitation services at our IRFs has assisted us to provide increasing amounts of rehabilitation services at our senior living
communities. 

 Institutional
pharmacies provide large quantities of drugs at locations where patients with recurring pharmacy requirements are concentrated. The business rationale for an institutional
pharmacy is to deliver drugs and pharmacy services more efficiently and at lower costs than from expensive retail
locations which cater to short term requirements. The aging of the population and recent pharmacological innovations have created rapidly growing demand for pharmacy drugs and services. The Medicare
Part D prescription drug benefit was implemented in 2006 pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, and by December 2008, approximately 90 of
Medicare beneficiaries had enrolled in Medicare Part D, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In 2008, (the most recent date for which information is publicly
available) the government share of all prescription drug expenditures in the United States rose to approximately 37 , including approximately 22 from the Medicare program, 8 from Medicaid programs
and 7 from other public sources. Because the MMA has increased Medicare expenditures for prescription drugs, we anticipate that the federal government and Congress will seek to implement various cost
control measures and as a result, the profitability of providing pharmacy goods and services may be reduced. 

 We
earn our senior living revenue primarily by providing housing and services to our senior living residents. During 2009, approximately 31 of our senior living revenues came from the
Medicare and Medicaid programs and approximately 69 of our senior living revenues came from residents' private resources. We bill all private pay residents in advance for the housing and services to
be provided in the following month. 

 Our
material expenses are: 

Wages and benefits includes wages for our employees working at our senior living communities and wage related
expenses such as health insurance, workers compensation insurance and other benefits. 
 Other operating expenses includes utilities, housekeeping, dietary, maintenance, marketing, insurance and
community level administrative costs at our senior living communities. 
 Rent expense we lease 188 senior living communities (excluding two senior living communities classified as
discontinued operations) and two rehabilitation hospitals from SNH and four senior living communities from HCPI. 
 Hospital expenses includes wages and benefits for our hospital based staff and other operating expenses
related to our hospital business. 
 Institutional pharmacy expenses includes the cost of drugs dispensed to our patients as well as wages and
benefits for our pharmacies' staff and other operating expenses related to our pharmacy business. 
 General and administrative expenses principally wage related costs for headquarters and regional staff
supporting our communities, hospitals and pharmacies. 
 
 33 

Table of Contents 

Depreciation and amortization expense we incur depreciation expense on buildings and furniture and equipment
that we own, and we incur amortization expense on certain identifiable intangible assets related to our pharmacy acquisitions. 
 Interest and other expenses primarily includes interest on outstanding debt and amortization of deferred
financing costs. 

Our
reportable segments consist of our senior living community business and our rehabilitation hospital business. In the senior living community segment, we operate independent living or
congregate care communities, assisted living communities and SNFs. Our rehabilitation hospital segment provides inpatient health rehabilitation services at two hospital locations and three satellite
locations and outpatient rehabilitation services at 13 outpatient clinics. We do not consider our institutional pharmacy operations to be a material, separately reportable segment of our business but
we report our institutional pharmacy revenues and expense as separate items within our corporate and other activities. All of our operations and assets are located in the United States, except with
regard to our two captive insurance companies, which participate in our workers' compensation and liability insurance programs and are located in the Cayman Islands. 

 We
use segment operating profit as an important measure to evaluate our performance and for business decision making purposes. Segment operating profit excludes interest and other
income, interest and other expense and certain corporate expenses.

 Year ended December 31, 2009 Compared to year ended December 31, 2008 

 Senior living communities: 

 The
9.4 increase in senior living revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 was due primarily to revenues from the 11 communities we began to
operate during the fourth quarter of 2009 and the 42 communities we began to operate after January 1, 2008, plus increased per diem charges to residents, offset by a decrease in occupancy. The
1.7 increase in senior living revenue at the communities that we have operated continuously since January 1, 2008, or our comparable communities, was due primarily to increased per diem
charges to residents, offset by a decrease in occupancy. 

 Our
12.6 increase in senior living wages and benefits costs for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily due to wages and benefits from the communities we began to operate
after January 1, 2008 and higher than historical workers compensation and health insurance costs at our comparable communities. The 6.1 increase in other senior living operating expenses,
which include utilities, housekeeping, dietary, maintenance, insurance and community level administrative costs, primarily resulted from expenses at the communities we began to operate after
January 1, 2008 and increased therapy costs and charges from various service providers. The senior living wages and benefits costs at our comparable communities increased by 5.0 due primarily
to moderate wage increases and higher than historical workers compensation and health insurance costs. Other senior living operating costs at our comparable communities decreased by 0.6 due primarily
to decreases in food and other purchase service expenses, offset by higher therapy costs. The 13.0 rent expense increase was primarily due to the addition of 42 communities that we began to lease
after January 1, 2008 and our payment of additional rent for senior living community capital improvements purchased by SNH since January 1, 2008. 

 The
21.2 increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily attributable to higher depreciation costs associated with our
acquisition of ten communities after January 1, 2008 and other capital expenditures (net of sales of capital improvements to SNH), including our purchase of furniture and fixtures for our owned
communities. 

 Interest
and other expense decreased by 25.7 , for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to our September 2008 prepayment of two United Sates Department of Housing, or
HUD, insured mortgages secured by one of our communities. 

 Our
interest, dividend and other income decreased by 76.5 , for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily as a result of recognizing an 840,000 gain during the first quarter of
2008 related to a 2003 sale of a property that was previously deferred and lower yields on our investments in 2009 than in 2008. 

 Rehabilitation hospitals: 

 The
2.1 increase in rehabilitation hospital revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily due to higher revenue from Medicare's low
income reimbursement program, increased third party insurance provider rates and increased Medicare reimbursement from higher acuity patients, offset by a decrease in occupancy. 

 The
0.3 decrease in rehabilitation hospital expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily due to increases in labor and benefit expenses due to wage increases and
increased insurance costs, offset by staffing reductions. 

 The
1.4 decrease in rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was due to rent reductions in connection with a lease realignment agreement, or the Lease Realignment
Agreement, we 

 37 

Table of Contents 

 entered
into with SNH in August 2009, offset by our payment of additional rent for rehabilitation hospital capital improvements purchased by SNH after January 1, 2008. 

The
89.2 decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily attributable to our write off of long lived assets in the fourth
quarter of 2008, offset by depreciation associated with the purchase of computers and related software (net of sales of capital improvements to SNH). 

 Corporate and other: 

 The
5.8 increase in institutional pharmacy revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily due to adding new customers, partially offset by
decreased revenues per prescription due to a higher percentage of sales of generic drugs. 

The
6.3 increase in institutional pharmacy expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily due to increases in cost of sales, due to higher pharmacy sales and labor
and benefit expenses associated with servicing additional customers. 

 The
10.0 increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily the result of increased regional support costs and expenses associated
with the communities we began to operate after January 1, 2008. Our general and administrative expenses were 4.4 of total revenues for both years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. 

The
10.6 increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily attributable to our purchase of furniture and fixtures, computers
and related software for our pharmacies and at our corporate and regional offices. 

 Our
interest, dividend and other income decreased by 41.5 for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily as a result of lower yields realized on our investments. 

 Our
interest and other expense decreased by 32.2 primarily as a result of our purchase and retirement of 76.8 million of our outstanding Notes during the year ended
December 31, 2009. 

 During
the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized: 

an unrealized gain of 3.5 million on investments in trading securities principally related to our holdings of ARS; 
 an unrealized loss of 2.8 million on the value of our UBS Put Right (defined below); 
 a gain of 795,000 on sale of available for sale securities held by our captive insurance companies; and 
 a loss due to an "other than temporary" impairment of 2.9 million on investments in securities held by our captive
insurance companies. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized an "other than temporary" impairment of 8.4 million on investments in securities held by our captive insurance
companies. 

 During
the year ended December 31, 2009, we retired 76.8 million par value of our outstanding Notes that we had purchased for 39.9 million, plus accrued interest.
As a result of these purchases we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of 34.6 million, net of related unamortized costs. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized tax expense of 2.2 million, which includes tax expense of 1.6 million for state taxes on operating income and
state tax expense of 500,000 attributable to the gain on extinguishment of debt, each payable without regard to our tax loss carry forwards. Tax expense also includes 118,000 related to a
non-cash deferred liability arising from the amortization of goodwill for tax purposes but not for book purposes. As of December 31, 2009, our 

 38 

Table of Contents 

federal
net operating loss carry forward was approximately 117.6 million which will begin to expire in 2023, if unused. 

 Discontinued operations: 

 Loss
from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 4.2 million to 927,000, compared to a loss of
 5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The losses in both years are primarily due to operating expenses we incurred as a result of our shutting down operations at two
assisted living communities in each of 2009, 2007 and 2006 and two pharmacies in 2007. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2008 also includes a 300,000 impairment loss of goodwill at our
pharmacy located in California and the write down of fixed assets of 1.8 million at one of our assisted living communities.

Year ended December 31, 2008, Compared to year ended December 31, 2007 

 Senior living communities: 

 The
15.7 increase in senior living revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 was due primarily to revenues from the 47 communities we began to
operate in 2008 and increased per diem charges, partially offset by a decrease in occupancy. The 3.5 increase in senior living revenue at the communities that we have operated continuously since
January 1, 2007, or our comparable communities, was due primarily to increased per diem charges to residents, partially offset by a decrease in occupancy. 

 Our
14.0 increase in senior living wages and benefits costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to wages and benefits at the 47 communities we began to operate
in 2008 and wage increases. The 16.6 increase in other senior living operating expenses, which include utilities, housekeeping, dietary, maintenance, insurance and community level administrative
costs, primarily
results from the operating expenses at the 47 communities we began to operate in 2008 and increased charges from third parties. The senior living wages and benefits costs at our comparable communities
increased by 2.6 , due primarily to increases in wages and benefits and utility expenses. Our operating expenses at our comparable communities increased by 5.3 due primarily to an increase in utility
costs. The 25.3 rent expense increase was due to the 37 communities that we began to lease during 2008 and our payment of additional rent for senior living community capital improvements purchased by
SNH since January 1, 2007. 

 The
8.4 increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily attributable to our purchase of furniture and fixtures for our owned
communities. 

 Our
interest and other expense decreased by 25.9 , for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to our September 2008 prepayment of HUD insured mortgages secured by one of
our senior living communities. We paid 2.4 million in principal and interest to retire these two mortgages. Because we had recorded these mortgages at a premium to their face value, we
recognized a net gain of 743,000 in connection with this early extinguishment of debt. 

 41 

Table of Contents 

 Our interest and other income increased by 744,000, or 127.0 , for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of recognition of an 840,000
gain related to the 2003 sale of a property that was previously deferred until the buyer paid in full our note receivable related to the sale during the first quarter of 2008. 

 During
2007, we prepaid seven HUD insured mortgages that were secured by six of our senior living communities. We recognized a net gain of 4.5 million in connection with this
early extinguishment of debt. 

 Rehabilitation
hospitals: 

 The
3.5 decrease in hospital revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to lower Medicare reimbursement rates as well as the
closing of several unprofitable outpatient clinics offset by a slight increase in occupancy. 

 The
1.4 decrease in hospital expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to reductions in labor and benefit expenses and the closing of several unprofitable
outpatient clinics. 

 The
4.5 rent expense increase in the year ended December 31, 2008 was due to our payment of additional rent for hospital capital improvements purchased by SNH since
January 1, 2007. 

 The
13.1 decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily attributable to our write off of long lived assets in the fourth
quarter of 2008, offset by depreciation associated with the purchase of furniture and fixtures and computers and related software for our rehabilitation hospitals. 

During
our 2008 annual review of long lived and other intangible assets, we identified and recorded an impairment of long lived assets related to our two rehabilitation hospitals of
 1.8 million. 

 Corporate
and other: 

 The
15.4 increase in institutional pharmacy revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily the result of adding new customers from both
our existing senior living and third party communities partially offset by the establishment of a contractual allowance reserve of 1.0 million. We recorded this allowance in order to fairly
state the realizable value of our institutional pharmacy receivables which are primarily billed under Medicare Part D. 

The
19.9 increase in institutional pharmacy expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to adding new customers. 

 The
10.3 increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily the result of the costs associated with the 47 communities we began to
operate in 2008. Our general and administrative expenses were 4.4 and 4.5 of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 

 The
15.2 increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily attributable to our purchase of furniture and fixtures and computers
and related software for our institutional pharmacies and corporate and regional offices. 

 Our
interest, dividend and other income decreased by 17.6 for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of lower cash available for investment and lower interest
rates earned on our cash investments. 

 During
the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized: 

an unrealized loss of 12.0 million on investments in trading securities related to our holdings of ARS; 
 
 42 

Table of Contents 

an unrealized gain of 11.0 million as a result of the agreement with UBS reached in the fourth quarter of 2008 to
purchase our ARS at 100 par value upon our request between June 2010 and July 2012; 
 an impairment loss of 5.9 million of goodwill associated with our pharmacies; and 
 an "other than temporary" loss of 8.4 million on investments in available for sale securities held by our captive
insurance companies. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized tax expenses of 1.4 million, which includes: 

tax expense of 1.6 million for state taxes payable without regard to our tax loss carry forwards; 
 tax expense of 129,000 related to a non-cash deferred tax liability arising from the amortization of goodwill
for tax purposes but not for book purposes. Due to the impairment of certain of these related items of goodwill for book purposes, we recognized a portion of the deferred tax liability as a reduction
in the income tax provision; and 
 partially offset by a tax benefit of 352,000 related to prior year refunds resulting from the application of tax credits
that offset federal alternative minimum taxes. 

Discontinued
operations: 

 Loss
from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 2.4 million to 5.1 million, compared to a loss of
 2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The losses in both years are primarily due to operating expenses we incurred as a result of our shutting down operations at two
communities in each of 2007 and 2006 and two pharmacies in 2007. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2008 also includes a 300,000 impairment loss of goodwill at our pharmacy located in
California and the write down of fixed assets of 1.8 million at one of our assisted living communities. Loss from discontinued operations for 2008 and 2007 was also restated in the current
year to reflect the sale of two senior living communities during 2009. 

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

 For the year ended December 31, 2009, we generated 28.0 million of cash from continuing operations. At year end, we had
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 11.3 million. We had no amounts outstanding on our 40.0 million revolving line of credit and 39.1 million outstanding under our line
of credit with UBS. We believe that our operations will continue to provide us with adequate cash flow to run our businesses and invest in and maintain our properties. If, however, our occupancies
continue to decline and we are unable to generate positive cash flow for some period of time, we intend to further reduce costs across the Company and to borrow additional funds from our outstanding
lines of credit. 

 Auction Rate Securities 

 At December 31, 2009, we had 66.0 million invested in student loan ARS with a par value of 74.4 million. We had
intended to use the funds which we invested in ARS to invest in potential acquisitions. Accordingly, these funds are not needed to fund our current operations. Based upon our expected operating cash
flows and other sources of cash, we do not expect the failure of auctions affecting our ARS holdings to have a material adverse impact upon our day to day operations or our ability to meet our
liquidity needs. 

 In
November 2008, we entered into a settlement with UBS regarding our ARS. The settlement was made in connection with UBS's settlement with the SEC, the New York Attorney General and
other state agencies related to UBS's sale and marketing of ARS. Under the terms of the settlement, we obtained a right, or the UBS Put Right, pursuant to which we may require UBS to repurchase our 

 43 

Table of Contents 

ARS
at 100 of par value (including accrued and unpaid interest, if any) at our option during the period beginning June 30, 2010 and ending July 2, 2012. In certain circumstances, UBS
has the right to purchase these securities earlier at par. As part of the settlement terms, we released UBS from all claims arising from its marketing of the ARS to us. In connection with the
settlement, UBS provided us with a non-recourse credit facility secured by our investments in these ARS of up to 60 of the market value of the ARS from time to time. In December 2009, UBS
increased the principal amount available to us from 60 to up to 75 of the market value of the ARS. As of December 31, 2009, the estimated fair value of our investment in ARS was
 66.0 million and we had borrowings of 39.1 million outstanding under the credit facility and approximately 10.3 million remained available to borrow. Our interest rate under
the credit facility varies depending on the interest payable to us on the ARS, but will not exceed LIBOR plus 125 basis points. 

 In
June 2009, we reclassified our investments in ARS, the UBS Put Right and our outstanding borrowings on our UBS credit facility from the long term to the current sections of our
balance sheet because we expect to exercise the UBS Put Right on June 30, 2010. The value of the UBS Put Right is the difference between our estimated value of UBS's repurchase obligation and
our estimate of the fair value of the ARS. Accordingly, the value of the UBS Put Right may increase or decrease as our estimate of the value of UBS's repurchase obligation and our estimate of the fair
value of the ARS changes. We reassess the fair values of both our ARS and the UBS Put Right in each reporting period based on several factors including auction and investment redemption experience,
changes in credit ratings of UBS and our ARS investments, market risks and other factors. During the year ended December 31, 2009 we had an unrealized gain of 3.5 million on our
investments in ARS and we recognized a corresponding 2.8 million decrease in the fair value of the UBS Put Right. We categorized our UBS Put Right and our ARS to be level three within the fair
value hierarchy. Level three inputs are defined as inputs for which significant valuation assumptions are unobservable in a market and therefore value is based on the best available data, some of
which is internally developed and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require. 

 Assets and Liabilities 

 Our total current assets at December 31, 2009 were 183.3 million, compared to 114.3 million at
December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of 11.3 million compared to 16.1 million at December 31, 2008. Our current liabilities
were 172.8 million at December 31, 2009 compared to 129.1 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in current assets was primarily the result of our reclassifying our
investments in ARS and UBS Put Right from long term assets to current assets. The increase in current liabilities is primarily the result of reclassifying our UBS revolving credit facility from long
term to a current liability. 

 We
had cash flows from continuing operations of 28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 46.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2008. Acquisitions of property and equipment, including the acquisition of senior living communities, on a net basis after considering the proceeds from sales of fixed assets to SNH, were
 27.4 million and 73.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, in August 2009 we sold 8.5 million of equipment to SNH in
accordance with the Lease Realignment Agreement. During 2009, we purchased and retired a total of 76.8 million par value of our Notes for 39.9 million plus accrued interest and issued
3.2 million shares of common stock to SNH for an allocated value of 9.0 million. During the year ended 2008, as a result of an early repayment of debt, we repaid long term debt of
 2.7 million. 

 Acquisitions (including the initiation of long term leases) and Related Financings 

 In April 2007, we acquired a 48 unit assisted living community located in Tennessee for 5.0 million. We financed the
acquisition by assuming a 4.5 million non-recourse HUD insured mortgage and paying the balance of the purchase price with cash on hand. The interest rate on the 

 44 

Table of Contents 

assumed
HUD insured mortgage is 7.65 . Residents pay substantially all of our charges at this community from their private resources. 

 In
2008, we leased from SNH 37 senior living communities with a total of 3,273 living units. Twenty-seven of these communities are assisted living communities (one of which offers some
skilled nursing services and one of which offers some independent living services), eight are independent living communities and two are continuing care retirement communities which offer independent
living,
assisted living and skilled nursing services. Our rent payable to SNH for these 37 communities is 38.2 million per year, plus future increases calculated as a percentage of the revenue
increases for 30 of these communities after 2010. 

 In
connection with one of the leases we initiated in 2008, we also acquired from the prior owner of the communities its ownership interest in certain operating companies, working
capital, certain long term liabilities, and operating practices and processes, especially in the memory care area. We accounted for this transaction as a business combination and, after allocating the
purchase price to applicable assets and liabilities based on their fair value, we recorded as goodwill the 996,000 excess consideration over fair value of identifiable assets. 

 Included
in the 37 senior living communities described above are seven assisted living communities with 717 units located in Pennsylvania and New Jersey that were previously operated by
NewSeasons Assisted Living Communities, Inc., or NewSeasons, under a lease from SNH. We leased these communities in July 2008 for annual rent of approximately 7.6 million per year. In
consideration of our lease assumption, NewSeasons paid us 10.0 million and transferred title to certain personal property located at the communities. We recorded the NewSeasons consideration
as a deferred credit on our balance sheet, which we are amortizing as a reduction of rent expense over the remaining lease term. 

Simultaneously
with leasing these seven communities from SNH, we purchased three additional NewSeasons communities from SNH with 278 units located in Pennsylvania and New Jersey for
 21.4 million. We allocated the purchase price of these communities to land, building and equipment. The purchase price of these properties equaled the seller's net book value and the fair
market value of these properties based on appraisals by an independent appraiser. The ten NewSeasons communities complement our business strategy of focusing our operations in high quality senior
living assets where residents pay for our services with private resources. The majority of the revenues from these communities come from residents' private resources. 

In
December 2008, we acquired seven independent and assisted living communities, with a total of 628 living units, located in North Carolina and South Carolina for a purchase price of
 44.0 million excluding closing costs. We financed the acquisition with cash on hand and drawings under our credit facility with UBS. 

 In
October 2009, we commenced leasing from SNH a senior living community with a total of 259 independent, assisted living and skilled nursing units which SNH purchased from an unrelated
party. Our rent payable to SNH for this community is 1.8 million per year. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at this community, will commence in 2011. We added this
community to Lease No. 4 with SNH, which has a current term expiring in 2017. In connection with this lease, we also acquired from the prior owner of the community its ownership interest in
certain management agreements, trademarks and working capital for 750,000. We accounted for this transaction as a business combination and, after allocating the purchase price to applicable assets,
liabilities, management agreements and trademarks based on their fair value, we recorded as goodwill the 15,000 excess consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets. 

 In
November 2009, we commenced leasing from SNH nine senior living communities with a total of 640 independent and assisted living units which SNH purchased from an unrelated party. Our
rent 

 45 

Table of Contents 

 payable
to SNH for these communities is 8.1 million per year. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at these communities, will commence in 2011. We added these communities to
Lease No. 1 with SNH, which has a current term expiring in 2024. 

 In
December 2009, we commenced leasing from SNH one senior living community with a total of 53 independent and assisted living units which SNH purchased from an unrelated party. Our rent
payable to SNH for this community is 436,000 per year. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at this community, will commence in 2011. We added this community to Lease No. 1
with SNH, which has a current term expiring in 2024. 

 Our Leases with SNH 

 As of December 31, 2009, we leased 188 senior living communities, two rehabilitation hospitals and two assisted living
communities which have been classified as discontinued operations from SNH under four leases. Our total annual rent payable to SNH as of December 31, 2009 was 184.4 million, excluding
percentage rent based on increases in gross revenues at certain properties. We paid approximately 3.4 million and 3.3 million in percentage rent to SNH for the years ended
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 

 Upon
our request, SNH may purchase capital improvements made at the properties we lease from SNH and increase our rent pursuant to contractual formulas. During the year ended
December 31, 2009, SNH reimbursed us 36.7 million for capital expenditures made at the properties leased from SNH and these purchases resulted in our annual rent being increased by
approximately 2.9 million. 

 In
August 2009, we entered into the Lease Realignment Agreement with SNH. The Lease Realignment Agreement was entered into to assist SNH in obtaining mortgage financing, or the Loan,
from the Federal National Mortgage Association, or FNMA, which is secured by 28 properties owned by SNH and leased to us, or the Properties. The Properties consist of senior living communities with
5,618 living units located in 16 states. In connection with the Loan, we realigned our leases with SNH. Lease No. 1 expires in 2024 and now includes 89 properties (including 10
communities acquired by SNH and excluding one community sold by SNH in the fourth quarter of 2009 and including two communities that we report as discontinued operations), including independent living
communities, assisted living communities and SNFs. Lease No. 2 expires in 2026 and now includes 49 properties (excluding one community sold by SNH in the fourth quarter of 2009),
including independent living communities,
assisted living communities, SNFs and two rehabilitation hospitals. Lease No. 3 expires in 2028 and now includes the 28 Properties, including independent living communities and assisted
living communities. Lease No. 4 expires in 2017 and now includes 26 properties (including one community acquired by SNH in the fourth quarter of 2009), including independent living
communities, assisted living communities and SNFs. In connection with the Lease Realignment Agreement and the Loan, we reached an accommodation with SNH whereby we sold certain of our personal
property at the Properties to SNH, we encumbered certain of our assets (e.g., accounts receivable) arising from our operation of the Properties, we sold 3,200,000 of our common shares to SNH
and we agreed to certain reporting and other operating obligations required by FNMA and we were compensated by SNH by receiving a 2.0 million annual rent reduction for the fixed term of Lease
No. 2 and a cash payment of 18.6 million. In addition, SNH reimbursed us for out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and closing of the Loan. We also granted
SNH certain registration rights with regard to our common shares sold to SNH in connection with the Loan. 

 We
allocated the cash payment from SNH pursuant to the Lease Realignment Agreement based on the fair value of assets conveyed or expenses reimbursed. We used our closing share price on
the date of the Lease Realignment Agreement to value the 3,200,000 common shares we issued to SNH. We used our net book value, which approximates its fair value as of the date of sale, to value the
personal property we sold to SNH. Accordingly, we allocated the 18.6 million in proceeds from SNH 

 46 

Table of Contents 

as
follows: 9.0 million to issuance of common shares, 8.5 million to the sale of personal property and 100,000 as reimbursement of costs incurred. We recorded the remaining
unallocated balance of 1.0 million as an inducement in connection with Lease No. 3 and will amortize this amount over the term of that lease as a reduction of rent expense. 

Our Revenues 

 Our revenues from services to residents at our senior living communities and patients of our rehabilitation hospitals and clinics are
our primary source of cash to fund our operating expenses, including rent, principal and interest payments on our debt and our capital expenditures. 

 During
the past two years, our occupancy has been negatively affected by weak economic conditions throughout the country. These conditions have impacted many companies both within and
outside of our industry and there can be no certainty as to when current economic conditions, especially the housing market, may materially improve. Although many of the services we provide are needs
driven, some of those needs may be deferred during recessionary periods; for example, relocating to a senior living community may be delayed when sales of houses are delayed. 

 At
some of our senior living communities and at our rehabilitation hospitals and clinics, operating revenues for skilled nursing and rehabilitation services are received from the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. Medicare and Medicaid revenues were earned primarily at our SNFs and our two rehabilitation hospitals. We derived 34 and 35 of our revenues from these programs for
the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 

 Our
net Medicare revenues from services to senior living community residents totaled 144.4 million and 136.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively. Our net Medicaid revenues from services to senior living community residents totaled 165.4 million and 154.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2009
and 2008, respectively. Federal agencies and some members of Congress have proposed Medicare and Medicaid policy changes and freezes on rate increases or rate reductions to be phased in during the
next several years. Congress is currently considering national healthcare reform legislation that would affect Medicare and Medicaid policies and reimbursement for SNFs and IRFs in federal fiscal year
2010 and future years. The CMS has recently adopted rules that it estimates will decrease aggregate Medicare payments to SNFs by approximately 1.1 and increase aggregate Medicare payments to IRFs by
approximately 2.5 in federal fiscal year 2010. These rules took effect on October 1, 2009. These estimates of reductions or increases in aggregate Medicare payments to SNFs and IRFs for
federal fiscal year 2010 may change due to actions of Congress or CMS. In addition, some of the states in which we operate either have not raised Medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset
increasing costs or have frozen or reduced, or are expected to freeze or reduce, Medicaid rates. The current economic conditions are causing budget shortfalls in many states, increasing the likelihood
of Medicaid rate reductions, freezes on rate increases, or increases that are insufficient to offset increasing operating costs. The magnitude of the potential Medicare and Medicaid rate reductions or
changes and the impact on us of the failure of these programs to increase rates to match increasing expenses, as well as the impact on us of the potential Medicare and Medicaid policy changes, cannot
currently be estimated, but they may be material to our operations and may affect our future results of operations. 

Approximately
64 and 63 of our revenues from our rehabilitation hospitals came from the Medicare and Medicaid programs for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. In October 2007, the Medicare rates at our IRFs increased by approximately 3.2 over the prior period. However, this increase was later rescinded and, for payments on and after
April 1, 2008, the Medicare rate increase was reset to zero percent for federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009. Also, on July 1, 2008, CMS issued a rule updating the Medicare IRF prospective
rate formulas for the federal fiscal year 2009. The rule revises the weights assigned to patient case mix groups that are used to calculate rates 

 47 

Table of Contents 

under
the IRF prospective payment system, and resets the outlier threshold to maintain estimated outlier payments at 3 of total estimated IRF payments for the year. CMS has recently adopted an
increase of approximately 2.5 to Medicare prospective payment rates at IRFs for the 2010 fiscal year effective October 1, 2009, to account for inflation and set the outlier limits at 3 of
total estimated IRF payments. CMS has also adopted regulations clarifying the coverage criteria for Medicare payments in IRFs, to be effective January 1, 2010. 

In
May 2004, CMS issued the "75 Rule" establishing revised Medicare criteria that rehabilitation hospitals are required to meet in order to participate as IRFs in the Medicare program.
As recently amended, the rule requires that for cost reporting periods starting on and after July 1, 2006, 60 of a facility's inpatient population must require intensive rehabilitation
services for one of the CMS's designated medical conditions. An IRF that fails to meet the requirements of this rule is subject to reclassification as a different type of healthcare provider; and the
effect of such reclassification would be to lower Medicare payment rates. As of December 31, 2009 and February 19, 2010, we believe our rehabilitation hospitals are operating in
compliance with the CMS requirements to remain IRFs. However, the actual percentage of patients at our IRFs who meet these Medicare requirements may not be or remain as high as we believe or
anticipate or may decline. Our failure to remain in compliance, or a CMS finding of noncompliance, if it occurs, will result in our receiving lower Medicare rates than we currently receive at our
IRFs. 

 Insurance 

 Increases over time in the costs of insurance, especially tort liability insurance, workers' compensation and employee health
insurance, have had an adverse impact upon our results of operations. Although we self insure a large portion of these costs, our costs have increased as a result of the higher costs that we incur to
settle claims and to purchase re-insurance for claims in excess of the self insurance amounts. These increased costs may continue in the future. For more information about our existing
insurance see Item 1 "Business Insurance" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To obtain control over our insurance costs, and as described herein, we and other
companies to which RMR provides management services have formed an insurance company which we expect will begin to underwrite certain of our insurance requirements in the future. 

 Institutional Pharmacies 

 Between 2003 and 2006, we acquired six institutional pharmacies and one mail order pharmacy located in Wisconsin, Nebraska, California,
South Carolina and Virginia. Our total purchase price for these pharmacies was 15.8 million. Certain of our pharmacy businesses have been discontinued and either sold or closed, as described
below. 

 Rehabilitation Hospitals 

 We commenced operations at our two hospitals on October 1, 2006. 

 Discontinued Operations 

 During 2007, we agreed with SNH that it should sell two assisted living communities in Pennsylvania, which we currently lease. We and
SNH are in the process of selling these assisted living communities and, upon their sale, our annual rent payable to SNH will decrease by an amount equal to 9.0 of the net proceeds of the sale to
SNH. 

 48 

Table of Contents 

 In December 2007, we decided to sell our institutional pharmacy located in California and our mail order pharmacy located in Nebraska. The assets and liabilities
related to these two institutional pharmacies are presented separately in the December 31, 2008 consolidated balance sheet. We sold the institutional pharmacy in two separate transactions in
the year ended December 31, 2009, which resulted in a gain on sale of 1.2 million. We were unable to sell the mail order pharmacy on acceptable terms and we ceased its operations on
March 31, 2009. 

 During
2009, with our approval, SNH sold two SNFs which we lease from SNH. On October 1, 2009, SNH sold a SNF located in Iowa to an unaffiliated party for net proceeds of
approximately 473,000 and our annual rent payable to SNH under Lease No. 1 decreased by approximately 47,300. On November 1, 2009, SNH sold a SNF located in Missouri to an unaffiliated
party for net proceeds of approximately 1.2 million and our annual rent payable to SNH under Lease No. 2 decreased by approximately 124,700. 

 As
of December 31, 2009, we had disposed of substantially all of our assets and liabilities related to the assisted living communities which we expect to sell and the two SNFs
which were sold during 2009. We have reclassified the consolidated statement of income for all periods presented to show the results of operations of the communities and pharmacies which have been
sold or are expected to be sold as discontinued. Below is a summary of the operating results of these discontinued operations included in the financial statements for the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands):

Debt Financings and Covenants 

 In April 2007, we financed the acquisition of a 48 unit assisted living community located in Tennessee for 5.0 million by
assuming a 4.5 million non-recourse, HUD insured mortgage and paying the balance of the purchase price with cash on hand. The coupon interest rate on the assumed HUD insured
mortgage is 7.65 and its effective market rate is 5.75 . 

 In
October 2006, we issued 126.5 million principal amount of Notes. Our net proceeds from this issuance were approximately 122.6 million. These Notes are convertible into
our common shares at any time. The initial conversion rate, which is subject to adjustment, is 76.9231 common shares per 1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price
of 13.00 per share. The Notes are guaranteed by certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. These Notes mature on October 15, 2026. We may prepay the Notes at any time after October 20,
2011 and the Note holders may require that we purchase all or a portion of these Notes on each of October 15 of 2013, 2016 and 2021. We issued these Notes pursuant to an indenture which
contains various customary covenants. As of December 31, 2009 and February 19, 2010, we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants of this indenture. 

 During
2009, we retired 76.8 million par value of our outstanding Notes that we had purchased for 39.9 million plus accrued interest. We funded these purchases
principally by borrowings under our UBS credit facility, with cash generated by our operations and with proceeds we received from SNH pursuant to the Lease Realignment Agreement. As a result of these
purchases, we recorded a gain of 34.6 million net of related unamortized costs on early extinguishment of debt, and 49.7 million in principal amount of the Notes remain outstanding. 

We
have a 40.0 million revolving secured credit facility with a financial institution available for general business purposes, including acquisitions and working capital, which
is currently scheduled to expire in May 2010. The amount we are able to borrow at any time is subject to limitations based upon qualifying collateral. We are the borrower under this revolving credit
facility and certain of our subsidiaries guarantee our obligations under the facility, which is secured by our and our guarantor subsidiaries' accounts receivable, deposit accounts and related assets.
The facility contains covenants requiring us to maintain collateral, minimum net worth and certain other financial ratios; and this facility also places limits on our ability to incur or assume debt
or create liens with respect to certain of our assets and has other customary provisions. In certain circumstances and subject to available collateral and lender approvals, the maximum amounts which
we may borrow under this credit facility may be increased to 80.0 million. As of December 31, 2009 and February 19, 2010, no amounts were outstanding with 40.0 million
available under this credit facility. As of December 31, 2009 and February 19, 2010, we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under this credit facility. 

 We
may borrow additional amounts under the facility before it expires in May 2010. If we have outstanding borrowings under the facility and are unable to extend it when it expires, we
would need to explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due. Such alternatives may include incurring
additional debt and engaging in sale leaseback transactions relating to some or all of our owned communities. While we believe we will be able to replace this facility before it expires, there can be
no assurance that we will be able to do so or that our cost associated with any such transaction will be reasonable. Also, the current market conditions have led to materially increased credit spreads
which, if they continue, may result in a material increase in the interest rate under this facility, or a replacement facility, when and if it is replaced. 

 In
November 2008, we entered into a non-recourse credit facility with UBS which is available for acquisitions, working capital and general business purposes and had a
principal amount available to us of 60 of the fair value of the ARS which are collateral for the loan. In December 2009, UBS increased the principal amount available to us from 60 to up to 75 of
the varying market value of 

 50 

Table of Contents 

the
ARS. Our interest rate under the credit facility will also vary depending on the interest payable to us on the ARS, but will not exceed LIBOR plus 125 basis points. As of December 31, 2009,
the estimated fair value of our investment in ARS was 66.0 million. As of December 31, 2009 and February 19, 2010, we have 39.1 million and 44.7 million
outstanding under this credit facility, respectively, and 10.3 million and approximately 4.2 million remained available for drawing as of December 31, 2009 and
February 19, 2010, respectively. As of December 31, 2009 and February 19, 2010, we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under this credit facility. 

 At
December 31, 2009, we have nine irrevocable standby letters of credit totaling 5.1 million. Two of the letters of credit, totaling 4.0 million, provide security
for our self insured workers' compensation and professional liability programs and the remaining seven letters of credit totaling 1.1 million are security for our four properties leased from
HCPI, two of our properties encumbered by HUD insured mortgages, an automobile leasing company and a utility company that provides services to one of our senior living communities. Eight of the
letters of credit are renewed annually and one is renewed quarterly. Maturity dates for these letters of credit range from March 2010 to September 2010. 

 In
2007, we prepaid seven mortgages that were secured by six of our senior living communities. We paid 28.9 million to retire these seven mortgages, which consisted of
approximately 28.0 million in principal and interest and 840,000 in prepayment penalties. Because we had carried these mortgages at a premium to their face value, we recognized a net gain of
 4.5 million in connection with the early extinguishment of debt. 

 In
September 2008, we prepaid two HUD insured mortgages that were secured by one of our senior living communities. We paid 2.4 million in principal and interest to retire these
two mortgages, and no prepayment penalty was required. Because we had recorded these mortgages at a premium to their face value under applicable accounting rules, we recognized a net gain of 743,000
in connection with this early extinguishment of debt. 

 At
December 31, 2009, three of our communities remained encumbered by HUD insured mortgages totaling 12.4 million. The weighted average interest rate on these mortgages is
6.23 . Payments of principal and interest are due monthly until maturities at varying dates ranging from June 2035 to July 2043. These mortgages contain standard HUD mortgage covenants. As of
December 31, 2009 and February 19, 2010, we believe we are in compliance with all covenants of these mortgages. 

 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

 As of December 31, 2009, we had no off balance sheet arrangements, commercial paper, derivatives, swaps, hedges, third party
guarantees, material joint ventures or partnerships, except for the pledge of certain of our assets to secure SNH's borrowings from FNMA pursuant to the Lease Realignment Agreement. 

Related Person Transactions 

 We were a 100 owned subsidiary of SNH before December 31, 2001. On December 31, 2001, SNH distributed substantially all
of our then outstanding shares to its shareholders. At the time of our spin off, all of the persons serving as our directors were trustees of SNH. In order to effect this spin off and to govern
relations after the spin off, we entered into agreements with SNH and others. Since then we have entered into various leases and other agreements which confirm and modify these undertakings. Among
other matters, these agreements provide that: 

so long as SNH remains a real estate investment trust, or a REIT, we may not waive the share ownership restrictions in our
charter on the ability of any person or group to acquire more than 9.8 of any class of our equity shares without the consent of SNH; 
 
 51 

Table of Contents 

so long as we are a tenant of SNH, we will not permit nor take any action that, in the reasonable judgment of SNH, might
jeopardize the tax status of SNH as a REIT; 
 SNH has the option to cancel all of our rights under the leases we have with SNH upon the acquisition by a person or group
of more than 9.8 of our voting stock and upon other change in control events affecting us, as defined in those documents including, in certain of the SNH leases, the adoption of any shareholder
proposal (other than a precatory proposal) or the election to our board of directors of any individual if such proposal or individual was not approved, nominated or appointed, as the case may be, by
vote of a majority of our directors in office immediately prior to the making of such proposal or the nomination or appointment of such individual; 
 the resolution of certain disputes, claims and controversies arising from our leases with SNH may be referred to binding
arbitration proceedings; and 
 so long as we have a business management agreement with RMR we will not acquire or finance any real estate without first
giving SNH or any other publicly owned REIT or other entity managed by RMR, the opportunity to acquire or finance real estate investments of the type in which SNH or any other publicly owned REIT or
other entity managed by RMR, respectively, invests. 

SNH
is our largest landlord and beneficially owns more than 9 of our common shares. RMR provides management services to us and SNH. One of our Managing Directors, Barry Portnoy, is
currently a managing trustee of SNH. Because of these and other relationships, we and SNH may be considered related persons. As of December 31 2009, we leased 190 of our 219 senior living
communities, including two that we report as discontinued operations, and two rehabilitation hospitals from SNH. Under our leases with SNH, we pay SNH rent based on minimum annual rent plus percentage
rent based on increases in gross revenues at certain properties. During 2009, our rent expense under our leases with SNH was 178.0 million, net of 0.9 million amortization of a lease
inducement from SNH. Our total minimum annual rent payable to SNH under our leases with SNH as of December 31, 2009 was 184.4 million, excluding percentage rent based on increases in
gross revenues at certain properties. Additional information regarding our leases with SNH appears in Item 1 "Our SNH Leases" of this Annual Report. 

 Since
January 1, 2009, we have had several transactions with SNH, including: 

In August 2009, we entered into the Lease Realignment Agreement with SNH. The Lease Realignment Agreement was entered into
to assist SNH in obtaining the Loan from FNMA which is secured by the Properties. The Properties consist of senior living communities with 5,618 living units located in 16 states. In connection with
the Loan, we realigned our leases with SNH. Lease No. 1 expires in 2024 and now includes 89 properties (including ten communities acquired by SNH and excluding one community sold by SNH in the
fourth quarter of 2009 and including two communities that we report as discontinued operations), including independent living communities, assisted living communities and SNFs. Lease No. 2
expires in 2026 and now includes 49 properties (excluding one community sold by SNH in the fourth quarter of 2009), including independent living communities, assisted living communities, SNFs and two
rehabilitation hospitals. Lease No. 3 expires in 2028 and now includes the 28 Properties, including independent living communities and assisted living communities. Lease No. 4 expires in
2017 and now includes 26 properties (including one community acquired by SNH in the fourth quarter of 2009), including independent living communities, assisted living communities and SNFs. In
connection with the Lease Realignment Agreement and the Loan, we reached an accommodation with SNH whereby we sold certain of our personal property at the Properties to SNH, we encumbered certain of
our assets (e.g., accounts receivable) arising from our operation of the Properties for the benefit of FNMA, we sold 3,200,000 of our common shares to SNH, we 
 
 52 

Table of Contents 

agreed
to certain reporting and other operating obligations required by FNMA and we were compensated by SNH by receiving a 2.0 million annual rent reduction for the fixed term of Lease
No. 2 and a cash payment of 18.6 million. In addition, SNH reimbursed us for out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and closing of the Loan. We also granted
SNH certain registration rights with regard to our common shares sold to SNH in connection with the Loan. 

In October 2009, we commenced leasing from SNH a senior living community with a total of 259 independent, assisted living
and skilled nursing units which SNH purchased from an unrelated party, and we paid 750,000 for certain of the non-real estate assets. Our rent payable to SNH for this community is
 1.8 million per year. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at this community, will commence in 2011. We added this community to Lease No. 4 with SNH, which has a
current term expiring in 2017. 
 At our request, also in October 2009, SNH sold one SNF with a total of 62 beds, which we leased, to an unaffiliated party,
for net proceeds of approximately 473,000 and our annual rent payable to SNH under Lease No. 1 decreased by approximately 47,300. 
 At our request, in November 2009, SNH sold one SNF with a total of 74 beds, which we leased, to an unaffiliated party, for
net proceeds of approximately 1.2 million and our annual rent payable to SNH under Lease No. 2 decreased by approximately 124,700. 
 Also in November 2009, we commenced leasing from SNH nine senior living communities with a total of 640 independent and
assisted living units which SNH purchased from an unrelated party. Our rent payable to SNH for these communities is 8.1 million per year. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues
at these communities, will commence in 2011. We added these communities to Lease No. 1 with SNH, which has a current term expiring in 2024. 
 In December 2009, we commenced leasing from SNH one senior living community with a total of 53 independent and assisted
living units which SNH purchased from an unrelated party. Our rent payable to SNH for this community is 436,000 per year. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at this community, will
commence in 2011. We added this community to Lease No. 1 with SNH, which has a current term expiring in 2024. 
 During 2009, pursuant to the terms of our leases with SNH, SNH purchased approximately 36.7 million of
improvements made to our communities leased from SNH, and, as a result, the annual rent payable to SNH by us increased by approximately 2.9 million. 

RMR
provides certain management, administrative and information system services to us under the business management agreement. The business management agreement provides for compensation
to RMR at an annual rate equal to 0.6 of our total revenues from all sources reportable under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Also, RMR is compensated at a rate equal
to 80 of the employment expenses of RMR's employees, other than its chief information officer, actively engaged in servicing management information systems. The business management agreement is
effective until December 31, 2010, and will be automatically renewed for successive one year terms thereafter unless we or RMR give notice of non-renewal before the end of an
applicable term. We or RMR may terminate the business management agreement upon 60 days prior written notice. RMR may also terminate the business management agreement upon five business days
notice if we undergo a change of control, as defined in the business management agreement. Our Board has given our compensation committee, which is comprised exclusively of our Independent Directors,
sole authority to act on our behalf with respect to this agreement. The charter of our compensation committee requires the committee to review, evaluate and approve the business management agreement
and evaluate RMR's performance under this agreement annually. Under the committee's charter, the committee must also annually evaluate and approve the compensation paid to RMR under 

 53 

Table of Contents 

the
agreement. The aggregate fees paid by us to RMR for management, administrative and information system services for 2009 were 10.5 million. We are generally responsible for all of our
expenses and certain expenses incurred by RMR on our behalf. 

 In
addition, RMR also provides the internal audit function for us and for other publicly owned companies to which it provides management services. Our audit committee appoints our
director of internal audit and our compensation committee approves his salary. Our compensation committee also approves the allocated costs we pay with respect to our internal audit function. Our pro
rata share of RMR's costs in providing that function was approximately 220,000 for 2009. The business management agreement also includes arbitration provisions for the resolution of certain disputes,
claims and controversies. A termination of our business management agreement is an event of default under our revolving credit facility, if not approved by a majority of our lenders. 

 The
fact that RMR has responsibilities to other entities, including our largest landlord, SNH, could create conflicts; and in the event of such conflicts between SNH and us, our business
management agreement with RMR allows RMR to act on behalf of SNH rather than on our behalf. The business management agreement includes restrictions on our ability to invest in or finance any real
estate property of a type then owned or financed by a publicly owned entity managed by RMR. Under the business management agreement, RMR has agreed not to provide business management services to any
other business or enterprise, other than SNH, that is directly competitive with our business. 

RMR
is beneficially owned by Barry Portnoy, one of our Managing Directors, and Adam Portnoy, his son, who is President and Chief Executive Officer and a director of RMR and a managing
trustee of SNH. Barry Portnoy and Gerard Martin, our Managing Directors, are directors of RMR. 

 Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are also officers and employees of RMR. These officers devote a substantial majority of their business time to our affairs and the
remainder to RMR's business which is separate from our business. We believe the compensation we paid to these officers reasonably reflects their division of business time; however, periodically, these
individuals may divide their business time differently than they do currently and their compensation from us may become disproportionate to this division. 

An
affiliated entity of RMR is the owner of the buildings in which our corporate headquarters and administrative offices are located. We lease those buildings under leases that expire in
2011. We incurred rent, which includes our proportional share of utilities and real estate taxes, under these leases during 2009 of 1.1 million. These leases have been amended at various times
to take into account our needs for increasing space. 

 One
of our hospitals' outpatient clinics leases space from HRPT Properties Trust, or HRP, a REIT managed by RMR. We incurred rent, which includes our proportional share of utilities and
real estate taxes, under this lease during 2009 of 20,000. 

 In
December 2006, we began leasing space for a regional office in Atlanta, Georgia from HRP. Our lease for this space expires in 2011. We incurred rent, which includes our proportional
share of utilities and real estate taxes, under this lease during 2009 of 66,000. 

 We
understand that the other companies to which RMR provides management services also have certain other relationships with each other, such as lease arrangements for properties. In
addition, officers of RMR serve as officers of those companies. We understand that further information regarding those relationships is provided in the applicable periodic reports and proxy statements
filed by those other companies with the SEC. In addition, our Independent Directors also serve as directors or trustees of certain of those other companies, and directors and trustees of certain of
those other companies serve as directors or trustees of the other companies. Mr. Barry Portnoy serves as a managing director or trustee of each of those other companies, including SNH.

 We,
RMR and other companies to which RMR provides management services formed AIC, which is an insurance company, in the State of Indiana in November 2008. AIC received its certificate of
authority to transact insurance business in the State of Indiana from the Indiana Department of Insurance in May 2009. All of our Directors currently serve on the board of directors of AIC. RMR, in
addition to being a shareholder, entered a management agreement with AIC pursuant to which RMR provides AIC certain management and administrative services. In addition, AIC entered an investment
advisory
agreement with RMR Advisors, Inc., or RMR Advisors, pursuant to which RMR Advisors acts as AIC's investment advisor. The same persons who own and control RMR, including Barry Portnoy, one of
our Managing Directors, and Adam Portnoy, his son, own and control RMR Advisors. Our Governance Guidelines provide that any material transaction between us and AIC shall be reviewed, authorized and
approved or ratified by both the affirmative vote of a majority of our entire Board and the affirmative vote of a majority of our Independent Directors. As of February 19, 2010, we have
invested 5.2 million in AIC. On December 16, 2009, Government Properties Income Trust, or GOV, another REIT management by RMR, purchased 20,000 shares of AIC from AIC, which represented
a 14.29 interest in AIC. In connection with that purchase by GOV, we, the other previous shareholders of AIC, AIC and GOV entered an amended and restated shareholders agreement. The amended and
restated shareholders agreement also includes arbitration provisions for the resolution of certain disputes, claims and controversies. We and the other shareholders of AIC each currently own
approximately 14.29 of AIC. We may invest additional amounts in AIC in the future if the expansion of this insurance business requires additional capital, but we are not obligated to do so. Over time
we expect to obtain some or all of our insurance coverage from AIC. By participating in this insurance business with RMR and the other companies to which RMR provides management services, we expect
that we may benefit financially by possibly reducing our insurance expenses and/or by realizing our pro-rata share of any profits of this insurance business. All transactions between us
and AIC have been approved pursuant to our Governance Guidelines. 

 The
foregoing descriptions of our agreements with SNH, HRP, AIC and RMR are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the agreements. A further description of the
terms of those agreements is included in our annual report to shareholders and this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in each case for the year ended December 31, 2009. In
addition, copies of those agreements are filed with the SEC and may be obtained from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. 

 We
believe that our agreements with SNH, HRP, AIC and RMR are on reasonable commercial terms. We also believe that our relationships with SNH, HRP, AIC and RMR benefit us and, in fact,
provide us competitive advantages in operating and growing our businesses. Nonetheless, because of our various relationships with SNH, AIC and RMR it is possible that some investors may assert
otherwise. See Item IA "Risk Factors We are subject to possible conflicts of interest; we have engaged in, and expect to continue to engage in, transactions with parties who may be
considered related parties." 

 Policies and Procedures Concerning Conflicts of Interest and Related Person Transactions 

 Our Code of Conduct and our Governance Guidelines address the review and approval of activities, interests or relationships that
interfere with, or appear to interfere with, our interests, including related person transactions. Persons subject to our Code of Conduct and Governance Guidelines are under a continuing obligation to
disclose any such conflicts of interest and may pursue a transaction or relationship which involves such conflicts of interest only if the transaction or relationship has been approved as
follows: 

In the case of an executive officer or director, such person must seek approval from our disinterested directors for
investments, related person transactions (involving a direct or indirect material interest) and other transactions or relationships which such person would like to pursue and which may otherwise
constitute a conflict of interest or other action falling outside the scope 
 
 55 

Table of Contents 

of
permissible activities under our Code of Conduct or Governance Guidelines. If there are no disinterested directors, the transaction shall be reviewed, authorized and approved or ratified by both
the affirmative vote of a majority of our entire Board of Directors and the affirmative vote of a majority of our Independent Directors. In determining whether to approve or ratify a transaction, our
Board of Directors, disinterested directors or Independent Directors, as the case may be, shall act in accordance with any applicable provisions of our charter, shall consider all of the relevant
facts and circumstances, and shall approve only those transactions that are fair and reasonable to us. 

In the case of other employees subject to our Code of Conduct, the employee must seek approval from an executive officer
who has no interest in the matter for which approval is being requested. 
 Together with RMR and various affiliates of RMR, in 2009 we formed and licensed AIC, in which we own equity, and for which
all of our directors serve as directors. Any material transaction between us and AIC shall be reviewed, authorized and approved or ratified by both the affirmative vote of a majority of our entire
Board of Directors and the affirmative vote of a majority of our Independent Directors. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

 Our critical accounting policies concern revenue recognition, our assessments of the net realizable value of our accounts receivable,
reserves related to our self insurance programs, income tax valuation allowances and our valuations of our goodwill, other intangibles and long lived assets. 

Our
revenue recognition policies involve judgments about Medicare and Medicaid rate calculations. These judgments are based principally upon our experience with these programs and our
knowledge of current rules and regulations applicable to these programs. We recognize revenues when services are provided and these amounts are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts. Some
Medicare and Medicaid revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment and sometimes retroactive legislative changes. 

 Our
policies for valuing accounts receivable based upon our experience, involve significant judgments based upon our experience, including consideration of the age of the receivables,
the terms of the agreements with our residents, their third party payors or other obligors, the residents or payors stated intent to pay, the residents or payors financial capacity and other factors
which may include litigation or rate and payment appeal proceedings. 

 Determining
reserves for the self insurance portions of our insurance programs involves significant judgments based upon our experience, including projected settlements for pending
claims, known incidents which we expect may result in claims, estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims, claims experience, estimated litigation costs and other factors. We also periodically
receive and rely upon recommendations from professional consultants in establishing these reserves. Despite these efforts, these reserves have sometimes proved to be materially inaccurate. 

Because
we have historically reported losses, we do not currently recognize the benefit of all of our deferred tax assets, including tax loss carry forwards that may be used to offset
future taxable income. We will, however, continue to assess our ability to generate sufficient taxable income during future periods in which our deferred tax assets may be realized. When we believe
that we will more likely than not realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets, we will record deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations, which will
affect our results of operations.

 We review goodwill annually during our fourth quarter, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances exist, for impairment. If our review indicates
that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value, we reduce the carrying amount to fair value. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which we determined to be the
segments we operate, by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit as determined by its discounted cash flows and market approaches, such as capitalization rates and earnings multiples, with its
carrying value. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis include future revenue growth, gross margins and our weighted average cost of capital. We select a growth rate based on
our view of the growth prospect of each of our segments. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its
carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss. Our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to our
business model or changes in operating performance. During our 2009 annual goodwill impairment review, we determined no impairments should be recorded. 

 During
the fourth quarter of 2008 our market capitalization declined and was significantly below the then current book value. As a result, we determined an interim impairment test was
necessary and performed the interim test on all of our reporting units as of December 31, 2008. In our evaluation we weighed all known quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if an
impairment occurred. As a result, we determined to reduce the value of goodwill reported on our balance sheet related to our pharmacies as of December 31, 2008 by 5.9 million. 

We
review the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. If there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable, we determine the amount of impairment loss, if any, by comparing the historical carrying value of the
asset to its estimated fair value. We determine estimated fair value through an evaluation of recent financial performance, recent sales of similar assets, market conditions and projected undiscounted
cash flows that our asset or asset groups are expected to generate. This process requires that estimates be made and errors in our judgments or estimates could have a material effect on our financial
statements. As a result of this test we determined to reduce the value of our long lived assets reported on our balance sheet related to our rehabilitation hospital reporting unit as of
December 31, 2008 by 1.8 million. During our 2009 we determined that no impairment charges were required. 

 Some
of our judgments and estimates are based upon published industry statistics and in some cases third party professionals. Any errors in our estimates or judgments affecting our
critical accounting policy could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

 In
the future we may need to revise the judgments, estimates and assessments we use to formulate our critical accounting policies to incorporate information which is not now known. We
cannot predict the effect changes to the premises underlying our critical accounting policies may have on our future results of operations, although such changes could be material and adverse. 

 Recently Announced Accounting Pronouncements 

 In June 2009, the FASB issued the Codification that is the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles and is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of the Codification did not cause any
material change to our current accounting practices. 

 Effective
June 30, 2009, we adopted the Subsequent Events Topic of the Codification. This topic establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur
after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. It requires the disclosure of the date through 

 57 

Table of Contents 

which
an entity has evaluated subsequent events and whether that date represents the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. 

The
Business Combinations Topic of the Codification establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer will recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable
assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination principally by expanding the definition of what constitutes a
business combination, making it more likely that our acquisitions will be accounted for as business combinations, and by requiring the immediate expensing of acquisition costs incurred in connection
with such transactions. This topic is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and the adoption affects our consolidated financial statements, principally by requiring us to
expense acquisition costs. 

 Effective
June 30, 2009, we adopted the Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments subtopic of the Financial Instruments Topic of the Codification. Please see
our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements No. 8, "Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities" for relevant disclosures. 

 In
April 2009, the FASB issued the following topics: Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying
Transactions That Are Not Orderly; Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments; and, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The
first topic provides additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the assets or liabilities have significantly decreased. This topic also includes guidance
on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. The Other-Than-Temporary Impairments Topic amends existing other than temporary impairment guidance
relating to debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments of debt and equity securities. The Interim
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments Topic requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in
annual financial statements. Each of these topics is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of these topics did not cause any material
changes to our disclosures in our consolidated financial statements. 

 Inflation and Deflation 

 Inflation in the past several years in the United States has been modest. Future inflation might have either positive or negative
impacts on our business. Rising price levels may allow us to increase occupancy charges to residents, but may also cause our operating costs, including our percentage rent, to increase. Also, our
ability to affect rate increases paid by the Medicare and Medicaid programs will be limited despite inflation. 

Deflation
would likely have a negative impact upon us. A large component of our expenses consists of our fixed minimum rental obligations to SNH and HCPI. Accordingly we believe that a
general decline in price levels which could cause our charges to residents to decline would likely not be fully offset by a decline in our expenses. 

 Seasonality 

 Our senior living business is subject to modest effects of seasonality. During the calendar fourth quarter holiday periods, nursing
home and assisted living residents are sometimes discharged to join family celebrations and relocations and admission decisions are often deferred. The first quarter of each calendar year usually
coincides with increased illness among nursing home and assisted living residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals. As a result of these factors, nursing home and
assisted living operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of a calendar year and lesser earnings in the first and fourth quarters. We do not believe 

 58 

Table of Contents 

that
this seasonality will cause fluctuations in our revenues or operating cash flow to such an extent that we will have difficulty paying our expenses, including rent, which do not fluctuate
seasonally. 

 Impact of Climate Change 

 The current political debates about world climate changes has resulted in various existing and proposed treaties, laws and regulations
which are intended to limit carbon emissions. We believe treaties, laws and regulations which may limit carbon emissions may cause energy costs at our communities to increase. In the longer term, we
believe any such increased costs will be passed through and paid by our patients, residents and other customers in higher charges for our services. However, in the short term, these increased costs,
if material in amount, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

 We are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates. We manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring
available financing alternatives. Our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from December 31, 2008. Other than as described below, we do not foresee any
significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future. 

 Changes
in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt; increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt, while decreases in
market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt. For example: based upon discounted cash flow analysis, if prevailing interest rates were to increase by 10 , the market value of
our 12.3 million fixed rate mortgage debt and 49.7 million Notes outstanding on December 31, 2009 would decline by about 3.0 million; and, similarly, if prevailing
interest rates were to decline by 10 and other credit market considerations remained unchanged, the market value of our 12.3 million fixed rate mortgage debt and 49.7 million Notes
outstanding on December 31, 2009, would increase by about 3.2 million. 

 Our
revolving line of credit bears interest at floating rates and matures in May 2010. As of December 31, 2009 and February 19, 2010, no amounts were outstanding under this
credit facility. We borrow in U.S. dollars and borrowings under our revolving credit facility require annual interest at LIBOR plus a spread. Accordingly, we are vulnerable to changes in U.S. dollar
based short term, interest rates, specifically LIBOR. A change in interest rates would not affect the value of any outstanding floating rate debt but would affect our operating results. For example,
if the maximum amount of 40.0 million were drawn under our credit facility and interest rates increased or decreased by 1 per annum, our interest expense would increase or decrease by
 400,000 per year, or 0.01 per share, based on our currently outstanding common shares. If interest rates were to change gradually over time, the impact would occur over time. 

 In
November 2008, we entered into a non-recourse credit facility with UBS secured by our ARS. As of December 31, 2009 and February 19, 2010,
 39.1 million and 44.7 million was outstanding under this credit facility. We borrow in U.S. dollars and interest payments under this non-recourse credit facility will vary
depending on the interest payable on the ARS, but will not exceed LIBOR plus 125 basis points. Because the interest we pay on this UBS facility depends, in part, on the interest we earn on our ARS and
our spread is capped, we do not believe changes in interest rates are likely to have a material impact upon our net cost of borrowings under this UBS facility or upon our results of operations. 

 The
amount of money we may borrow under this UBS credit facility depends upon the market value of our ARS. Because our ARS are income securities, it is likely that the market value of
our ARS will be affected by changes in interest rates; as interest rates increase the market value of our ARS might decline, and as interest rates decrease the market value on our ARS should increase. 

 59 

Table of Contents 

However,
there are other factors which might impact the market value of our ARS, such as supply and demand and liquidity, such that we do not believe the impact of interest rate changes upon the value
of our ARS and our borrowing capacity under the UBS credit facility can be precisely determined. 

 Our
exposure to fluctuations in interest rates may increase in the future if we incur additional debt to fund acquisitions or otherwise.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

 As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 

 There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

 Management Report on Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

 We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system is
designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no
matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation. 

 Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework . Based on our assessment, we
believe that, as of December 31, 2009, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. 

Ernst 
Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our 2009 consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. The report appears elsewhere herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

 To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Five Star Quality Care, Inc. 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Five Star Quality Care, Inc., as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 

 We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Five Star Quality Care, Inc. at
December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

 We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Five Star Quality Care, Inc.'s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February 19, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

 To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Five Star Quality Care, Inc. 

 We
have audited Five Star Quality Care, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Five Star Quality Care, Inc.'s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in Item 9A of
Five Star Quality Care Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. 

 We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

 Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In
our opinion, Five Star Quality Care, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the

FIVE STAR QUALITY CARE, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands, except per share data) 

1. Organization and Business 

We were organized in 2000 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Senior Housing Properties Trust, or SNH. On December 31, 2001, SNH distributed substantially all of our common shares to
its shareholders. Concurrent with our spin-off, we entered into agreements with SNH and others to establish our initial capitalization and other matters. 

 We
operate senior living communities, including independent living or congregate care communities, assisted living communities and skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs. As of
December 31, 2009, we leased or owned and operated 217 senior living communities containing 22,905 living units, including 170 primarily independent and assisted living communities with 18,627
living units and 47 SNFs with 4,278 living units. 

 Of
our 170 primarily independent and assisted living communities, we: 

leased 143 communities containing 16,451 living units from SNH, our former parent; 
 leased four communities with 200 living units from Health Care Property Investors, or HCPI; and 
 owned 23 communities with 1,976 living units. 

Of
our 47 SNFs, we: 

leased 45 facilities from SNH with 4,007 living units; and 
 owned two facilities with 271 living units. 

In
aggregate, our 217 senior living communities included 6,315 independent living apartments, 10,352 assisted living suites and 6,238 skilled nursing units. Excluded from the preceding
data are two assisted living communities containing 173 living units leased from SNH that have been classified as discontinued operations. 

 We
also operate two rehabilitation hospitals with 321 beds that we lease from SNH. Our two rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient services at the two hospitals and three satellite
locations. In addition, we operate 13 outpatient clinics affiliated with these rehabilitation hospitals. We also own and operate five institutional pharmacies. 

 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

 Basis of Presentation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of all of our subsidiaries.
All intercompany
transactions have been eliminated. 

 Subsequent Events Evaluation. In preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements, we evaluated events that occurred through
February 19, 2010, the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements for potential recognition or disclosure. 

 Use of Estimates. Preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires
us to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and related notes. Some significant estimates include the fair value of our investments in
securities that are not actively traded on a major

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

exchange,
the value of our put right, our self insurance reserves, the allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances. 

 We
are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary
differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement and tax purposes. These timing differences result in
deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. We are required to record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets if we are not able to conclude
that it is more likely than not these assets will be realized. 

 Our
actual results could differ from our estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in the consolidated financial
statements in the period that they are determined. 

 Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents, consisting of money market funds with original maturities of three months or less
at the date
of purchase, are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates market. 

Investment Securities and Restricted Investments. Investments securities that are held principally for resale in the near term are
classified as
"trading" and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. Trading investments at December 31, 2009 and 2008 consisted entirely of auction rate securities, or ARS.
In 2009 and 2008, our investments in these trading securities generated interest income of 1,142 and 2,693, respectively, and is included in interest, dividend and other income. 

 Securities
not classified as "trading" are classified as "available for sale" and carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of
shareholders' equity and "other than temporary" losses recorded in our consolidated statement of operations. Realized gains and losses on all available for sale securities are recognized based on
specific identification. Available for sale investments at December 31, 2009 and 2008 consisted primarily of preferred securities. At December 31, 2009, these investments had a fair
value of 9,084 and we had recorded an unrealized holding gain of 2,078. At December 31, 2008, these investments had a fair value of 7,232 and an unrealized holding loss of 492. 

 Our
restricted investments consist of preferred securities and are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate
component of shareholders' equity. The unrealized loss on investments shown on the consolidated balance sheet represents the difference between the market value of these investments calculated by
using quoted market prices on the date they were acquired and on December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, these investments had a fair value of 8,096 and an unrealized gain of 2,502.
At December 31, 2008, these investments had a fair value of 9,664, and an unrealized loss of 1,090. 

 In
2009 and 2008, our available for sale securities generated interest and dividend income of 1,347 and 1,714, respectively, and is included in interest, dividend and other income.

We
routinely evaluate our available for sale investments to determine if they have been impaired. If the book or carrying value of an investment is less than its estimated fair value and
that situation is expected to continue for a more than a temporary period, we will remove the unrealized holding loss from equity and record an "other than temporary" loss in our consolidated
statement of operations. We determine the estimated fair value of our available for sale investments by reviewing the current market price; the ratings of the security; the financial condition of the
issuer or obligor; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment. In evaluating the factors described above
for available for sale investments, we presume a decline in value to be "other than temporary" if the quoted market price of the security is below the investment's cost basis for an extended period.
However, the presumption may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating the decline is temporary in nature, such as if the issuer's/obligor's operating performance is strong; if dividends
are being paid; or the market price of the security is historically volatile. Additionally, there may be instances in which impairment losses are recognized even if the decline in value does not fall
within the criteria described above, such if there is a plan to
sell the security in the near term and the fair value is below our cost basis. We recorded charges of 2,947 and 8,404 for an "other than temporary" impairment in the value of our securities held by
our captive insurance company for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 

 Restricted Cash. Restricted cash as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 includes cash that we deposited as security for obligations
arising from our
self insurance programs and other amounts for which we are required to establish escrows, including: Florida regulatory requirements; real estate taxes

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We record accounts receivable at their estimated net realizable value. We
estimate
allowances for uncollectible amounts and contractual allowances based upon factors which include, but are not limited to: the age of the receivable and the terms of the agreements; the residents',
patients' or third party payors' stated intent to pay; the payor's financial capacity to pay; and other factors which may include likelihood and cost of litigation. Accounts receivable allowances are
estimates. We periodically review and revise these estimates based on new information and these revisions may be material. 

 During
2009, 2008 and 2007, we increased our allowance of, and charged to expense, doubtful accounts of 7,054, 6,737 and 4,865, respectively, and wrote off accounts receivable of
 7,360, 5,342 and 4,994, respectively. 

 Included
in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 are amounts due from the Medicare program of 20,954 and 25,433, respectively, and amounts due from various state
Medicaid programs of 17,886 and 15,323, respectively. 

 Deferred Finance Costs. We capitalize issuance costs related to borrowings and amortize the deferred costs over the terms of the
respective loans.
Our unamortized balance of deferred finance costs was 2,121 and 4,404 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Accumulated amortization related to deferred finance costs was 806 and 634
at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2009, the weighted average amortization period remaining is approximately 20 years. The amortization expenses to be
incurred during the next five years as of December 31, 2009 are 160 in 2010 and 109 in each of 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. 

 Property and Equipment. Property and equipment is stated at cost. We record depreciation on property and equipment on a straight line
basis over
estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, up to 15 years for building improvements and up to seven years for personal property. We regularly evaluate whether events or
changes in circumstances have occurred that could indicate impairment in the value of our long lived assets. If there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable, we
determine the amount of impairment loss, if any, by comparing the historical carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. We determine estimated fair value through an evaluation of recent
financial performance, recent sales of similar assets, market conditions and projected cash flows of properties using standard industry valuation techniques. As a result of this

test
we reduced the value of property and equipment by 1,837 reported on our balance sheet related to our rehabilitation hospitals as of December 31, 2008. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the costs of business acquisitions in excess of the fair value of identifiable
net assets
acquired. We review goodwill annually during our fourth quarter, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances exist, for impairment. If our review indicates that the carrying amount of
goodwill exceeds its fair value, we reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to fair value. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which we determined to be the segments we
operate, by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit as determined by its discounted cash flows and market approaches, such as capitalization rates and earnings multiples, with its carrying
value. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis include future revenue growth, gross margins and our weighted average cost of capital. We select a growth rate based on our view of
the growth prospect of each of our segments. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying
amount to measure the amount of the potential impairment loss. 

 At
acquisition, we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets primarily using discounted cash flow analysis of anticipated cash flows reflecting incremental
revenues and/or cost savings resulting from the acquired intangible asset, reflecting market participant assumptions. Amortization of intangible assets with finite lives is recognized over their
estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized. 

 Long
lived assets and other intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying
amounts may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset held for use exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows, the carrying value of the asset is generally written
down to fair value. 

 Self Insurance. We self insure up to certain limits for workers compensation and professional liability claims. Claims in excess of
these limits are
insured by third party insurance providers up to contractual limits, over which we are self insured. We fully self insure all health related claims for our covered employees. We accrue the estimated
cost of self insured amounts based on projected settlements for pending claims, known incidents which we expect may result in claims, estimates of incurred but not yet reported incidents and expected
changes in premiums for insurance provided by third party insurers whose policies provide for retroactive adjustments. We periodically adjust these estimates based upon our claims experience,
recommendations from our professional consultants, changes in market conditions and other factors; such adjustments may be material. 

Continuing Care Contracts. Residents at one of our communities may enter into continuing care contracts. We offer two forms of
continuing care
contracts to new residents at this community. One form of contract provides that 10 of the resident admission fee becomes non-refundable upon occupancy, and the remaining 90 becomes
non-refundable at the rate of 1.5 per month of the original amount over the subsequent 60 months. The second form of contract provides that 30 of the resident admission fee is
non-refundable upon occupancy and 70 is refundable. Three other forms of continuing care contracts are in effect for existing residents but are not offered to new residents. One
historical form of contract provides that the resident admission fee is 10 non-refundable upon

occupancy
and 90 refundable. A second historical form of contract provides that the resident admission fee is 100 refundable. A third historical form of contract provides that the resident admission
fee is 1 refundable and 99 non-refundable upon admission. In each case, we amortize the non-refundable part of these fees into revenue over the actuarially determined
remaining life of the resident, which is the expected period of occupancy by the resident. We pay refunds of our admission fees when residents relocate from our communities. We report the refundable
amount of these admission fees as current liabilities and the non-refundable amount as deferred revenue, a portion of which is classified as a current liability. The balance of refundable
admission fees as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 6,372 and 7,525, respectively. 

Leases. On the inception date of a lease and upon any relevant amendments to such lease, we test the classification of such lease as
either a capital
lease or an operating lease. None of our leases have met any of the criteria to be classified as a capital lease under the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification , or the Codification, Leases Topic, and, therefore, we have accounted for all of our leases as operating
leases. 

 Taxes. The Income Taxes topic of the Codification prescribes how we should recognize, measure and present in our financial statements
uncertain tax
positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. We can recognize a tax benefit only if it is "more likely than not" that a particular tax position will be sustained upon
examination or audit. To the extent the "more likely than not" standard has been satisfied, the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that has a greater than 50 
likelihood of being realized upon settlement. As required, we adopted this provision effective January 1, 2007 and have concluded that the effect is not material to our consolidated financial
statements. Accordingly, we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of this provision. At December 31, 2009, our tax returns filed for the 2003 through 2009 tax
years are subject to examination by taxing authorities. We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, in our financial statements as a component of general and
administrative expense. 

 We
pay franchise taxes in certain states in which we have operations. We have included franchise taxes in general and administrative and other operating expenses in our consolidated
statement of operations. 

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Our financial instruments are limited to cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, trading
and available
for sale securities, accounts payable, mortgage notes payable, our put right (See Note 8) and our Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, or the Notes. Except for the Notes, as of
December 31, 2009, the fair value of these financial instruments was not materially different from their carrying values at December 31, 2009 and 2008. As of December 31, 2009 and
2008, our carrying value of the Notes was 49,707 and 126,500, respectively, and the fair value was 37,777 and 42,884, respectively. We estimate the fair values using market quotes when available,
discounted cash flow analysis and current prevailing interest rates.

 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenues primarily from services to residents and patients at our senior living communities and
hospitals and we
record revenues when services are provided. We expect payment from governments or other third party payors for some of our services. We derived approximately 31 , 31 and 34 of our senior living
revenues in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, from payments under Medicare and Medicaid programs. For the year ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we received approximately 64 , 63 and
69 , respectively, of our hospital revenues from these programs. Revenues under some of these programs are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment. 

Medicare
revenues from senior living operations totaled 144,390, 135,988 and 123,175 during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Medicaid revenues from senior living operations totaled
 165,385, 153,980 and 144,258 during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Medicare revenues from our hospitals were 64,506, 62,118 and 70,235 for the year ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. 

 Per Common Share Amounts. We computed income (loss) per share, or EPS, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, using
the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if our Notes were converted into our common shares and is separately
reported where such conversion would result in a lower EPS amount. 

 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. In June 2009, the FASB issued the Codification that is the single source of authoritative
nongovernmental
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of the Codification
did not cause any material change to our current accounting practices. 

 Effective
June 30, 2009, we adopted the Subsequent Events Topic of the Codification. This topic establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur
after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. It requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and whether that date
represents the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. 

 The
Business Combinations Topic of the Codification establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer will recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable
assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination principally by expanding the definition of what constitutes a
business combination, making
it more likely that our acquisitions will be accounted for as business combinations, and by requiring the immediate expensing of acquisition costs incurred in connection with such transactions. This
topic is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and the adoption affects our consolidated financial statements, principally by requiring us to expense acquisition costs. 

 Effective
June 30, 2009, we adopted the Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments subtopic of the Financial Instruments Topic of the Codification. Please see
Note 8, "Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities" for relevant disclosures. 

In
April 2009, the FASB issued the following topics: Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying
Transactions That Are Not Orderly; Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary

 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

Impairments;
and Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The first topic provides additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the
assets or liabilities have significantly decreased. This topic also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. The
Other-Than-Temporary Impairments Topic amends existing other than temporary impairment guidance relating to debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve
the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments of debt and equity securities. The Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments Topic requires disclosure about
fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements. Each of these topics is effective for interim and annual
reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of these topics did not cause any material changes to our disclosures in our consolidated financial statements.

and furniture, fixtures and equipment that we intend to sell to SNH as permitted by our leases. 

 4. Financial Data by Segment 

Our reportable segments consist of our senior living community business and our rehabilitation hospital business. In the senior living community segment, we operate independent living or
congregate care communities, assisted living communities and SNFs, which all operate under a similar regulatory environment, are subject to centralized oversight functions and service a similar
resident and customer base. Our rehabilitation hospital segment provides inpatient rehabilitation services at two hospital locations and three satellite locations and outpatient rehabilitation
services at 13 affiliated outpatient clinics. We do not consider our institutional pharmacy operations to be a material, separately reportable segment of our business but we report our institutional
pharmacy revenues and expenses as separate items within our corporate and other activities. All of our operations and assets are located in the United States, except for our two captive insurance
companies, which participate in our workers' compensation and liability insurance programs and are located in the Cayman Islands.

16,182 

(1) Intangible
assets in our senior living communities relate to management agreements and trademarks we acquired in connection with one of the leases we
initiated with SNH in 2009.
 (2) Intangible
assets in our corporate and other segment relate to customer agreements we acquired with our pharmacy acquisitions. 

Goodwill. During 2008, we concluded that goodwill recorded at our pharmacies was fully impaired and we recognized a non-cash impairment
charge of 5,930 to eliminate all goodwill from our pharmacy business. During the fourth quarter of 2008 our market capitalization declined and was significantly below the then current book value. As
a result, we determined an interim impairment test was necessary and performed the interim test on all of our reporting units as of December 31, 2008. In our evaluation we weighed all known
quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if an impairment occurred and determined no additional impairment charge was warranted on our senior living community segment. In addition, during
2008 we wrote off 785 related to the reduction of an unrecognized tax benefit to state income taxes payable. During our 2009 annual goodwill impairment review, we determined no impairment charges
were appropriate. 

 Intangible and other long lived assets. We amortize intangible assets using the straight line method over the useful lives of the
assets commencing
on the date of acquisition. Total amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was 405, 449 and 478, respectively. At
December 31, 2009, the weighted average amortization period remaining is approximately 13 years. Amortization expense is estimated to be approximately 451 in each of 2010, 2011, 2012,
2013 and 2014.

 5. Goodwill, Other Intangible and Long Lived Assets (Continued) 

 During
2008, we recorded an impairment of 1,837 resulting from long lived assets at our two rehabilitation hospitals. The impairment charge relating to these long lived assets was
measured based upon the difference between projected undiscounted future operating cash flows and carrying value. 

 6. Income Taxes 

Because we have historically reported losses, we do not currently recognize the benefit of all of our deferred tax assets, including tax loss carry forwards that may be used to offset
future taxable income. We will, however, continue to assess our ability to generate sufficient taxable income during future periods in which our deferred tax assets may be realized. When we believe
that we will more likely than not realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets, we will record deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations, which will
affect our results of operations. As of December 31, 2009, our federal net operating loss carry forward was approximately 117,602. Our net operating loss carry forwards, which begin to expire
in 2023 if unused, are subject to audit and adjustments by the Internal Revenue Service. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, are
as follows:

attributable to the gain on extinguishment of debt, each payable without regard to our tax loss carry forwards. Tax expense

7. Earnings Per Share 

Basic EPS for year ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted EPS for the period ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 reflects additional common shares, related to the Notes, that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any
adjustment to income applicable to common shareholders that would result from their assumed issuance. The weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate basic and diluted EPS include
approximately 463,130 and 390,140 unvested shares as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, issued to officers and others under our 2001 Stock Option and Stock Incentive Plan.

(1) Long
lived assets held for sale consist of property and equipment we expect to sell to SNH as permitted by our leases. We determined that these asset costs
approximate fair value since we have either recently acquired the assets or the assets are part of ongoing construction projects and we expect to sell these assets to SNH at their recorded value.
 (2) Our
investments in trading securities consist of our ARS, which are primarily bonds issued by various entities to fund student loans pursuant to the Federal
Family Education Loan Program. Due to events in the credit markets, auctions for our ARS failed starting in the first quarter of 2008 and there is currently no market, or a very illiquid market, in
which we might sell these securities. Due to the changes in fair value for our ARS for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recorded an unrealized gain of 3,495 and an unrealized loss
of 11,967, respectively. We have entered a settlement agreement with UBS related to our investment in ARS. Pursuant to this agreement we have the right, or the UBS Put Right, to require UBS to
acquire our ARS at par value on June 30, 2010. In June 2009, we reclassified our ARS from non-current to current investments due to our expectation of exercising the UBS Put Right
on June 30, 2010.
 (3) We
valued the UBS Put Right by taking into consideration the fair value of our ARS, the amounts outstanding on our loan with UBS and a factor representing
our credit party risk with UBS. The largest risk associated with the UBS Put Right is the continued financial solvency of UBS. The value of the UBS Put Right typically fluctuates inversely with the
value of the ARS that we hold. The increase in value of our ARS for the year ended December 31, 2009 caused an unrealized loss of 2,759 in the value of the UBS Put Right and the decrease in
value for the year ended December 31, 2008 caused an unrealized gain of 11,081 in the value of the UBS Put Right. We elected the fair value option since we expect that, other than changes in
UBS' credit default swap rate and our borrowings on the UBS line, the changes in fair value of the UBS Put Right will be offset by the fair value change in the ARS. In June 2009, we reclassified the
UBS Put Right from non-current to current assets due to our expectation of exercising the UBS Put Right on June 30, 2010.
 (4) Investments
in available for sale securities consist primarily of preferred securities and are reported on our balance sheet as current investments in
available for sale securities of 9,084, current restricted investments of 2,207 and long term restricted investments of 5,889. These securities

are
carried at fair value utilizing quoted market prices with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income and have an amortized cost of 12,518 and 25,807 as of December 31,
2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received gross proceeds of 3,719 in connection with the sale of available for sale securities and
recorded a gross realized gain totaling 820 and a gross realized loss totaling 25. 

 When
a change in fair value of available for sale securities is deemed temporary, we record a corresponding credit or charge to other comprehensive income for any unrealized gains or losses. As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, these securities had unrealized gains of 4,701 and 92 and unrealized losses of 39 and 1,716, respectively. Unrealized gains earned on our available for sale
investments are recorded in other comprehensive income for the current period and will be recorded in the statement of operations when the investments are sold. At December 31, 2009, five of
the preferred securities we hold are in a loss position that has ranged from 18 to 51 months and have accumulated losses of 39. We consider these investments temporarily impaired since we
believe we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until recovery of their market value occurs.

(1) We
measured the fair value of these securities by reference to a statement provided by UBS that was calculated with the assistance of a valuation model.
This model considered, among other items, the collateral underlying the investments, the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the timing of expected future cash flows including possible refinancing
of the securities and a determination of the appropriate discount rate. The analysis also included a comparison, when possible, to observable market data of securities with characteristics similar to
our ARS. We reviewed the components of, and calculations made under, UBS's model.
 (2) The
carrying value of our restricted cash and investments and our mortgage notes payable approximates its fair value.
 (3) We
measured the fair value of our equity investment in AIC (as defined below) by considering, among other things, the individual assets and liabilities held
by AIC, AIC's overall financial condition and earning trends, and the financial condition and prospects for the insurance industry generally.
 (4) We
have accounted for the UBS Put Right as a freestanding economic hedge for a financial asset (our investments in ARS) and elected to carry it at its
estimated fair market value.
 (5) The
carrying value of our UBS secured revolving credit facility approximates fair value.
 (6) We
estimate the fair value of our convertible senior notes using quoted market data for these securities.

9. Indebtedness 

We have a 40,000 revolving line of credit. Our revolving line of credit is available for acquisitions, working capital and general business purposes and is scheduled to expire in May
2010. The amount we are able to borrow at any time is subject to limitation based upon qualifying collateral. We are the borrower under this revolving line of credit and certain of our subsidiaries
guarantee our obligations under the facility, which is secured by our and our guarantor subsidiaries' accounts receivable, deposit accounts and related assets. We borrow in U.S. dollars and borrowings
under our revolving line of credit bear interest at LIBOR plus a premium. The facility contains covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios, places limits on our ability to incur or
assume debt or create liens with respect to certain of our properties and has other customary provisions. In certain circumstances and subject to available collateral and lender approvals, the maximum
amount which we may borrow under this credit facility may be increased to 80,000. As of December 31, 2009 and February 19, 2010, no amounts were outstanding and 40,000 was available
under this line of credit. As of December 31, 2009 and February 19, 2010, we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under this revolving line of credit. Interest
expense and other associated costs related to this facility were 340, 205 and 388 for the year ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 

 Pursuant
to our settlement agreement with UBS, we have a non-recourse credit facility with UBS which is available for acquisitions, working capital and general business
purposes. The amount we are able to borrow at any time is 75 of the market value of the ARS which are collateral for the loan. Such amount may vary over time. The interest rate under our credit
facility will also vary depending on the interest payable to us on the ARS, but will not exceed LIBOR plus 125 basis points. In June 2009, we reclassified our ARS from non-current to
current investments since we expect to exercise our put right with UBS within one year. As a result, in June 2009, we also reclassified our outstanding borrowings from long term to current as the loan
must be repaid with the proceeds from the exercise of the UBS Put Right. As of December 31, 2009 and February 19, 2010, we had 39,141 outstanding under this credit facility and
approximately 10,330 remained available to borrow. As of December 31, 2009 and February 19, 2010, we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under this revolving
credit facility. Interest expense and other associated costs related to this facility were 551 and 75 for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 

 At
December 31, 2009, we have nine irrevocable standby letters of credit totaling 5,127. Two of the letters of credit totaling 4,000, provide security for our
self-insured workers'
compensation and professional liability programs and the remaining seven letters of credit totaling 1,127 are security for our four properties leased from HCPI, two of our properties encumbered by
United States Department of Housing (described below), an automobile leasing company and a utility company that provides services to one of our senior living communities. Eight of the letters of
credit are renewed annually and one is renewed quarterly. Maturity dates for these letters of credit range from March 2010 to September 2010. 

 In
October 2006, we issued 126,500 principal amount of Notes. Our net proceeds from this issuance were approximately 122,600. These Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.75 per annum,
payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year. These Notes are convertible into our common shares at any time. The initial conversion rate, which
is subject to adjustment, is 76.9231 common shares per 1 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of 13.00 per share. The Notes are guaranteed by certain of our wholly
owned subsidiaries. These

Notes
mature on October 15, 2026. We may prepay the Notes at any time after October 20, 2011 and the Note holders may require that we purchase all or a portion of these Notes on each of
October 15 of 2013, 2016 and 2021. If a "fundamental change", as defined in the indenture governing the Notes, occurs, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of
their Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest and, in certain circumstances, plus a make whole
premium as defined in the indenture governing the Notes. Interest expense and other associated costs related to the Notes was 2,673 and 4,980 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. We issued these Notes pursuant to an indenture which contains various customary covenants. As of December 31, 2009 and February 19, 2010, we believe we are in compliance
with all applicable covenants of this indenture. 

 During
the year ended December 31, 2009, we retired 76,793 par value of our outstanding Notes that we had purchased for 39,932, plus accrued interest. We funded these purchases
primarily from cash generated by our operations, borrowings under our UBS credit facility and cash received in connection with the lease realignment agreement, or the Lease Realignment Agreement, we
entered into with SNH in August 2009 (see Note 15). As a result of these purchases we recorded a 34,579 gain, net of related unamortized costs, on early extinguishment of debt. 

 At
December 31, 2009, three of our communities were encumbered by United States Department of Housing, or HUD, insured mortgage debts and contain standard HUD mortgage covenants.

In
April 2007, we acquired a 48 unit assisted living community located in Tennessee for 5,025. We financed the acquisition by assuming a 4,559 non-recourse HUD insured
mortgage and paying the balance of the purchase price with cash on hand. 

 In
2007, we prepaid seven mortgages that were secured by six of our senior living communities. We paid 28,867 to retire these seven mortgages, which consisted of approximately 28,027
in principal and interest and 840 in prepayment penalties. Because we had carried these mortgages at a premium to their face value, we recognized a net gain of 4,491 in connection with the early
extinguishment of debt. 

 In
September 2008, we prepaid two HUD insured mortgages that were secured by one of our senior living communities. We paid 2,393 in principal and interest to retire these two mortgages,
and no prepayment penalty was required. Because we had recorded these mortgages at a premium to their face value under applicable accounting rules, we recognized a net gain of 743 in connection with
this early extinguishment of debt.

 Mortgage
interest expense, net of premium amortization, was 802 and 1,077 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our mortgages require monthly payments
into escrows for taxes, insurance and property replacement funds; withdrawals from these escrows require HUD approval.

10. Leases 

Of our 217 senior living communities we operated on December 31, 2009 we leased 188 senior living communities, as well as two rehabilitation hospitals and two senior living
communities that we report as discontinued operations, under four non-cancelable leases with SNH, and leased four communities under a lease with HCPI. These leases are
"triple-net" leases which require that we pay for all costs incurred in the operation of the communities, including the cost of insurance and real estate taxes; maintaining the
communities; and indemnifying the landlord for any liability which may arise from its ownership during the lease term. 

 Our
leases with SNH require us to pay percentage rent at 183 of the 190 senior living communities we lease from SNH (including the two assisted living communities we lease from SNH which
have been classified as discontinued operations) equal to 4 of the amount by which gross revenues, as defined in our leases, exceeds gross revenues in a base year. We paid approximately 3,368 and
 3,279 in percentage rent to SNH for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 

SNH
may fund amounts that we request for renovations and improvements to communities and hospitals we lease from SNH in return for rent increases according to formulas in the leases. In
2009 and 2008, SNH funded 36,701 and 69,420, respectively, for renovations and improvements to some of our communities and hospitals.

 11. Shareholders' Equity 

We issued 263,210 and 387,460 common shares in 2009 and 2008, respectively, to our directors, officers and others who provide services to us. We valued the shares at the average price of
our common shares on the NYSE Amex on the dates of issue, or 8.08 in 2009, based on an 2.99 weighted average share price and 5.96 in 2008, based on an 1.53 weighted average share price,
respectively. Shares issued to directors vest immediately; shares issued to our officers and others vest over five years and we recognize the cost ratably over the vesting period. As of
December 31, 2009, 1,859 of our common shares remain available for issuance under our 2001 Stock Option and Stock Incentive Plan. 

 12. Acquisitions 

In July 2008, we acquired three assisted living communities from SNH with 278 units located in Pennsylvania and New Jersey for a purchase price of 21,350. We financed this acquisition
with cash on hand. We allocated the purchase price of these communities to land, building and equipment. 

 In
December 2008, we acquired seven independent and assisted living communities, with a total of 628 living units, located in North Carolina (four communities) and South Carolina (three
communities) for a purchase price of 44,000 plus closing costs. We financed the acquisition with cash on hand and drawings under our UBS credit facility. We allocated the purchase price of these
communities to land, building and equipment. 

 In
connection with one of the leases we initiated in 2008, we also acquired from the prior owner of the communities its ownership interest in certain operating companies, working
capital, certain long term liabilities, and operating practices and processes, especially in the memory care area. We accounted for this transaction as a business combination and, after allocating the
purchase price to applicable assets and liabilities based on their fair value, recorded as goodwill the 996 excess of the consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets. 

 In
connection with one of the leases we initiated with SNH in 2009, we also acquired from the prior owner of the communities its ownership interest in certain management agreements,
trademarks and
working capital for 750. We accounted for this transaction as a business combination and, after allocating the purchase price to applicable assets and liabilities based on their fair value, recorded
as goodwill the 15 excess of the consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets. 

 13. Discontinued Operations 

In March 2007, we agreed with SNH that it should sell two assisted living communities in Pennsylvania, which we lease from SNH. We and SNH are in the process of selling these assisted
living communities and, if and when they are sold, our annual minimum rent payable to SNH will decrease by 9.0 of the net proceeds of the sale to SNH, in accordance with the terms of our lease with
SNH. 

 In
December 2007, we decided to sell one institutional pharmacy located in California and our mail order pharmacy located in Nebraska. We sold the institutional pharmacy in two separate
transactions in 2009, which resulted in a gain on sale of 1,226. We were unable to sell the mail order pharmacy on acceptable terms and we ceased its operations on March 31, 2009. 

 During
2009, with our approval, SNH sold two SNFs, which we lease from SNH. On October 1, 2009, SNH sold a SNF located in Iowa to an unaffiliated party for net proceeds of
approximately 473

and
our rent payable to SNH under Lease No. 1 decreased by approximately 47. On November 1, 2009, SNH sold a SNF located in Missouri to an unaffiliated party for net proceeds of
approximately 1,247 and our rent payable to SNH under Lease No. 2 decreased by approximately 125. 

 As
of December 31, 2009, we had disposed of substantially all of our assets and liabilities related to the assisted living communities which we expect to sell and the two SNFs
which were sold during 2009. We have reclassified the consolidated statement of income for all periods presented to show the results of
operations of the communities and pharmacies which have been sold or are expected to be sold as discontinued. Below is a summary of the operating results of these discontinued operations included in
the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

14. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement 

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no off balance sheet arrangements, commercial paper, derivatives, swaps, hedges, third party guarantees, material joint ventures or
partnerships, except for the pledge of certain of our assets to secure SNH's borrowings from FNMA pursuant to the Lease Realignment Agreement described in Note 15. 

15. Related Person Transactions 

We were a 100 owned subsidiary of SNH until December 31, 2001. On December 31, 2001, SNH distributed substantially all of our then outstanding shares to its shareholders.
At the time of our spin off, all of the persons serving as our directors were trustees of SNH. In order to effect this spin off and to govern relations after the spin off, we entered into agreements
with SNH and others. Since then we have entered into various leases and other agreements which confirm and modify these undertakings. Among other matters, these agreements provide
that: 

so long as SNH remains a real estate investment trust, or a REIT, we may not waive the share ownership restrictions in our
charter on the ability of any person or group to acquire more than 9.8 of any class of our equity shares without the consent of SNH; 
 so long as we are a tenant of SNH, we will not permit nor take any action that, in the reasonable judgment of SNH, might
jeopardize the tax status of SNH as a REIT; 
 SNH has the option to cancel all of our rights under the leases we have with SNH upon the acquisition by a person or group
of more than 9.8 of our voting stock and upon other change in control events affecting us, as defined in those documents including the adoption of any shareholder proposal (other than a precatory
proposal) or the election to our board of directors of any individual if such proposal or individual was not approved, nominated or appointed, as the case may be, by vote of a majority of our
directors in office immediately prior to the making of such proposal or the nomination or appointment of such individual;

the resolution of certain disputes, claims and controversies arising from our leases with SNH may be referred to binding
arbitration proceedings; and 
 so long as we have a business management agreement with Reit Management and Research, or RMR, we will not acquire or
finance any real estate without first giving SNH or any other publicly owned REIT or other entity managed by RMR, the opportunity to acquire or finance real estate investments of the type in which SNH
or any other publicly owned REIT or other entity managed by RMR, respectively, invests. 

SNH
is our largest landlord and beneficially owns more than 9 of our common shares. RMR provides management services to us and SNH. One of our Managing Directors, Barry Portnoy, is
currently a managing trustee of SNH. Because of these and other relationships, we and SNH may be considered related persons. As of December 31 2009, we leased 190 of our 219 senior living
communities, including two that we report as discontinued operations, and two rehabilitation hospitals from SNH. Under our leases with SNH, we pay SNH rent based on minimum annual rent plus percentage
rent based on increases in gross revenues at certain properties. During 2009, our rent expense under our leases with SNH was 177,760, net of 900 amortization of a lease inducement from SNH. Our
total minimum annual rent payable to SNH under our leases with SNH as of December 31, 2009 was 184,370, excluding percentage rent based on increases in gross revenues at certain properties.
Additional information regarding our leases with SNH appears in Item 1 "Our SNH Leases" of this Annual Report. 

 Since
January 1, 2009, we have had several transactions with SNH, including: 

In August 2009, we entered into the Lease Realignment Agreement with SNH. The Lease Realignment Agreement was entered into
to assist SNH in obtaining mortgage financing, or the Loan, from the Federal National Mortgage Association, or FNMA, which is secured by 28 properties owned by SNH and leased to us, or the
Properties. The Properties consist of senior living communities with 5,618 living units located in 16 states. In connection with the Loan, we realigned our leases with SNH. Lease No. 1 expires
in 2024 and now includes 89 properties (including 10 communities acquired by SNH and excluding one community sold by SNH in the fourth quarter of 2009 and including two communities that we
report as discontinued operations), including independent living communities, assisted living communities and SNFs. Lease No. 2 expires in 2026 and now includes 49 properties (excluding one
community sold by SNH in the fourth quarter of 2009), including independent living communities, assisted living communities, SNFs and two rehabilitation hospitals. Lease No. 3 expires in 2028
and now includes the 28 Properties, including independent living communities and assisted living communities. Lease No. 4 expires in 2017 and now includes 26 properties (including one community
acquired by SNH in the fourth quarter of 2009), including independent living communities, assisted living communities and SNFs. In connection with the Lease Realignment Agreement and the Loan, we
reached an accommodation with SNH whereby we sold certain of our personal property at the Properties to SNH, we encumbered certain of our assets (e.g., accounts receivable) arising from our
operation of the Properties for the benefit of FNMA, we sold 3,200,000 of our common shares to SNH, we agreed to certain reporting and other operating obligations required by FNMA and we were
compensated by SNH by receiving a 2,000 annual rent reduction for the fixed term of Lease No. 2 and a cash payment of 18,600.

In
addition, SNH reimbursed us for out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and closing of the Loan. We also granted SNH certain registration rights with regard to our common
shares sold to SNH in connection with the Loan. 

We
allocated the cash payment from SNH pursuant to the Lease Realignment Agreement based on the fair value of assets conveyed or expenses reimbursed. We used our closing share price on the date of the
Lease Realignment Agreement to value the 3,200,000 common shares we issued to SNH. We used our net book value, which approximates its fair value as of the date of sale, to value the personal
property we sold to SNH. Accordingly, we allocated the 18,600 in proceeds from SNH as follows: 8,960 to issuance of common shares, 8,491 to the sale of personal property and 100 as reimbursement
of costs incurred. We recorded the remaining unallocated balance of 1,049 as an inducement in connection with Lease No. 3 and we are amortizing this amount over the term of that lease as a
reduction of rent expense. 

In October 2009, we commenced leasing from SNH a senior living community with a total of 259 independent, assisted living
and skilled nursing units which SNH purchased from an unrelated party, and we paid 750 for certain of the non-real estate assets. Our rent payable to SNH for this community is 1,779 per
year. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at this community, will commence in 2011. We added this community to Lease No. 4 with SNH, which has a current term expiring in 2017. 
 At our request, also in October 2009, SNH sold one SNF with a total of 62 beds, which we leased, to an unaffiliated party,
for net proceeds of approximately 473 and our annual rent payable to SNH under Lease No. 1 decreased by approximately 47. 
 At our request, in November 2009, SNH sold one SNF with a total of 74 beds, which we leased, to an unaffiliated party, for
net proceeds of approximately 1,247 and our annual rent payable to SNH under Lease No. 2 decreased by approximately 125. 
 Also in November 2009, we commenced leasing from SNH nine senior living communities with a total of 640 independent and
assisted living units which SNH purchased from an unrelated party. Our rent payable to SNH for these communities is 8,125 per year. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at these
communities, will commence in 2011. We added these communities to Lease No. 1 with SNH, which has a current term expiring in 2024. 
 In December 2009, we commenced leasing from SNH one senior living community with a total of 53 independent and assisted
living units which SNH purchased from an unrelated party. Our rent payable to SNH for this community is 436 per year. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at this community, will
commence in 2011. We added this community to Lease No. 1 with SNH, which has a current term expiring in 2024. 
 During 2009, pursuant to the terms of our leases with SNH, SNH purchased approximately 36,700 of improvements made to our
communities leased from SNH, and, as a result, the annual rent payable to SNH by us increased by approximately 2,945.

RMR
provides certain management, administrative and information system services to us under the business management agreement. The business management agreement provides for compensation
to RMR at an annual rate equal to 0.6 of our total revenues from all sources reportable under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Also, RMR is compensated at a rate equal
to 80 of the employment expenses of RMR's employees, other than its chief information officer, actively engaged in servicing management information systems. The business management agreement is
effective until December 31, 2010, and will be automatically renewed for successive one year terms thereafter unless we or RMR give notice of non-renewal before the end of an
applicable term. We or RMR may terminate the business management agreement upon 60 days prior written notice. RMR may also terminate the business management agreement upon five business days
notice if we undergo a change of control, as defined in the business management agreement. Our Board has given our compensation committee, which is comprised exclusively of our Independent Directors,
sole authority to act on our behalf with respect to this agreement. The charter of our compensation committee requires the committee to review, evaluate and approve the business management agreement
and evaluate RMR's performance under this agreement annually. Under the committee's charter, the committee must also annually evaluate and approve the compensation paid to RMR under the agreement. The
aggregate fees paid by us to RMR for management, administrative and information system services for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were 10,546, 8,336 and 6,052, respectively. We are generally responsible for
all of our expenses and certain expenses incurred by RMR on our behalf. 

 In
addition, RMR also provides the internal audit function for us and for other publicly owned companies to which it provides management services. Our audit committee appoints our
director of internal audit and our compensation committee approves his salary. Our compensation committee also approves the allocated costs we pay with respect to our internal audit function. Our pro
rata share of RMR's costs in providing that function was 220, 223 and 169 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The business management agreement also includes arbitration provisions for the
resolution of certain disputes, claims and controversies. A termination of our business management agreement is an event of default under our revolving credit facility, if not approved by a majority
of our lenders. 

 The
fact that RMR has responsibilities to other entities, including our largest landlord, SNH, could create conflicts; and in the event of such conflicts between SNH and us, our business
management agreement with RMR allows RMR to act on behalf of SNH rather than on our behalf. The business management agreement includes restrictions on our ability to invest in or finance any real
estate property of a type then owned or financed by a publicly owned entity managed by RMR. Under the
business management agreement, RMR has agreed not to provide business management services to any other business or enterprise, other than SNH, that is directly competitive with our business. 

 RMR
is beneficially owned by Barry Portnoy, one of our Managing Directors, and Adam Portnoy, his son, who is President and Chief Executive Officer and a director of RMR and a managing
trustee of SNH. Barry Portnoy and Gerard Martin, our Managing Directors, are directors of RMR. 

 Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are also officers and employees of RMR. These officers devote a substantial majority of their business time to our affairs and the
remainder to RMR's business which is separate from our business. We believe the compensation we paid to these officers reasonably reflects their division of business time; however, periodically, these
individuals may

divide
their business time differently than they do currently and their compensation from us may become disproportionate to this division. 

 An
affiliated entity of RMR is the owner of the buildings in which our corporate headquarters and administrative offices are located. We lease those buildings under leases that expire
in 2011. We incurred rent, which includes our proportional share of utilities and real estate taxes, under these leases during 2009, 2008 and 2007 of 1,143, 1,051 and 1,332, respectively.
These leases have been amended at various times to take into account our needs for increasing space. 

 One
of our hospitals' outpatient clinics leases space from HRPT Properties Trust, or HRP, a REIT managed by RMR. We incurred rent, which includes our proportional share of utilities and
real estate taxes, under this lease during 2009, 2008 and 2007 of 20, 58 and 53, respectively. 

 In
December 2006, we began leasing space for a regional office in Atlanta, Georgia from HRP. Our lease for this space expires in 2011. We incurred rent, which includes our proportional
share of utilities and real estate taxes, under this lease during 2009, 2008 and 2007 of 66, 60 and 61, respectively. 

 We
understand that the other companies to which RMR provides management services also have certain other relationships with each other, such as lease arrangements for properties. In
addition, officers of RMR serve as officers of those companies. We understand that further information regarding those relationships is provided in the applicable periodic reports and proxy statements
filed by those other companies with the SEC. In addition, our Independent Directors also serve as directors or trustees of certain of those other companies, and directors and trustees of certain of
those other companies serve as directors or trustees of the other companies. Mr. Barry Portnoy serves as a managing director or trustee of each of those other companies, including SNH. 

 We,
RMR and other companies to which RMR provides management services formed Affiliates Insurance Company, or AIC, which is an insurance company, in the State of Indiana in November
2008. AIC received its certificate of authority to transact insurance business in the State of Indiana from the Indiana Department of Insurance in May 2009. All of our Directors currently serve on the
board of directors of AIC. RMR, in addition to being a shareholder, entered a management agreement with AIC pursuant to which RMR provides AIC certain management and administrative services. In
addition, AIC entered an investment advisory agreement with RMR Advisors Inc., or RMR Advisors, pursuant to which RMR Advisors acts as AIC's investment advisor. The same persons who own and
control RMR, including Barry Portnoy, one of our Managing Directors, and Adam Portnoy, his son, own and control RMR Advisors. Our Governance Guidelines provide that any material transaction between us
and AIC shall be reviewed, authorized and approved or ratified by both the affirmative vote of a majority of our entire Board and the affirmative vote of a majority of our Independent Directors. As of
December 31, 2009, we have invested 5,134 in AIC. On December 16, 2009, Government Properties Income Trust, or GOV, purchased 20,000 shares of AIC from AIC, which represented a 14.29 
interest in AIC. In connection with that purchase by GOV, we, the other previous shareholders of AIC, AIC and GOV entered an amended and restated shareholders agreement. The amended and restated
shareholders agreement includes arbitration provisions for the resolution of certain disputes, claims and controversies. We and the other shareholders of AIC each currently own approximately 14.29 of
the common shares of AIC and our shares have a current carrying value of 5,000. We may invest additional amounts in AIC in the future if the expansion of

insurance business requires additional capital, but we are not obligated to do so. Over time we expect to obtain some or all of our insurance coverage from AIC. By participating in this insurance
business with RMR and the other companies to which RMR provides management services, we expect that we may benefit financially by possibly reducing insurance expenses and/or by realizing our
pro-rata share of any profits of this insurance business. All transactions between us and AIC have been approved pursuant to our Governance Guidelines. 

 Although
we own less than 20 of AIC, we use the equity method to account for our investment in AIC because we believe that we have significant influence over AIC since each of our
directors is a director of AIC and since we expect to procure some of our insurance from AIC. Under the equity method, we record our percentage share of net earnings from AIC in our consolidated
statement of income. If we determine there is an "other than temporary impairment" in the fair value of this investment, we would record a charge to earnings. In evaluating the fair value of this
investment, we have considered, among other things, the assets and liabilities held by AIC, AIC's overall financial condition and earning trends, and the financial condition and prospects for the
insurance industry generally. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we invested an additional 20 in order to fund our share of certain AIC formation and licensing costs. 

 16. Employee Benefit Plans 

We have several employee savings plans under the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. All our employees are eligible to participate in at least one of our
plans and are entitled upon termination or retirement to receive their vested portion of the plan assets. For some of our plans, we match a certain amount of employee contributions. We also pay
certain expenses related to all of our plans. Expenses for all our plans, including our contributions, were 1,235, 1,484 and 1,321 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT 

THIS
INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (this Agreement is made and entered March 10,
2004 (the Effective Date ), by and between Five Star Quality Care, Inc.,
a Maryland Corporation (the Company ), and Rosemary Esposito, R.N. Indemnitee ). 

WHEREAS
Indemnitee currently serves as an officer of the Company and may, in connection
therewith, be subjected to claims, suits or proceedings arising from such
service; and 

WHEREAS,
as an inducement to Indemnitee to continue to serve as such officer, the Company has agreed to
indemnify and to advance expenses and costs incurred by Indemnitee in
connection with any such claims, suits or proceedings, to the fullest extent
permitted by law as hereinafter provided; and 

NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein,
the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows: 

Section 1. Definitions . For purposes of this Agreement: 

(a) Change
in Control means a change in control of the Company occurring after the
Effective Date of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to
Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A (or in response to any
similar item on any similar schedule or form) promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Act ), whether or not the
Company is then subject to such reporting requirement; provided, however, that,
without limitation, such a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred
if after the Effective Date (i) any person (as such term is used in
Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Act) is or becomes the beneficial
owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Act), directly or indirectly,
of securities of the Company representing 10 or more of the combined voting power in the election of
directors of the Company s then outstanding securities without the prior
approval of at least two-thirds of the members of the Board of Directors in
office immediately prior to such person attaining such percentage interest; (ii) there
occurs a proxy contest, or the Company is a party to a merger, consolidation,
sale of assets, plan of liquidation or other reorganization not approved by at
least two-thirds of the members of the Board of Directors then in office, as a
consequence of which members of the Board of Directors in office immediately
prior to such transaction or event constitute less than a majority of the Board
of Directors thereafter; or (iii) during any period of two consecutive
years, other than as a result of an event described in clause (a)(ii) of
this Section 1 , individuals who at the beginning of such period
constituted the Board of Directors (including for this purpose any new director
whose election or nomination for election by the Company s stockholders was
approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office
who were directors at the beginning of such period) cease for any reason to
constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors.

preparing to be a witness in a Proceeding. 

(e) Independent
Counsel means a law firm, or a member of a law firm, that is retained by

other proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(including on appeal), except one initiated by an Indemnitee pursuant to Section 9 . 

Section 2. Indemnification
- - General . The Company shall
indemnify, and advance Expenses to, Indemnitee (a) as provided in this
Agreement and (b) otherwise to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland
law in effect on the date hereof and as amended from time to time; provided ,
 however , that no change in Maryland law shall have the effect of
reducing the benefits available to Indemnitee hereunder based on Maryland law
as in effect on the date hereof. The
rights of Indemnitee provided in this Section 2 shall include,
without limitation, the rights set forth in the other sections of this
Agreement, including any additional indemnification permitted by Section 2-418(g) of
the Maryland General Corporation Law MGCL ). 

Section 3. Proceedings
Other Than Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company . Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of
indemnification provided in this Section 3 if, by reason of his
Corporate Status, he is, or is threatened to be, made a party to any
threatened, pending, or completed Proceeding, other than a Proceeding by or in
the right of the Company. Pursuant to
this Section 3 , Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all
judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement and all Expenses
incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with a Proceeding by reason of
Indemnitee s Corporate Status unless it is established that (i) the act or
omission of Indemnitee was material to the matter giving rise to the Proceeding
and (a) was committed in bad faith or (b) was the result of active
and deliberate dishonesty, (ii) Indemnitee actually received an improper
personal benefit in money, property or services, or (iii) in the case of
any criminal Proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was unlawful. 

Section 4. Proceedings
by or in the Right of the Company . 
Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided
in this Section 4 if, by reason of his Corporate Status, he is, or
is threatened to be, made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in
its favor. Pursuant to this Section 4 ,
Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all amounts paid in settlement and all
Expenses incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such Proceeding
unless it is established that (i) the act or omission of Indemnitee was
material to the matter giving rise to such a Proceeding and (a) was
committed in bad faith or (b) was the result of active and 

2 

deliberate dishonesty or (ii) Indemnitee actually received an
improper personal benefit in money, property or services. 

Section 5. Indemnification
for Expenses of a Party Who is Partly Successful . Without limitation on Section 3 
and Section 4 , if Indemnitee is not wholly successful in any
Proceeding covered by this Agreement, but is successful, on the merits or
otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in
such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee under this Section 5 
for all Expenses incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with each
successfully resolved claim, issue or matter, allocated on a reasonable and
proportionate basis. For purposes of
this Section and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue
or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall
be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter. 

Section 6. Advance of Expenses . 
The Company shall advance all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of
Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is, or is
threatened to be, made a party or a witness, within ten days after the receipt
by the Company of a statement or statements from Indemnitee requesting such
advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final
disposition of such Proceeding. Such
statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by
Indemnitee and shall include or be preceded or accompanied by a written affirmation
by Indemnitee of Indemnitee s good faith belief that the standard of conduct
necessary for indemnification by the Company as authorized by law and by this
Agreement has been met and a written undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee,
in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A or in such
form as may be required under applicable law as in effect at the time of the
execution thereof, to reimburse the portion of any Expenses advanced to
Indemnitee relating to claims, issues or matters in the Proceeding as to which
it shall ultimately be established that the standard of conduct has not been
met and which have not been successfully resolved as described in Section 5 . To the extent that Expenses advanced to
Indemnitee do not relate to a specific claim, issue or matter in the Proceeding,
such Expenses shall be allocated on a reasonable and proportionate basis. The undertaking required by this Section 6 
shall be an unlimited general obligation by or on behalf of Indemnitee and
shall be accepted without reference to Indemnitee s financial ability to repay
such advanced Expenses and without any requirement to post security therefor. 

Section 7. Procedure for Determination of
Entitlement to Indemnification . 

(a) To
obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the
Company a written request, including such documentation and information as is
reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine
whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly
upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board of
Directors in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification. 

(b) Upon
written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to the first
sentence of Section 7(a) hereof, a determination, if required
by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement thereto shall
promptly be made in the specific case: (i) if a Change in Control shall
have occurred, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of 

3 

Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to
Indemnitee; or (ii) if a Change of Control shall not have occurred or if
after a Change of Control Indemnitee shall so request, (A) by the Board of
Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) by a majority vote of a
quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors (as herein defined), or (B) if
a quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of Disinterested Directors is not
obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so
directs, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors,
a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee, or (C) if so directed by
a majority of the members of the Board of Directors, by the stockholders of the
Company; and, if it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten days after such
determination. Indemnitee shall cooperate
with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to
Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such
person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or
information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and
which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such
determination. Any Expenses incurred by
Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination
shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to
Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification) and the Company shall indemnify
and hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom. 

Section 8. Presumptions and Effect of Certain
Proceedings . 

(a) In
making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification
hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall
presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if
Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 7(a) of
this Agreement, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that
presumption in connection with the making of any determination contrary to that
presumption. 

(b) The
termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, a
plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, or an entry of an
order of probation prior to judgment, does not create a presumption that
Indemnitee did not meet the requisite standard of conduct described herein for
indemnification. 

Section 9. Remedies of Indemnitee . 

(a) If
(i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 7 that
Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advance
of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 6 , (iii) no
determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant
to Section 7(b) within 30
days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment
of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 5 within ten
days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, or (v) payment
of indemnification is not made within ten days after a determination has been
made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, Indemnitee shall be
entitled to an adjudication in an appropriate court of the State of Maryland,
or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, of his entitlement to such
indemnification or advance of Expenses. 
Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his option, may seek an award in
arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the commercial 

4 

Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association. Indemnitee shall commence
such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within 180
days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence
such proceeding pursuant to this Section 9(a) ; provided , however ,
that the foregoing clause shall not apply in respect of a proceeding brought by
Indemnitee to enforce his rights under Section 5 . 

(b) In
any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 9 ,
the Company shall have the burden of proving that Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification or advance of Expenses, as the case may be. 

(c) If
a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 7(b) that
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such
determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to
this Section 9 , absent a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material
fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee s
statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for
indemnification. 

(d) In
the event that Indemnitee, pursuant to this Section 9 , seeks a
judicial adjudication of or an award in arbitration to enforce his rights
under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be
entitled to recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by the Company
for, any and all Expenses incurred by him in such judicial adjudication or
arbitration. If it shall be determined
in such judicial adjudication or arbitration that Indemnitee is entitled to
receive part but not all of the indemnification or advance of Expenses sought,
the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such judicial
adjudication or arbitration shall be appropriately prorated. 

Section 10. Defense of the Underlying Proceeding . 

(a) Indemnitee
shall notify the Company promptly upon being served with or receiving any
summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, information, notice,
request or other document relating to any Proceeding which may result in the
right to indemnification or the advance of Expenses hereunder; provided ,
 however , that the failure to give any such notice shall not disqualify
Indemnitee from the right, or otherwise affect in any manner any right of
Indemnitee, to indemnification or the advance of Expenses under this Agreement
unless the Company s ability to defend in such Proceeding or to obtain proceeds
under any insurance policy is materially and adversely prejudiced thereby, and
then only to the extent the Company is thereby actually so prejudiced. 

(b) Subject
to the provisions of the last sentence of this Section 10(b) and
of Section 10(c) below, the Company shall have the right to
defend Indemnitee in any Proceeding which may give rise to indemnification
hereunder; provided , however , that the Company shall notify
Indemnitee of any such decision to defend within 15 calendar days following
receipt of notice of any such Proceeding under Section 10(a) above. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, consent to the entry of any judgment against Indemnitee or enter into
any settlement or compromise which (i) includes an admission of fault of
Indemnitee or (ii) does not include, as an unconditional term thereof, the
full release of Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Proceeding,
which 

5 

release shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Indemnitee. This Section 10(b) shall
not apply to a Proceeding brought by Indemnitee under Section 9 
above or Section 14 . 

(c) Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 10(b) , if in a Proceeding to which
Indemnitee is a party by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, (i) Indemnitee
reasonably concludes, based upon an opinion of counsel approved by the Company,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, that he may have separate
defenses or counterclaims to assert with respect to any issue which may not be
consistent with other defendants in such Proceeding, (ii) Indemnitee
reasonably concludes, based upon an opinion of counsel approved by the Company,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, that an actual or apparent
conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest exists between
Indemnitee and the Company, or (iii) the Company fails to assume the
defense of such Proceeding in a timely manner, Indemnitee shall be entitled to
be represented by separate legal counsel of Indemnitee s choice, subject to the
prior approval of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, at the
expense of the Company. In addition, if
the Company fails to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or
in the event that the Company or any other person takes any action to declare
this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any Proceeding to deny or
to recover from Indemnitee the benefits intended to be provided to Indemnitee
hereunder, Indemnitee shall have the right to retain counsel of Indemnitee s
choice, subject to the prior approval of the Company, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, at the expense of the Company (subject to Section 9(d)) ,
to represent Indemnitee in connection with any such matter. 

Section 11. Non-Exclusivity; Survival of Rights . 

(a) The
rights of indemnification and advance of Expenses as provided by this Agreement
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at
any time be entitled under applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation or
Bylaws of the Company, any agreement or a resolution of the stockholders
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or of the Board of
Directors, or otherwise. No amendment,
alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit
or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action
taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his Corporate Status prior to such
amendment, alteration or repeal. 

(b) In
the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated
to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee,
who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure
such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable
the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights. 

(c) The
Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts
otherwise indemnifiable hereunder if and to the extent that Indemnitee has
otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract,
agreement or otherwise. 

Section 12. Duration of Agreement; Binding Effect . 

(a) This
Agreement shall continue until and terminate ten years after the date that
Indemnitee shall have ceased to serve as a director, trustee, officer,
employee, or agent of the 

6 

Company or of any other corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise which
Indemnitee served at the request of the Company; provided , however ,
that the rights of Indemnitee hereunder shall continue until the final
termination of any Proceeding then pending in respect of which Indemnitee is
granted rights of indemnification or advance of Expenses hereunder and of any
proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 9 relating
thereto. 

(b) The
indemnification and advance of Expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to,
this Agreement shall be binding upon and be enforceable by the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns (including any direct or indirect
successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or
substantially all of the business or assets of the Company), shall continue as
to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, trustee, officer, employee or
agent of the Company or of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise which such person is or was
serving at the written request of the Company, and shall inure to the benefit
of Indemnitee and his or her spouse, assigns, heirs, devisees, executors and
administrators and other legal representatives. 

(c) The
Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by
purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all, substantially all or a
substantial part, of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written
agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Indemnitee, expressly to assume
and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent
that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken
place. 

Section 13. Severability . 
If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any section of
this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent
possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each
portion of any section of this Agreement containing any such provision
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent
manifested thereby. 

Section 14. Limitation and Exception to Right of
Indemnification or Advance of Expenses . 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (a) any
indemnification or advance of Expenses to which Indemnitee is otherwise
entitled under the terms of this Agreement shall be made only to the extent
such indemnification or advance of Expenses does not conflict with applicable
Maryland law and (b) Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification
or advance of Expenses under this Agreement with respect to any Proceeding
brought by Indemnitee, unless (i) the Proceeding is brought to enforce
indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise or (ii) the Company s
Bylaws, as amended, the Articles of Incorporation, a resolution of the
stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or of the
Board of Directors or an agreement approved by the Board of Directors to which
the Company is a party expressly provide otherwise. 

7 

Section 15. Counterparts . 
This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of

of Control . Any Shareholder whose
Shares would be subject to an Existing Pledge shall use best efforts to cause

(a) If, at any time after the date hereof, the Company wishes to
issue any capital stock of the Company or any other securities convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock of the Company (collectively, New
Securities to any person or entity (the Subject Purchaser ), then
the Company shall first offer the Appropriate Percentage (as defined herein) of
the New Securities (the Allocated Shares to each Shareholder (each, a
 Preemptive Rightholder and collectively, the Preemptive
Rightholders by sending written notice (the New Issuance Notice to each of the Preemptive Rightholders, which New Issuance Notice shall state
the terms of such proposed issuance, including the number of New Securities
proposed to be issued and the proposed purchase price per security of the New
Securities (the Proposed Price ). 
Upon delivery of the New Issuance Notice, such offer shall be
irrevocable unless and until the Company shall have terminated the contemplated
issuance of New Securities 

4 

in its entirety at which time the rights set forth herein
shall be applicable to any proposed issuance subsequent to any such
termination. For purposes of this Section 3.2,
 Appropriate Percentage shall mean that percentage of the New
Securities determined by dividing (i) the total number of Shares then
owned by a Preemptive Rightholder by (ii) the total number of Shares owned
by all the Preemptive Rightholders. 

(b) For a period of 20 days after the giving of the New Issuance
Notice pursuant to Section 3.2(a) (the Initial Preemptive
Subscription Period ), each of the Preemptive Rightholders shall have the
right to purchase, in whole or in part, the Allocated Shares offered to such
Preemptive Rightholder as determined pursuant to Section 3.2(a) at a
purchase price equal to the Proposed Price and upon the terms and conditions
set forth in the New Issuance Notice. 

(c) The right of each Preemptive Rightholder to purchase the New
Securities so offered under Section 3.2(b) shall be exercisable by
delivering written notice of the exercise thereof, prior to the expiration of
the Initial Preemptive Subscription Period, to the Company, which notice shall
state the amount of New Securities that such Preemptive Rightholder elects to
purchase pursuant to Section 3.2(a). 
The failure of a Preemptive Rightholder to respond prior to the
expiration of the Initial Preemptive Subscription Period shall be deemed to be
a waiver of such Preemptive Rightholder s rights under this Agreement solely
with respect to its right to purchase the New Securities referenced in the New
Issuance Notice; provided that each Preemptive Rightholder may waive its rights
under Section 3.2(b) prior to the expiration of Initial Preemptive
Subscription Period by giving written notice of such waiver to the Company. 

(d) If as of the expiration of the Initial Preemptive
Subscription Period, some but not all of the Preemptive Rightholders have
exercised their right to purchase the full amount of New Securities to which
they are entitled to purchase pursuant to Sections 3.2(b) and (c) (any
such Preemptive Rightholder which has exercised in full its rights to purchase
such New Securities, a Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder ), the
Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholders shall have the right to purchase, in
whole or in part, their Oversubscription Appropriate Percentage (as defined
herein) of the New Securities which the Preemptive Rightholders did not
exercise their right to purchase pursuant to Sections 3.2(b) and (c) (the
 Undersubscribed Shares at a purchase price equal to the Proposed
Price and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the New Issuance
Notice. The right of the Fully
Exercising Preemptive Rightholders to purchase the Undersubscribed Shares may
be exercised for a period of ten days following the earlier of the expiration
of the Initial Preemptive Subscription Period or the date on which notice is
given by the Company to such Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholders that all
the Preemptive Rightholders have either exercised their right to purchase the
New Securities pursuant to Sections 3.2(b) and (c) or waived their
rights to purchase any of such New Securities pursuant to Section 3.2(c) (the
 Oversubscription Period ). For
purposes of this Section 3.2, Oversubscription Appropriate Percentage 
shall mean that percentage of the Undersubscribed Shares determined by dividing
(i) the total number of Shares then owned by a Fully Exercising Preemptive
Rightholder by (ii) the total number of Shares owned by all the Fully
Exercising Preemptive Rightholders. 

(e) The right of each Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder to
purchase Undersubscribed Shares pursuant to Section 3.2(d) shall be
exercisable by delivering 

5 

written notice of the exercise thereof, prior to the
expiration of the Oversubscription Period, to the Company, which notice shall
state the amount of Undersubscribed Shares that such Fully Exercising
Preemptive Rightholder elects to purchase pursuant to Section 3.2(d). The failure of a Fully Exercising Preemptive
Rightholder to respond prior to the expiration of the Oversubscription Period
shall be deemed to be a waiver of such Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder s
rights under this Agreement solely with respect to its right to purchase the
Undersubscribed Shares included in the New Securities referenced in the New
Issuance Notice; provided that each Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder may
waive its rights under Section 3.2(d) prior to the expiration of
Oversubscription Period by giving written notice of such waiver to the Company. 

(f) The closing of the purchase of New Securities subscribed for
by the Preemptive Rightholders, including the Fully Exercising Preemptive
Rightholders, pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall be held at such time and
place as the parties to the transaction may reasonably agree. At such closing, the New Securities
subscribed for shall be issued by the Company free and clear of all liens,
charges or encumbrances (other than those arising hereunder and those
attributable to actions by the purchasers thereof). Each Preemptive Rightholder, including each
Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder, purchasing the New Securities shall
deliver at the closing payment in full in immediately available funds for the
New Securities purchased by it. At such
closing, all of the parties to the transaction shall execute such additional
documents as are otherwise necessary, appropriate or customary for similar
financing transactions. If any
Preemptive Rightholder, including any Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder,
fails to purchase any New Securities for which it exercised its right to
purchase pursuant to Sections 3.2(b) and (c) or 3.2(d) and (e),
such New Securities may be purchased by the Fully Exercising Preemptive
Rightholders which did purchase all the New Securities for which they exercised
their rights to purchase pursuant to Sections 3.2(b), (c), (d) and (e) in
the same manner provided in this Section 3.2 with respect to
Undersubscribed Shares and the resulting Oversubscription Period with respect
to such right to purchase shall be an Oversubscription Period for all
instances such term is used in this Section 3.2. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the
obligations and liability of any Preemptive Rightholder, including any Fully
Exercising Preemptive Rightholder, which fails to purchase any New Securities
for which it exercised its right to purchase pursuant to Sections 3.2(b) and
(c) or 3.2(d) and (e) shall not be relieved as a result of any
Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder s right to purchase, or any actual
purchase by any Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder of, any such New
Securities. 

(g) Following the expiration of the later of the Initial
Preemptive Subscription Period and, if applicable, the Oversubscription Period,
if the Preemptive Rightholders, including any Fully Exercising Preemptive
Rightholders, did not exercise their right to purchase any of the New
Securities, including the Undersubscribed Shares, which were originally the
subject of the New Issuance Notice, then the Company may sell the remaining New
Securities to the Subject Purchaser on terms and conditions that are no more
favorable to the Subject Purchaser than those set forth in the New Issuance
Notice; provided, however, that such sale is bona fide and made pursuant to a
contract entered into between the Company and the Subject Purchaser and that
such sale is consummated by not later than 90 days following the earlier to
occur of (i) receipt by the Company of written waivers pursuant to Section 3.2(c) from
all the Preemptive Rightholders of their rights to purchase the Appropriate
Percentage of New 

6 

Securities and, if applicable, written waivers pursuant to Section 3.2(e) from
all the Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholders of their rights to purchase
the Oversubscription Appropriate Percentage of New Securities, and (ii) the
expiration of the Oversubscription Period, if applicable, and if not
applicable, the expiration of the Initial Preemptive Subscription Period. If the sale of any of the New Securities is
not consummated by the expiration of such 90 day period, then the preemptive
rights afforded to the Shareholders under this Section 3.2 shall again
become effective, and no issuance and sale of New Securities may be made
thereafter by the Company without again offering the same in accordance with
this Section 3.2. 

3.3 Change of
Control Call Option . 

(a) By not later than five days following a Change of Control (as
defined herein or in Section 3.1(b)) of any Shareholder, such Shareholder
shall give the Company and each other Shareholder notice of such Change of
Control and shall disclose the number of Shares and any other securities of the
Company which were owned by the Shareholder as of immediately prior to such
Change of Control of such Shareholder (the Change of Control Securities ). If the Shareholder fails to give the notice
required by the preceding sentence by the time required thereby, and another Shareholder
or the Company is or becomes aware that such Shareholder underwent a Change of
Control, then (i) if it is a Shareholder that is or becomes aware of such
Change of Control, that Shareholder shall reasonably promptly inform the
Company of such Change of Control and upon the Company being of the reasonable
belief that such a Change of Control has occurred, the Company shall reasonably
promptly provide the notice to the Shareholders that such Shareholder which
underwent the Change of Control failed to provide, or (ii) if it is the
Company that is or becomes aware of such Change of Control, the Company shall
reasonably promptly provide the notice that such Shareholder which underwent
the Change of Control failed to provide. 
Any liability of a Shareholder which undergoes a Change of Control for
failure to give the notice required by the first sentence of this Section 3.3(a) shall
not be relieved as a result of the Company or any other Shareholder being
obligated to give, or giving, the notice required by the second sentence of
this Section 3.3(a). 

(b) For a period of 20 days following the receipt of a notice
given pursuant to Section 3.3(a), the Company shall have the right to
purchase from such Shareholder (or its successor, as applicable), in whole or
in part, the Change of Control Securities. 
The purchase price for the Change of Control Securities shall be the
book value, as determined in accordance with the statutory accounting
principles applicable to the Company, of the Change of Control Securities as of
the time such Shareholder underwent the Change of Control (the Call Option
Purchase Price ). To exercise its
right to purchase the Change of Control Securities, the Company shall deliver
written notice of such exercise to the Shareholder which underwent the Change
of Control and the other Shareholders prior to the expiration of such 20 day
call exercise period. The closing for
any such exercised call option shall occur on the fifth business day (or such
longer period as may be required by applicable law or in order to obtain
applicable regulatory approval) following receipt of the Company s notice of
exercise of its call option by the Shareholder which underwent the Change of
Control, or on such other date as may be agreed by the Company and such Shareholder. At its option, the Company may pay in cash
the entire amount of the Call Option Purchase Price at such closing or it may
elect to defer any amount of the Call Option Purchase Price. Any amounts so deferred shall bear interest
at the Deferred 

7 

Interest Rate (as defined herein). The Company may pay any such deferred amounts
and accrued interest thereon at any time and from time to time; provided,
however, that all such deferred amounts and accrued but unpaid interest, shall
be due and payable on the fifth anniversary of the closing of the applicable
call option exercise. 

(c) Shareholders other than the Shareholder which underwent the
Change of Control shall have the right to purchase, in whole or in part, any
Change of Control Securities not elected to be purchased by the Company
pursuant to Section 3.3(b) at a price equal to the Call Option
Purchase Price. To exercise its right to
purchase the Change of Control Securities, the applicable Shareholder shall
deliver written notice of such exercise to the Shareholder which underwent the
Change of Control, the Company and the other Shareholders by not later than the
20 days following the earlier of (i) the expiration of the 20 day period
during which the Company has the right to exercise its call option for the
Change of Control Securities pursuant to Section 3.3(b) and (ii) the
date the Company waives its right to purchase such Change of Control Securities
and has given notice of the same to all the Shareholders (such deadline for
exercising a right to purchase Change of Control Securities referred to as the Call
Option Exercise Deadline ). The
notice of exercise shall indicate the number of Change of Control Securities
that the Shareholder seeks to purchase. 
If the aggregate number of Change of Control Securities sought to be
purchased by the exercising Shareholders (determined by adding all the eligible
securities each Shareholder states it seeks to purchase in its notice of
exercise) exceeds the actual number of Change of Control Securities eligible
for purchase, the number of Change of Control Securities which may be purchased
by a particular applicable Shareholder shall be reduced by an amount equal to
the product of the aggregate number of such excess Change of Control Securities
sought to be purchased by all the exercising Shareholders multiplied by 
the quotient of (x) the number of Shares owned by all eligible
Shareholders which are exercising their call option rights minus the
number of Shares owned by the particular applicable exercising Shareholder divided
by (y) the number of Shares owned by all eligible Shareholders which
are exercising their call option rights, with any such result rounded up or
down to the nearest whole share as reasonably determined by the Company. The closing of any such exercised call option
shall occur on the fifth business day (or such longer period as may be required
by applicable law or in order to obtain applicable regulatory approval)
following the Call Option Exercise Deadline, or on such other date as may be
agreed by the exercising Shareholder, the Company and the Shareholder which
underwent the Change of Control. At its
option, the exercising Shareholder may pay in cash the entire amount of the
Call Option Purchase Price at such closing or it may elect to defer any amount
of the Call Option Purchase Price. Any
amounts so deferred shall bear interest at the Deferred Interest Rate. The exercising Shareholder may pay any such
deferred amounts and accrued interest thereon at any time and from time to
time; provided, however, that all such deferred amounts and accrued but unpaid
interest, shall be due and payable on the fifth anniversary of the closing of
the applicable call option exercise.

party involved in a Dispute shall bear its own costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees), and the arbitrators shall not render an award that would

respectively) shall bear the costs and expenses of its (or their) selected
arbitrator and the parties (or, if there are more than two parties to the
Dispute, all claimants, on the one hand, and all respondents, on the other
hand) shall equally bear the costs and expenses of the third appointed
arbitrator. 

(g) An Award shall be final and binding upon the parties thereto
and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy between such parties relating to the
Dispute, including any claims, counterclaims, issues or accounting presented to
the arbitrators. Judgment upon the Award
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no
application or appeal to any court of competent jurisdiction may be made in
connection with any question of law arising in the course of arbitration or
with respect to any award made except for actions relating to enforcement of
this agreement to arbitrate or any arbitral award issued hereunder and except
for actions seeking interim or other provisional relief in aid of arbitration
proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction. 

(h) Any monetary award shall be made and payable in U.S. dollars

Borrower Agreement 

BY SIGNING BELOW, THE BORROWER UNDERSTANDS,
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT: 

A. The
Borrower has received and read a copy of this Borrower Agreement, the attached
Credit Line Account Application and Agreement (including the Credit Line
Agreement following this Borrower Agreement) and the Loan Disclosure Statement
explaining the risk factors that the Borrower should consider before obtaining
a loan secured by the Borrower s securities account. The Borrower agrees to be bound by the terms
and conditions contained in the Credit Line Account Application and Agreement
(including the Credit Line Agreement following this Borrower Agreement) (which
terms and conditions are incorporated by reference). Capitalized terms used in this Borrower
Agreement have the meanings set forth in the Credit Line Agreement. 

B. THE
BORROWER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT UBS BANK USA MAY DEMAND FULL OR
PARTIAL PAYMENT OF THE CREDIT LINE OBLIGATIONS, AT ITS SOLE OPTION AND WITHOUT
CAUSE, AT ANY TIME, AND THAT NEITHER FIXED RATE ADVANCES NOR VARIABLE RATE
ADVANCES ARE EXTENDED FOR ANY SPECIFIC TERM OR DURATION. THE BORROWER
UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT ALL ADVANCES ARE SUBJECT TO COLLATERAL MAINTENANCE
REQUIREMENTS. THE BORROWER UNDERSTANDS THAT UBS BANK USA MAY, AT ANY TIME, IN
ITS DISCRETION, TERMINATE AND CANCEL THE CREDIT LINE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR
NOT AN EVENT HAS OCCURRED. 

C. UNLESS
DISCLOSED IN WRITING TO UBS BANK USA AT THE TIME OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND
APPROVED BY UBS BANK USA, THE BORROWER AGREES NOT TO USE THE PROCEEDS OF ANY
ADVANCE EITHER TO PURCHASE, CARRY OR TRADE IN SECURITIES OR TO REPAY ANY DEBT (I) USED
TO PURCHASE, CARRY OR TRADE IN SECURITIES OR (II) TO ANY AFFILIATE OF UBS
BANK USA. THE BORROWER WILL BE DEEMED TO REPEAT THIS AGREEMENT EACH TIME THE
BORROWER REQUESTS AN ADVANCE. 

D. THE BORROWER UNDERSTANDS THAT BORROWING USING SECURITIES AS
COLLATERAL ENTAILS RISKS. SHOULD THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES IN THE COLLATERAL
ACCOUNT DECLINE BELOW THE REQUIRED COLLATERAL MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS, UBS
BANK USA MAY REQUIRE THAT THE BORROWER POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL, REPAY PART OR
ALL OF THE BORROWER S LOAN AND/OR SELL THE BORROWER S SECURITIES. ANY REQUIRED
LIQUIDATIONS MAY INTERRUPT THE BORROWER S LONG-TERM INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
AND MAY RESULT IN ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES. 

E. Neither UBS Bank USA nor UBS Financial Services Inc. provides
legal or tax advice and nothing herein shall be construed as providing legal or
tax advice. 

F. Upon
execution of this Credit Line Account Application and Agreement, the Borrower
declares that all of the information requested in the Application and supplied
by the Borrower is true and accurate and further agrees to promptly notify UBS
Bank USA in writing of any material changes to any or all of the information
contained in the Application including information relating to the Borrower s
financial situation. 

G. Subject
to any applicable financial privacy laws and regulations, data regarding the
Borrower and the Borrower s securities accounts may be shared with UBS Bank USA
affiliates. Subject to any applicable financial privacy laws and regulations,
the Borrower requests that UBS Bank USA share such personal financial data with
non-affiliates of UBS Bank USA as is necessary or advisable to effect,
administer or enforce, or to service, process or maintain, all transactions and
accounts contemplated by this Agreement. 

H. The
Borrower authorizes UBS Bank USA and UBS Financial Services Inc. to obtain a
credit report or other credit references concerning the Borrower (including
making verbal or written inquiries concerning credit history) or to otherwise
verify on update credit information given to UBS Bank USA at any time. The
Borrower authorizes the release of this credit report or other credit
information to UBS Bank USA affiliates as it deems necessary or advisable to
effect, administer or enforce, or to service, process or maintain all
transactions and accounts contemplated by this Agreement, and for the purpose
of offering additional products, from time to time, to the Borrower. The
Borrower authorizes UBS Bank USA to exchange Borrower information with any
party it reasonably believes is conducting a legitimate credit inquiry in
accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. UBS Bank USA may also share
credit or other transactional experience with the Borrower s designated UBS
Financial Services Inc. Financial Advisor or other parties designated by the
Borrower. 

I. UBS
Bank USA is subject to examination by various federal, state and
self-regulatory organizations and the books and records maintained by UBS Bank
USA are subject to inspection and subpoena by these regulators and by federal,
state, and local law enforcement officials. The Borrower also acknowledges that
such regulators and officials may, pursuant to treaty or other arrangements, in
turn disclose such information to the officials or regulators of other
countries, and that U.S. courts may be required to compel UBS Bank USA to
disclose such information to the officials or regulators of other countries.
The Borrower agrees that UBS Bank USA may disclose to such regulators and
officials information about the Borrower and transactions in the credit line
account or other accounts at UBS Bank USA without notice to the Borrower. In
addition, UBS Bank USA may in the context of a private dispute be required by
subpoena or other judicial process to disclose information or produce
documentation related to the Borrower, the credit line account or other
accounts at UBS Bank USA. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that UBS Bank
USA reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to respond to subpoenas and
judicial process as it deems appropriate. 

J. To
help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify,
and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. When
the Borrower opens an account with UBS Bank USA, UBS Bank USA will ask for the
Borrower s name, address, and other information that will allow UBS Bank USA to
identify the Borrower. UBS Bank USA may also ask to see other identifying
documents. UBS Financial Services Inc. and UBS Bank USA are firmly committed to
compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including
those related to combating money laundering. The Borrower understands and
agrees that the Borrower must take all necessary steps to comply with the
anti-money laundering laws, rules and regulations of the Borrower s
country of origin, country of residence and the situs of the Borrower s
transaction. 

K. UBS
Bank USA and its affiliates will act as creditors and, accordingly, their
interests may be inconsistent with, and potentially adverse to, the Borrower s
interests. As a lender and consistent with normal lending practice, UBS Bank
USA may take any steps necessary to perfect its interest in the Credit Line,
issue a call for additional collateral or force the sale of the Borrower s
securities if the Borrower s actions or inactions call the Borrower s
creditworthiness into question. Neither UBS Bank USA nor UBS Financial Services
Inc. will act as Client s investment advisor with respect to any liquidation.
In fact UBS Bank USA will act as a creditor and UBS Financial Services Inc.
will act as a securities intermediary. 

L. The
Borrower understands that, if the Collateral Account is a managed account with
UBS Financial Services Inc., (i) in addition to any fees payable to UBS
Financial Services Inc. in connection with the Borrower s managed account,
interest will be payable to the Bank on an amount advanced to the Borrower in
connection with the Credit Line Account, and (ii) the performance of the
managed account might not exceed the managed account fees and the interest
expense payable to the Bank in which case the Borrower s overall rate of return
will be less than the costs associated with the managed account. 

M. UBS
Bank USA may provide copies of all credit line account statements to UBS
Financial Services Inc. and to any Guarantor. The Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that UBS Bank USA may share any and all information regarding the
Borrower and the Borrower s accounts at UBS Bank USA with UBS Financial
Services Inc. UBS Financial Services Inc. may provide copies of all statements
and confirmations concerning each Collateral Account to UBS Bank USA at such
times and in such manner as UBS Bank USA may request and may share with UBS
Bank USA any and all information regarding the Borrower and the Borrower s
accounts with UBS Financial Services Inc.

the initial Advance requested by the Borrower is made in the form of a check
drawn on the Credit Line that does not satisfy the initial Advance Requirement,
then, in addition to and not in limitation of the Bank s rights, remedies,
powers or privileges under this Agreement or applicable law, the Bank may, in
its sole and absolute discretion 

(i) pay
the check drawn by the Borrower if, prior to paying that check, the Bank makes
another Advance to the Borrower, which Advance shall he in an amount not less
than 25,001; or 

(ii) pay
the check drawn by the Borrower; or 

(iii) decline
to pay (bounce) the check.

If the Bank elects option (ii), no
interest shall accrue on the amount of the Advance made by paying the check,
and the amount of that Advance shall be due and payable to the Bank immediately
(with or without demand by the Bank). 

4) Interest 

a) Each
Fixed Rate Advance will bear interest at a fixed rate and for the Interest
Period each as specified in the related Advance Advice. The rate of interest
payable on each Fixed Rate Advance will be determined by adding a percentage
rate to the UBS Bank USA Fixed Funding Rate, as of the date that the fixed rate
is determined. 

b) Each
Variable Rate Advance under a Premier Credit Line will bear interest at a
variable rate equal to LIBOR, adjusted daily, plus the percentage rate that
(unless otherwise specified by the Bank in writing) is shown on Schedule I
below for the Approved Amount of the Credit Line. For Premier Credit Lines, the
rate of interest payable on Variable Rate Advances is subject to change without
notice in accordance with fluctuations in LIBOR and in the Approved Amount. On
each day that LIBOR changes or the Approved Amount crosses one of the
thresholds that is indicated on Schedule I (or that is otherwise specified by
the Bank in writing), the interest rate on all Variable Rate Advances will
change accordingly. 

c) Each
Variable Rate Advance under a Prime Credit Line will bear interest at a
variable rate equal to the Prime Rate, adjusted daily, plus the percentage rate
that (unless otherwise specified by the Bank in writing) is shown on the
attached Schedule II and that corresponds to the aggregate principal amount
outstanding under the Prime Credit Line on that day. For Prime Credit Lines,
the rate of interest payable on Variable Rate Advances is subject to change
without notice in accordance with fluctuations in the Prime Rate and in the
aggregate amount outstanding under the Prime Credit Line. On each date that the
Prime Rate changes or the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the
Prime Credit Line crosses one of the thresholds that is indicated on Schedule
II (or that is otherwise specified by the Bank in writing), the interest rate
on all Variable Rate Advances will change accordingly. 

5) Payments 

a) Each Fixed Rate Advance will be due and payable in full ON
DEMAND or, if not earlier demanded by the Bank, on the last day of the
applicable Interest Period. Any Fixed Rate Advance
as to which the Bank has not made a demand for payment and that is not paid in
full or renewed, which renewal is in the sole and absolute discretion of the
Bank, (pursuant to procedures as may be established by the Bank) as another
Fixed Rate Advance on or before the last day of its Interest Period, will be
automatically renewed on that date as a U.S. dollar denominated, Variable Rate
Advance in an amount (based, in the case of any conversion of a non-U.S. dollar
denominated Fixed Rate Advance, upon the applicable, spot currency exchange
rate as of the maturity date, as determined by the Bank) equal to the unpaid
principal balance of the Fixed Rate Advance plus any accrued but unpaid
interest on the Fixed Rate Advance, which Variable Rate Advance will then
accrue additional interest at a variable rate as provided in this Agreement. 

b) Each Variable Rate Advance will be due and payable ON DEMAND. 

c) The
Borrower promises to pay the outstanding principal amount of each Advance,
together with all accrued but unpaid interest on each Advance, any and all fees
or other charges payable in connection with each Advance, on the date the principal
amount becomes due (whether by reason of demand, the occurrence of a stated
maturity date, by reason of acceleration or otherwise). The Borrower further
promises to pay interest in respect of the unpaid principal balance of each
Advance from the date the Advance is made until it is paid in full. All
interest will be computed on the basis of the number of days elapsed and a
360-day year. Interest on each Advance will be payable in arrears as follows. 

(i) for
Fixed Rate Advances - on the last day of the Interest Period (or if the
Interest Period is longer than three months, on the last day of each three
month period following the date of the Advance) and on each date that all or
any portion of the principal amount of the Fixed Rate Advance becomes due or is
paid, and 

(ii) for
Variable Rate Advances - on the twenty-second day of each month other than
December, and on the thirty-first day of December, and on each date that all or
any portion of the principal amount of the Variable Rate Advance becomes due or
is paid 

To the extent permitted by law, and
without limiting any of the Bank s other rights and remedies under the
Agreement, interest charges on any Advance that are not paid when due will be
treated as principal and will accrue interest at a variable rate from the date
the payment of interest was due until it is repaid in full. 

d) All
payments of principal, interest or other amounts payable under this Agreement
will be made in immediately available funds and in the same currency in which
the Advance was made, which unless otherwise agreed by the Bank, will be U.S.
dollars. UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS International Inc., as applicable,
may act as collecting and servicing agent for the Bank for the Advances. All
payments will be made by wire transfer of funds to an account specified by the
Bank or by another method agreed upon by the Bank and the Borrower. Upon
receipt of all payments, the Bank will credit the same to the Credit Line
Account. The Bank shall apply the proceeds of any payments in the following
order, first to any Breakage Costs, Breakage Fee, other fees, costs of
collection and expenses, second to the outstanding principal amount of the
related Advance and third to accrued interest. 

e) All
payments must be made to the Bank free and clear of any and all present arid
future taxes (including withholding taxes), levies, imposts, duties,
deductions, fees, liabilities and similar charges other than those imposed on
the overall net income of the Bank. If so requested by the Bank, the Borrower
will deliver to the Bank the original or a certified copy of each receipt
evidencing payment of any taxes or, if no taxes are payable in respect of any
payment under this Agreement, a certificate from each appropriate taxing
authority, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance and from counsel
acceptable to the Bank in its sole and absolute discretion, in either case
stating that the payment is exempt from or not subject to taxes. If any taxes
or other charges are required to be withheld or deducted from any amount
payable by the Borrower under this Agreement, the amount payable will be
increased to the amount which, after deduction from the increased amount of all
taxes and other charges required to be withheld or deducted from the amount
payable, will yield to the Bank the amount stated to be payable under this
Agreement. If any of the taxes or charges are paid by the Bank, the Borrower
will reimburse the Bank on demand for the payments, together with all interest
and penalties that may be imposed by any governmental agency. None of the Bank,
UBS Financial Services Inc., UBS-I or their respective employees has provided
or will provide legal advice to the Borrower or any Loan Party regarding
compliance with (or the implications of the Credit Line and the related
guaranties and pledges under) the laws (including tax laws) of the jurisdiction
of the Borrower or any Loan Party or any other jurisdiction, The Borrower and
each Loan Party are and shall be solely responsible for, and the Bank shall
have no responsibility for, the compliance by the Loan Parties with any and all
reporting and other requirements arising under any applicable laws. 

f) In
no event will the total interest and fees, if any, charged under this Agreement
exceed the maximum interest rate or total fees permitted by law. In the event
any excess interest or fees are collected, the same will be refunded or
credited to the Borrower. If the amount of interest payable by the Borrower for
any period is reduced pursuant to this Section 5(f), the amount of
interest payable for each succeeding period will be increased to the maximum
rate permitted by law until the amount of the reduction has been received by
the Bank.

6) Prepayments;
Breakage Charges 

a) The
Borrower may repay any Variable Rate Advance at any time, in whole or in part,
without penalty. 

b) The
Borrower may repay any Fixed Rate Advance in whole. The Borrower may not repay
any Fixed Rate Advance in part. The Borrower agrees to reimburse the Bank,
immediately upon demand, for any loss or cost Breakage Costs that the Bank
notifies the Borrower has been incurred by the Bank as a result of (i) any
payment of the principal of a Fixed Rate Advance before the expiration of the
Interest Period for the Fixed Rate Advance (whether voluntarily, as a result of
acceleration, demand or otherwise), or (ii) the Customer s failure to take
any Fixed Rate Advance on the date agreed upon, including any loss or cost
(including loss of profit or margin) connected with the Bank s re-employment of
the amount so prepaid or of those funds acquired by the Bank to fund the
Advance not taken on the agreed upon date. 

Breakage Costs will be calculated by
determining the differential between the stated rate of interest (as determined
in accordance with Section 4(a) of the Agreement) for the Fixed Rate
Advance and prevailing UBS Bank USA Fixed funding Rate and multiplying the
differential by the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the Fixed Rate
Advance (or the principal amount of Fixed Rate Advance not taken by the
Borrower) multiplied by the actual number of days remaining in the Interest
Period for the Fixed Rate Advance (based upon a 360-day year). The Borrower
also agrees to promptly pay to the Bank an administrative fee Breakage Fee in connection with any permitted or required prepayment. The Breakage Fee will
be calculated by multiplying the outstanding principal amount of the Fixed Rate
Advance (or the principal amount of Fixed Rate Advance not taken by the
Borrower) by two basis points (0.02 (with a minimum Breakage Fee of 100,00),
Any written notice from the Bank as to the amount of the loss or cost will be
conclusive absent manifest error.

Credit Line Account Agreement; Suspension and Cancellation 

a) If
more than one Person is signing this Agreement as the Borrower , each party (a

liabilities between the parties. Except as provided below for the reinstatement
of a suspended or cancelled Credit Line, and unless otherwise agreed by the

receives it, and each Joint Borrower will continue to be responsible for paying
(i) the Credit Line Obligations as of the effective date of the notice,
and (ii) all Advances that any Joint Borrower has requested but that have
not yet become part of the Credit Line Obligations as of the effective date of

interest in the Collateral. All subsequent requests to reinstate credit
privileges must be signed by all Joint Borrowers comprising the Borrower,
including the Joint Borrower requesting the suspension of credit privileges.
Any reinstatement will be granted or denied in the sole and absolute discretion
of the Bank. 

c) All
Credit Line Obligations will become immediately due and payable in full as of
the effective date of any suspension or cancellation of the Credit Line. The
borrower will be responsible for the payment of all charges incurred on the

future. (i) each Collateral Account, (ii) any and all money, credit
balances, certificated and uncertificated securities, security entitlements,
commodity contracts, certificates of deposit, instruments, documents,
partnership interests, general intangibles, financial assets and other
investment property now or in the future credited to or carried, held or

all actions reasonably requested by the Bank to evidence, maintain and perfect
the Bank s first priority security interest in, and to enable the Bank to

the Pledgors, including but not limited to making, executing, recording and
delivering to the Bank (and authorizes the Bank to file, without the signature
of the Borrower and any Pledgor where permitted by applicable law) financing
statements and amendments thereto, control agreements, notices, assignments,
listings, powers, consents and other documents regarding the Collateral and the
Bank s security interest in the Collateral in such Jurisdiction and in a form
as the Bank reasonably may require. Each Loan Party irrevocably authorizes and
appoints each of the Bank and UBS Financial Services Inc., as collateral agent,
to act as their agent and attorney-in-fact to file any documents or to execute
any documents in their name, with or without designation of authority. Each
Loan Party acknowledges that it will be obligated in respect of the
documentation as if it had executed the documentation itself. 

c) The
Borrower (and, if applicable, any other Pledgor on the Collateral Account)
agrees to maintain in a Collateral Account, at all times, Collateral having an
aggregate lending value as specified by the Bank from time to time. 

d) The
Bank s sole duty for the custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of any
Collateral in its possession will be to deal with the Collateral in the same
manner as the Bank deals with similar property for its own account. The
Borrower (and, if applicable, any other Pledgor on the Collateral Account)
agrees that the Bank will have no responsibility to act on any notice of
corporate actions or events provided to holders of securities or other
investment property included in the Collateral. The Borrower (and, if
applicable, any other Pledgor on the Collateral Account) agrees to (i) notify
the Bank promptly upon receipt of any communication to holders of the investment
property disclosing or proposing any stock split, stock dividend, extraordinary
cash dividend, spin-off or other corporate action or event as a result of which
the Borrower or Pledgor would receive securities, cash (other than ordinary
cash dividends) or other assets in respect of the investment property, and (ii) immediately

be credited to a Collateral Account or deliver them to or as directed by the
Bank as additional Collateral.

Borrower (and, if applicable, any other Pledgor on the Collateral Account)
agrees that all principal, interest, dividends, distributions, premiums or
other income and other payments received by the Bank or credited to the
Collateral Account in respect of any Collateral may be held by the Bank as
additional Collateral or applied by the Bank to the Credit Line Obligations.
The Bank may create a security interest in any of the Collateral and may, at
any time and at its option, transfer any securities or other investment
property constituting Collateral to a securities account maintained in its name
or cause any Collateral Account to be redesignated or renamed in the name of
the Bank.

f) The
Borrower (and, if applicable, any other Pledgor on the Collateral Account)
agrees that if a Collateral Account has margin features, the margin features
will be removed by UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS International Inc., as
applicable, so long as there is no outstanding margin debit in the Collateral
Account. 

g) If
the Collateral Account permits cash withdrawals in the form of check writing,
access card charges, bill payment and/ or electronic funds transfer services
(for example, Resource Management Account , Business Services Account BSA ,
certain Basic Investment Accounts and certain accounts enrolled in UBS
Financial Services Inc. Investment Consulting Services programs), the Borrower
(and, if applicable, any other Pledgor on the Collateral Account) agrees that
the Withdrawal Limit for the Collateral Account, as described in the
documentation governing the account will be reduced on an ongoing basis so that
the aggregate lending value of the Collateral remaining in the Collateral
Account following the withdrawal may not be less than the amount required
pursuant to Section 8(c). 

h) In
addition to the Bank s security interest, the Borrower (and, if applicable, any
other Pledgor on the Collateral Account) agrees that the Bank will at all times
have a right to set off any or all of the Credit Line Obligations at or after
the time at which they become due, whether upon demand, at a stated maturity
date, by acceleration or otherwise, against all securities, cash, deposits or
other property in the possession of or at any time in any account maintained
with the Bank or any of its affiliates by or for the benefit of the Borrower,
whether carried individually or jointly with others. This right is in addition
to, and not in limitation of, any right the Bank may have at law or otherwise. 

i) The
Bank reserves the right to disapprove any Collateral and to require the
Borrower at any time to deposit into the Borrower s Collateral Account
additional Collateral in the amount as the Bank requests or to substitute new
or additional Collateral for any Collateral that has previously been deposited
in the Collateral Account. 

9) Control 

For the purpose of
giving the Bank control over each Collateral Account and in order to perfect
the Bank s security interests in the Collateral, the Borrower and each Pledgor
on the applicable Collateral Account consents to compliance by UBS Financial
Services Inc., UBS-1 or any other securities intermediary (in any case, the Securities
Intermediary maintaining a Collateral Account with entitlement orders and
instructions from the Bank (or from any assignee or successor of the Bank)
regarding the Collateral Account and any financial assets or other property
held therein without the further consent of the Borrower or any other Pledgor
on the applicable Collateral Account. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Borrower and each Pledger on the Collateral Account acknowledges. consents and
agrees that, pursuant to a control agreement entered into between the Bank and
the Securities Intermediary 

a) The
Securities Intermediary will comply with entitlement orders originated by the
Bank regarding any Collateral Account without further consent from the Borrower
or any Pledgor. The Securities Intermediary will treat all assets credited to a
Collateral Account, including money and credit balances, as financial assets
for purposes of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code. 

b) In
order to enable the Borrower and any Pledgor on the applicable Collateral
Account to trade financial assets that are from time to time credited to a
Collateral Account, the Securities Intermediary may comply with entitlement
orders originated by the Borrower or any Pledgor on the applicable Collateral
Account (or if so agreed by the Bank, by an investment adviser designated by
the Borrower or any Pledgor on the applicable Collateral Account and acceptable
to the Bank and the Securities Intermediary) regarding the Collateral Account,
but only until the time that the Bank notifies the Securities Intermediary,
that the Bank is asserting exclusive control over the Collateral Account. After
the Securities Intermediary has received a notice of exclusive control and has
had a reasonable opportunity to comply, it will no longer comply with
entitlement orders originated by the Borrower or any Pledgor (or by any
investment adviser designated by the Borrower or any Pledgor) concerning the
Collateral Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, and irrespective of
whether it has received any notice of exclusive control, the Securities
Intermediary will not comply with any entitlement order originated by the
Borrower or any Pledgor (or by any investment adviser designated by the
Borrower or any Pledgor) to withdraw any financial assets from a Collateral
Account or to pay any money, free credit balance or other amount owing on a
Collateral Account (other than cash withdrawals and payments not exceeding the Withdrawal
Limit as contemplated in Section 8 (g)) without the prior consent of the
Bank.

sole and absolute discretion, liquidate, withdraw or sell all or any part of

way for any adverse consequences (for tax effect or otherwise) resulting from

transacted or by private sale, and the Bank may be the purchaser at any public

customarily is sold on a recognized exchange or market may be sold without
providing any Loan Party with prior notice of the sale. Each Loan Party agrees
that, for all other Collateral, two calendar days notice to the Loan Party,
sent to its last address shown in the Bank s account records, will be deemed
reasonable notice of the time and place of any public sale or time after which
any private sale or other disposition of the Collateral may occur. Any amounts
due and not paid on any Advance following an Event will bear interest from the
day following the Event until fully paid at a rate per annum equal to the
interest rate applicable to the Advance immediately prior to the Event plus
2.00 . In addition to the Bank s rights under this Agreement, the Bank will
have the right to exercise any one or more of the rights and remedies of a
secured creditor under the Utah Uniform Commercial Code, as then in effect, or

absolute discretion and without cause, at any time, whether or not an Event has
occurred and is continuing. 

c) All
rights and remedies of the Bank under this Agreement are cumulative and are in
addition to all other rights and remedies that the Bank may have at law or
equity or under any other contract or other writing for the enforcement of the
security interest herein or the collection of any amount due under this
Agreement. 

d) Any
non-exercise of rights, remedies and powers by the Bank under this Agreement
and the other documents delivered in connection with this Agreement shall not

reserves its rights to invoke any of its rights, remedies and powers at any
time it may deem appropriate.

c) Neither
the Borrower nor any Pledgor on the Collateral Account has pledged or will
pledge the Collateral or grant a security interest in the Collateral to any
party other than the Bank or the Securities Intermediary, or has permitted or
will permit the Collateral to become subject to any liens or encumbrances (other
than those of the Bank and the Securities Intermediary), during the term of

d) No
Loan Party is in default under any material contract, judgment, decree or order

You are being asked to
guarantee this debt. Think carefully before you do. If the borrower doesn t pay
the debt, you will have to. Be sure you can afford to pay if you have to, and
that you want to accept this responsibility. 

You may have to pay to
the full amount of the debt if the borrower does not pay. You may also have to
pay late fees or collection costs, which increase this amount. 

The creditor can collect
this debt from you without first trying to collect from the borrower. The
creditor can use the same collection methods against you that can be used
against the borrower, such as suing you, garnishing your wages, etc. If this
debt is ever in default, that fact may become a part of your credit record. 

This notice is not the
contract that makes you liable for the debt.

2. The
Agreement is amended by adding the following as Section 3 e):

will not make an Advance against the ARS Collateral in amounts equal to the
fair market or par value of the ARS Collateral unless the Borrower arranges for

equal to the par value of the ARS Collateral, the Borrower has arranged for UBS
Financial Services Inc. to provide, directly or through a third party, the
pledge of additional collateral and/or assurances to the Bank so that the Bank
will consider making Advances from time to time in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and in amounts equal to, in the aggregate, the par value of the
ARS Collateral at the date of an Advance. In addition, the Borrower, the Bank
and UBS Financial Services Inc. acknowledge and agree that if (a) the Bank

 such third party to the Bank, then the Agreement shall not terminate
and the Bank shall automatically assign to UBS Financial Services Inc. and any
such third party, and UBS Financial Services Inc. and any such third party
shall automatically assume and be subrogated to, all of the Bank s rights,
claims and interest in and under the Agreement and this Addendum, including
without limitation, the security interest in the Collateral, including without
limitation the ARS Collateral, granted the Bank under the Agreement and this
Addendum (further including, without limitation, interest, dividends,
distributions, premiums, other income and payments received in respect of any
and all such Collateral) to the extent of the amount that the Bank has realized
on all or any part of the additional collateral and/or assurances pledged or
otherwise provided by UBS Financial Services and/or any such third party to the
Bank in order to effect the repayment of the Credit Line Obligations due to the
Bank under the Agreement. Upon such automatic assignment and subrogation, UBS
Financial Services Inc. and any such third party shall be entitled to directly

e) and Section 4 f): 

d) 

Notwithstanding
 anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and subject to the provisions of
 Sections 4 e) and f) of this Agreement, the interest rate charged on any and
 all outstanding Variable Rate Advances shall be the lesser of (i) the
 amount prescribed by Sections 4 a), b), or c) of this Agreement, as
 applicable, and (ii) the then applicable weighted average rate of
 interest or dividend rate paid to the Borrower by the issuer of the ARS Collateral. 

e) 

The Bank and the
 Borrower acknowledge and agree that the Bank shall be entitled to determine
 or adjust, at any time and from time to time, the interest rate payable by
 the Borrower to the Bank on all or any part of the outstanding Variable Rate
 Advances to reflect any changes in the composition of the ARS Collateral, to
 address any inability to determine interest rates, or for any other reason
 that, in the Bank s sole and absolute discretion, is necessary to give effect
 to the intent of the provisions of this Agreement, including, without
 limitation, this Section 4 (it being acknowledged and agreed that the
 provisions of this Section 4 are intended to cause the interest payable
 by the Borrower under this Agreement to equal the interest or dividend rate
 payable to the Borrower by the issuer of any ARS Collateral) and any and all
 such adjustments by the Bank hereunder shall be conclusive and binding on the
 Bank and the Borrower absent manifest error. 

f) 

If and to the extent that any or all of the ARS Collateral
 consists of Taxable Student Loan Auction Rate Securities, then
 notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, when calculating
 such weighted average interest rate, the interest rate paid to the Borrower
 with respect to such Taxable Student Loan Auction Rate Securities shall be
 deemed to be equal to (i) for the period from the date of this Addendum
 through and including January 21, 2009, the applicable coupon
 rate(s) and (ii) from January 22, 2009 and thereafter, the
 then applicable Taxable SLARC Maximum Auction Rate, for, and to the extent
 of, such Taxable Student Loan Auction Rate Securities. The Borrower will be
 charged interest on the Loan in months in which the Borrower does not receive
 interest on the Taxable Student Loan Auction Rate Securities. 

Payments 

4. The
Agreement is amended by adding the following as Section 5 g): 

The Borrower will make additional
payments Additional Payments as follows: 

The
proceeds of any liquidation, redemption, sale or other disposition of all or
part of the ARS Collateral will be automatically transferred to the Bank as
payments. The amount of these payments will be determined by the proceeds
received in the Collateral Account, and may be as much as the total Credit Line
Obligations. 

All
other interest, dividends, distributions, premiums, other income and payments
that are received in the Collateral Account in respect of any ARS Collateral
will be automatically transferred to the Bank as payments. These are referred
to as ARS Payments. The amount of each ARS Payment will vary, based on the
proceeds received in the Collateral Account. The Bank estimates that the ARS
Payments will range from zero to fifteen 15.00) dollars per month per 1,000
in par value of Pledged ARS. The Bank will notify the Borrower at least ten (10) days
in advance of any ARS Payment that falls outside of this range. If the Borrower
would prefer to have advance notice of each payment to be made to Advances, the
Borrower may cancel ARS Payments as described below. 

The
Borrower agrees that any cash, check or other deposit (other than a deposit of
securities) made to the Collateral Account is an individual authorization to
have such amount transferred to the Bank as a payment. The amount of each
payment is the amount of the deposit. 

Each Additional Payment will be applied,
as of the date received by the Bank, in the manner set forth in the last
sentence of Section 5 d). The Borrower acknowledges that neither the Bank
nor UBS Financial Services Inc. sets or arranges for any schedule of Additional
Payments. Instead, Additional Payments will be transferred automatically from
the Collateral Account whenever amounts are received in the Collateral Account,
generally on the second Business Day after receipt. 

The Borrower may elect to stop ARS
Payments at any time, and this election will cancel all ARS Payments that would
occur three (3) Business Days or more after the Bank receives such notice.
If the Borrower stops ARS Payments, the Borrower will continue to be obligated
to pay principal, interest, and other amounts pursuant to the Agreement. If the
Borrower elects to cancel ARS Payments, all other Additional Payments will be
cancelled. Cancelling ARS Payments and Additional Payments may result in higher
interest charges by the Bank because amounts received in the Collateral Account
will not be automatically transferred and credited. Any amounts received in the
Collateral Account will remain in the Collateral Account unless the Bank
permits you to withdraw all or part of such amounts. Your notice to cancel must
be sent to: Attention; Head of Credit Risk Monitoring, UBS Bank USA, 299 South
Main Street, Suite 2275, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111, or call (801)
741-0310. 

Important
Disclosure About Required Payments. 
If Additional Payments are sufficient to pay all accrued interest on Advances
on or before a due date, then the Borrower need not make an additional interest
payment. Excess Additional Payments will be applied against principal. However,
if Additional Payments are not sufficient to pay all accrued interest on
Advances on or before a due date, then the Bank may, in its sole discretion (1) capitalize
unpaid interest as an additional Advance, or (2) require the Borrower to
make payment of all accrued and unpaid interest. 

Remedies 

5. The
Agreement is amended by adding the following as Section 10 e): 

The Borrower agrees
that in the event the Bank determines to liquidate or sell any Collateral, the
Bank shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, have the right
to do so in any manner, including, without limitation, the sale of Collateral
individually or in a block, for cash or for credit, in a public or private
sale, with or without public notice, through the use of sealed bids or
otherwise, with the aid of any advisor or agent who may be an affiliate of the
Bank or in any other manner as the Bank in its sole discretion shall choose.
The Borrower acknowledges that the price the Bank obtains for Collateral in the
Bank s chosen method of sale may be lower than might be otherwise obtained in
another method of sale, and the Borrower hereby agrees that any such sale shall
not be considered to be not commercially reasonable solely because of such
lower price. The Borrower understands that there may not be a liquid market for
the Collateral and that, as a result, the price received for the Collateral
upon liquidation or sale by the Bank may be substantially less than the
Borrower paid for such Collateral or than the last market value available for
it, if any. The Borrower further agrees that any sale by the Bank shall not be
considered to be not commercially reasonable solely because there are few
(including only one) or no third parties who submit bids or otherwise offer to
buy the Collateral. The Borrower understands that the Bank s sale of any of the
Collateral may be subject to various state and federal property and/or
securities laws and regulations, and that compliance with such laws and
regulations may result in delays and/or a lower price being obtained for the
Collateral. The Borrower agrees that the Bank shall have the right to restrict
any prospective purchasers to those who, in the Bank s sole discretion, the
Bank deems to be qualified. The Borrower acknowledges that the Bank shall have
sole authority to determine, without limitation, the time, place, method of
advertisement and manner of sale and that the Bank may delay or adjourn any
such sale in its sole discretion. The Borrower expressly authorizes the Bank to
take any action with respect to the Collateral as the Bank deems necessary or
advisable to facilitate any liquidation or sale, and the Borrower agrees that
the Bank shall not be held liable for taking or failing to take any such
action, regardless if a greater price may have been obtained for the Collateral
if such action was or was not taken, as applicable. The Borrower hereby waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, any legal right of appraisal, notice,
valuation, stay, extension, moratorium or redemption that the Borrower would
otherwise have with respect to a sale of the Collateral. 

Representations, Warranties and Covenants by the Loan
Parties: 

6. The
Agreement is amended by adding the following as Section 11 g):

 are Credit Line Obligations outstanding under the Credit Line, then in
 connection with any ARS Collateral, if at any time any such ARS Collateral
 may be sold, exchanged, redeemed, transferred or otherwise conveyed by the
 Borrower for gross proceeds that are, in the aggregate, not less than the par
 value of such Auction Rate Securities to any party, including, without
 limitation, to UBS Financial Services Inc. and/or any of its affiliates (any
 such sale, exchange, redemption, transfer or conveyance referred to herein as
 an ARS Liquidation ), the Borrower agrees (i) to immediately effect
 such ARS Liquidation to the extent necessary to satisfy all Credit Line
 Obligations in full and (ii) that the proceeds of any such ARS
 Liquidation so effected shall be immediately and automatically used to pay
 down any and all such outstanding Credit Line Obligations to the extent of
 such proceeds. The Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees with the Bank and
 directs UBS Financial Services Inc. that to the extent permitted by
 applicable law, this Section 11 g) shall constitute an irrevocable
 instruction, direction and standing sell order to UBS Financial Services Inc.
 to effect an ARS Liquidation to the extent it is possible to do so at any
 time during the term of this Agreement. The Borrower further agrees with the
 Bank and UBS Financial Services Inc. to execute and deliver to the Bank
 and/or UBS Financial Services Inc. such further documents and agreements as
 may be necessary in the sole and absolute discretion of the Bank and/or UBS
 Financial Services Inc. to effect the foregoing irrevocable instruction,
 direction and standing sell order.
