Item 1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings. 
 On or about December 23, 2009, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle (the FHLB-Seattle filed a complaint in the Superior Court for the State of
Washington (case number 09-2-46348-4 SEA) against the depositor, Redwood Trust, Inc. Redwood Trust ), Morgan Stanley Co., and Morgan Stanley Capital I, Inc. (collectively, the FHLB-Seattle Defendants ), which alleged
that the FHLB-Seattle Defendants made false or misleading statements in offering materials for a mortgage pass-through certificate (the Seattle Certificate issued in the Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2005-4 securitization transaction (the
 2005-4 RMBS and purchased by the FHLB-Seattle. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the alleged misstatements concerned the (1) loan-to-value ratio of mortgage loans and the appraisals of the properties that secured loans supporting
the 2005-4 RMBS, (2) occupancy status of the properties, (3) standards used to underwrite the loans, and (4) ratings assigned to the Seattle Certificate. The FHLB-Seattle alleged claims under the Securities Act of Washington (Section 21.20.005, et
seq.) and sought to rescind the purchase of the Seattle Certificate and to collect interest on the original purchase price at the statutory interest rate of 8 per annum from the date of original purchase (net of interest received) as well as
attorneys fees and costs. The Seattle Certificate was issued with an original principal amount of approximately 133 million, and, at December 31, 2017, approximately 125 million of principal and 11 million of interest payments had been made
in respect of the Seattle Certificate. As of December 31, 2017, the Seattle Certificate had a remaining outstanding principal amount of approximately 8 million. The matter was subsequently resolved and the claims were dismissed by the FHLB-Seattle
as to all the FHLB-Seattle Defendants. At the time the Seattle Certificate was issued, the depositor and Redwood Trust agreed to indemnify the underwriters of the 2005-4 RMBS, which underwriters were named as defendants in the action, for certain
losses and expenses they might incur as a result of claims made against them relating to this RMBS, including, without limitation, certain legal expenses. Regardless of the resolution of this litigation, the depositor and Redwood Trust could incur a
loss as a result of these indemnities. On or about July 15, 2010, The Charles Schwab Corporation Schwab filed a complaint in the Superior
Court for the State of California in San Francisco (case number CGC-10-501610) against the depositor and 26 other defendants (collectively, the Schwab Defendants ), which alleged that the Schwab Defendants made false or misleading
statements in offering materials for various residential mortgage-backed securities sold or issued by the Schwab Defendants. Schwab alleged only a claim for negligent misrepresentation under California state law against the depositor and sought
unspecified damages and attorneys fees and costs from the depositor. Schwab claimed that the depositor made false or misleading statements in offering materials for a mortgage pass-through certificate (the Schwab Certificate issued in the 2005-4 RMBS and purchased by Schwab. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the misstatements for the 2005-4 RMBS concerned the (1) loan-to-value ratio of mortgage loans and the appraisals of the properties that secured loans
supporting the 2005-4 RMBS, (2) occupancy status of the properties, (3) standards used to underwrite the loans, and (4) ratings assigned to the Schwab Certificate. The Schwab Certificate was issued with an original principal amount of approximately
 15 million, and, at December 31, 2017, approximately 14 million of principal and 1 million of interest payments had been made in respect of the Schwab Certificate. As of December 31, 2017, the Schwab Certificate had a remaining outstanding
principal amount of approximately 1 million. At the time the Schwab Certificate was issued, the depositor and Redwood Trust agreed to indemnify the underwriters of the 2005-4 RMBS, which underwriters were also named as defendants in the action, for
certain losses and expenses they might incur as a result of claims made against them relating to this RMBS, including, without limitation, certain legal expenses. Regardless of the resolution of this litigation, the depositor and Redwood Trust could
incur a loss as a result of these indemnities. The business of the sponsor, the depositor, the seller and their affiliates has included, and continues to
include, activities relating to the acquisition and securitization of residential mortgage loans. In addition, the business of the sponsor has, in the past, included activities relating to the acquisition and securitization of debt obligations and
other assets through the issuance of collateralized debt obligations 

(commonly referred to as CDO transactions). Because of their involvement in the securitization and CDO businesses, the sponsor, the depositor, the seller and their affiliates could become the
subject of litigation relating to these businesses, including additional litigation of the type described above, and could also become the subject of governmental investigations, enforcement actions, or lawsuits and governmental authorities could
allege that these entities violated applicable law or regulation in the conduct of their business. As an example, in July 2016 the sponsor, the depositor and their affiliates became aware of a complaint filed by the State of California on April 1,
2016 against Morgan Stanley Co. and certain of its affiliates alleging, among other things, that there were misleading statements contained in offering materials for 28 different mortgage pass through certificates purchased by various
California investors, including various California public pension systems, from Morgan Stanley and alleging that Morgan Stanley made false or fraudulent claims in connection with the sale of those certificates. Of the 28 mortgage pass-through
certificates that were the subject of the complaint, two were Sequoia mortgage pass-through certificates issued in 2004 and two were Sequoia mortgage pass-through certificates issued in 2007. With respect to each of those certificates, RWT Holdings,
Inc. was the sponsor and Sequoia Residential Funding, Inc. was the depositor. The plaintiffs subsequently withdrew from the litigation their claims based on eight of the 28 mortgage pass-through certificates, including one of the Sequoia mortgage
pass-through certificates issued in 2004. At the time these Sequoia mortgage pass-through certificates were issued, the depositor and Redwood Trust agreed to indemnify the underwriters of these certificates for certain losses and expenses they might
incur as a result of claims made against them relating to these certificates, including, without limitation, certain legal expenses. Regardless of the outcome of this litigation, the depositor and Redwood Trust could incur a loss as a result of
these indemnities. The depositor has been notified by Citibank, N.A. Citibank and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo ),
respectively, of material pending legal proceedings to which Citibank and Wells Fargo are, respectively, subject in connection with their role as trustee on certain RMBS transactions. This Sequoia transaction is not a party to nor subject to the
pending legal proceedings. The disclosure that the depositor received from each of Citibank and Wells Fargo, respectively, is included here: 
 Citibank, N.A Citibank, N.A. Citibank is
acting as Securities Administrator of this RMBS transaction. In the ordinary course of business, Citibank is involved in a number of legal proceedings, including in connection with its role as trustee of certain RMBS transactions. Certain of these
Citibank as trustee-related matters are disclosed herein. On June 18, 2014, a civil action was filed against Citibank in the Supreme Court of the State
of New York by a group of investors in 48 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee, asserting claims for purported violations of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the Trust Indenture Act ),
breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on Citibank s alleged failure to perform its duties as trustee for the 48 RMBS trusts. On November 24, 2014, plaintiffs sought leave to withdraw this action. On the same day, a
smaller subset of similar plaintiff investors in 27 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee, filed a new civil action against Citibank in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York asserting similar claims as the prior action filed in state court. In January 2015, the court closed plaintiffs original state court action. On September 8, 2015, the federal court dismissed all claims as to 24 of the 27 trusts and
allowed certain of the claims to proceed as to the other three trusts. Subsequently, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed all claims with respect to two of the three trusts. On April 7, 2017, Citibank filed a motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs
filed its consolidated opposition brief and cross motion for partial summary judgment on May 22, 2017. Briefing on those motions was completed on August 4, 2017. 

On November 24, 2015, the same investors that brought the federal case brought a new civil action in the Supreme
Court of the State of New York related to 25 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee. This case includes the 24 trusts previously dismissed in the federal action, and one additional trust. The investors
assert claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of New York s Streit Act (the Streit Act ). Following oral argument on Citibank s motion to dismiss,
Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on August 5, 2016. On June 27, 2017, the state court issued a decision, dismissing the Event of Default claims, mortgage-file-related claims, the fiduciary duty claims, and the conflict of interest claims. The
decision sustained certain breach of contract claims including the claim alleging discovery of breaches of representations and warranties, a claim related to robo-signing, and the implied covenant of good faith claim. Citibank appealed the lower
court s decision, and on January 16, 2018, the Appellate Division, First Department, dismissed the claims related to robo-signing and the implied covenant of good faith, but allowed plaintiffs claim alleging discovery of breaches of
representations and warranties to proceed. On August 19, 2015, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC as Receiver for a failed
financial institution filed a civil action against Citibank in the Southern District of New York. This action relates to one private-label RMBS trust for which Citibank formerly served as trustee. FDIC asserts claims for breach of contract,
violation of the Streit Act, and violation of the Trust Indenture Act. Citibank jointly briefed a motion to dismiss with The Bank of New York Mellon and U.S. Bank, N.A., entities that have also been sued by FDIC in their capacity as trustee, and
these cases have all been consolidated in front of Judge Carter. On September 30, 2016, the Court granted Citibank s motion to dismiss the complaint without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On October 14, 2016, FDIC filed a
motion for reargument or relief from judgment from the Court s dismissal order. On July 11, 2017, Judge Carter ruled on the motion for reconsideration regarding his dismissal of the action. He denied reconsideration of his decision on standing,
but granted leave to amend the complaint by October 9, 2017. The FDIC subsequently requested an extension of time to file its amended complaint, which was granted. The FDIC filed its amended complaint on December 8, 2017. 
 There can be no assurances as to the outcome of litigation or the possible impact of litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Citibank denies
liability and continues to vigorously defend against these litigations. Furthermore, neither the above-disclosed litigations nor any other pending legal proceeding involving Citibank will materially affect Citibank s ability to perform its
duties as Securities Administrator under the pooling and servicing agreement for this RMBS transaction. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. 
 On June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank in its capacity as trustee under 276 residential mortgage backed securities RMBS trusts, which was later amended on July 18, 2014, to increase the number of trusts to 284 RMBS trusts. On
November 24, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the state court action without prejudice. That same day, a group of institutional investors filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (the District Court against Wells Fargo Bank, alleging claims against the bank in its capacity as trustee for 274 RMBS trusts (the Federal Court Complaint ). In December 2014, the
plaintiffs motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court action was granted. As with the prior state court action, the Federal Court Complaint is one of six similar complaints filed contemporaneously against RMBS trustees (Deutsche
Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon 

and US Bank) by a group of institutional investor plaintiffs. The Federal Court Complaint against Wells Fargo Bank alleges that the trustee caused losses to investors and asserts causes of action
based upon, among other things, the trustee s alleged failure to: (i) notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged events of
default, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. Relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and equitable relief. Other cases alleging similar causes of
action have been filed against Wells Fargo Bank and other trustees in the District Court by RMBS investors in these and other transactions, and these cases against Wells Fargo Bank are proceeding before the same District Court judge. A similar
complaint was also filed May 27, 2016 in New York state court by a different plaintiff investor. On January 19, 2016, an order was entered in connection with the Federal Court Complaint in which the District Court declined to exercise jurisdiction
over 261 trusts at issue in the Federal Court Complaint; the District Court also allowed plaintiffs to file amended complaints as to the remaining, non-dismissed trusts, if they so chose, and three amended complaints have been filed. On December 17,
2016, the investor plaintiffs in the 261 trusts dismissed from the Federal Court Complaint filed a new complaint in New York state court (the State Court Complaint ). In September 2017, Royal Park Investments SA/NV Royal
Park ), one of the plaintiffs in the District Court cases against Wells Fargo Bank, filed a putative class action complaint relating to two trusts seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and money damages based on Wells Fargo Bank s
indemnification from trust funds for legal fees and expenses Wells Fargo Bank incurs or has incurred in defending the District Court case filed by Royal Park. With respect to the foregoing litigations, Wells Fargo Bank believes plaintiffs 
claims are without merit and intends to contest the claims vigorously, but there can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigations or the possible impact of the litigations on Wells Fargo Bank or the RMBS trusts. 
 Item 1119 of Regulation AB, Affiliations and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. 
 The seller and servicing administrator, the sponsor and the depositor are each either directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries of Redwood Trust, Inc.
There is not currently, and there was not during the past two years, any material business relationship, agreement, arrangement, transaction or understanding that is or was entered into outside the ordinary course of business or is or was on terms
other than would be obtained in an arm s length transaction with an unrelated third party, between (a) any of the seller, the sponsor, the depositor and the issuing entity on the one hand and (b) any of the trustee, any servicer, the
custodian, the master servicer, the securities administrator or either originator of the mortgage loans on the other hand. Item 1122 of
Regulation AB, Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria. The reports on assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria for asset-backed
securities and the related attestation reports on such assessments of compliance are attached hereto under Item 15. 

The registrant has prepared the Table below in connection with this transaction. The Table shows, in one compiled
format, which entity participating in a servicing function for this transaction was assigned responsibility for each criterion in Item 1122(d). In the Table below, certain criteria are not applicable, given the structure of the offering, and
accordingly no entity is assigned responsibility for such criteria. Also, Christiana Trust, a division of Wilmington Savings Fund Society FSB Christiana ), the trustee, does not participate in any servicing function for the transaction that is the subject of this 10-K filing. Therefore, there is no reference to Christiana in the chart
below; nor does this 10-K filing include any assessment or auditor report from Christiana. Finally, any discrepancies between the chart below and the assessment of compliance exhibit provided by any party
listed in the chart is explained by the fact that the chart is specific to the transaction that is the subject of this 10-K filing, whereas each party s respective assessment of compliance is issued on a
platform basis and includes coverage of other additional transactions that are not the subject of this 10-K filing.

The Revised PSA inadvertently and mistakenly indicates by X that Citibank performs Reg AB Item 1122(d)(4)(xiv). However, this Chart, as well as Citibank s management assessment report and report of the
independent accountants are accurate in that Reg AB Item 1122(d)(4)(xiv) is not performed by Citibank. This Reg AB Item 1122(d)(4)(xiv) servicing criteria function is being performed by other parties. In this SEMT
 2013-3 transaction, the Reg AB Item 1122(d)(4)(xiv) servicing criteria function is performed by Wells Fargo, as master servicer, and by underlying servicers First Republic Bank and Cenlar FSB.

The Revised PSA indicates by X that Cenlar FSB performs Reg AB Items 1122(d)(4)(i-ii). However, Cenlar FSB s management assessment report and report of the
independent accountants state that Reg AB Items 1122(d)(4)(i-ii) are not performed by Cenlar. In this SEMT 2013-3 transaction, the Reg AB Items 1122(d)(4)(i-ii) servicing criteria functions, as to Cenlar FSB, are instead performed by Wells Fargo, as custodian.

Exhibit 33.2 

Management s Assertion 
 Management of First Republic Bank (the Bank) is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of
Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of residential mortgage loans serviced for others (the Platform), except for the servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C) and 1122d(4)(xv), which the Bank
has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. Appendix A identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as
constituting the Platform. With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii), management has engaged various vendors
to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Bank s management has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Bank s management has
elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers
 (C DI 200.06). Management has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Bank s
management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria. The
Bank s management has assessed the Bank s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Based on such assessment, management believes that, as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2017, the Bank has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform. 
 KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to the Bank s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. San Francisco Palo Alto Los Angeles Santa

 Management Assessment Management of the Cenlar
FSB (Cenlar or the Bank) is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of residential mortgage loans (the
Platform), except for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(b)-(c), 1122(d)(4)(i), and 1122(d)(4)(ii), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. These criteria are not applicable to the Bank because the Bank does not perform
activities with respect to the Platform relating to these criteria. Appendix A identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(i),
management has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria, has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Bank has elected
to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06,
 Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Bank asserts that it has policies and procedures in place, designed and operating effectively, to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors 
activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Bank is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as
described in our assertion. The Bank s management has assessed the Bank s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2017. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 
 Based on such assessment, management has concluded that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Bank has complied in all material respects
with the servicing criteria, except as set forth in the column titled Inapplicable Servicing Criteria on Appendix B, set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the
Platform. Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to
management s assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Regulation AB (the Servicing Criteria) for residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) transactions backed by pools of residential mortgage loans and/or backed by RMBS, for which the Company provides master
servicing services and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the
issued securities for such RMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable Servicing
Criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any
 government-sponsored entity, other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the RMBS Master

with respect to the Company s continuing obligation to act as, or appoint, a successor servicer or, if applicable, a back-up servicer under the circumstances set forth in the transaction agreements;

(United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the
Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the RMBS
Master Servicing Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the RMBS Master Servicing Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the
Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may
have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We
believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria.

1122(d)(3)(i)(C), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Bank has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. Appendix A to Management s Assertion
identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Bank s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management s assertion about the Bank s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. Our examination was conducted in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Bank s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected
asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Bank processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in
compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Bank during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine
whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Bank during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other
transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Bank s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 
 As described in the accompanying Management s Assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Bank has engaged
various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Bank has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation (C DI) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). As
permitted by C DI 200.06, the Bank has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to
each vendor. The Bank is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related servicing criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the
Bank s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. In our opinion, management s assertion that the Bank complied with the aforementioned Servicing
Criteria, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 is fairly stated, in all

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 The Board of Directors Cenlar FSB: 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management Assessment, that Cenlar FSB (the Bank) complied with the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the residential mortgage loans platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, except for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(1)(iii),
1122(d)(3)(i)(b)-(c), 1122(d)(4)(i), and 1122(d)(4)(ii) which the Bank has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. See Appendix A for the asset backed
transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the Bank s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Bank s compliance with the
servicing criteria based on our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Bank s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of
the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining whether the Bank processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance
and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Bank during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or
reported by the Bank during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Bank is responsible for assessing compliance with 1122(d)(2)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(xv) of Regulation
AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Bank during the year ended December 31, 2017 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Bank s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 As described in management s assertion, for servicing criterion 1122 (d)(2)(i), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities
required by this servicing criterion. The Bank has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Bank has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
applicable servicing criterion applicable to each vendor as permitted by C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Bank has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the
vendors activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Bank is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related
criterion as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Bank s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. A member
firm of Ernst Young Global Limited 

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Bank complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria,
including servicing criteria 1122 (d)(2)(i) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 for the residential mortgage loans platform, is fairly stated, in all
material respects.

transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or

subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other
transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2017 is fairly stated, in all material respects. /s/KPMG LLP
