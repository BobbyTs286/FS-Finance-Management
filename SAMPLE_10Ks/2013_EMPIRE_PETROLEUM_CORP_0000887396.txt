Background 

Empire Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the Company or Empire ), was incorporated in the State of Utah in August 1983 under the name Chambers
Energy Corporation and domesticated in Delaware in March 1985 under the name Americomm Corporation. The Company's name was changed
to Americomm Resources Corporation in July 1995. On May 29, 2001, Americomm Resources Corporation acquired Empire Petroleum Corporation,
which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Americomm Resources Corporation. On August 15, 2001, Americomm Resources Corporation
and Empire Petroleum Corporation merged and the Company's name was changed to Empire Petroleum Corporation. The Company operates
from leased office space at 6506 S. Lewis Ave., Suite 112, Tulsa, OK 74136-1020, and its telephone number is (918) 488-8068. 

During the past three fiscal years, the Company
has focused on the exploration of the Gabbs Valley Prospect and the evaluation of the South Okie Prospect as further described
below. 

Gabbs Valley Prospect 

The Company owns a working interest in oil and
gas leases in Mineral County, Nevada (the Gabbs Valley Prospect ). As of December 31, 2012, the Company's working interest
was 50 on 30,346 gross acres and 88.5 on 3,840 gross acres. The Gabbs Valley Prospect consisted of 34,186 gross acres at December
31, 2012. 

In 2006, a test well, the Empire Cobble Cuesta
1-12-12N-34E, Nye County, Nevada was drilled to a depth of 5,195 feet. The well encountered a volcanic formation at 1,760 feet
and scattered oil shows from 2,000 feet to total depth. After reaching 5,195 feet, the Company and its partners elected to suspend
operations on the well, release the drilling rig, and associated equipment and personnel to evaluate the drilling and logging data.
After the study was completed, Empire and its partners decided to conduct a thorough testing program on the well. The Company re-entered
the well on April 17, 2007 and conducted a series of drill stem tests and recovered only drilling mud. It was then determined after
considerable study that the formation is likely very sensitive to mud and water used in drilling which may have caused clays in
the formation to swell preventing any oil that might be present to flow into the wellbore. 

In 2008, the Company and its partners engaged
W. L. Gore and Associates to carry out an Amplified Geochemical Imaging Survey which covered approximately sixteen square miles.
The survey was concentrated along the apex of the large Cobble Cuesta structure which included the areas around the Empire Cobble
Cuesta 1-12 exploratory test and another test well drilled in the immediate area by a third party. Both of these tests encountered
oil shows and the geochemical survey indicated potential hydrocarbons beyond the two well bores. 

During 2010, the Company had a new Federal drilling
unit formed and approved by the Bureau of Land Management BLM ). This unit was formed according to the Company's plans
to drill a second test well on the prospect to be known as the Empire Paradise Unit 2-12. This test well was to be drilled to 6,000
feet, or 500 feet into the Triassic formation or into a zone that establishes commercial production at a lesser depth. Drilling
operations were commenced July 19, 2010 and ceased on November 5, 2010. During the drilling phase, the Company had several zones
where oil shows were observed. During its test from 3,698' to 3,786' a small amount of oil was recovered. Drilling continued to
4,248', encountering additional oil shows and the decision was made to set 7 production casing to 4,225'. A further attempt
to deepen the hole failed when a heavy water flow was encountered at 4,248'. One further test through the pipe at 4,140' to 4,167'
tested water. It was then decided to test the area between 3,700' to 3,782'. Oil was recovered from this interval and was swabbed
at the rate of three (3) to five (5) barrels of oil per day. The recovered oil contained a significant amount of paraffin, which
could have restricted the oil production. The Company then made the decision to plug the well, considering it to be non-commercial.
One of the parties that had farmed out their interest to Empire for drilling the 2-12 test well asked for an assignment of the
lease on which the well was drilled. Empire agreed to this assignment subject to such party's assumption of the plugging liabilities
of both the 1-12 and 2-12 wells, plus the reclaiming and seeding of the two well sites and replacing Empire's 25,000 drilling
bond. The acquiring party conducted additional testing of the well. The Company has been provided with such additional well data.
Although the Company is not optimistic that further testing will improve the 2-12 well, it believes there is producible oil in
the very large Cobble Cuesta Structure, which is located 150 miles from the nearest oil production. As a result, the Company has
conducted additional geological studies with the expectation it will likely attempt to promote the drilling of another test on
the prospect. 

Other than a small refinery located approximately
100 miles from the Gabbs Valley Prospect, and a six inch gas pipeline crossing our prospect, there are no service networks located
near the prospect. 

South Okie Prospect 

On August 4, 2009, the Company purchased, for
 25,000 and payment of lease rentals of 4,680, a nine month option to purchase oil and gas leases known as the South Okie Prospect
in Natrona County, Wyoming. 

The option allowed the Company to purchase the
leasehold interests for 35,000. The Tensleep Sand at depths from 3,300 feet to 4,500 feet is the primary target. As of December
31, 2009, the Company acquired 11 miles of seismic data and studies of this data were completed in early January 2010. An additional
geological study was also completed early January 2010. Based on these studies, the Company exercised its option in 2010. 

In October, 2012 the Company allowed one of
the leases to terminate on the South Okie Prospect, Wyoming. As of December 31, 2012, the Company s interest in the South
Okie Prospect consisted of approximately 110 net acres of leases. 

Competition 

The oil and gas business is extremely competitive.
The Company must compete with many long-established companies with greater financial resources and technical capabilities. The
Company is not a significant participant in the oil and gas industry. 

Markets; Price Volatility 

The market price of oil and gas is volatile,
subject to speculative movement and depends upon numerous factors beyond the control of the Company, including expectations regarding
inflation, global and regional demand, political and economic conditions and production costs. Future profitability, if any, will
depend substantially upon the prevailing prices for oil and gas. If the market price for oil and gas is significantly depressed
in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to raise additional capital necessary to finance
operations and to explore the Gabbs Valley and South Okie Prospects. Lower oil and gas prices may also reduce the amount of oil
and gas, if any, that can be produced economically from the Company's properties. While the prices of oil and gas remain volatile,
the oil and gas industry has recently experienced historically high prices for oil and gas. The Company anticipates that the prices
of oil and gas will fluctuate somewhat in the near future. 

Regulation 

The oil and gas industry is subject to extensive
federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the production, transportation and sale of hydrocarbons as well as the
taxation of income resulting therefrom. 

Legislation affecting the oil and gas industry
is constantly changing. Numerous federal and state departments and agencies have issued rules and regulations applicable to the
oil and gas industry. In general, these rules and regulations regulate, among other things, the extent to which acreage may be
acquired or relinquished; spacing of wells; measures required for preventing waste of oil and gas resources; and, in some cases,
rates of production. The heavy and increasing regulatory burdens on the oil and gas industry increase the Company's cost of doing
business and, consequently, affect profitability. 

A substantial portion of the leases, which constitute
the South Okie and Gabbs Valley Prospects are granted by the federal government and administered by the BLM and the Minerals Management
Service MMS of the U.S. Department of the Interior, both of which are federal agencies. Such leases are issued through
competitive bidding, contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed BLM and MMS regulations and orders
(which are subject to change by the BLM and the MMS). Leases are also accompanied by stipulations imposing restrictions on surface
use and operations. Operations to be conducted by the Company on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory
restrictions, including various nondiscrimination statutes. Federal leases also generally require a complete archaeology and environmental
impact assessment prior to the authorization of an exploration or development plan. 

The Company's oil and gas properties and operations
are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. These laws govern,
among other things, the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment, the issuance of
permits in connection with exploration, drilling and production activities, the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility
sites and the remediation of contaminated sites. These laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities if the Company fails
to comply or if any contamination results from the Company's operations. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2012, the Company had one
employee, a full-time secretary. Mr. Albert E. Whitehead, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, devotes a considerable amount of
time to the affairs of the Company and receives no compensation. For financial statement purposes, Mr. Whitehead's services have
been recorded as contributed capital and expense in the amount of 50,000 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. 

Gabbs Valley Prospect 

As of December 31, 2012, the Gabbs Valley Prospect
consisted of approximately 34,186 gross acres of federal leases located in Nye County, Nevada, of which the Company owns a 50 
working interest in 30,346 gross acres and 88.5 in 3,840 gross acres. 

As of December 31, 2012, two wells, the Empire
Cobble Cuesta 1-12 and the Empire Paradise 2-12, had been drilled and tested on this prospect, but the wells were not completed.

At December 31, 2012, there were approximately
196 stockholders of record of the Company's Common Stock. 

Dividends 

The Company has never paid cash dividends on
its Common Stock. The Company intends to retain future earnings for use in its business and, therefore, does not anticipate paying
cash dividends on its Common Stock in the foreseeable future. 

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 

On or about February 24, 2011, the Company settled
outstanding invoices of two third party service providers. One such invoice was settled in the net amount of 54,900 by paying
 25,000 in cash and issuing 60,000 shares of Common Stock and the other such invoice was settled by issuing 435,000 shares of Common
Stock for the amount owed of 43,500. 

In August 2011, the Company issued 2,000,000
shares of its common stock to Albert E. Whitehead, its Chief Executive Officer, for a purchase price of 0.05 per share, which
resulted in a total investment of 100,000. 

On December 11, 2012, the Company entered in
a note conversion agreement with the Albert E. Whitehead Living Trust (the Whitehead Trust ). Pursuant to the note
conversion agreement, on December 11, 2012, the Company converted 300,012.50 in debt owed by the Company to the Whitehead Trust
into shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate of 0.05 per share, resulting in the issuance of 6,000,250 shares of Common Stock
to the Whitehead Trust. Upon the issuance of such shares, such debt owed by the Company to the Whitehead Trust was deemed paid
in full and certain notes issued by the Company and the other obligations relating to such debt were terminated. Albert E. Whitehead,
the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Chairman of its Board of Directors, is the trustee of the Whitehead Trust.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements. 

All statements, other than statements of historical
fact, contained in this report are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements generally are accompanied by words such
as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, may, might, potential, 
 project or similar statements. 

Although the Company believes that the expectations
reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to be
correct. Factors that could cause results to differ materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements include: 

the need for additional
capital, 

the costs expected to
be incurred in exploration and development, 

unforeseen engineering,
mechanical or technological difficulties in drilling wells, 

uncertainty of exploration
results, 

operating hazards, 

competition from other
natural resource companies, 

the fluctuations of prices
for oil and gas, 

the effects of governmental
and environmental regulation, and 

general economic conditions
and other risks described in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange 

 Commission (the
 SEC ). 

Information on these and other risk factors
are discussed under Factors That May Affect Future Results below. Accordingly, the actual results of operations in
the future may vary widely from the forward-looking statements included herein, and all forward-looking statements in this Form
10-K are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this paragraph. 

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management's analysis, judgment, belief and expectations only as of the date
hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
that arise after the date hereof. 

Factors That May Affect Future Results. 

The Company does not have any significant on-going
income producing oil and gas properties and has limited financial resources. 

For the past three fiscal years, the Company
has financed its operations primarily from sales of its equity securities and from loans made to the Company by Albert E. Whitehead,
the Company's Chief Executive Officer. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to finance its operations
through the sale of its equity securities, or through loans or advances by third parties. In addition, Mr. Whitehead has no obligation
to advance the Company any additional money, and there is no assurance that he will do so. 

The Company reported losses of (253,348) and
 (247,432) for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company also had an accumulated deficit of 14,259,901
as of December 31, 2012. The Company can provide no assurance that it will be profitable in the future and, if the Company does
not become profitable, it may have to suspend its operations. As a result of the foregoing, the audit report of the Company's independent
registered public accounting firm relating to the Company's financial statements has been modified because of a going concern uncertainty.
If the Company is able to raise the funds necessary to continue its operations, its future performance will be dependent on the
successful drilling results of its inventory of unproved locations in Wyoming and Nevada. The failure of drilling activities to
achieve sufficient quantities of economically attractive reserves and production would have a material adverse effect on the Company's
liquidity, operations and financial results. 

The Company could be adversely affected by
fluctuations in oil and gas prices. 

Even if the Company's drilling activities achieve
commercial quantities of economically attractive reserves and production revenue, the Company will remain subject to prevailing
prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, which are dependent upon numerous factors such as weather, economic, political
and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy. The volatile nature of the energy markets makes it particularly
difficult to estimate future prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids
are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in circumstances, 

 and there can be no assurance that future prolonged
decreases in such prices will not occur. All of these factors are beyond the control of the Company. Any significant decline in
oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity, operations and financial condition. 

The Company could be adversely affected by
increased costs of service providers utilized by the Company. 

In accordance with customary industry practice,
the Company relies on independent third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells, including
drilling rigs and related equipment and services, horizontal drilling equipment and services, trucking services, tubulars, fracing
and completion services and production equipment. The industry has experienced significant price fluctuations for these services
during the last year and this trend is expected to continue into the future. These cost uncertainties could, in the future, significantly
increase the Company's development costs and decrease the return possible from drilling and development activities, and possibly
render the development of certain proved undeveloped reserves uneconomical. 

The Company is subject to numerous drilling
and operating risks. 

Oil and gas drilling activities are subject
to numerous risks, many of which are beyond the Company's control. The Company's operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled
as a result of title problems, weather conditions, compliance with governmental requirements, mechanical difficulties and shortages
or delays in the delivery of equipment. In addition, the Company's properties may be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production
by other operators on adjacent properties. Industry operating risks include the risk of fire, explosions, blow-outs, pipe failure,
abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as oil spills, gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases,
the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to
or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities,
regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. 

The Company's insurance policies may not
adequately protect the Company against certain unforeseen risks. 

In accordance with customary industry practice,
when conducting drilling operations, the Company maintains insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described herein.
There can be no assurance that any insurance will be adequate to cover the Company's losses or liabilities. The Company cannot
predict the continued availability of insurance, or its availability at premium levels that justify its purchase. 

The Company is subject to various environmental
risks, and governmental regulation relating to environmental matters. 

The Company is subject to a variety of federal,
state and local governmental laws and regulations related to the storage, use, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise
hazardous materials. These regulations subject the Company to increased operating costs and potential liability associated with
the use and disposal of hazardous materials. Although these laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial condition or results of operations, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be required to make
material expenditures in the future. Moreover, the Company anticipates that such laws and regulations will become increasingly
stringent in the future, which could lead to material costs for environmental compliance and remediation by the Company. Any failure
by the Company to obtain required permits for, control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances
under present or future regulations could subject the Company to substantial liability or could cause its operations to be suspended.
Such liability or suspension of operations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

The Company's activities are subject to extensive
governmental regulation. Oil and gas operations are subject to various federal, state and local governmental regulations that may
be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed
price controls and limitations on production in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas. In addition, the production, handling,
storage, transportation and disposal of oil and gas, by-products thereof and other 

 substances and materials produced or used in
connection with oil and gas operations are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily
relating to protection of human health and the environment. To date, expenditures related to complying with these laws and for
remediation of existing environmental contamination have not been significant in relation to the operations of the Company. There
can be no assurance that the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations will not continue. 

The Company is subject to intense competition.

The Company operates in a highly competitive
environment and competes with major and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and gas properties,
as well as for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties. Many of these competitors have financial
and other resources substantially greater than those of the Company. 

The Company currently depends on the Company's
Chief Executive Officer. 

The Company is dependent on the experience,
abilities and continued services of its current Chief Executive Officer and President, Albert E. Whitehead. The loss or reduction
of services of Mr. Whitehead could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

There has been a limited public trading market
for the Company's Common Stock, and there can be no assurance that an active trading market will be sustained. 

There can be no assurance that the Common Stock
will trade at or above any particular price in the public market, if at all. The trading price of the Common Stock could be subject
to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results or even mild expressions of interest on a
given day. Accordingly, the Common Stock could experience substantial price changes in short periods of time. Even if the Company
is performing according to its plan and there is no legitimate company-specific financial basis for this volatility, it must still
be expected that substantial percentage price swings will occur in the Company's Common Stock 

 for the foreseeable future. 

The Company does not expect to declare or
pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. 

The Company has not declared or paid any dividends
on its Common Stock. The Company currently intends to retain future earnings to fund the development and growth of its business,
to repay indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, and therefore, does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its Common
Stock in the foreseeable future. 

The Company's Common Stock may be subject
to secondary trading restrictions related to penny stocks. 

Certain transactions involving the purchase
or sale of Common Stock of the Company may be affected by a SEC rule for penny stocks that imposes additional sales
practice burdens and requirements upon broker-dealers that purchase or sell such securities. For transactions covered by this penny
stock rule, broker-dealers must make certain disclosures to purchasers prior to purchase or sale. Consequently, the penny stock
rule may impede the ability of broker-dealers to purchase or sell the Company's securities for their customers and the ability
of persons now owning or subsequently acquiring the Company's securities to resell such securities. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

GENERAL TO ALL PERIODS 

The Company's primary business is the exploration
and development of oil and gas interests. The Company has incurred significant losses from operations, and there is no assurance
that it will achieve profitability or obtain funds necessary to finance its operations. 

For all periods presented, the Company's effective
tax rate is 0 . The Company has generated net operating losses since inception, which would normally reflect a tax benefit in the
statement of operations and a deferred asset on the balance sheet. However, because of the current uncertainty as to the Company's
ability to achieve profitability, a valuation reserve has been established that offsets the amount of any tax benefit available
for each period presented in the statements of operations. 

TWELVE MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012,
COMPARED TO TWELVE MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2012
and 2011, sales revenue was 0. The Company does not have any producing wells at this time. 

Production and operating expenses decreased
 7,314 to 14,746 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, from 22,060 for the same period in 2011. This decrease was primarily
due to the refund of certain costs incurred on the Gabbs Valley test well in 2010. 

General and administrative and lease abandonment
expenses increased by 8,553 to 230,686 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, from 222,133 for the same period in 2011.
The increase was primarily due to a write off of a South Okie Prospect lease. 

For the reasons discussed above, net loss increased
 5,916 from (247,432) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, to (253,348) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

GENERAL 

As of December 31, 2012, the Company had 20,766
of cash on hand. The Company's cash on hand will not be sufficient to fund its operations during the next 12 months. The Company
expects to incur costs of approximately 10,000 per month relating to general administrative, office and other expenses. In order
to sustain the Company's operations on a long term basis, the Company intends to continue to look for merger opportunities and
consider public or private financings. To the extent that it is necessary, the Company expects that management will support the
Company financially for several months to allow the Company to consummate a merger opportunity, or public or private financing. 

PRIVATE EQUITY PLACEMENTS 

In a private placement concluded on January
26, 2010, the Company received subscriptions for 21,431,661 shares of its common stock, par value 0.001 per share, with the aggregate
offering price of such shares being 1,500,216. The material terms and conditions applicable to the purchase and sale of the securities
in the private placement are set forth in the form of the Securities Purchase Agreement included as an exhibit to the Company's
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2009. 

Subsequent to this private placement, the Company
determined that it needed to enter into the farm-in agreement and raise additional funds in order to successfully drill a new test
well on the Gabbs Valley Prospect. In July 2010, the Company completed the private placement offering by issuing 2,500,002 additional
shares of common stock, and 1,250,001 additional warrants to purchase shares of common stock at a price of .50, which expired
on December 31, 2011, as applicable, with an aggregate purchase price of 225,000. Proceeds from this private placement were utilized
for the Company's share of costs to drill a new well on the Gabbs Valley Prospect. Any remaining funds were used for general working
capital purposes. 

Proceeds of the July 2010 private placement
were allocated 57,500 to common stock warrants and 167,500 to common stock and paid in capital. The value of the warrants was
estimated using the Black-Scholes Valuation Model with the following weighted average assumptions: risk free interest rate of .30 ,
no dividend yield, volatility factor of the expected market price of the Company's common stock of 155 to 157 (depending on the
date of sale), and a weighted average expected life of the warrants of one year. These warrants have expired. 

In August 2011, the Company issued 2,000,000
shares of its common stock to Albert E. Whitehead, its Chief Executive Officer, for a purchase price of 0.05 per share, which
resulted in a total investment of 100,000. 

As discussed further below in Advances
from Related Party in this Item 7, on December 11, 2012, the Company converted 300,012.50 in debt owed by the
Company to the Whitehead Trust into shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate of 0.05 per share, resulting in the issuance of
6,000,250 shares of Common Stock to the Whitehead Trust. 

 SALE OF WORKING INTEREST 

In October 2010, the Company sold 7 of its
working interest in the Gabbs Valley Prospect leases for 700,000. In connection with such sale, the purchasers were granted a
working interest in the Paradise Unit 2-12 well and leases. 

ADVANCES FROM RELATED PARTY 

During 2011 and 2012, the Whitehead Trust
advanced loans to the Company in the following transactions: 

on February 1, 2011, the Whitehead Trust
loaned the Company 100,000 in exchange for the issuance of a convertible note, which accrued interest at an annual rate of four
percent; 

on April 17, 2012, the Whitehead Trust loaned
the Company 133,603 in exchange for the issuance of a convertible note, which accrued interest at an annual rate of four percent;

on August 8, 2012, the Whitehead Trust advanced
an additional loan to the Company in the amount of 32,397.50, and such loan accrued interest at an annual rate of four percent;
and 

on August 28, 2012, the Whitehead Trust loaned
the Company 25,000 in exchange for the issuance of a promissory note, which accrued interest at an annual rate of four percent. 

 On December 11, 2012, the Company converted
the 302,167 in debt owed by the Company with respect to such loans into shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate of 0.05 per
share, resulting in the issuance of 6,000,250 shares of Common Stock to the Whitehead Trust. Upon the issuance of such shares,
such debt owed by the Company to the Whitehead Trust was deemed paid in full and the notes issued by the Company and the other
obligations relating to such debt were terminated. Albert E. Whitehead, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Chairman
of its Board of Directors, is the trustee of the Whitehead Trust. 

 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Because estimates and assumptions require
significant judgment, future actual results could differ from those estimates and could have a significant impact on the Company's
results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The Company re-evaluates its estimates and assumptions at least on a
quarterly basis. The following policies may involve a higher degree of estimation and assumption: 

Successful Efforts Accounting - Under the successful
efforts method of accounting, the Company capitalizes all costs related to property acquisitions and successful exploratory wells,
all development costs and the costs of support equipment and facilities. Certain costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending
determination that proved reserves have been found. Such determination is dependent upon the results of planned additional wells
and the cost of required capital expenditures to produce the reserves found. 

All costs related to unsuccessful exploratory
wells are expensed when such wells are determined to be non-productive and other exploration costs, including geological and geophysical
costs, are expensed as incurred. The application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires management's judgment
to determine the proper designation of wells as either developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper
accounting treatment of the costs incurred. The results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze, and the
determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and application of industry experience. Wells
may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver oil and gas in quantities insufficient to be economic,
which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date. The evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs requires
management's judgment to estimate the fair value of exploratory costs related to drilling activity in a given area. 

Impairment of unproved oil and gas properties
- Capitalized drilling costs are reviewed periodically for impairment. Costs related to impaired prospects or unsuccessful exploratory
drilling are charged to expense. Management's assessment of the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned
future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such leaseholds impact the amount and timing of impairment provisions. An impairment
expense could result if oil and gas prices decline in the future as it may not be economic to develop some of these unproved properties. 

Estimates of future dismantlement, restoration,
and abandonment costs - the Company accounts for future abandonment costs of wells and related facilities in accordance with the
provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Under this method
of accounting, the accrual for future dismantlement and abandonment costs is based on estimates of these costs for each of the
Company's properties based upon the type of production structure, reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market demand
for equipment, currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants. Because these costs
typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates
and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing technology and the political
and regulatory environment and, estimates as to the proper discount rate to use and timing of abandonment.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this
report, the Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision of the Company's Chief Executive Officer (and principal financial
officer) of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure 

 controls and procedures pursuant to Securities
Exchange Act Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e). Based on this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer (and principal
financial officer) has concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report
are effective. 

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting 

The Company's Chief Executive Officer (and principal
financial officer) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company's internal controls were designed
to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company's financial reporting and the preparation of the financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. 

Due to inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of control effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

The Company's Chief Executive Officer (and principal
financial officer) made an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2012. In making this assessment, the Company's Chief Executive Officer (and principal financial officer) used the criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Based on this assessment, the Company's Chief Executive Officer (and principal financial officer) concluded that as of
December 31, 2012, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 

This annual report does not include an attestation
report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's
report was not subject to attestation by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC,
which only require management's report in this annual report. 

Changes on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There was no change in the Company's internal
control over financial reporting identified in connection with the Company s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
which occurred during the Company s last fiscal quarter (the fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that
has materially affected or that is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

IDENTIFICATION OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE; AUDIT
COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT 

As of December 31, 2012, the Company had not
established any committees (including an audit committee) because of the small size of its Board of Directors. As such, the Company
does not have an audit committee or an audit committee financial expert serving on such committee. As of December 31, 2012, the
entire Board of Directors (Messrs. Whitehead, Kinard, Hackett and Seth) 

 essentially serve as the Company's audit committee.

The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics that
applies to all of the Company's directors and employees, including the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial
officer and principal accounting officer or persons performing similar functions. The Company undertakes to provide any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the Code of Ethics. Requests may be directed to Empire Petroleum Corporation, 6506 S. Lewis

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING
COMPLIANCE 

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, requires the Company's directors, executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10 percent
of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes
in ownership of Common Stock and other equity securities of the Company. 

Officers, directors and greater than ten percent
stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 

Based solely on review of the copies of such
reports furnished to the Company and any written representations that in other reports were required during the year ended December
31, 2012, to the Company's knowledge, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors and greater than
10 beneficial owners during the year ended December 31, 2012 were complied with on a timely basis. 

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. 

The Board of Directors does not have a Compensation
Committee. 

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

During the last two completed fiscal years,
no executive officer received a salary or any other benefits as a part of executive compensation. The Company's only named executive
officer, Albert E. Whitehead, does not hold any stock options and has not received any other award under an equity incentive plan. 

DIRECTORS COMPENSATION 

In return for serving as a member of the Board
of Directors of the Company, Mr. Seth was granted in 2011 options to purchase 150,000 shares of the Company s stock under
the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, at a strike price of 0.10 per share, which was the closing price on the date of the grant. At the
end of fiscal year 2012, all of such options remained outstanding. 

Except for Mr. Seth, no Director received compensation
or any other benefits from the registrant during the last completed fiscal year.

equity incentive plans under which equity securities were authorized for issuance to the Company's directors, officers, employees
and other persons who performed substantial services for or on behalf of the Company. The 1995 Stock Option Plan , which
expired in May 2005, remains only to the extent necessary to govern outstanding options issued under the Plan. At the Company's
2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the stockholders approved the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan , which authorizes granting
up to 5,000,000 options for up to 5,000,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED
TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE. 

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 

In August 2011, the Company issued 2,000,000
shares of its common stock to Albert E. Whitehead, its Chief Executive Officer for a purchase price of 0.05 per share, which resulted
in a total investment of 100,000. For more information regarding such purchase see Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 
under Item 5 of this Form 10-K. 

In October 2010, Messrs. Whitehead and Hackett
participated in the sale of working interests by the Company on the same terms and conditions as the other purchasers of the working
interest. For more information regarding such transaction, see Sale of Working Interest under Item 7 of this From 10-K. 

During 2011 and 2012, the Whitehead Trust
advanced loans to the Company in the following transactions: 

on February 1, 2011, the Whitehead Trust
loaned the Company 100,000 in exchange for the issuance of a convertible note, which accrued interest at an annual rate of four
percent; 

on April 17, 2012, the Whitehead Trust loaned
the Company 133,603 in exchange for the issuance of a convertible note, which accrued interest at an annual rate of four percent;

on August 8, 2012, the Whitehead Trust advanced
an additional loan to the Company in the amount of 32,397.50, and such loan accrued interest at an annual rate of four percent;
and 

on August 28, 2012, the Whitehead Trust loaned
the Company 25,000 in exchange for the issuance of a promissory note, which accrued interest at an annual rate of four percent. 

 No payments of principal or interest were made
with respect to such loans during 2011 or 2012. As of December 11, 2012, the total outstanding indebtedness owed by the Company
to the Whitehead Trust with respect to such loans was 300,012.50, and such amount was the largest aggregate amount of such indebtedness
outstanding at any time. Albert E. Whitehead, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Chairman of its Board of Directors,
is the trustee of the Whitehead Trust. 

On December 11, 2012, the Company entered
in a note conversion agreement with the Whitehead Trust. Pursuant to the note conversion agreement, on December 11, 2012, the Company
converted the 300,012.50 in debt owed by the Company to the Whitehead Trust into shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate of
 0.05 per share, resulting in the issuance of 6,000,250 shares of Common Stock to the Whitehead Trust. Upon the issuance of such
shares, such debt owed by the Company to the Whitehead Trust was deemed paid in full and the notes issued by the Company and the
other obligations relating to such debt were terminated. Because of Mr. Whitehead s interest in the transaction, Mr.
Whitehead did not participate in the Board of Directors deliberations on, or approval of, the note conversion agreement
or the conversion transaction. 

 DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

The Company has determined that Mr. Kinard,
Mr. Hackett and Mr. Seth are independent within the meaning of Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ listing standards. Because
of the small size of the Company's Board of Directors, the Company has not established any committees. Rather, the entire Board
acts as, and performs the same functions as, the audit committee, compensation committee and nominating committee. Mr. Whitehead
is not considered independent within the meaning of Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ listing standards.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT 

REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Empire Petroleum Corporation 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Empire Petroleum Corporation as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders'
equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Empire Petroleum Corporation as of December 31, 2012
and 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company
has incurred significant losses since inception. The ultimate recoverability of the Company's investment in its oil and gas interests
is dependent upon the existence and discovery and development of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and the ability
of the Company to obtain necessary financing to carry out its exploration and development program. This condition raises substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans concerning this matter are also described
in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

DECEMBER 31, 2012 and 2011 

General: 

On July 20, 2001, Americomm Resources Corporation
merged with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Empire Petroleum Corporation, and simultaneously changed the name of the corporation to
Empire Petroleum Corporation (the Company ). Both the merger and name change were effective as of August 15, 2001. Americomm
Resources Corporation was originally incorporated in the State of Utah on the 22nd day of August 1983, as Chambers Energy Corporation.
On the 7th day of March 1985, the state of incorporation was changed to Delaware by means of a merger with Americomm Corporation,
a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of effecting the said change. In July 1995, the Company changed its name to Americomm
Resources Corporation. 

1. Continuing operations: 

The ultimate recoverability of the Company's
investment in its oil and gas interests is dependent upon the existence and discovery of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves,
the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to further develop the interests, and upon the ability to attain future
profitable production. The Company has been incurring significant losses in recent years. 

Virtually all of the Company's assets are invested
in the Gabbs Valley and South Okie Prospects, both of which are unproven, that is, they have not been evaluated as being capable
of producing economical quantities of reserves. The Company acquired additional leasehold interests in and drilled a test well
on its Gabbs Valley Prospect in 2006. Completion of the test well was suspended pending evaluation of the geologic information
and the securing of additional capital to continue the evaluation and possibly to complete the well. The Company drilled a test
well on the Prospect in 2010 which recovered oil, however the oil contained paraffin which prevented it from producing at economic
rates. The Company continues to believe that the Prospect contains economical reserve quantities and is actively conducting additional
studies and will be pursuing potential funding and/or partners to continue evaluation and exploration. 

The Company plans to supplement current studies
of the South Okie Prospect with a seismograph evaluation to verify the potential of the prospect. The Company has acquired 11 miles
of seismic and studies of this data were completed in early January 2010 and an additional geological study was also completed
in early January 2010. 

The continuation of the Company is dependent
upon the ability of the Company to attain future profitable operations. These financial statements have been prepared on the basis
of United States generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a company with continuing operations, which assume that
the Company will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its obligations
in the normal course of operations. Management believes the going concern assumption to be appropriate for these financial statements.
If the going concern assumption were not appropriate for these financial statements, then adjustments might be necessary to the
carrying value of assets and liabilities, reported expenses and the balance sheet classifications used. 

2. Significant accounting policies: 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

(a) Capital assets: 

The Company uses the successful efforts method
of accounting for its oil and gas activities. Costs incurred are deferred until exploration and completion results are evaluated.
At such time, costs of activities with economically recoverable reserves are capitalized as proven properties, and costs of unsuccessful
or uneconomical activities are expensed. 

Capitalized drilling costs are reviewed periodically
for impairment. Costs related to impaired prospects or unsuccessful exploratory drilling are charged to expense. Management's assessment
of the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such
leaseholds impact the amount and timing of impairment provisions. An impairment expense could result if oil and gas prices decline
in the future as it may not be economical to develop some of these unproved properties. 

(b) Per share amounts: 

The Company calculates and discloses basic earnings
per share Basic EPS and diluted earnings per share Diluted EPS ). The computation of basic earnings per
share is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares
during the period. 

Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential
common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS does not assume conversion, exercise or contingent
exercise of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect on losses. As a result, if there is a loss from continuing operations,
Diluted EPS is computed in the same manner as Basic EPS is computed. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 the Company had 1,245,000 options
outstanding that were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. Such financial instruments may become dilutive
and would then need to be included in future calculations of Diluted EPS. 

(c) Income taxes: 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
with the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established if management determines it
is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

(d) Financial instruments: 

The carrying value of current assets and current
liabilities approximate their fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity of the instruments. 

(e) Stock option plan: 

The Company expenses options granted over the
vesting period based on the grant date fair value of the award. 

(f) Obligations associated with the retirement
of assets: 

The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) guidance on accounting for asset retirement obligations, which among other matters, addresses financial accounting
and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs. This guidance requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period
in which it is incurred, with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the related asset and allocated to expense
over the asset's useful life. The Company applies its analysis to producing wells. 

(g) Recent Accounting Pronouncements: 

FASB periodically issues new accounting standards
in a continuing effort to improve standards of financial accounting and reporting. The Company has reviewed the recently issued
pronouncements and concluded that the following new accounting standards are applicable: 

In July 2012, the FASB issued guidance to amend
and simplify the rules related to testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The revised guidance permits an entity
to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely
than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances,
an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity
is not required to take further action. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value
of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying
amount in accordance with current guidance. These amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for
fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on the Company s
consolidated financial statements. 

3. Property and equipment: 

In 2003, the Company acquired a 10 interest
in the Gabbs Valley Prospect of Western Nevada by issuing 2,000,000 shares of Company stock. The Company has recorded its investment
at 200,000. In 2005, the Company conducted a seismic survey of the Gabbs Valley Prospect. Based on the results of the seismic
survey, during 2006, the Company entered into an agreement to increase its working interest in the prospect to 40 by paying 675,000
plus 55 of the drilling costs through completion. The Company contracted a drilling rig, which commenced drilling the Empire Cobble
Cuesta 1-12-12N-34E, Nye County, Nevada in September 2006. After reaching a depth of 5,195 feet the Company ceased drilling operations,
ran electronic logs, installed a wellhead, and 

 conditioned the hole so that it might be re-entered
or deepened at a later date. In April 2007, the Company re-entered the well and based on the results of drill stem tests, determined
that the formation was very sensitive to the mud and water used in drilling the test well, causing clogs in the formation to swell
which prevented any oil which might be present to flow into the well bore. The total gross acres of this prospect was increased
to 92,826 acres by the acquisition of 30,917 acres from the U.S. Department of Interior in June 2006, at a cost of 36,689, the
acquisition of 9,943.91 acres in September 2008, at a cost of 13,025 and the acquisition of 7,680 acres in September 2009, at
a cost of 12,615. The Company increased its interest to 57 in the prospect leases in 2007 when one of the joint participants
elected to surrender its 30 interest. The Company and the remaining joint owners assumed liabilities of approximately 68,000
to acquire the interest. 

In 2010, the Company drilled a test well in
the Paradise Unit of the Gabbs Valley Prospect to a depth of 4,250 feet. The well produced small amounts of oil containing paraffin
which may have restricted oil flow. A co-owner of the lease elected to take over the lease and well, including remediation of the
site and as of December 31, 2010, the Company had expensed 2,255,493 of intangible drilling costs related to the Paradise Unit
test well. Also in 2010, the Company sold a 7 working interest in the Gabbs Valley Prospect for 700,000. In December 2011, the
Company acquired leases on 3,840 acres of undeveloped land in Nye County, Nevada, which are a part of the Gabbs Valley Prospect.
As of December 31, 2012, the Gabbs Valley Prospect consisted of approximately 34,186 gross acres of federal leases located in Nye
County, Nevada, of which the Company owns a 50 working interest in 30,346 gross acres and an 88.5 in 3,840 gross acres. 

The Company's other property and equipment,
totaling 2,561 at December 31, 2012, consists entirely of office furniture, fixtures and equipment, which are fully depreciated. 

4. Capital Stock: 

In 2005, the Company raised 500,000 of net
proceeds by selling 5,000,000 shares of newly issued common stock along with warrants to purchase 1,250,000 shares of common stock
which, subject to certain restrictions, could have been exercised for a period of one year at an exercise price of 0.25. Proceeds
of the original placement were allocated 67,875 to common stock warrants and 

 432,125 to common stock and paid in capital.
In 2006, the warrants were extended twice; the extensions reduced the value of the warrants to 18,250. The value assigned to the
warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation method with the following assumptions: no dividend yield, expected
volatility of 154 , risk free interest rate of 3.28 and expected life of one year. Assumptions used for the extensions were: no
dividend yield, expected volatility of 153 , risk free interest rate of 4.86 and expected life of 6 months. The warrants expired
on November 15, 2010 with none being exercised. 

In 2006, the Company raised 1,450,000 of net
proceeds by selling 7,250,000 shares of newly issued stock along with warrants to purchase 1,812,500 shares of common stock, which,
subject to certain restrictions, could have been exercised on or before March 15, 2009 subsequently extended to November 15, 2010
at an exercise price of 0.50. Proceeds of the placement were allocated 144,675 to common stock warrants and 1,305,325 to common
stock and paid in capital. The value assigned to the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation method with
the following assumptions: no dividend yield, expected volatility of 148 risk-free interest rate of 5.09 and an expected life
of one year. The warrants expired November 15, 2010 with none being exercised. 

In 2007, the Company raised 1,000,000 of net
proceeds by selling 5,000,000 shares of newly issued stock, along with warrants to purchase 1,250,000 shares of common stock, which
subject to certain restrictions, could have been exercised until March 15, 2009 (subsequently extended to November 15, 2010 at
an exercise price of 0.50 per share. Proceeds of the placement were allocated 80,000 to common stock warrants and 920,000 to
common stock and paid in capital. The value assigned to the warrants was determined by using the Black-Scholes option valuation
methods with the following assumptions: no dividend yield, expected volatility of 136 , risk free interest rate of 4.94 , and an
expected useful life of one year. The warrants expired November 15, 2010 with none being exercised. 

In 2009, the Company raised 1,215,216 of net
proceeds by selling 17,360,233 shares of newly issued common stock. Proceeds were utilized for the Company's share of costs to
drill a new well on the Gabbs Valley Prospect (See Note 1). 

In 2010, the Company raised 685,000 of net
proceeds by selling 8,515,874 shares of newly issued stock, along with warrants to purchase 2,222,226 shares of Common Stock which,
subject to certain restrictions, could have been exercised until June 16, 2011 at an exercise price of 0.50 per share. Proceeds
of the placements were allocated 101,250 to Common Stock Warrants and 583,750 to Common Stock and paid in capital. The value
assigned to the warrants was determined by using the Black-Scholes option valuation methods with the following assumptions: no
dividend yield, expected volatility of 155 , risk free interest rate of .3 and an expected useful life of one year. The warrants
expired in 2011 with none being exercised. 

In August 2011, the Company issued 2,000,000
shares of its common stock to Albert E. Whitehead, its Chief Executive Officer, for a purchase price of 0.05 per share, which
resulted in a total investment of 100,000. 

On December 11, 2012, the Company entered in
a note conversion agreement with the Albert E. Whitehead Living Trust (the Whitehead Trust ). Pursuant to the note
conversion agreement, on December 11, 2012, the Company converted 300,012.50 in debt owed by the Company to the Whitehead Trust
into shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate of 0.05 per share, resulting in the issuance of 6,000,250 shares of Common Stock
to the Whitehead Trust. Upon the issuance of such shares, such debt owed by the Company to the Whitehead Trust was deemed paid
in full and certain notes issued by the Company and the other obligations relating to such debt were terminated. Albert E. Whitehead,
the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Chairman of its Board of Directors, is the trustee of the Whitehead Trust. 

5. Stock options: 

Under a stock option plan adopted in 1995, the
Company had the discretion to grant options for up to 1,600,000 shares of common stock until May 15, 2005, at which time the plan
terminated except to the extent necessary to govern outstanding options. Stock options granted under the plan vest on grant date
and expire ten years from the date of grant plus 30 days. The exercise price of the options is the fair value on the date of grant. 

At the Company's 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders,
the stockholders approved the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the Plan ). The Plan permits the issuance of stock options,
restricted stock awards, and performance shares to employees, officers, directors, and consultants of the Company. Initially, and
until such time as the Board creates a Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors will administer the Plan. The total number
of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to awards under the Plan is 5,000,000. Under the Plan, no participant may
receive awards of stock options that cover in the aggregate more than 500,000 shares of common stock in any fiscal year. Unless
terminated by the Board, or upon the granting of awards covering all of the shares subject to the Plan, the Plan shall terminate
on June 5, 2016. 

The Company expenses the cost of options granted
over the vesting period of the option based on the grant-date fair value of the award. For the year ended December 31, 2012 and
2011, the Company recognized an expense of 0 and 11,295, respectively, related to options granted under the Plan. 

Fair values were estimated at the date of grants
of the options, using the Black-Scholes option valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions: risk-free interest
rate of 3.65 and 2.77 , volatility factor of the expected market price of the Company's common stock of 172 and 142 , no dividend
yield on the Company's common stock, and a weighted average expected 

 life of the options of 5 years. The Black-Scholes
option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. For purposes of determining the expected life of the options, the Company utilizes the Simplified Method
as defined in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

In addition options valuation models require
the input of highly subjective assumptions including stock price volatility. 

As of December 31, 2012, there was no unrecognized
compensation expense related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements under the Plan.

6. Income taxes: 

The provision for income taxes differs from
the amount obtained by applying the Federal income tax rate of 34 to income before income taxes. The difference relates to the
following items: 

2012 
 
 2011 
 
 Statutory tax rate 
 
 34 
 
 34 

Expected tax benefit 
 
 (86,000) 
 
 (85,000) 
 
 Benefit of losses not recognized 
 
 86,000 
 
 85,000 

Tax provision (benefit) as reported 
 
 0

The components of deferred income taxes at December 31, 2012 are as follows: 

2012 
 
 2011 

Deferred tax assets: 

Loss carry-forwards 
 
 2,400,000 
 
 2,300,000 
 
 Valuation allowance 
 
 (2,400,000) 
 
 (2,300,000) 

0 
 
 0 
 
 Deferred tax liabilities: 

Property and equipment 
 
 0 
 
 0 

Net deferred taxes 
 
 0 
 
 0 

At December 31, 2012, the Company had net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately 7,952,231 which expire beginning in 2013. 

Utilization of the Company's loss carryforwards
is dependent on realizing taxable income. Deferred tax assets for these carryforwards have been reduced by a valuation allowance
up to an amount equal to estimated deferred tax liability. 

The Company is no longer subject to income tax
examinations by tax authorities for years before 2008. The Company is not currently the subject of any income tax examinations
by any tax authorities. 

Based upon a review of its income tax filing
positions, the Company believes that its positions would be sustained upon an audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that
would result in a material change to its financial position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been
recorded. The Company recognizes interest related to income taxes as interest expense and penalties as operating expenses. 

7. Oil Sale Revenue: 

The Company currently records revenue from petroleum
sales when received from the operator of the well. Petroleum sales are reported net of working interest and overriding royalty
amounts due. Prior to 2006, the Company was responsible for distributing allocable portions of oil sale revenue to working interest
and royalty owners for production in the Cheyenne River Prospect. Accordingly, a liability for estimated royalty payments was recorded
when oil sale proceeds were received since a division order had not been completed, certain amounts were credited to royalties
payable until the division order issue was resolved. 

8. Operating lease: 

The Company leases office space under an operating
lease agreement with an unrelated party which expires in March 31, 2014. Monthly lease payments are 1,100. 

Rent expense for each of the years ended December
31, 2012 and 2011 was 13,200 and 13,200, respectively. 

9. Related Party Transactions: 

During 2011 and 2012, the Whitehead Trust
advanced loans to the Company in the following transactions: 

on February 1, 2011, the Whitehead Trust
loaned the Company 100,000 in exchange for the issuance of a convertible note, which accrued interest at an annual rate of four
percent; 

on April 17, 2012, the Whitehead Trust loaned
the Company 133,603 in exchange for the issuance of a convertible note, which accrued interest at an annual rate of four percent; 

on August 8, 2012, the Whitehead Trust advanced
an additional loan to the Company in the amount of 32,397.50, and such loan accrued interest at an annual rate of four percent;
and 

on August 28, 2012, the Whitehead Trust loaned
the Company 25,000 in exchange for the issuance of a promissory note, which accrued interest at an annual rate of four percent. 

 On December 11, 2012, the Company converted
 302,167 in debt and accrued interest owed by the Company with respect to such loans into shares of Common Stock at a conversion
rate of 0.05 per share, resulting in the issuance of 6,000,250 shares of Common Stock to the Whitehead Trust. Upon the issuance
of such shares, such debt owed by the Company to the Whitehead Trust was deemed paid in full and the notes issued by the Company
and the other obligations relating to such debt were terminated. Albert E. Whitehead, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company
and Chairman of its Board of Directors, is the trustee of the Whitehead Trust.
