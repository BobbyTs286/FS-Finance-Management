History 

Our company, FSP 50 South
Tenth Street Corp., which individually or together with its subsidiary, we refer to as the Company , we 
or our , is a Delaware corporation formed to purchase, own and operate a twelve-story multi-tenant office and retail
building containing approximately 498,768 square feet of rentable space located in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, which we refer
to as the Property. The Company operates in a manner intended to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal
income tax purposes. 

The Company was organized
initially in September 2006 by FSP Investments LLC (member, FINRA and SIPC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Franklin Street Properties
Corp., which we refer to as Franklin Street (NYSE MKT: FSP). FSP Investments LLC acted as a real estate investment firm and broker/dealer
with respect to (a) the organization of the Company, (b) the acquisition of the Property by the Company and (c) the sale of equity
interests in the Company. 

The Company purchased the
Property from an unaffiliated third party for 127,000,000 on November 8, 2006. The purchase price, which was determined by arm s-length
negotiations, was financed entirely by a loan from Franklin Street collateralized by a first mortgage, which we refer to as the
Acquisition Mortgage Loan. 

Franklin Street holds the
sole share of the Company s common stock, .01 par value per share, which we refer to as the Common Stock. Between November
2006 and January 2007, FSP Investments LLC completed the sale on a best efforts basis of 700 shares of preferred stock, .01 par
value per share, which we refer to as the Preferred Stock. We sold the Preferred Stock for an aggregate consideration of 70,000,000
in a private placement offering to 627 accredited investors within the meaning of Regulation D under the Securities
Act of 1933. Between November 13, 2006 and January 9, 2007, the Company held six investor closings, at each of which shares of
Preferred Stock were sold and funds were received. Funds from each individual closing were used to repay a portion of the Acquisition
Mortgage Loan from Franklin Street and associated fees as well as other expenses payable to Franklin Street s wholly-owned
subsidiary, FSP Investments LLC. On December 21, 2006, the Company obtained a permanent first mortgage loan in the original principal
amount of 76,200,000 from Bank of America, N.A., which we refer to as the BofA Loan, which was repaid in its entirety on December
29, 2011. The Acquisition Mortgage Loan was repaid in its entirety on December 26, 2006 from the proceeds of the sale of equity
interests in the Company and from the proceeds of the Permanent Mortgage Loan. Total interest and loan fees incurred on the Acquisition
Mortgage Loan payable to Franklin Street were approximately 4,961,000 in 2006. The use of proceeds received from the offering
of Preferred Stock and the Permanent Mortgage Loan and affiliates receiving payments therefrom are set forth in the table below:

(5) The Loan Fee Paid to Franklin Street was a fee (or points) of 4,025,000 paid to Franklin Street
to obtain the Acquisition Mortgage Loan to purchase the Property. The Acquisition Mortgage Loan was 

 in the original principal amount
equal to the purchase price of the Property, had a term of two years, and was prepayable at any time without premium or penalty
and carried an interest rate equal to the rate payable by Franklin Street on borrowings under its line of credit with its bank. 

(6) The Acquisition Fee was paid for services in connection with identifying and acquiring the Property.

Transactions between the
Company and Franklin Street and/or its affiliates were entered into without the benefit of arm s-length bargaining and involved
conflicts of interest. Although Franklin Street has sponsored the syndication of other REITs similar to the Company and has in
the past acquired some of those REITs, Franklin Street is under no obligation to acquire or to offer to acquire the Company or
the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, and any acquisition transaction would need to be approved by the Company s stockholders
and the boards of directors of Franklin Street and the Company. Please see Part III, Item 13. Certain Relationships and
Related Transactions, and Director Independence . 

Our Business 

Our sole business
is to own and operate the Property and we do not intend to invest in or purchase any additional properties. We derive
rental revenue from income paid to us by the tenants of the Property. Asset, investor and property management services are
provided by third parties. 

FSP 50 South Tenth Street
LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, leases a portion of the Property from the Company and is the lessor for tenants
occupying the portion of the Property controlled by a master lease. This arrangement has no economic effect on the Company's operations
and exists only because the Company acquired the Property with a master lease in place. 

The Property was completed
in 2001 and is currently leased to office and retail tenants with staggered lease expirations but, as described below, has a large
office component that is effectively leased to Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT), which we refer to as Target, through March 31, 2030.
The Property is located directly across the street from the designated world headquarters of Target and is connected to a corporately-owned
two-level Target retail store and sits above an approximately 850-stall, three-level parking garage that is owned and managed by
the City of Minneapolis. 

The Property also has street
level retail space and is part of a larger area that we refer to as the Project that covers a full city block in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Project is comprised of our Property, the Target retail store and the parking garage. The three owners of the Project, the
Company, Target and the City of Minneapolis, share expenses and responsibilities for maintenance of the Project under the terms
of a Reciprocal Easement and Operation Agreement (REOA), which is administered by Ryan Companies US, Inc., which we refer to as
Ryan. The three owners of the Project also share certain common areas and access to four skyway bridges that connect the Project
to other buildings, including Target s world headquarters across the street, and the greater Minneapolis skyway system. Ryan
also serves as our property manager. For the year ended December 31, 2012, total expenses allocable to the three owners pursuant
to the REOA were 0.65 million, of which 307,000 or 47.3 was allocated to us as common area expenses. These common area expenses
are typically recovered through tenant leases. 

The Property primarily
has office and retail space, which collectively was approximately 98.8 occupied as of December 31, 2012. There is approximately
449,233 rentable square feet, which we refer to as RSF, of office space, approximately 36,415 RSF of retail space and approximately
13,120 RSF of storage space. Oracle America, Inc., which we refer to as Oracle America, leases approximately 242,107 RSF of office
space through March 31, 2014. Oracle America subleases all of its office space to Target. In addition, Target directly leases approximately 130,908 RSF of office
space through March 31, 2030. 

On February 29, 2012, the
Company and Target entered into a new Office Lease Agreement, which we refer to as the Target Lease, whereby Target extended and
expanded its lease of space at the Property, effectively leasing 100 of the Property s office space (449,233 RSF) through
March 31, 2030 with no early termination rights. The office space that is subject to the Target Lease becomes part of the leased
premises at different times that are tied to the expiration dates of existing leases at the Property. However, in the event that
any office space that is currently leased by an existing tenant becomes available prior to its scheduled expiration date, Target
is required to accept delivery of such office space on the earlier of (i) the date three months after the Company provides written
notice of the availability of such office space to Target or (ii) the originally scheduled commencement date for such office space.
The initial leased premises contain an aggregate of 259,344 RSF, are located on floors 7-11 and a portion of floor 4 and have a
commencement date of April 1, 2014. The balance of space contains an aggregate of 189,889 RSF and has become or will become part
of the leased premises pursuant to the following put arrangement:

Target also has the right
to extend the term of the Target Lease beyond March 31, 2030 for a minimum of 225,000 RSF for two consecutive additional periods
of five years each at prevailing market rental rates upon delivery of prior written notice and satisfaction of certain other customary
conditions. 

Rent is comprised of base
rent and Target s share of basic operating costs. Base rent increases each year. There is no free-rent or reduced
rent period. In lieu of any further tenant improvement allowance, abatement of rent or any other lease concessions, the Company
was required to pay Target a tenant incentive payment in the amount of 23,950,000. In addition, the Company was required to pay
brokerage fees relating to the consummation of the Target Lease in the amount of 6,688,000. 

On February 29, 2012, the
Company and Ryan entered into a Lease Termination Agreement, which we refer to as the Lease Termination Agreement, whereby the
parties agreed to terminate Ryan s lease with the Company effective March 31, 2012. Effective April 1, 2012, Target directly
leased 100 of Ryan s former space at the Property pursuant to the above-described put arrangement. Prior to execution of
the Lease Termination Agreement, Ryan s lease at the Property had been scheduled to terminate on July 31, 2015. 

FSP Property Management
LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Franklin Street, provides the Company with asset management and financial reporting services,
which include but are not limited to, selecting and supervising a local property management company and local leasing brokers,
approving lease transactions, managing debt compliance, evaluating performance of the asset, and recommending appropriate stockholder
distributions to the Board of Directors of the Company. The asset management agreement between the Company and FSP Property Management
LLC requires the Company to pay FSP Property Management LLC a monthly fee equal to one percent (1 of the gross revenues of the
Property. The asset management agreement between the Company and FSP Property Management LLC may be terminated by the Company without
cause at any time, upon at least thirty (30) days written notice. 

FSP Investments LLC, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Franklin Street, provides investor services to the holders of the Company s Preferred Stock. The
investor services agreement between the Company and FSP Investments LLC requires the Company to pay a monthly service fee of 500
and to reimburse FSP Investments LLC for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. The investor services agreement may be terminated
by either party with thirty (30) days written notice or immediately upon the occurrence of certain events of default specified
in the investor services agreement. 

Ryan provides the Company
with local, on-site property management and building maintenance services and periodic financial, operating and budget reports
relating to the operation of the Property for review by FSP Property Management LLC. Ryan is a third-party service provider that
is not related to or affiliated with Franklin Street. The management agreement between the Company and Ryan requires the Company
to pay Ryan a monthly fee equal to three percent (3 of the net operating receipts collected in the preceding month. The management
agreement between the Company and Ryan may be terminated by the Company without cause at any time, upon at least thirty (30) days
written notice.

Investment Objectives 

The Company s objectives
are to (i) obtain cash available to pay dividends through rental receipts from operations of the Property, (ii) have that cash
increase over time as a result of rental rate step increases in existing leases, (iii) have our rental revenue potentially increase
over time if rental rates increase for new leases, (iv) provide increased equity in the Property as a result of appreciation in
market value, and (v) preserve and protect the capital invested by the holders of our Preferred Stock. We cannot be sure of meeting
our objectives. 

Our policy is not to make
loans to other persons, not to invest in the securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control, not to underwrite
the securities of other issuers, not to offer securities in exchange for property and not to purchase or otherwise reacquire our
securities. These policies may be changed by our directors without a vote of the holders of our Preferred Stock. 

We have issued 700
shares of Preferred Stock in the offering described above. The Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation,
or charter, authorizes the Company to issue up to 1,540 shares of Preferred Stock. In the event that the Company elects, in its
sole and absolute discretion, to reduce the principal amount of the Permanent Mortgage Loan, the Company will have the right, without
the consent of any holder of shares of our Preferred Stock, to issue up to 840 additional shares of Preferred Stock. We expect
that any such issuance would be in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act. No additional shares of Preferred
Stock are authorized by our charter, and authorization of any increase in the number of authorized shares or the creation of any
new series or class of stock would require the affirmative vote of the holders of 66.67 of the outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock. 

 We intend to dispose of
the Property at such time that our directors determine that we have achieved our investment objectives. We do not intend to reinvest
the proceeds and would distribute cash proceeds to shareholders following such disposition. We also do not intend to list our shares
of Preferred Stock on an exchange and therefore do not expect any trading market to develop in such shares. 

BofA Loan 

The Property was subject
to a 76,200,000 mortgage loan, which we refer to as the BofA Loan, with Bank of America, N.A. The BofA Loan was repaid in full
on December 29, 2011. The BofA Loan originally closed on December 21, 2006, had a January 1, 2012 maturity date and was secured
by, among other items, a first mortgage lien on the Property. Interest on the BofA Loan was fixed at 5.287 per annum and the Company
was obligated to make monthly payments of interest only until the maturity date, at which time the principal amount of the BofA
Loan, together with any accrued but unpaid interest, was due and payable in full. Interest expense paid for the year ended December
31, 2011 was 4,085,000. The BofA Loan was nonrecourse to the Company. The documentation evidencing and securing the BofA Loan
contained customary representations and warranties, as well as customary events of default and affirmative and negative covenants.
The Company was in compliance with the BofA Loan covenants on December 29, 2011, the date that the BofA Loan was repaid in full. 

Bridge Loan 

On December 29, 2011, we
executed and delivered a promissory note to Franklin Street that evidenced a loan for up to 106,200,000, which we refer to as
the Bridge Loan. On July 27, 2012, we repaid the Bridge Loan in its entirety from the proceeds of the Term Loan (as defined below).
The Bridge Loan included a term loan component, which we refer to as the Term Loan Component, in the amount of 76,200,000, all
of which was funded on December 29, 2011 and used to repay the BofA Loan in the same amount in full. We paid Franklin Street a
Term Loan Component fee in the amount of 762,000 on December 29, 2011. The Bridge Loan also included a revolving line of credit
component that could not at any time exceed 30,000,000, which we refer to as the Revolving Line Component. The proceeds of the
Revolving Line Component of the Bridge Loan were to be used for lender-approved tenant improvement costs, leasing commissions and
other incentives necessary to lease space at the Property. 

The Bridge Loan was evidenced
by a loan agreement dated December 29, 2011 by and between the Company and Franklin Street. Pursuant to the loan agreement, we
could borrow, repay and reborrow Revolving Line Component funds in the form of revolving advances from time to time so long as
no event of default existed and certain other customary conditions were satisfied, provided, however, that the aggregate principal
amount of all revolving advances outstanding at any time could in no event exceed 30,000,000. On March 4, 2012, we requested and
Franklin Street funded a revolving advance in the amount of 30,000,000. We were required to pay Franklin Street a fee in an amount
equal to 1.00 of each revolving advance. As of December 31, 2012, the revolving advance fees paid to Franklin Street were 300,000. 

4 

As of December 31, 2012,
costs and fees paid associated with the Bridge Loan, including the 762,000 Term Loan Component fee, the 300,000 Revolving Line
Component fee and a 520,000 exit fee paid to Franklin Street, were 1,582,000 and have been fully amortized and are included in
interest expense in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2012. 

We were obligated to pay
interest only on the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan Component and any revolving advances under the Revolving Line
Component at the fixed rate of 6.51 per annum. The outstanding principal amount of the Bridge Loan, together with any accrued
but unpaid interest, was due and payable on December 31, 2013. The Bridge Loan could be prepaid in whole or in part at any time
without premium or penalty. Any partial payment had to be in an amount at least equal to 100,000. At the time of any prepayment
and upon payment of the unpaid principal balance on the maturity date, the Company was required to pay Franklin Street an exit
fee in an amount equal to 0.49 of such prepayment or payment of the unpaid principal balance. Interest expense paid for the year
ended December 31, 2012 was 3,647,000. 

The promissory note and
the loan agreement were secured by a combination mortgage, security agreement and fixture filing dated December 29, 2011 from the
Company in favor of Franklin Street, an environmental indemnification agreement dated December 29, 2011 from the Company in favor
of Franklin Street, and an assignment of leases and rents dated December 29, 2011 from the Company in favor of Franklin Street.
The mortgage constituted a lien against the Property and was recorded in the Office of the Hennepin County Registrar of Titles.
The loan documents that evidenced and secured the Bridge Loan contained customary representations and warranties, as well as customary
events of default and affirmative and negative covenants. We were in compliance with Bridge Loan covenants on July 27, 2012, the
date that the Bridge Loan was repaid in full. 

Term Loan 

On
July 27, 2012, we entered into a new 106,200,000 secured credit facility, which we refer to as the Term Loan, providing for the
extension of credit to the Company by Bank of America, N.A., which we refer to as BofA, and RBS Citizens, National Association,
which we refer to as RBS Citizens. The Term Loan was structured as a purchase by BofA and RBS Citizens of the Bridge Loan from
Franklin Street. Accordingly, in connection with the closing of the Term Loan, the loan documents evidencing and securing the Bridge
Loan were amended and restated. More specifically, on July 27, 2012, we executed and delivered an Amended and Restated Promissory
Note, which we refer to as the BofA Note, to BofA in the principal amount of 60,000,000 and an Amended and Restated Promissory
Note, which we refer to as the RBS Citizens Note, to RBS Citizens in the principal amount of 46,200,000. All of the proceeds of
the Term Loan were funded on July 27, 2012 and used to repay the Bridge Loan in its entirety. BofA is the Term Loan s administrative
agent and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith Incorporated is the Term Loan s sole lead arranger and sole book manager. 

 The Term Loan is
evidenced by a Loan Agreement dated July 27, 2012 by and among the Company, BofA and RBS Citizens, which we refer to as the Loan
Agreement. So long as there is no default, the Company is obligated to pay interest only on the outstanding principal amount of
the Term Loan at a variable rate equal to 30-day LIBOR plus 2.00 . The outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan, together
with any accrued but unpaid interest, is due and payable on July 27, 2017. Subject to payment by the Company of certain yield maintenance
and redeployment costs, the Term Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time. Any partial payment must be in an amount
at least equal to 100,000. 

 Although the interest
rate on the Term Loan is variable, under the Loan Agreement the Company was required to fix the 30-day LIBOR interest rate by entering
into an interest rate swap agreement with BofA. On July 27, 2012, the Company entered into an ISDA Master Agreement with BofA that
fixed the 30-day LIBOR interest rate on the Term Loan at 0.87 per annum for the term of the Term Loan. Accordingly, when combined
with the required 2.00 spread over 30-day LIBOR interest rate, the all-in interest rate on the Term Loan is 2.87 per annum. Total
interest expense on the Term Loan for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 1,336,000. 

 The BofA Note, the RBS
Citizens Note and the Loan Agreement are secured by an Amended and Restated Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security
Agreement and Fixture Filing dated July 27, 2012 from the Company in favor of BofA as administrative agent for itself and other
lenders, which we refer to as the Mortgage, an Environmental Indemnification and Release Agreement dated July 27, 2012 from the
Company in favor of BofA as administrative agent for itself and other lenders, a Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Protection
Agreement dated July 27, 2012 from the Company in favor of BofA as administrative agent for itself and other lenders, and an Assignment
and Subordination of Management Agreement dated July 27, 2012 by and among the Company, BofA as administrative agent for itself
and other lenders and Ryan. The Mortgage constitutes a lien against the Property and has been recorded in the Office of the Hennepin
County Registrar of Titles. The documents evidencing and securing the Term Loan contain customary representations and warranties,
as well as customary events of default and affirmative and negative covenants. The Company was in compliance with the Term Loan
covenants as of December 31, 2012.

Revolving Line of Credit 

While a line of credit
is not expected to be needed, the Company may, without the consent of any holder of shares of our Preferred Stock but subject to
any required lender consents, obtain a revolving line of credit of up to 46,200,000 on commercially reasonable terms to be used
for capital improvements, operating expenses, working capital requirements or to refinance the Company s debt and fund other
Company purposes, if needed. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had neither sought nor obtained a revolving line of credit. 

Competition 

The Property is located
in the downtown area of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Property may encounter substantial competition from the other office buildings
which are or may become available in the general area in which the Property is located and which may be priced at rental levels
lower than those for space in the Property or which may otherwise be more attractive to tenants. In order to maintain or increase
rental revenues following the expiration of our leases, the Property must be competitive, in regard to cost and amenities, with
other buildings of similar use near our location. Some of our competitors may have significantly more resources than we do and
may be able to offer more attractive rental rates or services. On the other hand, some of our competitors may be smaller or have
lower fixed overhead costs, less cash or other resources that make them willing or able to accept lower rents in order to maintain
a certain occupancy level. If there is not currently significant existing property competition, our competitors may decide to enter
the market and build new buildings to compete with our Property. Our competition is not only with other developers, but also with
property users who choose to own their building. In addition, larger market forces beyond our control, such as general economic
conditions, may increase competition among landlords for quality tenants and individual decisions beyond our control. We cannot
predict which competitive factors will be relevant to prospective future tenants at this time. 

Management believes that
the position of the Property within Minneapolis office and retail markets is strong. In order to further improve the Property s
position in Minneapolis office and retail markets, throughout 2012, management evaluated the Property s operations
for both greater efficiency and for more active and proactive sustainability practices. The Property is Energy Star certified
and, on November 1, 2010, earned LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council in the Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design for Existing Buildings: Operations and Maintenance.

We
acquired the Property on November 8, 2006. In the opinion of our management, the Property is adequately covered by insurance. The
Property is currently encumbered by the Term Loan described above in Item 1. Business 
Term Loan. Other than normal tenant improvements or replacements of equipment in the ordinary course of ongoing operations,
there are no present plans for the improvement or development of any portion of the Property. Below is certain information with
respect to the Property s significant tenants and leases . 

The Property was completed
in 2001 and is currently leased to office and retail tenants with staggered lease expirations but, as described below, has a large
office component that is effectively leased to Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT), which we refer to as Target, through March 31, 2030.
The Property is located directly across the street from the designated world headquarters of Target and is connected to a corporately-owned
two-level Target retail store and sits above an approximately 850-stall, three-level parking garage that is owned and managed by
the City of Minneapolis. 

The Property also has street
level retail space and is part of a larger area that we refer to as the Project that covers a full city block in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Project is comprised of our Property, the Target retail store and the parking garage. The three owners of the Project, the
Company, Target and the City of Minneapolis, share expenses and responsibilities for maintenance of the Project under the terms
of a Reciprocal Easement and Operation Agreement (REOA), which is administered by Ryan Companies US, Inc., which we refer to as
Ryan. The three owners of the Project also share certain common areas and access to four skyway bridges that connect the Project
to other buildings, including Target s world headquarters across the street, and the greater Minneapolis skyway system. Ryan
also serves as our property manager. For the year ended December 31, 2012, total expenses allocable to the three owners pursuant
to the REOA were 0.65 million, of which 307,000 or 47.3 was allocated to us as common area expenses. These common area expenses
are typically recovered through tenant leases. 

The Property primarily
has office and retail space, which collectively was approximately 98.8 occupied as of December 31, 2012. There is approximately
449,233 rentable square feet, which we refer to as RSF, of office space, approximately 36,415 RSF of retail space and approximately
13,120 RSF of storage space. Oracle America, Inc., which we refer to as Oracle America, leases approximately 242,107 RSF of office
space through March 31, 2014. Oracle America subleases all of its office space to Target. In addition, Target directly leases approximately 130,908 RSF of office
space through March 31, 2030.

On February 29, 2012, the
Company and Target entered into a new Office Lease Agreement, which we refer to as the Target Lease, whereby Target extended and
expanded its lease of space at the Property, effectively leasing 100 of the Property s office space (449,233 RSF) through
March 31, 2030 with no early termination rights. The office space that is subject to the Target Lease becomes part of the leased
premises at different times that are tied to the expiration dates of existing leases at the Property. However, in the event that
any office space that is currently leased by an existing tenant becomes available prior to its scheduled expiration date, Target
is required to accept delivery of such office space on the earlier of (i) the date three months after the Company provides written
notice of the availability of such office space to Target or (ii) the originally scheduled commencement date for such office space.
The initial leased premises contain an aggregate of 259,344 RSF, are located on floors 7-11 and a portion of floor 4 and have a
commencement date of April 1, 2014. The balance of space contains an aggregate of 189,889 RSF and has become or will become part

Target also has the right
to extend the term of the Target Lease beyond March 31, 2030 for a minimum of 225,000 RSF for two consecutive additional periods
of five years each at prevailing market rental rates upon delivery of prior written notice and satisfaction of certain other customary
conditions. 

Rent is comprised of base
rent and Target s share of basic operating costs. Base rent increases each year. There is no free-rent or reduced
rent period. In lieu of any further tenant improvement allowance, abatement of rent or any other lease concessions, the Company
was required to pay Target a tenant incentive payment in the amount of 23,950,000. In addition, the Company was required to pay
brokerage fees relating to the consummation of the Target Lease in the amount of 6,688,000. 

On February 29, 2012, the
Company and Ryan entered into a Lease Termination Agreement, which we refer to as the Lease Termination Agreement, whereby the
parties agreed to terminate Ryan s lease with the Company effective March 31, 2012. Effective April 1, 2012, Target directly
leased 100 of Ryan s former space at the Property pursuant to the above-described put arrangement. Prior to execution of
the Lease Termination Agreement, Ryan s lease at the Property had been scheduled to terminate on July 31, 2015.

The final sale of Preferred Stock occurred on January 9, 2007 and following that date no further distributions have been or will
be declared on the Common Stock. The last Common Stock dividend was declared on December 27, 2006 and was paid in December 2006. 

Set forth below are the
distributions made to Preferred Stockholders in respect of each quarter from the last two fiscal years. Distributions are determined
based on the Company s Board of Directors review of cash available for distribution and distribution requirements
necessary for the Company to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. We cannot guarantee the future payment of dividends
or the amount of any such dividends. See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements that are included with this Annual Report

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Historical results
and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated financial statements, including trends which might appear, should not
be taken as necessarily indicative of future operations. The following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form
10-K may also contain forward-looking statements based on current judgments and current knowledge of management, which are subject
to certain risks, trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forward

in United States and in the market where we own the Property, disruptions in the debt markets, risks of a lessening of demand for
the type of real estate owned by us, the financial performance of Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT), which we refer to as Target,
changes in government regulations and regulatory uncertainty, uncertainty about government fiscal policy, geopolitical events,
and expenditures that cannot be anticipated such as utility rate and usage increases, unanticipated repairs, additional staffing,

Overview 

FSP 50 South Tenth Street
Corp., which we refer to as the Company, is a Delaware corporation formed to purchase, own and operate a twelve-story multi-tenant
office and retail building containing approximately 498,768 square feet of rentable space located in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota,
which we refer to as the Property. 

Franklin Street Properties
Corp., which we refer to as Franklin Street, is the sole holder of our one share of common stock, .01 par value per share, which
we refer to as the Common Stock, that is issued and outstanding. Between November 2006 and January 2007, FSP Investments LLC (member
FINRA and SIPC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Franklin Street, completed the sale on a best efforts basis of 700 shares of our
preferred stock, .01 par value per share, which we refer to as the Preferred Stock. FSP Investments LLC sold the Preferred Stock
in a private placement offering to accredited investors within the meaning of Regulation D under the Securities Act
of 1933. Since the completion of the placement of the Preferred Stock in January 2007, Franklin Street has not been entitled to
share in any earnings or dividend related to the Common Stock. 

We operate in one business
segment, which is real estate operations, and own a single property. Our real estate operations involve real estate rental operations,
leasing services and property management services. The main factor that affects our real estate operations is the broad economic
market conditions in the United States and, more specifically, the economic conditions in Minneapolis, Minnesota. These market
conditions affect the occupancy levels and the rent levels on both a national and local level. We have no influence on national
or local market conditions. 

Trends and Uncertainties 

Economic Conditions 

The economy in the United
States is continuing to experience a period of limited economic growth, including historically high levels of unemployment, which
directly affects the demand for office space, our primary income producing asset. The broad economic conditions in the United States
are affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to, inflation and employment levels, energy prices, slow growth and/or
recessionary concerns, uncertainty about government fiscal policy, changes in currency exchange rates, geopolitical events, the
regulatory environment and the availability of debt and interest rate fluctuations. Current and future economic factors may negatively
affect real estate values, occupancy levels and property income. At this time, we cannot predict the extent or duration of any
negative impact current or future economic factors will have on our business.

Real Estate Operations 

The Property was completed
in 2001 and is currently leased to office and retail tenants with staggered lease expirations but, as described below, has a large
office component that is effectively leased to Target through March 31, 2030. The Property is located directly across the street

primarily has office and retail space, which collectively was approximately 98.8 occupied as of December 31, 2012. There are

parties agreed to terminate Ryan s lease with the Company effective March 31, 2012. Effective April 1, 2012, Target directly

the position of the Property within Minneapolis office and retail markets is strong. In order to further improve the Property s
position in Minneapolis office and retail markets, throughout 2012, management evaluated the Property s operations

and, on November 1, 2010, earned LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council in the Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design for Existing Buildings: Operations and Maintenance. 

It is difficult for management
to predict what will happen to occupancy or rents after the expiration or earlier termination of existing leases at our Property
because the need for space and the price tenants are willing to pay are tied to both the local economy and to the larger trends
in the national economy, such as job growth, interest rates, the availability of credit and corporate earnings, which in turn are
tied to even larger macroeconomic and political factors, such as recessionary concerns, volatility in energy pricing and the risk
of terrorism. In addition to the difficulty of predicting macroeconomic factors, it is difficult to predict how our local market
or tenants will suffer or benefit from changes in the larger economy. In addition, because the Property is in a single geographical
market, these macroeconomic trends may have a different effect on the Property and on its tenants, many of which operate on a national
level. Although we cannot predict how long it would take to lease vacant space at the Property or what the terms and conditions
of any new leases would be, we would expect to sign new leases at then current market rates, which may be below the expiring rates. 

The potential for any of
our tenants to default on its lease or to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws exists. If any of our tenants defaults on its
lease, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment.
In addition, at any time, a tenant may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws, which could result in the rejection and termination
of such tenant s lease and thereby cause a reduction in cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Bankruptcy or
a material adverse change in the financial condition of a material tenant would likely have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations. 

BofA Loan 

The Property was subject
to a 76,200,000 mortgage loan, which we refer to as the BofA Loan, with Bank of America, N.A. The BofA Loan was repaid in full
on December 29, 2011. The BofA Loan originally closed on December 21, 2006, had a January 1, 2012 maturity date and was secured
by, among other items, a first mortgage lien on the Property. Interest on the BofA Loan was fixed at 5.287 per annum and the Company
was obligated to make monthly payments of interest only until the maturity date, at which time the principal amount of the BofA
Loan, together with any accrued but unpaid interest, was due and payable in full. Interest expense paid for the year ended December
31, 2011 was 4,085,000. The BofA Loan was nonrecourse to the Company. The documentation evidencing and securing the BofA Loan
contained customary representations and warranties, as well as customary events of default and affirmative and negative covenants.
The Company was in compliance with BofA Loan covenants on December 29, 2011, the date that the BofA Loan was repaid in full. 

Bridge Loan 

On December 29, 2011, we
executed and delivered a promissory note to Franklin Street that evidenced a loan for up to 106,200,000, which we refer to as
the Bridge Loan. On July 27, 2012, we repaid the Bridge Loan in its entirety from the proceeds of the Term Loan (as defined below).
The Bridge Loan included a term loan component, which we refer to as the Term Loan Component, in the amount of 76,200,000, all
of which was funded on December 29, 2011 and used to repay the BofA Loan in the same amount in full. We paid Franklin Street a
Term Loan Component fee in the amount of 762,000 on December 29, 2011. The Bridge Loan also included a revolving line of credit
component that could not at any time exceed 30,000,000, which we refer to as the Revolving Line Component. The proceeds of the
Revolving Line Component of the Bridge Loan were to be used for lender-approved tenant improvement costs, leasing commissions and
other incentives necessary to lease space at the Property. 

13 

The Bridge Loan was evidenced
by a loan agreement dated December 29, 2011 by and between the Company and Franklin Street. Pursuant to the loan agreement, we
could borrow, repay and reborrow Revolving Line Component funds in the form of revolving advances from time to time so long as
no event of default existed and certain other customary conditions were satisfied, provided, however, that the aggregate principal
amount of all revolving advances outstanding at any time could in no event exceed 30,000,000. On March 4, 2012, we requested and
Franklin Street funded a revolving advance in the amount of 30,000,000. We were required to pay Franklin Street a fee in an amount
equal to 1.00 of each revolving advance. As of December 31, 2012, the revolving advance fees paid to Franklin Street were 300,000. 

As of December 31, 2012,
costs and fees paid associated with the Bridge Loan, including the 762,000 Term Loan Component fee, the 300,000 Revolving Line
Component fee and a 520,000 exit fee paid to Franklin Street, were 1,582,000 and have been fully amortized and are included in
interest expense in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2012. 

We were obligated to pay
interest only on the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan Component and any revolving advances under the Revolving Line
Component at the fixed rate of 6.51 per annum. The outstanding principal amount of the Bridge Loan, together with any accrued
but unpaid interest, was due and payable on December 31, 2013. The Bridge Loan could be prepaid in whole or in part at any time
without premium or penalty. Any partial payment had to be in an amount at least equal to 100,000. At the time of any prepayment
and upon payment of the unpaid principal balance on the maturity date, the Company was required to pay Franklin Street an exit
fee in an amount equal to 0.49 of such prepayment or payment of the unpaid principal balance. Interest expense paid for the year
ended December 31, 2012 was 3,647,000. 

The promissory note and
the loan agreement were secured by a combination mortgage, security agreement and fixture filing dated December 29, 2011 from the
Company in favor of Franklin Street, an environmental indemnification agreement dated December 29, 2011 from the Company in favor
of Franklin Street, and an assignment of leases and rents dated December 29, 2011 from the Company in favor of Franklin Street.
The mortgage constituted a lien against the Property and was recorded in of the Office of the Hennepin County Registrar of Titles.
The loan documents that evidenced and secured the Bridge Loan contained customary representations and warranties, as well as customary
events of default and affirmative and negative covenants. We were in compliance with Bridge Loan covenants on July 27, 2012, the
date that the Bridge Loan was repaid in full. 

Term Loan 

On July 27, 2012,
we entered into a new 106,200,000 secured credit facility, which we refer to as the Term Loan, providing for the extension of
credit to the Company by Bank of America, N.A., which we refer to as BofA, and RBS Citizens, National Association, which we refer
to as RBS Citizens. The Term Loan was structured as a purchase by BofA and RBS Citizens of the Bridge Loan from Franklin Street.
Accordingly, in connection with the closing of the Term Loan, the loan documents evidencing and securing the Bridge Loan were amended
and restated. More specifically, on July 27, 2012, we executed and delivered an Amended and Restated Promissory Note, which we
refer to as the BofA Note, to BofA in the principal amount of 60,000,000 and an Amended and Restated Promissory Note, which we
refer to as the RBS Citizens Note, to RBS Citizens in the principal amount of 46,200,000. All of the proceeds of the Term Loan
were funded on July 27, 2012 and used to repay the Bridge Loan in its entirety. BofA is the Term Loan s administrative agent
and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith Incorporated is the Term Loan s sole lead arranger and sole book manager. 

 The Term Loan is
evidenced by a Loan Agreement dated July 27, 2012 by and among the Company, BofA and RBS Citizens, which we refer to as the Loan
Agreement. So long as there is no default, the Company is obligated to pay interest only on the outstanding principal amount of
the Term Loan at a variable rate equal to 30-day LIBOR plus 2.00 . The outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan, together
with any accrued but unpaid interest, is due and payable on July 27, 2017. Subject to payment by the Company of certain yield maintenance
and redeployment costs, the Term Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time. Any partial payment must be in an amount
at least equal to 100,000. 

 Although the interest
rate on the Term Loan is variable, under the Loan Agreement the Company was required to fix the 30-day LIBOR interest rate by entering
into an interest rate swap agreement with BofA. On July 27, 2012, the Company entered into an ISDA Master Agreement with BofA that
fixed the 30-day LIBOR interest rate on the Term Loan at 0.87 per annum for the term of the Term Loan. Accordingly, when combined
with the required 2.00 spread over 30-day LIBOR interest rate, the all-in interest rate on the Term Loan is 2.87 per annum. Total
interest expense on the Term Loan for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 1,336,000. 

14 

The BofA Note, the
RBS Citizens Note and the Loan Agreement are secured by an Amended and Restated Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security
Agreement and Fixture Filing dated July 27, 2012 from the Company in favor of BofA as administrative agent for itself and other
lenders, which we refer to as the Mortgage, an Environmental Indemnification and Release Agreement dated July 27, 2012 from the
Company in favor of BofA as administrative agent for itself and other lenders, a Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Protection
Agreement dated July 27, 2012 from the Company in favor of BofA as administrative agent for itself and other lenders, and an Assignment
and Subordination of Management Agreement dated July 27, 2012 by and among the Company, BofA as administrative agent for itself
and other lenders and Ryan. The Mortgage constitutes a lien against the Property and has been recorded in the Office of the Hennepin
County Registrar of Titles. The documents evidencing and securing the Term Loan contain customary representations and warranties,
as well as customary events of default and affirmative and negative covenants. The Company was in compliance with the Term Loan
covenants as of December 31, 2012. 

 Building Reserves 

The Term Loan requires
the Company to maintain a cash balance that increases from 5,000,000 to 6,000,000. As of December 31, 2012, the Company s
measure of cash reserves beyond operating needs was approximately 6,400,000. Not only does the Company need to continue to maintain
the cash balance required by the Term Loan, but it also believes that it is necessary and prudent to build reserves in light of
the potential needs for ongoing leasing costs of the Property s retail space and capital expenditures not covered by existing
tenant lease obligations. Accordingly, the Company anticipates that until it believes that such reserve levels are established,
the Company s level of dividends on its Preferred Stock will be somewhat reduced from average levels of the past five years.
The Company is estimating dividend distributions from operations for the balance of 2013 as follows:

 ESTIMATED

(1) Estimated yield is calculated on the original issue price of a share of Preferred
Stock of 100,000. 

Dividend amounts and cash reserves
will be constantly evaluated for levels that best balance current shareholder distributions and required/prudent property capital
needs and adjusted as deemed appropriate. Although we believe that these estimates of dividend distributions are reasonable, neither
the Company nor management can guarantee future dividend levels. The Company s Board of Directors is ultimately responsible
for making (or not making) a dividend declaration. 

Revolving Line of Credit

While a line of credit
is not expected to be needed, we may, without the consent of any holder of shares of our Preferred Stock but subject to any required
lender consents, obtain a revolving line of credit of up to 46,200,000 on commercially reasonable terms to be used for capital
improvements, operating expenses, working capital requirements or to refinance the Company s debt and fund other Company
purposes, if needed. As of December 31, 2012, we had neither sought nor obtained a revolving line of credit. 

Possible Future Capital
Transaction 

We do not intend to borrow
any additional money at this time but have the right to obtain the revolving line of credit described above. There can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to sell or refinance the Property upon the maturity of the Term Loan or that the proceeds received
from such sale or refinancing, or cash raised from the issuance of up to an additional 840 shares of Preferred Stock or the use
of our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to repay the Term Loan at that time. In light of the Target Lease, we believe
that our financial options could be numerous and we intend to monitor the Property s performance and market conditions and
evaluate future opportunities for the Property, including a possible sale of the Property. Of course, any sale of the Property
would be subject to a number of conditions, including approval by our directors and the holders of a majority of the shares of
Preferred Stock.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We have certain critical
accounting policies that are subject to judgments and estimates by our management and uncertainties of outcome that affect the
application of these policies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. In the event estimates or assumptions prove
to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. The accounting
policies that we believe are most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations, and that require
significant management estimates and judgments, are discussed below. 

Critical accounting policies
are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant
judgments and estimates. We believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information
that fairly presents our results of operations. These policies affect our: 

recognition of rental income and depreciation and amortization expense; and 

assessment of the carrying values and impairments of long-lived assets. 

Depreciation and Amortization 

We compute depreciation
expense using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of up to 39 years for the building and improvements, and up
to 15 years for personal property. The allocated cost of land is not depreciated. The value
of above or below-market leases are amortized over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the lease as an adjustment to rental
income. The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is also amortized
over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration, all
unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off. Inappropriate allocation of acquisition costs, or incorrect estimates
of useful lives, could result in depreciation and amortization expenses which do not appropriately reflect the allocation of our
capital expenditures over future periods, as is required by generally accepted accounting principles. 

Impairment 

We periodically evaluate
the Property for impairment indicators. These indicators may include declining tenant occupancy, weak or declining tenant profitability,
cash flow or liquidity, our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or legislative, economic
or market changes that permanently reduce the value of our investment. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the
carrying value of the Property by comparing it to its expected future undiscounted cash flows. If the sum of these expected future
cash flows is less than the carrying value, we reduce the net carrying value of the Property to the present value of these expected
future cash flows. This analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash
flows. If we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future tenant profitability, market or industry factors differ from our expectations,
we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate or fail to record a charge when we should have done so, or the amount
of such charges may be inaccurate. 

Lease Classification 

Each time we enter into
a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate whether it is appropriately classified as a capital lease or as
an operating lease. The classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property, as well as
our recognition of rental payments as revenue. These evaluations require us to make estimates of, among other things, the remaining
useful life and market value of a property, discount rates and future cash flows. Incorrect assumptions or estimates may result
in misclassification of our leases.

Results of Operations 

Comparison of the year
ended December 31, 2012 to the year ended December 31, 2011 

Revenue 

Total revenue decreased
 0.9 million to 15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to 15.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2011. This decrease was primarily attributable to the amortization of lease acquisition costs of 1.0 million, which was offset
by an increase in rental revenue of 0.1 million. 

Expenses 

Total expenses increased
approximately 3.5 million to 18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to 14.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense of 2.8 million, an increase in
depreciation and amortization of 0.6 million and an increase in rental operating expense of 0.1 million. 

Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

Cash and cash equivalents
increased approximately 0.2 million to 9.7 million at December 31, 2012, as compared to 9.5 million for the year ended December
31, 2011. Cash provided by financing activities was 26.7 million and was offset by cash used for operating activities of 26.5
million. 

As of December 31, 2012,
the Term Loan was outstanding in the principal amount of 106.2 million. 

Management believes that
existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2012 of 9.7 million and cash anticipated to be generated internally by operations
will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements, distributions and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next
12 months. 

Operating Activities

The cash used for operating
activities of 26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily attributable to a net loss of approximately 3.3
million, payment of deferred leasing costs of 6.8 million, the tenant incentive payment of 24 million and uses arising from other
current accounts of 0.1 million, which was partially offset by the add back of 5.8 million of depreciation and amortization,
 1.0 million of amortization of lease acquisition costs as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 0.8
million. 

Investing Activities

The cash used
 for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 of 17,000 was attributable to the purchase of real estate
assets. 

Financing Activities

The cash
provided by financing activities of 26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 was attributable to the 30 million
proceeds from the March 4, 2012 revolving advance under the loan payable affiliate and the 106.2 million proceeds
from the July 27, 2012 loan payable, which was partially offset by the 106.2 million principal payment on the loan payable -
affiliate and the 1.5 million payments of deferred financing costs and a 1.8 million dividend payment. 

Sources and Uses of
Funds 

Our principal demands on
liquidity are cash for operations, interest on debt payments and distributions to equity holders. As of December 31, 2012, we had
approximately 2.3 million in accrued liabilities and 106.2 million in long-term debt in the form of the Term Loan. In the near
term, liquidity is generated by cash from operations.

Contingencies 

We may be subject to various
legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements
may occur, we believe that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position
or results of operations. 

Related Party Transactions 

Asset Management Agreement 

We have in the past engaged
in and currently engage in transactions with a related party, Franklin Street and its subsidiaries FSP Investments LLC and FSP
Property Management LLC, which we collectively refer to as FSP. We expect to continue to have related party transactions with FSP
in the form of management fees paid to FSP to manage the Company on behalf of our stockholders. FSP Property Management LLC currently
provides the Company with asset management and financial reporting services. The asset management agreement between the Company
and FSP Property Management LLC requires the Company to pay FSP Property Management LLC a monthly fee equal to one percent (1 of the gross revenues of the Property. The asset management agreement between the Company and FSP Property Management LLC may be
terminated by either party without cause at any time, upon at least thirty (30) days written notice, effective at the end of the
notice period. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, management fees paid were 160,000 and 158,000, respectively.

Investor Services Agreement 

On August 14, 2012, we
entered into an Investor Services Agreement, which we refer to as the FSPI Agreement, with FSP Investments LLC for the provision
of investor services to holders of our Preferred Stock. FSP Investments LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Franklin Street, which
is the sole holder of our one share of Common Stock that is issued and outstanding. FSP Investments LLC acted as a real estate
investment firm and broker/dealer with respect to (a) our organization, (b) our acquisition of the Property and (c) the sale of
our equity interests. The FSPI Agreement requires us to pay a monthly service fee of 500 for services performed under the FSPI
Agreement, and to reimburse FSP Investments LLC for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the FSPI
Agreement. The FSPI Agreement may be terminated by either party with thirty days written notice or immediately upon certain events
of default set forth in the FSPI Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, investor services fees paid were approximately
 3,000 and 0, respectively. 

Ownership of Common Stock 

Franklin Street is the
sole holder of the Company s one share of Common Stock that is issued and outstanding. Subsequent to the completion of the
private placement of the Preferred Stock in January 2007, Franklin Street has not been entitled to share in any earnings or any
dividend as a result of its ownership of the Common Stock of the Company.

and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the
participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2012. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of
a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment
in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of December 31, 2012, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such
date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management s Annual
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

The management of
the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officer and effected
by the Company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Company; 

Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 

Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

The Company s
management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.
In making this assessment, the Company s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. 

Based on our assessment,
management concluded that, as of December 31, 2012, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective
based on those criteria. 

This annual report is not
required to include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. This report shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act or otherwise subject
to the liabilities of that section. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

No change in our internal
control over financial reporting occurred during the year ended December 31, 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Stockholders 

 FSP 50 South Tenth Street Corp. 

 Wakefield, Massachusetts 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of FSP 50 South Tenth Street Corp. as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, other comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These consolidated financial statements
and schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and schedule based on our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FSP 50 South Tenth Street Corp.
as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

1. Organization 

FSP 50 South Tenth Street
Corp. (the Company was organized on September 12, 2006 as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware
to purchase, own and operate a twelve-story multi-tenant office and retail building containing approximately 498,768 rentable square
feet of space located in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota (the Property ). The Company acquired the Property on November
8, 2006. Franklin Street Properties Corp. Franklin Street (NYSE MKT: FSP) holds the sole share of the Company s
common stock, .01 par value per share (the Common Stock ). Between November 2006 and January 2007, FSP Investments
LLC (member, FINRA and SIPC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Franklin Street, completed the sale on a best efforts basis of 700 shares
of the Company s preferred stock, .01 par value per share (the Preferred Stock ). FSP Investments LLC sold
the Preferred Stock in a private placement offering to accredited investors within the meaning of Regulation D under
the Securities Act of 1933. 

All references to the Company refer to FSP
50 South Tenth Street Corp. and its consolidated subsidiary, collectively, unless the context otherwise requires. 

2. 
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

BASIS OF
PRESENTATION 

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary .
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS 

The Company prepares its consolidated financial
statements and related notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ).
These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

REAL ESTATE AND DEPRECIATION 

Real estate assets are stated at the lower
of cost or fair value, as appropriate, less accumulated depreciation. 

Costs related to property acquisition and improvements
are capitalized. Typical capital items include new roofs, site improvements, various exterior building improvements and major interior
renovations. 

Routine replacements and ordinary maintenance
and repairs that do not extend the life of the asset are expensed as incurred. Funding for repairs and maintenance items typically
is provided by cash flows from operating activities. 

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method over the assets' estimated useful lives as follows: 

Category 
 Years 

Building - Commercial 
 39 

Building Improvements 
 15-39 

The Company reviews the Property to determine
if the carrying amount will be recovered from future cash flows if certain indicators of impairment are identified at the Property.
The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental
rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. When indicators of impairment
are present and the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss
is recorded equal to the difference between the asset s current carrying value and its fair value based on discounting its
estimated future cash flows. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, no impairment charges were recorded. 

Depreciation expense of 2,659,000 and 2,632,000
is included in Depreciation and Amortization in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December
31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

 ACQUIRED REAL ESTATE LEASES 

The acquired real estate leases represent the
estimated value of legal and leasing costs related to acquired leases that were included in the purchase price when the Company
acquired the Property. The Company subsequently amortizes these costs on a straight-line basis over the remaining lives of the
related leases. Amortization expense of 980,000 and 703,000 is included in Depreciation and Amortization in the Company s
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 

Acquired real estate lease costs included in
the purchase price of the Property were 6,447,000. Detail of the remaining acquired real estate leases are as follows:

ACQUIRED FAVORABLE REAL ESTATE LEASES 

Acquired favorable real estate
leases represent the value related to the leases when the lease payments due under a tenant s lease exceed the market rate
of the lease at the date the Property was acquired. The Company reports this value separately from its investment in real estate.
The Company subsequently amortizes this amount on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the tenant s lease. Amortization
of 432,000 and 402,000 is shown as a reduction of rental income in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations
for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 

The acquired favorable real estate leases
included in the purchase price of the property were 3,198,000. Detail of the remaining acquired favorable real estate leases

ACQUIRED UNFAVORABLE REAL ESTATE LEASES 

Acquired unfavorable real estate leases represent
the value relating to leases with rents below the market rate at the time of property acquisition. Amortization is computed using
the straight-line method over the lives of the leases assumed. Amortization of 140,000 and 175,000 is included with rental revenue
in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

CASH AND
CASH EQUIVALENTS 

The Company considers all
highly liquid debt instruments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company has set aside
funded reserves of 5,866,000 and 6,666,000 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, in anticipation of future capital needs
of the Property. These funds typically are used for the payment of real estate assets and deferred leasing commissions; however,
there is no legal restriction on their use and they may be used for any Company purpose. 

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS 

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
are financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk. The Company maintains its cash
balances and short-term investments principally in banks which the Company believes to be creditworthy. The Company periodically
assesses the financial condition of these banks and believes that the risk of loss is minimal. Cash balances held with various
financial institutions frequently exceed the insurance limit of 250,000 provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 

For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011,
rental income was derived from various tenants. As such, future receipts are dependent upon the financial strength of the lessees
and their ability to perform under the lease agreements. 

The
following tenants represent greater than 10 of rental revenue as of December 31:

On February 29, 2012, the Company and Target

at the Property, effectively leasing 100 of the Property s office space through March 31, 2030 with no early termination
rights.

2. Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS 

The Company estimates that the carrying value
of cash and cash equivalents, loan payable, and loan payable - affiliate approximate their fair values based on their short-term
maturity and prevailing interest rates. 

STEP RENT RECEIVABLE 

Certain leases provide
for fixed rental increases over the life of the lease. Rental revenue is recognized on the straight-line basis over the related
lease term; however, billings by the Company are based on required minimum rentals in accordance with the lease agreements. Step
rent receivable, which is the cumulative revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed by the Company, is 986,000 and 771,000
at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively . 

TENANT RENT RECEIVABLE 

Tenant rent receivable is reported at the amount
the Company expects to collect on balances outstanding at year-end. The Company provides an allowance
for doubtful accounts based on its estimate of a tenant s ability to make future rent payments. The computation of this allowance
is based in part on the tenants payment history and current credit status. Management monitors outstanding balances
and relationships and concluded that an allowance of 0 and 51,000 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, was sufficient. 

DEFERRED LEASING COSTS 

Deferred leasing
commissions represent direct and incremental external leasing costs incurred in the leasing of commercial space. These costs are
capitalized and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related lease agreements. Deferred leasing
costs of 6,846,000 and 17,000 were incurred during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Amortization expense
was 362,000 and 74,000 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 

LEASE ACQUISITION COSTS 

The lease
acquisition costs represent incentive payments made in the leasing of commercial space. On February 29, 2012, the Company and Target
Corporation Target entered into a new Office Lease Agreement and in lieu of any tenant improvement allowance, abatement
of rent or any other lease concessions, the Company paid Target a tenant incentive payment in the amount of 23,950,000. These
costs are capitalized and amortized into revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement. Amortization of
 998,000 is included as a reduction of rental income in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year
ended December 31, 2012. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

The Company has retained substantially all
of the risks and benefits of ownership of the Company's commercial property and accounts for its leases as operating leases. Rental
income from the leases, which may include rent concessions (including free rent) and scheduled increases in rental rates during
the lease term, is recognized on a straight-line basis. Any lease incentives are recorded as deferred rent and amortized as reductions
to rental income over the lease term on a straight-line basis. The Company does not have any percentage rent arrangements with
its commercial property tenants. Reimbursable costs are included in rental income in the year earned.

INTEREST INCOME 

Interest income is recognized when the earnings
process is complete. 

INCOME TAXES 

The Company has elected to be taxed as a Real
Estate Investment Trust REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a REIT, the Company generally
is entitled to a tax deduction for dividends paid to its stockholders, thereby effectively subjecting the distributed net income
of the Company to taxation at the stockholder level only. The Company must comply with a variety of restrictions to maintain its
status as a REIT. These restrictions include the type of income it can earn, the type of assets it can hold, the number of stockholders
it can have and the concentration of their ownership, and the amount of the Company s taxable income that must be distributed
annually. 

NET INCOME PER SHARE 

 Basic net income per share of Preferred Stock
is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted
net income per share of Preferred Stock reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue
shares were exercised or converted into shares. There were no potential dilutive shares outstanding at December 31, 2012 and 2011.
Subsequent to the completion of the offering shares of Preferred Stock, the holders of Common Stock are not entitled to share in
any income nor in any related dividend. 

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 

The Company recognizes derivatives on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Derivatives that do not qualify, or are not designated as hedge relationships, must
be adjusted to fair value through income. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability
in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Cash flow hedges are
accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or
liability. To the extent hedges are effective, a corresponding amount, adjusted for swap payments, is recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders equity. Amounts are then reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) to the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
Ineffectiveness, if any, is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company periodically reviews the effectiveness
of each hedging transaction, which involves estimating future cash flows, at least quarterly. Derivative instruments designated
in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable
to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Fair values of derivatives are subject to significant
variability based on changes in interest rates. The results of such variability could be a significant increase or decrease in
our derivative assets, derivative liabilities, book equity, and/or earnings.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be
received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There is also an established fair value
hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring
fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. Financial assets and liabilities
recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: 

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other
than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs
may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset
or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at
commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which is typically based on an entity s
own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity or information. In instances where the determination of the
fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy
within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its
entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. These inputs were considered and applied
to the Company s outstanding derivative, and Level 2 inputs were used to value the interest rate swap. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income. This standard eliminates the current
option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity and instead requires
the components of other comprehensive income to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or
in two separate but consecutive statements. This standard is intended to enhance comparability between entities that report under
GAAP and to provide a more consistent method of presenting non-owner transactions that affect an entity s equity. This standard
is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company has adopted
this update for the years ending December 31, 2012 and 2011. 

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

In preparing these consolidated financial statements
the Company evaluated events that occurred through the date of issuance of these financial statements for potential recognition
or disclosure. 

3. Loans
Payable 

BofA Loan 

The Property was subject to a 76,200,000 mortgage
loan (the BofA Loan with Bank of America, N.A. The BofA Loan was repaid in full on December 29, 2011. The BofA Loan
originally closed on December 21, 2006, had a January 1, 2012 maturity date and was secured by, among other items, a first mortgage
lien on the Property. Interest on the BofA Loan was fixed at 5.287 per annum and the Company was obligated to make monthly payments
of interest only until the maturity date, at which time the principal amount of the BofA Loan, together with any accrued but unpaid
interest, was due and payable in full. Interest expense paid for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 4,085,000. The BofA Loan
was nonrecourse to the Company. The documentation evidencing and securing the BofA Loan contained customary representations and
warranties, as well as customary events of default and affirmative and negative covenants. The Company was in compliance with BofA
Loan covenants on December 29, 2011, the date that the BofA Loan was repaid in full.

and delivered a promissory note to Franklin Street that evidenced a loan for up to 106,200,000 (the Bridge Loan ).
On July 27, 2012, the Company repaid the Bridge Loan in its entirety from the proceeds of the Term Loan (as defined below). Please
refer to Note 7 below for a detailed description of the Bridge Loan. 

Term Loan 

On July 27, 2012, the Company entered into
a new 106,200,000 secured credit facility (the Term Loan providing for the extension of credit to the Company by
Bank of America, N.A. BofA and RBS Citizens, National Association RBS Citizens ). The Term Loan was
structured as a purchase by BofA and RBS Citizens of the Bridge Loan from Franklin Street. Accordingly, in connection with the
closing of the Term Loan, the loan documents evidencing and securing the Bridge Loan were amended and restated. More specifically,
on July 27, 2012, the Company executed and delivered an Amended and Restated Promissory Note (the BofA Note to BofA
in the principal amount of 60,000,000 and an Amended and Restated Promissory Note (the RBS Citizens Note to RBS
Citizens in the principal amount of 46,200,000. All of the proceeds of the Term Loan were funded on July 27, 2012 and used to
repay the Bridge Loan in its entirety. BofA is the Term Loan s administrative agent and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner 
Smith Incorporated is the Term Loan s sole lead arranger and sole book manager. 

The Term Loan is evidenced by a Loan
Agreement dated July 27, 2012 by and among the Company, BofA and RBS Citizens (the Loan Agreement ). So long as there
is no default, the Company is obligated to pay interest only on the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan at a variable
rate equal to 30-day LIBOR plus 2.00 . The outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan, together with any accrued but unpaid
interest, is due and payable on July 27, 2017. Subject to payment by the Company of certain yield maintenance and redeployment
costs, the Term Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time. Any partial payment must be in an amount at least equal to
 100,000. 

 Although the interest rate on the
Term Loan is variable, under the Loan Agreement the Company was required to fix the 30-day LIBOR interest rate by entering into
an interest rate swap agreement with BofA. On July 27, 2012, the Company entered into an ISDA Master Agreement with BofA that
fixed the 30-day LIBOR interest rate on the Term Loan at 0.87 per annum for the term of the Term Loan. Accordingly, when combined
with the required 2.00 spread over 30-day LIBOR interest rate, the all-in interest rate on the Term Loan is 2.87 per annum.
 Total interest expense on the Term Loan for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 1,336,000. 

The BofA Note, the RBS Citizens Note and the
Loan Agreement are secured by an Amended and Restated Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture
Filing dated July 27, 2012 from the Company in favor of BofA as administrative agent for itself and other lenders (the Mortgage ),
an Environmental Indemnification and Release Agreement dated July 27, 2012 from the Company in favor of BofA as administrative
agent for itself and other lenders, a Collateral Assignment of Interest Rate Protection Agreement dated July 27, 2012 from the
Company in favor of BofA as administrative agent for itself and other lenders, and an Assignment and Subordination of Management
Agreement dated July 27, 2012 by and among the Company, BofA as administrative agent for itself and other lenders and Ryan Companies
US, Inc. The Mortgage constitutes a lien against the Property and has been recorded in the Office of the Hennepin County Registrar
of Titles. The documents evidencing and securing the Term Loan contain customary representations and warranties, as well as customary
events of default and affirmative and negative covenants. The Company was in compliance with the Term Loan covenants as of December
31, 2012. 

4. Financial
Instruments: Derivatives and Hedging 

On July 27, 2012, the Company fixed the 30-day
LIBOR interest rate for the five year term of the Term Loan at 0.87 per annum pursuant to an interest rate swap agreement.

4. Financial
Instruments: Derivatives and Hedging (continued) 

The interest swap agreement qualifies as a
cash flow hedge and has been recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. If a derivative qualifies as a hedge,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair
value of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the
hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately
recognized in earnings, which may increase or decrease reported net income (loss) and stockholders equity prospectively,
depending on future levels of interest rates and other variables affecting the fair values of derivative instruments and hedged
items, but will have no effect on cash flows. 

The following table summarizes the notional
and fair value of our derivative financial instrument at December 31, 2012. The notional value is an indication of the extent of
our involvement in these instruments at that time, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rate or market risks (in
thousands).

As of December 31, 2012, the derivative instrument
was reported as an obligation at its fair value of approximately 1,024,000. This is included in other liabilities: derivative
termination value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2012. Offsetting adjustments are represented as deferred gains
or losses on derivative financial instruments in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 1,024,000. 

The Company was hedging exposure to variability
in future cash flows for forecasted transactions in addition to anticipated future interest payments on existing debt. 

5. Income Taxes 

The Company files as a REIT
under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In order to qualify as a REIT, the Company is required
to distribute at least 90 of its taxable income to stockholders and to meet certain asset and income tests as well as certain
other requirements. The Company will generally not be liable for federal income taxes, provided it satisfies these requirements.
Even as a qualified REIT, the Company is subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property. 

The Company
adopted an accounting pronouncement related to uncertainty in income taxes effective January 1, 2007, which did not result in recording
a liability, nor was any accrued interest and penalties recognized with the adoption. Accrued interest and penalties will be recorded
as income tax expense, if the Company records a liability in the future. The Company s effective tax rate was not affected
by the adoption. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the State of Minnesota jurisdiction.
The statute of limitations for the Company s income tax returns is generally three years and as such, the Company s
returns that remain subject to examination would be from 2009 and thereafter. 

For the period ended December 31, 2006
and for the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company incurred a net operating loss for income tax purposes of approximately 4,166,000
and 3,087,000 that can be carried forward until it expires in the year 2026 and 2032, respectively. 

At December 31, 2012, the Company s
net tax basis of its real estate assets was 106,131,000.

of a share of Preferred Stock. 

In addition to certain rights to remove and
replace directors, the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall have the further right to
