 Citibank, N.A. Citibank ), as Indenture Trustee, has provided the following information for inclusion in this report on Form 10-K: 
 
 On June 18, 2014, a civil action was filed against Citibank in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by a group of investors in 48 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee, asserting claims for purported violations of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on Citibank s alleged failure to perform its duties as trustee for the 48 RMBS trusts. On November 24, 2014, plaintiffs sought leave to withdraw this action. On the same day, a smaller subset of similar plaintiff investors in 27 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee, filed a new civil action against Citibank in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York asserting similar claims as the prior action filed in state court. In January 2015, the court closed plaintiffs original state court action. Citibank s motion to dismiss the federal complaint was fully briefed as of May 13, 2015. On September 8, 2015, the federal court dismissed all claims as to 24 of the 27 trusts and allowed certain of the claims to proceed as to the other three trusts. That case, involving the three remaining trusts, is pending. 
 
 On November 24, 2015, the same investors that brought the federal case brought a new civil action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York related to 25 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee. This case includes the 24 trusts previously dismissed in the federal action, and one additional trust. The investors assert claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of New York s Streit Act. Citibank filed a motion to dismiss this case on February 26, 2016. 
 
 On August 19, 2015, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as Receiver for a financial institution filed a civil action against Citibank in the Southern District of New York. This action relates to one private-label RMBS trust for which Citibank formerly served as trustee. FDIC asserts claims for breach of contract, violation of the Streit Act, and violation of the Trust Indenture Act. Citibank is jointly briefing a motion to dismiss with The Bank of New York Mellon and U.S. Bank, entities that have also been sued by FDIC in their capacity as trustee, and whose cases are all in front of Judge Carter. Defendants joint motion to dismiss was fully briefed as of March 22, 2016. 

There can be no assurances as to the outcome of litigation or the possible impact of litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Citibank denies liability and continues to vigorously defend against these litigations. Furthermore, neither the above-disclosed litigations nor any other pending legal proceeding involving Citibank will materially affect Citibank s ability to perform its duties as Trustee under the Indenture for this ABS transaction.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 Board of Directors 
 Ally Financial Inc. 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Certification Regarding 
 Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Ally Financial Inc. (the Company 
 complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange 
 Commission s Regulation AB for the Consumer Automotive Receivables Platform (the Consumer 
 Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, and for the period from the respective dates 
 of sale during 2015 for each newly issued trust to December 31, 2015, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 
 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), 
 which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect 
 to the Consumer Platform. The Consumer Platform consists of the activities involved in the performance 
 of servicing functions for all publicly and privately issued retail and lease asset-backed transactions. 
 Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility 
 is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing 
 criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting 
 Oversight Board (United States), and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about 
 the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the 
 servicing activities related to the Consumer Platform, determining whether the Company performed those 
 selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing 
 such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to 
 selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, 
 accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed 
 transaction included in the Consumer Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect 
 noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may 
 have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered 
 by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our 
 examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing 
 criteria. 
 
 As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 
 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii) and 1122(d)(4)(viii), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain 
 activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that the vendors are not 
 considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take 
 responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to the vendors as permitted 
 by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers 
 (C DI 200.06) (formerly SEC Manual Telephone Interpretation 17.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, 
 the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable 
 assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable 
 to the vendors. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to 
 apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no 
 procedures with respect to the Company's determination of its eligibility to use C DI 200.06. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned applicable 
 servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, and for the period from the respective 
 dates of sale for each trust to December 31, 2015, for the Consumer Automotive Receivables Platform is 
 fairly stated, in all material respects.

Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 In our opinion, management s assessment that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 is fairly stated, in all material respects.
