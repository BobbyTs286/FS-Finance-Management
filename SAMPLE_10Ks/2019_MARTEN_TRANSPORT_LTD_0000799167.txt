PART I 

ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Overview 

We have strategically transitioned from a long-haul carrier to a multifaceted business offering a network of truck-based transportation capabilities across our five distinct business platforms Truckload, Dedicated, Intermodal, Brokerage and MRTN de Mexico. We are one of the leading temperature-sensitive truckload carriers in the United States, specializing in transporting and distributing food and other consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment. Our dry freight services are expanding, with 1,600 dry vans operating as of December 31, 2018. In 2018, we generated 787.6 million in operating revenue. Approximately 58 of our Truckload and Dedicated revenue in 2018 resulted from hauling temperature-sensitive products and 42 from hauling dry freight. We operate throughout the United States and in parts of Canada and Mexico, with substantially all of our revenue generated from within the United States. We provide regional truckload carrier services in the Southeast, West Coast, Midwest, South Central and Northeast regions. Our primary medium-to-long-haul traffic lanes are between the Midwest and the West Coast, Southwest, Southeast, and the East Coast, as well as from California to the Pacific Northwest. In 2018, our average length of haul was 433 miles. 

Our growth strategy is to expand our business organically by offering shippers a high level of service and significant freight capacity. We market primarily to shippers that offer consistent volumes of freight in the lanes we prefer and are willing to compensate us for a high level of service. With our fleet of 2,755 company and independent contractor tractors, we offer service levels that include up to 99 on-time performance and delivery within the narrow time windows often required when shipping perishable commodities. 

We have four reporting segments Truckload, Dedicated, Intermodal and Brokerage. Financial information regarding these segments can be found in Footnote 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

The primary source of our operating revenue is provided by our Truckload segment through a combination of regional short-haul and medium-to-long-haul full-load transportation services. We transport food and other consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment, along with dry freight, across the United States and into and out of Mexico and Canada. 

Our Dedicated segment provides customized transportation solutions tailored to meet individual customers requirements, utilizing temperature-controlled trailers, dry vans and other specialized equipment within the United States. Our agreements with customers range from three to five years and are subject to annual rate reviews. 

Our Intermodal segment transports our customers freight within the United States utilizing our temperature-controlled trailers on railroad flatcars for portions of trips, with the balance of the trips using our tractors or, to a lesser extent, contracted carriers. 

1

Our Brokerage segment develops contractual relationships with and arranges for third-party carriers to transport freight for our customers in temperature-controlled trailers and dry vans within the United States and into and out of Mexico through Marten Transport Logistics, LLC, which was established in 2007 and operates pursuant to brokerage authority granted by the DOT. We retain the billing, collection and customer management responsibilities. 

Operating results of our MRTN de Mexico business which offers our customers door-to-door service between the United States and Mexico with our Mexican partner carriers is reported within our Truckload and Brokerage segments. 

Organized under Wisconsin law in 1970, we are a successor to a sole proprietorship Roger R. Marten founded in 1946. In 1988, we reincorporated under Delaware law. Our executive offices are located at 129 Marten Street, Mondovi, Wisconsin 54755. Our telephone number is (715) 926-4216. 

We maintain a website at www.marten.com . We are not including the information contained on our website as a part of, nor incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We post on our website, free of charge, documents that we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and proxy statements, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also provide a link on our website to Forms 3, 4 and 5 that our officers, directors and 10 stockholders file with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Marketing and Operations 

We approach our business as an integrated effort of marketing and operations. We target food and consumer packaged goods companies whose products require temperature-sensitive services and who ship multiple truckloads per week. By emphasizing high-quality service, we seek to become a core carrier for our customers. In 2018, our largest customer was Walmart. 

Our marketing efforts are conducted by a staff of 238 sales, customer service and support personnel under the supervision of our senior management team. Marketing personnel travel within their regions to solicit new customers and maintain contact with existing customers. Customer service managers regularly contact customers to solicit additional business on a load-by-load basis. 

Our operations and sales personnel strive to improve our asset productivity by seeking freight that allows for rapid turnaround times, minimizes non-revenue miles between loads, and carries a favorable rate structure. Once we have established a customer relationship, customer service managers work closely with our fleet managers to match customer needs with our capacity and the location of revenue equipment. Fleet managers use our optimization system to assign loads to satisfy customer and operational requirements, as well as to meet the routing needs of our drivers. We attempt to route most of our trucks over selected operating lanes, which we believe assists us in meeting customer requirements, balancing traffic, reducing non-revenue miles, and improving the reliability of delivery schedules. 

We employ technology in our operations when we believe that it will allow us to operate more efficiently and the investment is cost-justified. Examples of the technologies we employ include: 

Terrestrial and satellite-based tracking and messaging that allows us to communicate with our drivers, obtain load position updates, provide our customers with freight visibility, and download operating information such as fuel mileage and idling time for the tractor engines and temperature setting and run time for the temperature-control units on our trailers. 

Freight optimization software that assists us in selecting loads that match our overall criteria, including profitability, repositioning, identifying capacity for expedited loads, driver availability and home time, and other factors. 

Electronic data interchange and internet communication with customers concerning freight tendering, invoices, shipment status, and other information. 

Electronic logging devices in our tractors to monitor drivers hours of service. 

2

Auxiliary power units installed on our company-owned tractors that allow us to decrease fuel costs associated with idling our tractors. 

Fuel-routing software that optimizes the fuel stops for each trip to take advantage of volume discounts available in our fuel network. 

We believe this integrated approach to our marketing and operations, coupled with our use of technology, has allowed us to provide our customers with a high level of service and support our revenue growth in an efficient manner. For example, we produced a non-revenue mile percentage of 6.2 during 2018, which points to the efficiency of our operations and we believe compares favorably to other temperature-sensitive and dry van trucking companies. 

Major Customers 

A significant portion of our revenue is generated from our major customers. In 2018, our top 30 customers accounted for approximately 65 of our revenue, and our top ten customers accounted for 46 of our revenue. We have emphasized increasing our customer diversity which is shown by the decrease in the portion of our revenue with our top customers. In 2010, our top 30 customers accounted for approximately 78 of our revenue, and our top ten customers accounted for 52 of our revenue. Eight of our top ten customers have been significant customers of ours for the last ten years. We believe we are the largest or second largest temperature-sensitive carrier for six of our top ten customers. We believe our relationships with these key customers are sound, but we are dependent upon them and the loss of some or all of their business could have a materially adverse effect on our results. 

Drivers and Other Personnel 

We believe that maintaining a safe and productive professional driver group is essential to providing excellent customer service and achieving profitability. As of December 31, 2018, 183 of our drivers have driven more than one million miles for us without a preventable accident, while 47 of our drivers have driven more than two million miles, 13 of our drivers have driven more than three million miles and one of our drivers has driven more than four million miles for us without a preventable accident. 

We select drivers, including independent contractors, using our specific guidelines for safety records, including drivers Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or CSA, scores, driving experience, and personal evaluations. We maintain stringent screening, training, and testing procedures for our drivers to reduce the potential for accidents and the corresponding costs of insurance and claims. We train new drivers at a number of our terminals in all phases of our policies and operations, as well as in safety techniques and fuel-efficient operation of the equipment. All new drivers also must pass DOT required tests prior to assignment to a vehicle. 

We primarily pay company-employed drivers a fixed rate per mile. The rate increases based on length of service. We also compensate drivers after one hour of detention, for inclement weather and for road service delays. Drivers also are eligible for bonuses based upon safe, efficient driving. We pay independent contractors a fixed rate per mile. Independent contractors pay for their own fuel, insurance, maintenance, and repairs. 

Competition in the trucking industry for qualified drivers is normally intense and is expected to increase. Our operations have been impacted, and from time-to-time we have experienced under-utilization and increased expense, as a result of a shortage of qualified drivers. We place a high priority on the recruitment and retention of an adequate supply of qualified drivers. 

As of December 31, 2018, we had 3,589 employees. This total consists of 2,718 drivers, 304 mechanics and maintenance personnel, and 567 support personnel, which includes management and administration. As of that date, we also contracted with 46 independent contractors. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit. We consider relations with our employees to be good.

Revenue Equipment 

Our revenue equipment programs are an important part of our overall goal of profitable growth. We evaluate our equipment decisions based on factors such as initial cost, useful life, warranty terms, expected maintenance costs, fuel economy, driver comfort, customer needs, manufacturer support, and resale value. We generally operate newer, well-maintained equipment with uniform specifications to minimize our spare parts inventory, streamline our maintenance program, and simplify driver training. 

As of December 31, 2018, we operated a fleet of 2,755 tractors, including 2,709 company-owned tractors and 46 tractors supplied by independent contractors. The average age of our company-owned tractor fleet at December 31, 2018 was approximately 1.7 years. In 2018, we replaced our company-owned tractors within an average of 3.7 years after purchase. 

Freightliner and Kenworth manufacture most of our company-owned tractors. Maintaining a relatively new and standardized fleet allows us to operate most miles while the tractors are under warranty to minimize repair and maintenance costs. It also enhances our ability to attract drivers, increases fuel economy, and improves customer acceptance by minimizing service interruptions caused by breakdowns. We adhere to a comprehensive maintenance program during the life of our equipment. We perform most routine servicing and repairs at our terminal facilities to reduce costly on-road repairs and out-of-route trips. We do not have any agreements with tractor manufacturers pursuant to which they agree to repurchase the tractors or guarantee a residual value, and we therefore could incur losses upon disposition if resale values of used tractors decline. 

The EPA adopted revised emissions control regulations, which required progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines. The last of three stepped reductions in exhaust emissions was effective for engines manufactured in January 2010 and thereafter. Since the beginning of 2016, all of the company-owned tractors in our fleet have tractor engines that were manufactured in January 2010 or thereafter and, therefore, were required to meet the revised design requirements. Compliance with these regulations has increased the cost of new tractors as manufacturers have significantly increased new equipment prices, in part to meet the more stringent engine design requirements imposed by the EPA. 

We historically have contracted with independent contractors to provide and operate a portion of our tractor fleet. Independent contractors own their own tractors and are responsible for all associated expenses, including financing costs, fuel, maintenance, insurance, and taxes. The percentage of our fleet provided by independent contractors was 1.7 at December 31, 2018, 2.2 at December 31, 2017 and 2.4 at December 31, 2016. 

As of December 31, 2018, we operated a fleet of 5,347 trailers, consisting of 3,747 refrigerated trailers and 1,600 dry vans. Most of our refrigerated trailers are equipped with Thermo-King refrigeration units, air ride suspensions, and anti-lock brakes. The average age of our trailer fleet at December 31, 2018 was approximately 2.5 years. In 2018, we replaced our company-owned trailers within an average of 5.5 years after purchase. 

Insurance and Claims 

We self-insure for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from workers compensation, auto liability, general liability, cargo and property damage claims, as well as employees health insurance. We are responsible for our proportionate share of the legal expenses relating to such claims as well. We reserve currently for anticipated losses and expenses. We periodically evaluate and adjust our insurance and claims reserves to reflect our experience. We have 14.6 million in standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of claims under agreements with our insurance carriers and regulatory authorities. We maintain insurance coverage for per-incident and total losses in excess of the amounts for which we self-insure up to specified policy limits with licensed insurance carriers. Insurance carriers have raised premiums for many businesses, including trucking companies, which increases our insurance and claims expense, along with other factors. We believe that our policy of self-insuring up to set limits, together with our safety and loss prevention programs, are effective means of managing insurance costs. 

4

Fuel 

Our operations are heavily dependent upon the use of diesel fuel. The price and availability of diesel fuel can vary and are subject to political, economic, and market factors that are beyond our control. Fuel prices fluctuated dramatically and quickly at various times during the last three years. We actively manage our fuel costs by purchasing fuel in bulk in Mondovi, Wisconsin and at a number of our other maintenance facilities throughout the country and have volume purchasing arrangements with national fuel centers that allow our drivers to purchase fuel at a discount while in transit. During 2018, nearly 100 of our fuel purchases were made at these designated locations. To help further reduce fuel consumption, we have equipped our company-owned tractors with auxiliary power units since 2007. These units reduce fuel consumption by providing quiet climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine. We have also invested in satellite tracking equipment for the temperature-control units on our trailers that has improved fuel usage through management of required temperature settings and run time of the units. 

We further manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices through fuel surcharge programs with our customers and other measures that we have implemented. We have historically been able to pass through a significant portion of long-term increases in fuel prices and related taxes to customers in the form of fuel surcharges. These fuel surcharges, which adjust with the cost of fuel, enable us to recover a substantial portion of the higher cost of fuel as prices increase, except for non-revenue miles, out-of-route miles or fuel used while the tractor is idling. As of December 31, 2018, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations. 

Competition 

We are one of the leading carriers operating in the temperature-sensitive segment of the truckload market, and our dry freight services are expanding. These markets are highly competitive, and we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with less-than-truckload carriers, railroads, and other transportation companies, many of which have more equipment, a wider range of services, and greater capital resources than we do or have other competitive advantages. We also compete with other motor carriers for the services of drivers, independent contractors, and management employees. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business are service, freight rates, capacity, use of technology and financial stability, which positions us well to compete in these segments. 

Regulation 

The United States Department of Transportation, or DOT, and various state and local agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety and insurance requirements. Our company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing, medical and continuous training qualification and hours-of-service. 

The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or FMCSA, imposes safety and fitness regulations on us and our drivers. In December 2010, the FMCSA introduced the Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or CSA, system to measure and evaluate the on-road safety performance of commercial carriers and individual drivers. CSA s Motor Carrier Safety Measurement System replaced the former SafeStat system and has removed a number of drivers from the industry as carriers are less willing to hire and retain drivers with marginal ratings, which has increased competition for qualified drivers. The FMCSA issued in January 2016 a proposed Safety Fitness Determination rule that would replace the current system utilizing CSA scores. The proposed methodology would integrate on-road safety data from inspections with the results of carrier investigations and accident reports. A final rule has not yet been issued. 

The FMCSA issued a regulatory rule effective in July 2013 that revised the hours-of-service requirements for drivers, which designate the length of time that drivers are allowed to drive and work. The rule retained the 11-hour driving maximum under which the industry has been operating since 2004. However, changes to the 34-hour restart provision and required breaks effectively reduced the maximum workweek for drivers. These changes reduced on-duty non-driving time and moderately decreased industry productivity. Omnibus bills adopted in each of December 2014, December 2015 and December 2016 have suspended the additional restrictions effective in July 2013 to the 34-hour restart provision. The restart rules are required by law to remain suspended until a comprehensive study on the impact of the rules is presented to Congress, who will determine any policy changes based on their review. This review has not yet taken place. 

5

In January 2011, the FMCSA issued a regulatory proposal requiring commercial carriers to track compliance with hours-of-service regulations using electronic logging devices, or ELD s, which was vacated and sent back to the FMCSA for further analysis and review in September 2011 by the 7 th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act, or MAP-21 Act, included a provision directing the FMCSA to develop a final ELD rule in 2013, which was delayed until its issuance in December 2015. The final rule required compliance beginning in December 2017 which was strictly enforced beginning in April 2018. Our entire tractor fleet has been equipped with ELD s since early 2011. 

The EPA adopted revised emissions control regulations, which required progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines. The last of three stepped reductions in exhaust emissions was effective for engines manufactured in January 2010 and thereafter. Since the beginning of 2016, all of the company-owned tractors in our fleet have tractor engines that were manufactured in January 2010 or thereafter and, therefore, were required to meet the revised design requirements. Compliance with these regulations has increased the cost of new tractors as manufacturers have significantly increased new equipment prices, in part to meet the more stringent engine design requirements imposed by the EPA. 

We are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, fuel storage tanks, air emissions from our facilities, engine idling, and discharge and retention of storm water. These regulations did not have a significant impact on our operations or financial results in 2016 through 2018. 

ITEM 1A. 

RISK FACTORS 

The following factors are important and should be considered carefully in connection with any evaluation of our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, or an investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company or our financial results. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations or affect our financial results. 

Our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely beyond our control, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results . Our business is dependent on a number of general economic and business factors that may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include excess capacity in the trucking industry, strikes or other work stoppages, and significant increases or fluctuations in interest rates, fuel taxes, fuel prices, and license and registration fees. We are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles, particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers. Economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services. 

It is not possible to predict the effects of actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, military action against any foreign state, heightened security requirements, or other related events and the subsequent effects on the economy or on consumer confidence in the United States, or the impact, if any, on our future results of operations. 

Instability of the credit markets and the resulting effects on the economy could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. If the credit markets and the economy weaken, our business, financial results, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, especially if consumer confidence declines and domestic spending decreases. We may need to incur additional indebtedness, which may include drawing on our credit facility, or issue debt securities in the future to fund working capital requirements, make investments, or for general corporate purposes. Additionally, stresses in the credit market causes uncertainty in the equity markets, which may result in volatility of the market price for our securities. 

We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, and numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability . We compete with many other truckload carriers that provide temperature-sensitive service and dry freight of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with less-than-truckload carriers, railroads and other transportation companies, many of which have more equipment, a wider range of services and greater capital resources than we do or have other competitive advantages. Many of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain significant growth in our business. In addition, many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so-called core carriers as approved service providers, or conduct bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and in some instances, we may not be selected as a core carrier or to provide service under such bids. 

6

In addition, the trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size. Competition from freight logistics and brokerage companies may negatively impact our customer relationships and freight rates. Furthermore, economies of scale that may be passed on to smaller carriers by procurement aggregation providers may improve such carriers ability to compete with us. 

If the growth in our regional operations declines, or if we expand into a market with insufficient economic activity, our results of operations could be adversely affected. We operate regional service centers which are located in a number of cities within the United States. In order to support future growth, these regional operations require the commitment of additional capital, revenue equipment and facilities along with qualified management, drivers and other personnel. Should the growth in our regional operations decline, the results of our operations could be adversely affected. It may become more difficult to identify additional cities that can support service centers, and we may expand into cities where there is insufficient economic activity, reduced capacity for growth or less driver and non-driver personnel to support our operations. We may encounter operating conditions in these new markets that materially differ from our current operations and customer relationships may be difficult to obtain at appropriate freight rates. Also, we may not be able to apply our regional operating strategy successfully in additional cities, and it might take longer than expected or require a more substantial financial commitment than anticipated to establish our operations in the additional cities. 

Increased prices and restricted availability of new revenue equipment could cause our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer . We have experienced higher prices for new tractors and trailers over the past few years, primarily as a result of higher commodity prices and government regulations applicable to newly manufactured tractors and trailers. We expect to continue to pay increased prices for revenue equipment for the foreseeable future. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors and trailers or if we have to pay increased prices for new revenue equipment. 

The EPA adopted revised emissions control regulations, which required progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines. The last of three stepped reductions in exhaust emissions was effective for engines manufactured in January 2010 and thereafter. Since the beginning of 2016, all of the company-owned tractors in our fleet have tractor engines that were manufactured in January 2010 or thereafter and, therefore, were required to meet the revised design requirements. Compliance with these regulations has increased the cost of new tractors as manufacturers have significantly increased new equipment prices, in part to meet the more stringent engine design requirements imposed by the EPA. 

We have significant ongoing capital requirements that could harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operations. The truckload industry is capital intensive, and our policy of operating newer equipment requires us to expend significant amounts annually. If we elect to expand our fleet in future periods, our capital needs would increase. We expect to pay for projected capital expenditures with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms in the future, we may have to limit our growth, enter into less favorable financing arrangements, or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability. 

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from our major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business . A significant portion of our revenue is generated from our major customers. For 2018, our top 30 customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 65 of our revenue; our top ten customers accounted for approximately 46 of our revenue; our top five customers accounted for approximately 37 of our revenue; our top two customers accounted for approximately 28 of our revenue; and our largest customer accounted for approximately 15 of our revenue. Generally, other than for our Dedicated operations, we enter into one-year contracts with our major customers, the majority of which do not contain any firm obligations to ship with us. We cannot ensure that, upon expiration of existing contracts, these customers will continue to use our services or that, if they do, they will continue at the same levels. Many of our customers periodically solicit bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress freight rates or result in loss of business to our competitors. Some of our customers also operate their own private trucking fleets, and they may decide to transport more of their own freight. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results. 

Ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly affect our earnings . Our future insurance and claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We self-insure for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from workers compensation, auto liability, general liability, cargo and property damage claims, as well as employees health insurance. We also are responsible for our legal expenses relating to such claims. We reserve currently for anticipated losses and expenses. We periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts. 

7

We maintain insurance above the amounts for which we self-insure with licensed insurance carriers. Although we believe the aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims, it is possible that one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. Insurance carriers have raised premiums for many businesses, including trucking companies. As a result, our insurance and claims expense has increased. If these expenses increase, or if we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, or we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided, results of our operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 

We operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our business . The DOT and various state and local agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety and insurance requirements. Our company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing, medical and continuous training qualification and hours-of-service. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions, ergonomics, or other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Other agencies, such as the EPA and the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, also regulate our equipment, operations, and drivers. Future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in our operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services, or require us to incur significant additional costs. Higher costs incurred by us or by our suppliers who pass the costs onto us through higher prices could adversely affect our results of operations. 

The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or FMCSA, imposes safety and fitness regulations on us and our drivers. In December 2010, the FMCSA introduced the Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or CSA, system to measure and evaluate the on-road safety performance of commercial carriers and individual drivers. CSA s Motor Carrier Safety Measurement System replaced the former SafeStat system and has removed a number of drivers from the industry as carriers are less willing to hire and retain drivers with marginal ratings, which has increased competition for qualified drivers. The FMCSA issued in January 2016 a proposed Safety Fitness Determination rule that would replace the current system utilizing CSA scores. The proposed methodology would integrate on-road safety data from inspections with the results of carrier investigations and accident reports. A final rule has not yet been issued. 

The FMCSA issued a regulatory rule effective in July 2013 that revised the hours-of-service requirements for drivers, which designate the length of time that drivers are allowed to drive and work. The rule retained the 11-hour driving maximum under which the industry has been operating since 2004. However, changes to the 34-hour restart provision and required breaks effectively reduced the maximum workweek for drivers. These changes reduced on-duty non-driving time and moderately decreased industry productivity. Omnibus bills adopted in each of December 2014, December 2015 and December 2016 have suspended the additional restrictions effective in July 2013 to the 34-hour restart provision. The restart rules are required by law to remain suspended until a comprehensive study on the impact of the rules is presented to Congress, who will determine any policy changes based on their review. This review has not yet taken place. 

In January 2011, the FMCSA issued a regulatory proposal requiring commercial carriers to track compliance with hours-of-service regulations using electronic logging devices, or ELD s, which was vacated and sent back to the FMCSA for further analysis and review in September 2011 by the 7 th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act, or MAP-21 Act, included a provision directing the FMCSA to develop a final ELD rule in 2013, which was delayed until its issuance in December 2015. The final rule required compliance beginning in December 2017 which was strictly enforced beginning in April 2018. Our entire tractor fleet has been equipped with ELD s since early 2011. 

From time to time, various federal, state, or local taxes are increased, including taxes on fuels. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any such increase applicable to us will be enacted, but such an increase could adversely affect our profitability. 

8

Increases in compensation or difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow . The transportation industry has historically experienced substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers, including independent contractors. With increased competition for drivers, including the impact that regulatory changes mandated by CSA have on the number of drivers in the transportation industry, we could experience greater difficulty in attracting sufficient numbers of qualified drivers. In addition, the available pool of independent contractor drivers is smaller than it has been historically. Accordingly, we may face difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers for all of our current tractors and for those we may add. Additionally, we may face difficulty in increasing the number of our independent contractor drivers. In addition, our industry suffers from high turnover rates of drivers. Our turnover rate requires us to recruit a substantial number of drivers. Moreover, our turnover rate could increase. If we are unable to continue to attract drivers and contract with independent contractors, we could be required to continue adjusting our driver compensation package beyond the norm or let trucks sit idle. An increase in our expenses or in the number of tractors without drivers could materially and adversely affect our growth and profitability. 

If demand declines for our used revenue equipment, it could result in decreased equipment sales, resale values, and gains on sales of assets. The market for used revenue equipment is subject to a number of factors, including fluctuations in demand and prices. We do not have any agreements with tractor manufacturers pursuant to which they agree to repurchase our tractors or guarantee a residual value. As such, we are sensitive to changes in used equipment prices and demand, especially with respect to tractors. Reduced demand for used equipment could result in a lower volume of sales or lower sales prices, either of which could negatively affect our gains on sales of assets. 

We depend on the stability, availability and security of the technology related to our management information and communication systems, which may prove to be inadequate . We depend upon our management information and communication systems for the efficient operation of our business. Our systems are used for receiving, planning and optimizing loads, communicating with and monitoring our drivers, tractors and trailers, billing customers and financial reporting. In addition, some of our key software has been developed internally by our programmers or by adapting purchased software to our needs and this software may not be easily modified or integrated with other software and systems. Our operations are potentially vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, internet failures, computer viruses, malware, hacking, and other events beyond our control. Although we have taken steps to prevent and mitigate service interruptions and data security threats, the operational and security risks associated with information technology systems have increased in recent years because of the complexity of the systems and the sophistication and amount of cyber attacks. Our business would be materially and adversely affected if our management information and communication systems are compromised or disrupted by a failure or security breach or if we are unable to improve, upgrade, integrate or expand our systems as we continue to execute our growth strategy. 

Fluctuations in the price or availability of fuel may increase our cost of operation, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability . We require large amounts of diesel fuel to operate our tractors and to power the temperature-control units on our trailers. Fuel is one of our largest operating expenses. Fuel prices tend to fluctuate, and prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political, economic and market factors that are beyond our control. We depend primarily on fuel surcharges, auxiliary power units for our tractors, satellite tracking equipment for the temperature-control units on our trailers, volume purchasing arrangements with truck stop chains and bulk purchases of fuel at our terminals to control and recover our fuel expenses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to collect fuel surcharges, enter into volume purchase agreements, or execute successful hedges in the future. Additionally, we may encounter decreases in productivity that may offset or eliminate savings from auxiliary power units or satellite tracking equipment, or we may incur unexpected maintenance or other costs associated with such units. The absence of meaningful fuel price protection through these measures, fluctuations in fuel prices, or a shortage of diesel fuel, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 

Seasonality and the impact of weather can affect our profitability . Our tractor productivity generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, with harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims and more equipment repairs. We can also suffer short-term impacts from weather-related events such as hurricanes, blizzards, ice-storms, and floods that could harm our results or make our results more volatile.

Lack of capacity , changes in equipment requirements and service instability in the railroad industry could increase our operating costs and reduce our ability to offer intermodal services, which could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and customer relationships . Our Intermodal segment is dependent on railroad services and their capacity to transport freight for our customers. We expect our dependence on railroads will continue to increase as we expand our Intermodal services. We compete for the availability of railroad services with other intermodal operators as well as certain industries reliant on the use of rail cars, such as oil and agricultural, whose consumption of railroad capacity has significantly fluctuated over the past several years. In most markets, rail service is limited to a few railroads or even a single railroad. Any capacity constraints, changes in equipment requirements, service problems or reduction in service by the railroads with which we have, or in the future may have, relationships is likely to increase the cost of the rail-based services we provide and reduce the reliability, timeliness, and overall attractiveness of our rail-based services, which could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and customer relationships. For example, certain railroads are considering requiring intermodal freight to be transported primarily using containers as opposed to trailers on flat cars, which could impact how we operate our intermodal business. Furthermore, railroads are relatively free to adjust shipping rates up or down as market conditions permit. Price increases could result in higher costs to our customers and reduce or eliminate our ability to offer Intermodal services. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate additional contracts with railroads to expand our capacity, add additional routes, or obtain multiple providers, which could limit our ability to provide this service. 

Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties . We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, fuel storage tanks, air emissions from our vehicles and facilities, engine idling, and discharge and retention of storm water. We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located, and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results. 

If we are unable to retain our executive officers and key management employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We are highly dependent upon the services of our executive officers and key management employees, including our Chief Executive Officer. Currently, we do not have employment agreements with these employees and the loss of their services for any reason could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and future profitability. We have entered into agreements with our executive officers that require us to provide compensation to them in the event of termination of their employment without cause in connection with or within a certain period of time after a change in control of our Company. In addition, we must continue to develop and retain a core group of managers if we are to realize our goal of expanding our operations and continuing our growth. While our Board regularly engages in succession planning for our Chief Executive Officer and executive leadership team, there is no guarantee that a candidate or plan will be successful. Although we strive to reduce the potential negative impact of any such changes, the loss of any executive officers or key management employees could result in disruptions to our operations. In addition, hiring, training, and successfully integrating replacement personnel, whether internal or external, could be time consuming, may cause additional disruptions to our operations, and may be unsuccessful, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

PART II 

ITEM 5. 

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol MRTN. On February 18, 2019, we had 134 record stockholders, and approximately 13,612 beneficial stockholders of our common stock. On July 7, 2017, we effected a five-for-three stock split of our common stock, .01 par value, in the form of a 66 2/3 stock dividend. The following cash dividends and share amounts have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the stock split for all periods presented. 

Dividend Policy 

In 2010, we announced a regular cash dividend program to our stockholders, subject to approval each quarter. Quarterly cash dividends of 0.025 per share of common stock were declared in each quarter of 2018 and totaled 5.5 million. Quarterly cash dividends of 0.015 per share of common stock were declared in each of the first two quarters of 2017 along with dividends of 0.025 per share in each of 2017 s last two quarters, which totaled 4.4 million. Quarterly cash dividends of 0.015 per share of common stock were declared in each quarter of 2016 and totaled 3.3 million. We currently expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. The payment of cash dividends in the future, and the amount of any such dividends, will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, and certain corporate law requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Our ability to pay cash dividends is currently limited by restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility, which prohibits us from paying, in any fiscal year, stock redemptions and dividends in excess of 25 of our net income from the prior fiscal year. A waiver of the 25 limitation for 2016 was obtained from the lender. 

Share Repurchase Program 

In 2007, our Board of Directors approved and we announced a share repurchase program to repurchase up to one million shares of our common stock either through purchases on the open market or through private transactions and in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. In 2015, our Board of Directors approved and we announced an increase in the share repurchase program, providing for the repurchase of up to 40 million, or approximately two million shares, of our common stock, which was increased by our Board of Directors to 3.3 million shares in August 2017 to reflect the five-for-three stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on July 7, 2017. The timing and extent to which we repurchase shares depends on market conditions and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. 

We repurchased and retired 200,000 shares of common stock for 3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. We did not repurchase any shares in 2017. We repurchased and retired 759,302 shares of our common stock for 7.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. As of December 31, 2018, future repurchases of up to 12.6 million, or 806,000 shares, were available in the share repurchase program.

ITEM 7. 

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appe aring elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the heading Risk Factors beginning on page 6 . We do not assume, and specifically disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this report. 

Overview 

We have strategically transitioned from a long-haul carrier to a multifaceted business offering a network of truck-based transportation capabilities across our five distinct business platforms Truckload, Dedicated, Intermodal, Brokerage and MRTN de Mexico. 

The primary source of our operating revenue is provided by our Truckload segment through a combination of regional short-haul and medium-to-long-haul full-load transportation services. We transport food and other consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment, along with dry freight, across the United States and into and out of Mexico and Canada. 

Our Dedicated segment provides customized transportation solutions tailored to meet individual customers requirements, utilizing temperature-controlled trailers, dry vans and other specialized equipment within the United States. Our agreements with customers range from three to five years and are subject to annual rate reviews. 

Generally, we are paid by the mile for our Truckload and Dedicated services. We also derive Truckload and Dedicated revenue from fuel surcharges, loading and unloading activities, equipment detention and other accessorial services. The main factors that affect our Truckload and Dedicated revenue are the rate per mile we receive from our customers, the percentage of miles for which we are compensated, the number of miles we generate with our equipment and changes in fuel prices. We monitor our revenue production primarily through average Truckload and Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per tractor per week. We also analyze our average Truckload and Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per total mile, non-revenue miles percentage, the miles per tractor we generate, our fuel surcharge revenue, our accessorial revenue and our other sources of operating revenue. 

Our Intermodal segment transports our customers freight within the United States utilizing our temperature-controlled trailers on railroad flatcars for portions of trips, with the balance of the trips using our tractors or, to a lesser extent, contracted carriers. The main factors that affect our Intermodal revenue are the rate per mile and other charges we receive from our customers. 

Our Brokerage segment develops contractual relationships with and arranges for third-party carriers to transport freight for our customers in temperature-controlled trailers and dry vans within the United States and into and out of Mexico through Marten Transport Logistics, LLC, which was established in 2007 and operates pursuant to brokerage authority granted by the DOT. We retain the billing, collection and customer management responsibilities. The main factors that affect our Brokerage revenue are the rate per mile and other charges that we receive from our customers. 

Operating results of our MRTN de Mexico business which offers our customers door-to-door service between the United States and Mexico with our Mexican partner carriers is reported within our Truckload and Brokerage segments. 

In addition to the factors discussed above, our operating revenue is also affected by, among other things, the United States economy, inventory levels, the level of truck and rail capacity in the transportation market, a contracting driver market, severe weather conditions and specific customer demand. 

16

Our operating revenue increased 89.5 million, or 12.8 , from 2017 to 2018. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 50.4 million, or 8.0 , compared with 2017. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 4.2 from 2017, primarily due to a reduction in our average number of tractors, partially offset by an increase in our average revenue per tractor. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 21.8 from 2017, primarily due to fleet growth driven by an increase in the number of Dedicated contracts we have with our customers. Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 21.8 due to increases in revenue per load and in volume. Brokerage segment revenue increased 22.7 also due to increases in revenue per load and in volume in 2018. Fuel surcharge revenue increased to 106.2 million in 2018 from 67.1 million in 2017 primarily due to higher fuel prices and a shift of a portion of line haul revenue to fuel surcharge revenue which began in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of changes in a number of customer agreements. The change reduced our revenue excluding fuel surcharges by 12.9 million in 2018 and increased our fuel surcharge revenue by the same amount. 

Our profitability is impacted by the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers, fixed costs, and expenses containing both fixed and variable components. The variable costs include fuel expense, driver-related expenses, such as wages, benefits, training, and recruitment, and independent contractor costs, which are recorded under purchased transportation. Expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our cost of insurance and claims. These expenses generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety, fleet age, efficiency and other factors. Our main fixed costs relate to the acquisition and subsequent depreciation of long-term assets, such as revenue equipment and operating terminals. We expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership will increase in future periods as a result of higher prices of new equipment, along with any increases in fleet size. Although certain factors affecting our expenses are beyond our control, we monitor them closely and attempt to anticipate changes in these factors in managing our business. For example, fuel prices have significantly fluctuated over the past several years. We manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices primarily through fuel surcharge programs with our customers, as well as through volume fuel purchasing arrangements with national fuel centers and bulk purchases of fuel at our terminals. To help further reduce fuel expense, we have installed and tightly manage the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to provide climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine, and also have improved the fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers. For our Intermodal and Brokerage segments, our profitability is impacted by the percentage of revenue which is payable to the providers of the transportation services we arrange. This expense is included within purchased transportation in our consolidated statements of operations. 

Our operating income improved 23.7 to 70.3 million in 2018 from 56.9 million in 2017. Our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or operating ratio, improved to 91.1 in 2018 from 91.9 in 2017. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, improved to 89.7 in 2018 from 91.0 in the 2017. Our net income was 55.0 million, or 1.00 per diluted share, in 2018 and 90.3 million, or 1.65 per diluted share, in 2017. Earnings in 2017 include a deferred income taxes benefit of 56.5 million recorded to recognize the impact on our federal net deferred tax liability of the reduction of the federal corporate statutory income tax rate from 35 to 21 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Excluding the deferred income taxes benefit, 2018 net income improved 62.7 from 2017 earnings of 33.8 million, or 0.62 per diluted share. 

Our business requires substantial, ongoing capital investments, particularly for new tractors and trailers. At December 31, 2018, we had 56.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, 576.0 million in stockholders equity and no long-term debt outstanding. In 2018, net cash flows provided by operating activities of 150.6 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of 93.9 million, to acquire and upgrade regional operating facilities in the amount of 5.9 million, to pay cash dividends of 5.5 million, and to repurchase and retire 200,000 shares of our common stock for 3.8 million, resulting in a 41.0 million increase in cash and cash equivalents. We estimate that capital expenditures, net of proceeds from dispositions, will be approximately 125 million in 2019. We believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months. Based upon anticipated cash flows, existing cash and cash equivalents balances, current borrowing availability and other sources of financing we expect to be available to us, we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future. 

17

This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes discussions of net income and diluted earnings per share, net of a deferred income taxes benefit; operating revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, each net of fuel surcharge revenue; and net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads). We provide these additional disclosures because management believes these measures provide a more consistent basis for comparing results of operations from period to period. These financial measures in this report have not been determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Pursuant to Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, we have included the amounts necessary to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of net income, diluted earnings per share, operating revenue, operating expenses divided by operating revenue, and fuel and fuel taxes. 

Stock Split 

On July 7, 2017, we effected a five-for-three stock split of our common stock, .01 par value, in the form of a 66 stock dividend. Our consolidated financial statements, related notes, and other financial data contained in this report have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the stock split for all periods presented. 

Adoption of New Revenue R ecognition Accounting Standard 

We account for our revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which we adopted on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Prior years have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The new revenue standard requires us to recognize revenue and related expenses within each of our four reporting segments over time, compared with our former policy in which we recorded revenue and related expenses on the date shipment of freight was completed.

Our operating revenue increased 89.5 million, or 12.8 , to 787.6 million in 2018 from 698.1 million in 2017. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 50.4 million, or 8.0 , to 681.4 million in 2018 from 631.0 million in 2017. This increase was due to a 33.4 million increase in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a 16.0 million increase in Brokerage revenue, and a 15.3 million increase in Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharges, partially offset by a 14.3 million decrease in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharge revenue increased to 106.2 million in 2018 from 67.1 million in 2017 primarily due to higher fuel prices and a shift of a portion of line haul revenue to fuel surcharge revenue which began in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of changes in a number of customer agreements. The change reduced our revenue excluding fuel surcharges by 12.9 million in 2018 and increased our fuel surcharge revenue by the same amount.

Truckload segment revenue decreased 4.9 million, or 1.3 , to 375.3 million in 2018 from 380.2 million in 2017. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 14.3 million, or 4.2 , to 322.3 million in 2018 from 336.6 million in 2017, primarily due to a reduction in our average number of tractors, partially offset by an increase in our average revenue per tractor. The shift from line haul revenue to fuel surcharge revenue as a result of changes in a number of customer agreements decreased our Truckload revenue excluding fuel surcharges by 2.8 million, or 32 per tractor per week, in 2018, and increased our fuel surcharge revenue by the same amount. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2018 was primarily due to the increase in our average revenue per tractor driven by increased rates with our customers. 

Dedicated segment revenue increased 57.0 million, or 34.1 , to 223.9 million in 2018 from 166.9 million in 2017. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 21.8 primarily due to fleet growth driven by an increase in the number of Dedicated contracts we have with our customers. The shift from line haul revenue to fuel surcharge revenue as a result of changes in a number of customer agreements decreased our Dedicated revenue excluding fuel surcharges by 10.1 million, or 179 per tractor per week, in 2018, and increased our fuel surcharge revenue by the same amount. The increase in the operating ratio for our Dedicated segment was primarily due to an increase in driver wages, an increase in bonus compensation expense for our non-driver employees and increased depreciation expense. 

Intermodal segment revenue increased 21.4 million, or 26.5 , to 102.0 million in 2018 from 80.6 million in 2017. Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 21.8 from 2017 due to increases in revenue per load and in volume. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in the amounts payable to railroads as a percentage of our revenue and increased rates with our customers. 

Brokerage segment revenue increased 16.0 million, or 22.7 , to 86.4 million in 2018 from 70.4 million in 2017 due to an increase in volume and rates with our customers. The increase in the operating ratio in 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the amounts payable to carriers for transportation services which we arranged as a percentage of our Brokerage revenue.

Salaries, wages and benefits consist of compensation for our employees, including both driver and non-driver employees, employees health insurance, 401(k) plan contributions and other fringe benefits. These expenses vary depending upon the size of our Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal tractor fleets, the ratio of company drivers to independent contractors, our efficiency, our experience with employees health insurance claims, changes in health care premiums and other factors. Salaries, wages and benefits expense increased 26.0 million, or 11.5 , in 2018 from 2017. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits from 2017 resulted primarily from an increase in company driver compensation expense of 11.1 million, an increase in bonus compensation expense for our non-driver employees of 5.4 million, and an increase in employees health insurance expense of 3.3 million due to an increase in our self-insured medical claims. 

Purchased transportation consists of amounts payable to railroads and carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with Brokerage and Intermodal operations and to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment. This category will vary depending upon the amount and rates, including fuel surcharges, we pay to third-party railroad and motor carriers, the ratio of company drivers versus independent contractors and the amount of fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors. Purchased transportation expense increased 26.3 million in total, or 22.2 , in 2018 from 2017. Amounts payable to carriers for transportation services we arranged in our Brokerage segment increased 13.7 million to 72.3 million in 2018 from 58.6 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase in brokerage revenue. Amounts payable to railroads and drayage carriers for transportation services within our Intermodal segment increased 13.6 million to 65.0 million in 2018 from 51.5 million in 2017. This increase was due to increased intermodal revenue along with increased fuel surcharges to the railroads due to higher fuel prices. The portion of purchased transportation expense related to our independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments, including fuel surcharges, decreased 1.1 million in 2018. We expect that purchased transportation expense will increase as we grow our Intermodal and Brokerage segments. 

Fuel and fuel taxes increased by 16.2 million, or 15.4 , in 2018 from 2017. Net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads) decreased 17.4 million, or 37.2 , to 29.4 million in 2018 from 46.8 million in 2017. Fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads increased to 14.0 million from 8.6 million in 2017. Despite an increase in the United States Department of Energy, or DOE, national average cost of fuel to 3.18 per gallon from 2.65 per gallon in 2017, net fuel expense decreased to 4.9 of Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, from 8.4 in 2017. The net fuel expense to revenue improved primarily due to a 12.9 million shift during 2018 of a portion of line haul revenue to fuel surcharge revenue as a result of changes in a number of customer agreements. Increases in our miles per gallon and in our revenue rate per mile in 2018 further improved this ratio. We have worked diligently to control fuel usage and costs by improving our volume purchasing arrangements and optimizing our drivers fuel purchases with national fuel centers, focusing on shorter lengths of haul, installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to minimize engine idling and improving fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers. Auxiliary power units, which we have installed in our company-owned tractors, provide climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine. 

Supplies and maintenance consist of repairs, maintenance, tires, parts, oil and engine fluids, along with load-specific expenses including loading/unloading, tolls, pallets and trailer hostling. Our supplies and maintenance expense decreased 760,000, or 1.8 , from 2017 primarily due to a decrease in our loading/unloading expense. 

Depreciation relates to owned tractors, trailers, auxiliary power units, communication units, terminal facilities and other assets. The increase in depreciation was primarily due to a continued increase in the cost of revenue equipment. We expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership will increase in future periods as a result of higher prices of new equipment, which will result in greater depreciation over the useful life. 

Gain on disposition of revenue equipment increased to 7.2 million in 2018 from 5.5 million in 2017 primarily due to an increase in the number of trailers sold, along with an increase in our average gain for each tractor and trailer sold. Future gains or losses on dispositions of revenue equipment will be impacted by the market for used revenue equipment, which is beyond our control. 

The 5.4 million increase in other operating expenses in 2018 was due in part to proceeds received in 2017 from the settlement of a lawsuit, net of 2017 legal expenses, of 1.0 million, and increased costs associated with recruiting and retaining drivers. 

21

As a result of the foregoing factors, our operating income improved 23.7 to 70.3 million in 2018 from 56.9 million in 2017. Our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or operating ratio, improved to 91.1 in 2018 from 91.9 in 2017. The operating ratio for our Truckload segment was 90.7 in 2018 and 93.1 in 2017, for our Dedicated segment was 91.7 in 2018 and 89.8 in 2017, for our Intermodal segment was 89.1 in 2018 and 89.7 in 2017, and for our Brokerage segment was 93.6 in 2018 and 92.7 in 2017. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, improved to 89.7 in 2018 from 91.0 in 2017. 

The increase in our non-operating income was primarily due to improved operating results in 2018 by MW Logistics, LLC, or MWL, a 45 owned affiliate. 

Our effective income tax rate increased to 22.5 in 2018 from (59.9 in 2017. We recorded a 56.5 million deferred income taxes benefit in 2017 to recognize the impact on our federal net deferred tax liability of the reduction of the federal corporate statutory income tax rate from 35 to 21 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was enacted prior to December 31, 2017. Excluding that benefit, our effective tax rate was 40.1 in 2017, which exceeds our effective tax rate in 2018 primarily due to the reduction of the federal corporate tax rate in 2018 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate as noted above and allowing bonus depreciation with full expensing of qualified property placed in service after September 27, 2017. 

As a result of the factors described above, net income was 55.0 million, or 1.00 per diluted share, in 2018 and 90.3 million, or 1.65 per diluted share, in 2017. Excluding the 56.5 million deferred income taxes benefit recorded in 2017, net income in 2018 improved 62.7 from 2017 earnings of 33.8 million, or 0.62 per diluted share.

Our operating revenue increased 27.0 million, or 4.0 , to 698.1 million in 2017 from 671.1 million in 2016. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 13.1 million, or 2.1 , to 631.0 million in 2017 from 617.9 million in 2016. This increase was due to a 6.7 million increase in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a 5.8 million increase in Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharges, and a 4.0 million increase in Brokerage revenue, partially offset by a 3.4 million decrease in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharge revenue increased to 67.1 million in 2017 from 53.2 million in 2016 due to higher fuel prices. 

Truckload segment revenue increased 4.4 million, or 1.2 , to 380.2 million in 2017 from 375.9 million in 2016. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 3.4 million, or 1.0 , to 336.6 million in 2017 from 340.0 million in 2016, primarily due to a reduction in our average number of tractors, partially offset by an increase in our average revenue per tractor. The increase in the operating ratio in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in insurance and claims expense, partially offset by the increase in our average revenue per tractor. 

23

Dedicated segment revenue increased 9.5 million, or 6.0 , to 166.9 million in 2017 from 157.4 million in 2016. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 4.5 primarily due to fleet growth and an increase in our average revenue per tractor. The increase in the operating ratio for our Dedicated segment was primarily due to an increase in insurance and claims expense, partially offset by the increase in our average revenue per tractor. 

Intermodal segment revenue increased 9.1 million, or 12.8 , to 80.6 million in 2017 from 71.5 million in 2016. Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, increased 9.0 from 2016 due to an increase in volume. The operating ratio in 2017 improved slightly from 2016. 

Brokerage segment revenue increased 4.0 million, or 6.0 , to 70.4 million in 2017 from 66.4 million in 2016 due to an increase in revenue per load. The improvement in the operating ratio in 2017 was achieved primarily through multiple cost control measures.

Salaries, wages and benefits expense increased 1.3 million, or 0.6 , in 2017 from 2016. The increase in salaries, wages and benefits from 2016 resulted primarily from an increase in non-driver bonus compensation expense of 2.3 million, partially offset by multiple other items. 

Purchased transportation expense increased 7.6 million in total, or 6.9 , in 2017 from 2016. Amounts payable to carriers for transportation services we arranged in our Brokerage segment increased 3.2 million to 58.6 million in 2017 from 55.4 million in 2016, primarily due to an increase in brokerage revenue. Amounts payable to railroads and drayage carriers for transportation services within our Intermodal segment increased 5.6 million to 51.5 million in 2017 from 45.9 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to increased intermodal revenue. The portion of purchased transportation expense related to our independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments, including fuel surcharges, decreased 1.2 million in 2017. 

24

Fuel and fuel taxes increased by 11.3 million, or 12.0 , in 2017 from 2016. Net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads) decreased 213,000, or 0.5 , to 46.8 million in 2017 from 47.0 million in 2016. Fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads increased to 8.6 million from 6.2 million in 2016. Despite an increase in the DOE national average cost of fuel to 2.65 per gallon from 2.30 per gallon in 2016, net fuel expense decreased to 8.4 of Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, from 8.5 in 2016. The net fuel expense to revenue improved in 2017 primarily due to increases in our miles per gallon and in our revenue rate per mile. We have worked diligently to control fuel usage and costs by improving our volume purchasing arrangements and optimizing our drivers fuel purchases with national fuel centers, focusing on shorter lengths of haul, installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to minimize engine idling and improving fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers. 

Our supplies and maintenance expense decreased 2.3 million, or 5.2 , from 2016 primarily due to decreased repair costs at external facilities and a reduction in parts costs. 

The increase in depreciation was primarily due to a continued increase in the cost of revenue equipment. 

Insurance and claims consist of the costs of insurance premiums and accruals we make for claims within our self-insured retention amounts, primarily for personal injury, property damage, physical damage to our equipment, cargo claims and workers compensation claims. These expenses will vary primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience, our self-insured retention levels and the market for insurance. The 6.4 million increase in insurance and claims in 2017 was primarily due to increases in the cost of physical damage claims related to our tractors and trailers, in self-insured workers compensation claims, and in auto liability insurance premiums. Our significant self-insured retention exposes us to the possibility of significant fluctuations in claims expense between periods which could materially impact our financial results depending on the frequency, severity and timing of claims. 

Gain on disposition of revenue equipment decreased to 5.5 million in 2017 from 10.5 million in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the average gain for tractors and trailers within a soft equipment market. 

The 3.2 million decrease in other operating expenses in 2017 was primarily due to proceeds received from the settlement of a lawsuit, net of current period legal expenses, of 1.0 million, along with multiple cost control measures. 

As a result of the foregoing factors, our operating income decreased to 56.9 million in 2017 from 58.3 million in 2016. Our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or operating ratio, was 91.9 in 2017 and 91.3 in 2016. The operating ratio for our Truckload segment was 93.1 in 2017 and 92.7 in 2016, for our Dedicated segment was 89.8 in 2017 and 87.6 in 2016, for our Intermodal segment was 89.7 in 2017 and 90.0 in 2016, and for our Brokerage segment was 92.7 in 2017 and 93.7 in 2016. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 91.0 in 2017 and 90.6 in 2016. 

The decrease in our non-operating expense was primarily due to improved operating results in 2017 by MWL, a 45 owned affiliate. 

Our effective income tax rate decreased to (59.9 in 2017 from 41.4 in 2016. We recorded a 56.5 million deferred income taxes benefit in 2017 to recognize the impact on our federal net deferred tax liability of the reduction of the federal corporate statutory income tax rate from 35 to 21 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Excluding that benefit, the effective tax rate was 40.1 in 2017. The decrease to 40.1 was due in part to certain federal employment tax credits realized as a discrete item and an excess tax benefit of 176,000 which was recorded as a decrease to the provision for income taxes in 2017 with the adoption of the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting in 2017. 

As a result of the factors described above, net income increased to 90.3 million, or 1.65 per diluted share, in 2017 from 33.5 million, or 0.61 per diluted share, in 2016. Excluding the deferred income taxes benefit, 2017 net income improved 1.1 to 33.8 million, or 0.62 per diluted share, from 2016. 

25

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our business requires substantial, ongoing capital investments, particularly for new tractors and trailers. Our primary sources of liquidity are funds provided by operations and our revolving credit facility. A portion of our tractor fleet is provided by independent contractors who own and operate their own equipment. We have no capital expenditure requirements relating to those drivers who own their tractors or obtain financing through third parties. 

The table below reflects our net cash flows provided by operating activities, net cash flows used for investing activities and net cash flows used for financing activities for the years indicated.

In 2007, our Board of Directors approved and we announced a share repurchase program to repurchase up to one million shares of our common stock either through purchases on the open market or through private transactions and in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. In 2015, our Board of Directors approved and we announced an increase in the share repurchase program, providing for the repurchase of up to 40 million, or approximately two million shares, of our common stock, which was increased by our Board of Directors to 3.3 million shares in August 2017 to reflect the five-for-three stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on July 7, 2017. The timing and extent to which we repurchase shares depends on market conditions and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. 

We repurchased and retired 200,000 shares of common stock for 3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. We did not repurchase any shares in 2017. We repurchased and retired 759,302 shares of our common stock for 7.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. As of December 31, 2018, future repurchases of up to 12.6 million, or 806,000 shares, were available in the share repurchase program. 

In 2018, net cash flows provided by operating activities of 150.6 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of 93.9 million, to acquire and upgrade regional operating facilities in the amount of 5.9 million, to pay cash dividends of 5.5 million, and to repurchase and retire 200,000 shares of our common stock for 3.8 million, resulting in a 41.0 million increase in cash and cash equivalents. In 2017, net cash flows provided by operating activities of 121.9 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of 87.6 million, to repay, net of borrowings, 7.9 million of long-term debt, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of 5.8 million, and to pay cash dividends of 4.4 million, resulting in a 15.3 million increase in cash and cash equivalents. In 2016, net cash flows provided by operating activities of 133.8 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of 89.9 million, to partially construct regional operating facilities in the amount of 5.1 million, to repay, net of borrowings, 30.0 million of long-term debt, to repurchase and retire 759,302 shares of our common stock for 7.5 million, and to pay cash dividends of 3.3 million. Beginning in 2018, our net cash flows are increased by the new tax laws established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which reduced the federal corporate statutory income tax rate and established bonus depreciation that allows for full expensing of qualified assets. 

We estimate that capital expenditures, net of proceeds from dispositions, will be approximately 125 million in 2019. Quarterly cash dividends of 0.025 per share of common stock were declared in each quarter of 2018 and totaled 5.5 million. Quarterly cash dividends of 0.015 per share of common stock were declared in each of the first two quarters of 2017 along with dividends of 0.025 per share in each of 2017 s last two quarters, which totaled 4.4 million. Quarterly cash dividends of 0.015 per share of common stock were declared in each quarter of 2016 and totaled 3.3 million. We currently expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. The payment of cash dividends in the future, and the amount of any such dividends, will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, and certain corporate law requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months. Based upon anticipated cash flows, existing cash and cash equivalents balances, current borrowing availability and other sources of financing we expect to be available to us, we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future. 

26

In August 2018, we entered into an amendment to our unsecured committed credit facility which reduces the aggregate principal amount of the facility from 40.0 million to 30.0 million and extends the term of the facility to August 2023. At December 31, 2018, there was no outstanding principal balance on the facility. As of that date, we had outstanding standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of self-insurance claims of 14.6 million and remaining borrowing availability of 15.4 million. This facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or the lender s Prime Rate, in each case plus/minus applicable margins. 

Our credit facility prohibits us from paying, in any fiscal year, stock redemptions and dividends in excess of 25 of our net income from the prior fiscal year. A waiver of the 25 limitation for 2016 was obtained from the lender. This facility also contains restrictive covenants which, among other matters, require us to maintain compliance with cash flow leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2018 and 2017. 

The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018.

Due to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows, the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan at December 31, 2018 of 241,348 shares of Company common stock with a value of 3.9 million has been excluded from the above table. 

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 

Other than standby letters of credit maintained in connection with our self-insurance programs in the amount of 14.6 million along with purchase obligations and operating leases summarized above in our summary of contractual obligations, we did not have any other material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2018. 

Inflation and Fuel Costs 

Most of our operating expenses are inflation-sensitive, with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations. During the past three years, the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices, accident claims, health insurance and employee compensation. We attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and cost control efforts. 

In addition to inflation, fluctuations in fuel prices can affect our profitability. We require substantial amounts of fuel to operate our tractors and power the temperature-control units on our trailers. Substantially all of our contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions. Although we historically have been able to pass through a significant portion of long-term increases in fuel prices and related taxes to customers in the form of fuel surcharges and higher rates, such increases usually are not fully recovered. These fuel surcharge provisions are not effective in mitigating the fuel price increases related to non-revenue miles or fuel used while the tractor is idling. 

Seasonality 

Our tractor productivity generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, with harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims, lower fuel efficiency and more equipment repairs.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition. We account for our revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which we adopted on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The new revenue standard requires us to recognize revenue and related expenses within each of our four reporting segments over time, compared with our former policy in which we recorded revenue and related expenses on the date shipment of freight was completed. 

We account for revenue of our Intermodal and Brokerage segments and revenue on freight transported by independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments on a gross basis because we are the principal service provider controlling the promised service before it is transferred to each customer. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide each specified service to each customer. We bear the primary risk of loss in the event of cargo claims by our customers. We also have complete control and discretion in establishing the price for each specified service. Accordingly, all such revenue billed to customers is classified as operating revenue and all corresponding payments to carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with brokerage and intermodal activities and to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment are classified as purchased transportation expense within our consolidated statements of operations. 

Accounts Receivable. We are dependent upon a limited number of customers, and, as a result, our trade accounts receivable are highly concentrated. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was 348,000 as of December 31, 2018 and 300,000 as of December 31, 2017. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past-due balances, including any billing disputes. In order to assess the collectibility of these receivables, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition. Through these evaluations, we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability, credit ratings or bankruptcy. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the best information available to us and is reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. We evaluate the allowance based on historical write-off experience, the size of the individual customer balances, past-due amounts and the overall national economy. We review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. 

Property and Equipment. The transportation industry requires significant capital investments. Our net property and equipment was 588.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and 571.9 million as of December 31, 2017. Our depreciation expense was 88.6 million in 2018, 85.1 million in 2017 and 82.4 million in 2016. We compute depreciation of our property and equipment for financial reporting purposes based on the cost of each asset, reduced by its estimated salvage value, using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. We determine and periodically evaluate our estimate of the projected salvage values and useful lives primarily by considering the market for used equipment, prior useful lives and changes in technology. We have not changed our policy regarding salvage values as a percentage of initial cost or useful lives of tractors and trailers within the last ten years. We believe that our policies and past estimates have been reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A 5 decrease in estimated salvage values would have decreased our net property and equipment as of December 31, 2018 by approximately 11.9 million, or 2.0 . 

Impairment of Assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell. 

28

Insurance and Claims. We self-insure, in part, for losses relating to workers compensation, auto liability, general liability, cargo and property damage claims, along with employees health insurance with varying risk retention levels. We maintain insurance coverage for per-incident and total losses in excess of these risk retention levels in amounts we consider adequate based upon historical experience and our ongoing review. However, we could suffer a series of losses within our self-insured retention limits or losses over our policy limits, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results. We are responsible for the first 1.0 million on each auto liability claim and for the first 750,000 on each workers compensation claim. We have 14.6 million in standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of claims under agreements with our insurance carriers and regulatory authorities. The insurance and claims accruals in our consolidated balance sheets were 28.1 million as of December 31, 2018 and 26.2 million as of December 31, 2017. We reserve currently for the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims. We periodically evaluate and adjust these reserves based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of outstanding individual claims and our estimate of future claims development based on historical development. Actual results could differ from these current estimates. In addition, to the extent that claims are litigated and not settled, jury awards are difficult to predict. 

Share-based Payment Arrangement Compensation. We have granted stock options to certain employees and non-employee directors. We recognize compensation expense for all stock options net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only record compensation expense for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (normally the vesting period). Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock options require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock options and stock price volatility. We use the Black-Scholes model to value our stock option awards. We believe that future volatility will not materially differ from our historical volatility. Thus, we use the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected life of the award. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock options represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, stock option compensation expense could be materially different in the future. 

We have also granted performance unit awards to certain employees which are subject to vesting requirements over a five-year period, primarily based on our earnings growth. The fair value of each performance unit is based on the closing market price on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for these awards based on the estimated number of units probable of achieving the performance and service vesting requirements of the awards, net of an estimated forfeiture rate.

ITEM 7A. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, most importantly the effects of the price and availability of diesel fuel. We require substantial amounts of diesel fuel to operate our tractors and power the temperature-control units on our trailers. The price and availability of diesel fuel can vary, and are subject to political, economic and market factors that are beyond our control. Significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Based upon our fuel consumption in 2018, a 5 increase in the average cost of diesel fuel would have increased our fuel expense by 6.0 million. 

We have historically been able to pass through a significant portion of long-term increases in diesel fuel prices and related taxes to customers in the form of fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharge programs are widely accepted among our customers, though they can vary somewhat from customer-to-customer. These fuel surcharges, which adjust weekly with the cost of fuel, enable us to recover a substantial portion of the higher cost of fuel as prices increase. These fuel surcharge provisions are not effective in mitigating the fuel price increases related to non-revenue miles or fuel used while the tractor is idling. In addition, we have worked diligently to control fuel usage and costs by improving our volume purchasing arrangements and optimizing our drivers fuel purchases with national fuel centers, focusing on shorter lengths of haul, installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to minimize engine idling and improving fuel usage in our trailers refrigeration units. 

While we do not currently have any outstanding hedging instruments to mitigate this market risk, we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge a portion of our fuel costs in the future.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for Marten Transport, Ltd. and subsidiaries (the Company ). This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projection of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management, with the participation of the Company s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this evaluation, management used the criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018. Further, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP, has issued a report on the Company s internal controls over financial reporting on page 31 of this Report.

MARTEN TRANSPORT, LTD. 

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

 December 31, 201 8 , 201 7 and 201 6 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Nature of business: Marten Transport, Ltd. is a multifaceted business offering a network of truck-based transportation capabilities across our five distinct business platforms Truckload, Dedicated, Intermodal, Brokerage and MRTN de Mexico. We are one of the leading temperature-sensitive truckload carriers in the United States, specializing in transporting and distributing food and other consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment. Our dry freight services are expanding, with 1,600 dry vans operating as of December 31, 2018. We operate throughout the United States and into and out of Mexico and Canada. 

Principles of consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include Marten Transport, Ltd. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. 

Cash and cash equivalents: Cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in short-term, highly liquid investments. We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced any losses in such accounts. 

Trade accounts receivable: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past-due balances, including any billing disputes. In order to assess the collectibility of these receivables, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition. Through these evaluations, we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability, credit ratings or bankruptcy. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the best information available to us and is reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. We evaluate the allowance based on historical write-off experience, the size of the individual customer balances, past-due amounts and the overall national economy. We review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. Invoice balances over 30 days after the contractual due date are considered past due per our policy and are reviewed individually for collectibility. Initial payments by new customers are monitored for compliance with contractual terms. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential recovery is considered remote. 

Property and equipment: Additions and improvements to property and equipment are capitalized at cost. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to operations. Gains and losses on disposals of revenue equipment are included in operations as they are a normal, recurring component of our operations. 

Depreciation is computed based on the cost of the asset, reduced by its estimated salvage value, using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. We begin depreciating assets in the month that each asset is placed in service and, therefore, is ready for its intended use, and depreciate each asset until it is taken out of service and available for sale. Accelerated methods are used for income tax reporting purposes. Following is a summary of estimated useful lives for financial reporting purposes: 

Years 

Tractors 

5 

Trailers 

7 

Service and other equipment 

3 
			 - 
			 15 

Buildings and improvements 

20 
			 - 
			 40 

In 2018, we replaced our company-owned tractors within an average of 3.7 years and our trailers within an average of 5.5 years after purchase. Our useful lives for depreciating tractors is five years and for trailers is seven years, with a 25 salvage value for tractors and a 35 salvage value for trailers. These salvage values are based upon the expected market values of the equipment after five years for tractors and seven years for trailers. Depreciation expense calculated in this manner approximates the continuing declining value of the revenue equipment, and continues at a consistent straight-line rate for units held beyond the normal replacement cycle. 

37

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell. 

Tires in service: The cost of original equipment and replacement tires placed in service is capitalized. Amortization is calculated based on cost, less estimated salvage value, using the straight-line method over 24 months. Tire amortization, which is included within supplies and maintenance in our consolidated statements of operations, was 7.0 million in 2018, 7.1 million in 2017 and 6.9 million in 2016. The current portion of capitalized tires in service is included in prepaid expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The long-term portion of capitalized tires in service and the estimated salvage value are included in revenue equipment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The cost of recapping tires is charged to operations as incurred. 

Income taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We have reflected the necessary deferred tax assets and liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We believe the future tax deductions will be realized principally through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income. 

In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than- not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than- not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense. 

Insurance and claims: We self-insure, in part, for losses relating to workers compensation, auto liability, general liability, cargo, and property damage claims, along with employees health insurance with varying risk retention levels. We are responsible for the first 1.0 million on each auto liability claim. We are also responsible for the first 750,000 on each workers compensation claim. We maintain insurance coverage for per-incident and total losses in excess of these risk retention levels in amounts we consider adequate based upon historical experience and our ongoing review. We reserve currently for the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims, including legal costs. These reserves are periodically evaluated and adjusted based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of outstanding individual claims and an estimate of future claims development based on historical development. Under agreements with our insurance carriers and regulatory authorities, we have 14.6 million in standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of claims. 

Revenue recognition: We account for our revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which we adopted on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The new revenue standard requires us to recognize revenue and related expenses within each of our four reporting segments over time, compared with our former policy in which we recorded revenue and related expenses on the date shipment of freight was completed. 

We account for revenue of our Intermodal and Brokerage segments and revenue on freight transported by independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments on a gross basis because we are the principal service provider controlling the promised service before it is transferred to each customer. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide each specified service to each customer. We bear the primary risk of loss in the event of cargo claims by our customers. We also have complete control and discretion in establishing the price for each specified service. Accordingly, all such revenue billed to customers is classified as operating revenue and all corresponding payments to carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with brokerage and intermodal activities and to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment are classified as purchased transportation expense within our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 3 for more information. 

38

Our largest customer, Walmart, accounted for 15 of our revenue in 2018 and 12 of our trade receivables as of December 31, 2018, 19 of our revenue in 2017 and 15 of our trade receivables as of December 31, 2017 and 17 of our revenue in 2016. Our second largest customer, The Coca-Cola Company, accounted for 13 of our revenue in 2018 and 7 of our trade receivables as of December 31, 2018. During each of 2018, 2017 and 2016, approximately 99 of our revenue was generated within the United States. 

Share-based payment arrangement compensation: Under our stock incentive plans, all of our employees and any subsidiary employees, as well as all of our non-employee directors, may be granted stock-based awards, including incentive and non-statutory stock options and performance unit awards. We account for share-based payment arrangements in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation , which requires all share-based payments to employees and non-employee directors, including grants of employee stock options and performance unit awards, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant. 

Earnings per common share: Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus all additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive common shares related to stock options and performance unit awards had been issued using the treasury stock method. 

Segment reporting: We report our operating segments in accordance with accounting standards codified in FASB ASC 280, Segment Reporting . We have five current operating segments that are aggregated into four reporting segments (Truckload, Dedicated, Intermodal and Brokerage) for financial reporting purposes. See Note 3 for more information. 

Use of estimates: We must make estimates and assumptions to prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are primarily related to insurance and claims accruals and depreciation. Ultimate results could differ from these estimates. 

Recent accounting pronouncements: In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2016 - 02, Leases which requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The new guidance also requires additional disclosures related to leasing transactions. The standard is effective for the first quarter of 2019. We will adopt the standard effective January 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an increase of 1.0 million to each of our assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We expect the impact of the adoption of the standard to be immaterial to our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows on an ongoing basis. We will include the additional required disclosures beginning with our Form 10 -Q for the first quarter of 2019. 

2. Adoption of New Accounting Standard 

We account for our revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which we adopted on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an increase of 485,000 to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard will be immaterial to our net income and financial position on an ongoing basis. 

The new revenue standard requires us to recognize revenue and related expenses within each of our four reporting segments over time, compared with our former policy in which we recorded revenue and related expenses on the date shipment of freight was completed.

3. Revenue and Business Segments 

We account for our revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which we adopted on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. We combine our five current operating segments into four reporting segments (Truckload, Dedicated, Intermodal and Brokerage) for financial reporting purposes. These four reporting segments are also the appropriate categories for the disaggregation of our revenue under FASB ASC 606. 

We have strategically transitioned from a long-haul carrier to a multifaceted business offering a network of truck-based transportation capabilities across our five distinct business platforms Truckload, Dedicated, Intermodal, Brokerage and MRTN de Mexico. 

40

The primary source of our operating revenue is provided by our Truckload segment through a combination of regional short-haul and medium-to-long-haul full-load transportation services. We transport food and other consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment, along with dry freight, across the United States and into and out of Mexico and Canada. 

Our Dedicated segment provides customized transportation solutions tailored to meet individual customers requirements, utilizing temperature-controlled trailers, dry vans and other specialized equipment within the United States. Our agreements with customers range from three to five years and are subject to annual rate reviews. 

Generally, we are paid by the mile for our Truckload and Dedicated services. We also derive Truckload and Dedicated revenue from fuel surcharges, loading and unloading activities, equipment detention and other accessorial services. The main factors that affect our Truckload and Dedicated revenue are the rate per mile we receive from our customers, the percentage of miles for which we are compensated, the number of miles we generate with our equipment and changes in fuel prices. We monitor our revenue production primarily through average Truckload and Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per tractor per week. We also analyze our average Truckload and Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per total mile, non-revenue miles percentage, the miles per tractor we generate, our fuel surcharge revenue, our accessorial revenue and our other sources of operating revenue. 

Our Intermodal segment transports our customers freight within the United States utilizing our temperature-controlled trailers on railroad flatcars for portions of trips, with the balance of the trips using our tractors or, to a lesser extent, contracted carriers. The main factors that affect our Intermodal revenue are the rate per mile and other charges we receive from our customers. 

Our Brokerage segment develops contractual relationships with and arranges for third -party carriers to transport freight for our customers in temperature-controlled trailers and dry vans within the United States and into and out of Mexico through Marten Transport Logistics, LLC, which was established in 2007 and operates pursuant to brokerage authority granted by the United States Department of Transportation, or DOT. We retain the billing, collection and customer management responsibilities. The main factors that affect our Brokerage revenue are the rate per mile and other charges that we receive from our customers. 

Operating results of our MRTN de Mexico business which offers our customers door-to-door service between the United States and Mexico with our Mexican partner carriers is reported within our Truckload and Brokerage segments. 

Our customer agreements are typically for one -year terms except for our Dedicated agreements which range from three to five years with annual rate reviews. Under FASB ASC 606, the contract date for each individual load within each of our four reporting segments is generally the date that each load is tendered to and accepted by us. For each load transported within each of our four reporting segments, the entire amount of revenue to be recognized is a single performance obligation and our agreements with our customers detail the per-mile charges for line haul and fuel surcharges, along with the rates for loading and unloading, stop offs and drops, equipment detention and other accessorial services, which is the transaction price. There are no discounts that would be a material right or consideration payable to a customer. We are required to recognize revenue and related expenses over time, from load pickup to delivery, for each load within each of our four reporting segments. We base our calculation of the amount of revenue to record in each period for individual loads picking up in one period and delivering in the following period using the number of hours estimated to be incurred within each period applied to each estimated transaction price. Contract assets for this estimated revenue are classified within prepaid expenses and other within our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. We had no impairment losses on contract assets in 2018. We bill our customers for loads after delivery is complete with standard payment terms of 30 days. 

We account for revenue of our Intermodal and Brokerage segments and revenue on freight transported by independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments on a gross basis, as discussed in our revenue policy note. 

41

The following table sets forth for the years indicated our operating revenue and operating income by segment. We do not prepare separate balance sheets by segment and, as a result, assets are not separately identifiable by segment.

5 . Long-Term Debt 

In August 2018, we entered into an amendment to our unsecured committed credit facility which reduces the aggregate principal amount of the facility from 40.0 million to 30.0 million and extends the term of the facility to August 2023. At December 31, 2018, there was no outstanding principal balance on the facility. As of that date, we had outstanding standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of self-insurance claims of 14.6 million and remaining borrowing availability of 15.4 million. At December 31, 2017, there was also no outstanding principal balance on the facility. As of that date, we had outstanding standby letters of credit of 12.9 million on the facility. This facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or the lender s Prime Rate, in each case plus/minus applicable margins. The interest rate for the facility that would apply to outstanding principal balances was 3.2 at December 31, 2018. 

Our credit facility prohibits us from paying, in any fiscal year, stock redemptions and dividends in excess of 25 of our net income from the prior fiscal year. A waiver of the 25 limitation for 2016 was obtained from the lender. This facility also contains restrictive covenants which, among other matters, require us to maintain compliance with cash flow leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

The following related party transactions occurred during the three years ended December 31, 2018; 

(a) We purchase fuel and tires and obtain related services from a company in which one of our directors is the chairman of the board, chief executive officer and the principal stockholder. We paid that company 341,000 in 2018, 328,000 in 2017 and 361,000 in 2016 for fuel, tires and related services. In addition, we paid 2.5 million in both 2018 and 2017 and 2.0 million in 2016 to tire manufacturers for tires that were provided by the same company. The same company received commissions from the tire manufacturers related to these purchases. We did not have any payables to that company as of December 31, 2018 or 2017. 

(b) We provide transportation services to MWL as described in Note 13. 

7 . Income Taxes 

We recorded a 56.5 million deferred income taxes benefit in 2017 to recognize the impact on our federal net deferred tax liability of the reduction of the federal corporate statutory income tax rate from 35 to 21 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was enacted prior to December 31, 2017. Excluding that benefit, the 2017 federal deferred provision was 8.0 million and the effective tax rate was 40.1 . The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate as noted above beginning on January 1, 2018 and allowing bonus depreciation with full expensing of qualified property placed in service after September 27, 2017.

We have not provided a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets at December 31, 2018 or 2017. We believe the deferred tax assets will be realized principally through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences (deferred tax liabilities) and future taxable income. 

Our reserves for unrecognized tax benefits were 1.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and 407,000 as of December 31, 2017. The 1.5 million increase in the amount reserved in 2018 relates to current period tax positions and an amendment to prior periods open returns for a current position less the removal of the reserve relating to 2013 tax positions, as that period has now closed. The amount reserved as of December 31, 2017 was added in 2013 through 2017 relating to current period tax positions. If recognized, 1.8 million of the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2018 would favorably impact our effective tax rate. Potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of 12,000 and 11,000 were recognized in our financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We do not expect the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly within the next twelve months. The federal statute of limitations remains open for 2015 and forward. We file tax returns in numerous state jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations.

Options totaling 153,500, 145,169 and 564,833 equivalent shares were outstanding but were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, because including the options in the denominator would be antidilutive, or decrease the number of weighted-average shares, due to their exercise prices exceeding the average market price of the common shares, or because inclusion of average unrecognized compensation expense in the calculation would cause the options to be antidilutive. 

Unvested performance unit awards (see Note 14 totaling 1,638, 124,046 and 64,162 equivalent shares for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were considered outstanding but were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because inclusion of average unrecognized compensation expense in the calculation would cause the performance units to be antidilutive. 

9 . Stock Split 

On July 7, 2017, we effected a five -for- three stock split of our common stock, .01 par value, in the form of a 66 stock dividend. Our consolidated financial statements, related notes, and other financial data contained in this report have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the stock split for all periods presented. 

10 . Share Repurchase Program 

In 2007, our Board of Directors approved and we announced a share repurchase program to repurchase up to one million shares of our common stock either through purchases on the open market or through private transactions and in accordance with Rule 10b - 18 of the Exchange Act. In 2015, our Board of Directors approved and we announced an increase in the share repurchase program, providing for the repurchase of up to 40 million, or approximately two million shares, of our common stock, which was increased by our Board of Directors to 3.3 million shares in August 2017 to reflect the five -for- three stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on July 7, 2017. The timing and extent to which we repurchase shares depends on market conditions and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. 

We repurchased and retired 200,000 shares of our common stock for 3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. We did not repurchase any shares in 2017. We repurchased and retired 759,302 shares of our common stock for 7.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. As of December 31, 2018, future repurchases of up to 12.6 million, or 806,000 shares, were available in the share repurchase program. 

11 . Dividends 

In 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend program to our stockholders, subject to approval each quarter. Quarterly cash dividends of 0.025 per share of common stock were declared in each quarter of 2018 and totaled 5.5 million. Quarterly cash dividends of 0.015 per share of common stock were declared in each of the first two quarters of 2017 along with dividends of 0.025 per share in each of 2017 s last two quarters, which totaled 4.4 million. Quarterly cash dividends of 0.015 per share of common stock were declared in each quarter of 2016 and totaled 3.3 million. 

1 2 . Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 

In May 2018, our stockholders approved our Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation increasing the authorized number of shares of common stock, .01 par value, from 96 million shares to 192 million shares. 

1 3 . Equity Investment 

We own a 45 equity interest in MWL, a third -party provider of logistics services to the transportation industry. A non-related party owns the other 55 equity interest in MWL. We account for our ownership interest in MWL under the equity method of accounting. We received 5.5 million, 2.2 million and 1.2 million of our revenue for loads transported by our tractors and arranged by MWL in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we also had a trade receivable in the amount of 630,000 from MWL and an accrued liability of 1.2 million to MWL for the excess of payments by MWL s customers into our lockbox account over the amounts drawn on the account by MWL.

1 4 . Employee Benefits 

Equity Incentive Plans - In May 2015, our stockholders approved our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan ). Our Board of Directors adopted the 2015 Plan in March 2015. Under our 2015 Plan, all of our employees and any subsidiary employees, as well as all of our non-employee directors, may be granted stock-based awards, including non-statutory stock options, performance unit awards and shares of common stock, of which 998,022 shares have been awarded as of December 31, 2018. Stock options expire within 7 or 10 years after the date of grant and the exercise price must be at least the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options issued to employees are generally exercisable beginning one year from the date of grant in cumulative amounts of 20 per year. Performance unit awards are subject to vesting requirements over a five -year period, primarily based on our earnings growth. Options exercised and performance unit award shares issued represent newly issued shares. The maximum number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2015 Plan is 1,333,333 shares. As of December 31, 2018, there were 568,873 shares reserved for issuance under options outstanding and 349,814 shares reserved for issuance under outstanding performance unit awards under the 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan replaces our 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2005 Plan ), which expired by its terms in May 2015. 

Under the 2005 Plan, officers, directors and employees were granted non-statutory stock options and performance unit awards with similar terms to the options and awards under the 2015 Plan. As of December 31, 2018, there were 370,320 shares reserved for issuance under options outstanding, which will continue according to their terms. As of the same date, there were no shares reserved for issuance under outstanding performance unit awards under the 2005 Plan. No additional awards will be granted under the 2005 Plan. 

We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value of option awards. The fair value of service-based option awards granted was estimated as of the date of grant using the following weighted average assumptions:

Expected option life We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected life assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option. We use a weighted-average expected life for all awards. 

2 

Expected stock price volatility We use our stock s historical volatility for the same period of time as the expected life. We have no reason to believe that its future volatility will differ from the past. 

3 

Risk-free interest rate The rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant for the same period of time as the expected life. 

4 

Expected dividend yield The calculation is based on the total expected annual dividend payout divided by the average stock price. 

Compensation costs associated with service-based option awards with graded vesting are recognized, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the period between the grant date and the award s stated vesting term. Service-based option awards become immediately exercisable in full in the event of death or disability and upon a change in control with respect to all options that have been outstanding for at least six months.

In May 2012, we granted 98,750 performance unit awards under our 2005 Stock Incentive Plan to certain employees. This was our third grant of such awards. As of December 31, 2012 and each December 31 st thereafter through December 31, 2016, each award vested and became the right to receive a number of shares of common stock equal to a total vesting percentage multiplied by the number of units subject to such award. The total vesting percentage for each of the five years was equal to the sum of a performance vesting percentage, which was the percentage increase, if any, in our diluted net income per share for the year being measured over the prior year, and a service vesting percentage of five percentage points. All payments were made in shares of our common stock. One half of the vested performance units were paid to the employees immediately upon vesting, with the other half being credited to the employees accounts within the Marten Transport, Ltd. Deferred Compensation Plan, which restricts the sale of vested shares to the later of each employee s termination of employment or attainment of age 62. 

In May 2013, we granted 104,250 performance unit awards with similar terms to the awards previously granted, and which vested from December 31, 2013 through 2017. 

In May 2014, we granted 60,668 performance unit awards with similar terms to the awards previously granted, and also granted 18,337 performance unit awards with similar terms to such awards, except that all vested performance units will be paid to the employees immediately upon vesting. All awards granted in 2014 vested from December 31, 2014 through 2018. 

In May 2015, we granted 58,335 performance unit awards under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan with similar terms to the awards previously granted, and also granted 32,500 performance unit awards with similar terms to such awards, except that all vested performance units will be paid to the employees immediately upon vesting. All awards granted in 2015 vest from December 31, 2015 through 2019. 

In May 2016, we granted 57,669 performance unit awards under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan with similar terms to the awards previously granted, except that the calculation of vesting shares is based on our increase in net income instead of our increase in diluted net income per share. As permitted in the performance unit award agreements granted in 2011 through 2015, the calculation of the performance vesting component beginning with the year 2015 was adjusted to be based on the increase in net income. We also granted 21,671 performance unit awards in May 2016 and 1,667 awards in August 2016 with similar terms to such awards, except that all vested performance units will be paid to the employees immediately upon vesting. All awards granted in 2016 vest from December 31, 2016 through 2020. 

In May 2017, we granted 109,169 performance unit awards under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan with similar terms to the awards granted in 2016, except that the service-based component was increased from five percent to ten percent per year. The Compensation Committee adjusted the equity vesting formula to better align it with our long-range growth plan. We also granted 43,342 performance unit awards in May 2017 and 2,000 awards in August 2017 with similar terms to such awards, except that all vested performance units will be paid to the employees immediately upon vesting. All awards granted in 2017 vest from December 31, 2017 through 2021. 

In May 2018, we granted 45,700 performance unit awards under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan with similar terms to the awards granted in 2017. We also granted 28,000 performance unit awards in May 2018 and 2,000 awards in August 2018 with similar terms to such awards, except that all vested performance units will be paid to the employees immediately upon vesting. These awards granted in 2018 vest from December 31, 2018 through 2022. We also granted 2,000 performance unit awards in December 2018 with similar terms to the awards granted in August 2018, except that the awards vest from December 31, 2019 through 2023. 

The fair value of each performance unit is based on the closing market price on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for these awards based on the estimated number of units probable of achieving the vesting requirements of the awards, net of an estimated forfeiture rate. 

The amount of share-based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We currently expect, based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures and known forfeitures on existing awards, that approximately 1.25 of unvested outstanding awards will be forfeited each year. This analysis will be re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest. 

47

Total share-based compensation expense recorded in 2018 was 3.3 million 2.6 million net of income tax benefit, 0.05 earnings per basic and diluted share), in 2017 was 1.3 million 738,000 net of income tax benefit, 0.01 of earnings per basic and diluted share), and in 2016 was 883,000 547,000 net of income tax benefit, 0.01 of earnings per basic and diluted share). All share-based compensation expense was recorded in salaries, wages and benefits expense. 

As of December 31, 2018, there was a total of 1.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested service-based option awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.2 years, and 2.4 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested performance unit awards, which will be recorded based on the estimated number of units probable of achieving the vesting requirements of the awards through 2022. 

Effective January 1, 2017, we adopted the provisions of FASB ASU No. 2016 - 09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The adoption of this standard resulted in decreases to our provision for income taxes in 2018 of 319,000 and in 2017 of 176,000, as the actual increase in our stock price exceeded the grant-date fair value of the period s exercised options and vested performance unit awards. Excess tax benefits were recognized in additional paid-in capital through 2016.

The 939,193 options outstanding as of December 31, 2018 have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.8 years and an aggregate intrinsic value based on our closing stock price on December 31, 2018 for in-the-money options of 3.0 million. The 545,713 options exercisable as of the same date have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.7 years and an aggregate intrinsic value similarly calculated of 2.6 million. 

The fair value of options granted in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was 957,000, 592,000 and 227,000, respectively, for service-based options. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was 1.5 million, 830,000 and 1.9 million, respectively. Intrinsic value is the difference between the fair value of the acquired shares at the date of exercise and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of options exercised. Proceeds received from option exercises in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 938,000, 1.1 million and 4.4 million, respectively.

This number of performance unit award shares vested based on our financial performance in 2018 and was distributed or credited to the Marten Transport, Ltd. Deferred Compensation Plan in February 2019. As permitted in the performance unit award agreements granted in 2014 and 2015, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors adjusted the calculation of the performance vesting component for 2018 to be based on our increase in net income instead of our increase in diluted net income per share. Additionally, the 56.5 million deferred income taxes benefit in 2017 related to the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was excluded from the calculation of the increase in net income from 2017 to 2018. The calculation of the increase in net income also included an adjustment of 2017 net income to reflect a federal income tax rate of 21 instead of 35 , to be consistent with the federal rate in 2018. The fair value of unit award shares that vested in 2018 was 2.7 million. 

Retirement Savings Plan - We sponsor a defined contribution retirement savings plan under Section 401 (k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees are eligible for the plan after three months of service. Participants are able to contribute up to the limit set by law, which in 2018 was 18,500 for participants less than age 50 and 24,500 for participants age 50 and above. We contribute 35 of each participant s contribution, up to a total of 6 contributed. Our contribution vests at the rate of 20 per year for the first through fifth years of service. In addition, we may make elective contributions as determined by the Board of Directors. No elective contributions were made in 2018, 2017 or 2016. Total expense recorded for the plan was 2.3 million in 2018 and 2.1 million in each of 2017 and 2016. 

Stock Purchase Plans - An Employee Stock Purchase Plan and an Independent Contractor Stock Purchase Plan are sponsored to encourage employee and independent contractor ownership of our common stock. Eligible participants specify the amount of regular payroll or contract payment deductions and voluntary cash contributions that are used to purchase shares of our common stock. The purchases are made at the market price on the open market. We pay the broker s commissions and administrative charges for purchases of common stock under the plans. 

1 5 . Excess Tax Benefit Reclassification 

Effective January 1, 2017, we adopted the provisions of FASB ASU No. 2016 - 09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. This standard changed the classification of excess tax benefits in the statements of cash flows. We retrospectively reclassified 235,000 of excess tax benefits for 2016 from financing to operating activities within our 2018 and 2017 consolidated statements of cash flows. 

1 6 . Deferred Compensation Plan 

In August 2010, our Board of Directors approved and adopted the Marten Transport, Ltd. Deferred Compensation Plan. The deferred compensation plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan designed to allow board elected officers and other select members of our management designated by our Compensation Committee to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. 

Under the terms of the plan, each participant is eligible to defer portions of their base pay, annual bonus, or receipt of common stock otherwise payable under a vested performance unit award. Each participant can elect a fixed distribution date for the participant s deferral account other than certain required performance unit award deferrals credited to the discretionary account, which will be distributed after the later of the date of the participant s termination of employment or the date the participant attains age 62. Upon termination of a participant s employment with the company, the plan requires a lump-sum distribution of the deferral account, excluding the required performance unit award deferrals, unless the participant had elected an installment distribution. Upon a participant s death, the plan provides that a participant s distributions accelerate and will be paid in a lump sum to the participant s beneficiary. We may terminate the plan and accelerate distributions to participants, but only to the extent and at the times permitted under the Internal Revenue Code. We may terminate the plan and accelerate distributions upon a change in control, which is not a payment event under the plan. In conjunction with the approval of the plan, our Board of Directors also adopted an amendment to the Marten Transport, Ltd. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan to allow for deferral of receipt of income from a performance unit award under the plan. Such deferral is also provided for within the Marten Transport, Ltd. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2018, 241,348 shares of Company common stock with a value of 3.9 million were credited to account balances within the plan. These shares were required performance unit award deferrals of vested awards, and dividends earned on such shares.

1 7 . Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

1 8 . Commitments and Contingencies 

We are committed to purchase 91.1 million of new revenue equipment in 2019. Operating lease obligation expenditures total 672,000 through 2022. 

We self-insure, in part, for losses relating to workers compensation, auto liability, general liability, cargo and property damage claims, along with employees health insurance with varying risk retention levels. We maintain insurance coverage for per-incident and total losses in excess of these risk retention levels in amounts we consider adequate based upon historical experience and our ongoing review, and reserve currently for the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims. 

We are also involved in other legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, based upon present knowledge of the facts, it is remote that the ultimate outcome of any such legal actions will have a material adverse effect upon our long-term financial position or results of operations.

The sum of the diluted earnings per common share for the 2018 quarters exceeds the amount for the year, and the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per common share for the 2017 quarters is less than the amounts for the year due to differences in rounding.

ITEM 9A. 

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ), we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2018. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We intend to periodically evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures as required by the Exchange Act Rules. 

Changes in Internal Control O ver Financial Reporting. Beginning January 1, 2018, we implemented ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Although the new revenue standard is expected to have an immaterial impact on our ongoing net income, we did implement changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and the control activities within them. These included the development of new policies based on the five-step model provided in the new revenue standard, new training, ongoing contract review requirements, additional estimates of revenue and related expenses for loads in progress at period-ends, and gathering of information provided in disclosures. 

We have included Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 8 above.
