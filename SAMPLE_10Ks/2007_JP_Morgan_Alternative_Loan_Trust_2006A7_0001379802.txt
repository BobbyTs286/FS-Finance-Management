agement's assertion about the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 

 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by the Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly
 Available Telephone Interpretations Interpretation 17.06 ). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. 

 As described in management's assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(iv), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria 

applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06. As permitted by Interpretation 17.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's eligibility to apply Interpretation 17.06. 

 Our examination disclosed the following material noncompliance with servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i), 1122(d)(2)(iv), and 1122(d)(3)(ii) applicable to the Company's platform covered by this report during the year ended December 31, 2006. 1122(d)(1)(i) - There were no policies and procedures instituted to monitor the performance or other triggers and events of defaults in accordance with the transaction agreements; 1122(d)(2)(iv) - The related accounts for each transaction were not separately maintained as set forth in the transaction agreements; and, 1122(d)(3)(ii) - Amounts due to investors were not remitted in accordance with the timeframes set forth in the transaction agreements. 

 The information in the Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria in Item 2 of Appendix B (i.e., remediation procedures) is presented by the Company for information purposes. Such information has not been subjected to the procedures applied in our examination of management's assertion as described above, and accordingly, we express no opinion on it. 

 In our opinion, except for the material noncompliance described in the fourth paragraph, the Company complied, in all material respects, with the aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1 122(d)(2)(i) and II 22(d)(4)(iv) for which compliance is determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 for the residential mortgage loan servicing platform.
