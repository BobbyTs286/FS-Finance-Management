Management's Assertion on Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria

National City Mortgage Co. (the "Asserting Party") is responsible for assessing
compliance, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 (the "Reporting
Period"), with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation
AB, excluding the criteria set forth in item 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C),
1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(xv) which the Asserting Party has concluded
are not applicable to the activities it performs, either directly or through
its Vendors, with respect to the residential mortgage-backed securities
transactions covered by this report (such criteria, the "Applicable Servicing
Criteria"). The transactions covered by this report include all residential
mortgage-backed securities that were completed on or after January 1, 2006 that
were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933 (the "Platform"), as listed on Appendix A.

The Asserting Party has engaged certain vendors ("Vendors") to perform
specific, limited or scripted activities as of and for the year ended December
31, 2007. The Asserting Party has policies and procedures in place designed to
provide reasonable assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all
material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each Vendor. The
Asserting Party is responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the Vendors and related
criteria. The Asserting Party elects to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the servicing criteria or portion of the servicing criteria
applicable to such Vendors for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi) and
1122(d)(4)(xii).

The Asserting Party has obtained an assertion of management and accompanying
1122 attestation report from the Vendor performing servicing criteria
1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(iv).

The Asserting Party has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Reporting Period and has concluded that it has complied, in
all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing Criteria during the
Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an attestation report for the Platform on the Asserting Party's assessment of
compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the Reporting
Period as set forth in this assertion.

Report on Assessment of Compliance with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria

1. Pursuant to Subpart 229.1100 - Asset Backed Securities, 17 C.F.R. Sections
 229.1100-229.1123 ("Regulation AB"), Regulus Group LLC, for itself and its
 wholly-owned subsidiaries (individually and collectively "Regulus"), is
 responsible for assessing its compliance with the servicing criteria
 applicable to the remittance processing services it provides to customers
 who are issuers or servicers of asset backed securities transactions and
 who have requested confirmation of Regulus' compliance in connection with
 loan and/or receivables portfolios that include pool assets for asset
 backed securities transactions (the "Platform"). Remittance processing is a
 service whereby check payments that are remitted by mail to a post office
 box are collected, processed through a highly automated data capture
 system, and prepared for deposit to a bank account held by the beneficiary
 of the payment.

2. The servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB were used
 in Regulus' assessment of compliance. Regulus has concluded that the
 servicing criteria set forth in Items 1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(iv) of
 Regulation AB are applicable to the servicing activities it performs with
 respect to the Platform (such criteria the "Applicable Servicing
 Criteria"). Regulus has concluded that the remainder of the servicing
 criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB are inapplicable to the
 activities it performs with respect to the Platform because Regulus does
 not participate in the servicing activities referenced by such servicing
 criteria.

3. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2007, Regulus has complied in all
 material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria set forth in Item
 1122(d) of Regulation AB.

4. KPMG LLP, a registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation
 report on Regulus' assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing
 Criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007. A copy of that
 attestation report is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Members
Regulus Group LLC:

We have examined management's assessment for those customers that management has
informed us have requested confirmation of compliance, included in the
accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Regulation AB Servicing
Criteria, that Regulus Group LLC complied with the servicing criteria set forth
in Item 1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(iv) of the Securities and Exchange
Commission's Regulation AB for remittance processing services to those issuers
of asset backed securities and servicers of loan and/or receivables portfolios
that include pool assets for asset backed securities transactions (the Platform)
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007. Regulus Group LLC has determined
that the remainder of the servicing criteria are not applicable to the
activities it performs with respect to the Platform as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2007. Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with
those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assessment about the Company's compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those
selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria.

In our opinion, management's assessment that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007
is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.'s
2007 Certification Regarding Compliance With Applicable Servicing Criteria

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.:

We have examined management's assessment, included in the accompanying 2007
Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's
Regulation AB for its primary servicing of residential mortgage loans by its
Wells Fargo Home Mortgage division, other than the servicing of such loans
for Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, state and local bond programs, or a
Federal Home Loan Bank (the Platform), except for servicing criteria
1122(d)(1)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not
applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2007. Management is responsible for the
Company's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management's assessment about the Company's compliance
based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those
selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We
believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria.

As described in the accompanying 2007 Certification Regarding Compliance with
Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i),
1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), the
Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by
these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that none of these vendors
is considered a "servicer" as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the
Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation
17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available
Telephone Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). As permitted by
Interpretation 17.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors'
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining
that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the
vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed
no procedures with respect to the Company's eligibility to apply
Interpretation 17.06.

In our opinion, management's assessment that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i),
1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xiii) for which
compliance is determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described above, as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 is fairly stated, in all material
respects.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA

Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(the "Company") is responsible for assessing compliance with the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company has determined that the
servicing criteria are applicable in regards to the servicing platform for the
period as follows:

Platform: Publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) residential
mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other
asset-backed securities, for which the Company provides master servicing,
trustee, securities administration or paying agent services, excluding any
publicly issued transactions issued by any agency or instrumentality of the
U.S. government or any government sponsored entity, and further excluding the
transactions issued prior to 2006 for which Wells Fargo outsources all material
servicing activities (as defined by Regulation AB) (the "Platform").

Applicable Servicing Criteria: All servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d), to the extent required in the related transaction agreements, or
required by the Item 1122(d) servicing criteria in regards to the activities
performed by the Company, except for the following criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii),
1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x),
1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which Management has
determined are not applicable to the activities the Company performs with
respect to the Platform ("the Applicable Servicing Criteria").

Period: As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 (the "Period").

Third parties classified as vendors: With respect to servicing criteria
1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged various vendors to handle certain
Uniform Commercial Code filing functions required by the servicing criteria
("vendors"). The Company has determined that none of the vendors is a
"servicer" as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company elects
to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation
17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available
Telephone Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). The Company has policies
and procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining
that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the
vendors and related criteria.

With respect to the Platform and the Period, the Company provides the following
assessment of compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria:

1. The Company is responsible for assessing its compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria.

2. The Company has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria,
including servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on
Interpretation 17.06 as described above, as of and for the Period. In
performing this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of
Regulation AB.

3. Based on such assessment as of and for the Period, the Company has complied,
in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

KPMG LLP, a registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation
report with respect to the Company's assessment of compliance as of and for
the Period.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Bank of America Corporation:

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying Report on
Assessment of Compliance with Servicing Criteria, that Bank of America, National
Association (the "Company") complied with the servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the
domestic asset-backed securities transactions for which the Company acted as
servicer involving residential mortgage loans, other than government sponsored
entities, or transactions that do not have scheduled interest and/or scheduled
principal remittance schedules as outlined in their respective transaction
agreements, with the exception of certain private whole loan transactions. (the
"Platform"), as of December 31, 2007 and for the year then ended, excluding the
criteria which the Company has determined are not applicable to the servicing
activities performed by them with respect to the Platform, as indicated in
Appendix A of the Report on Assessment of Compliance with Servicing Criteria. As
described in Appendix A, for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(2)(ii), 1122 (d)(4)
(iv), 1122 (d)(4)(xi), 1122 (d)(4)(xii) and 1122 (d)(4)(xiii), the Company has
engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing
criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered
"servicers" as defined in Item 11016) of Regulation AB, and the Company has
elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing
criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the
SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone
Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). As permitted by interpretation 17.06,
the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all
material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The
Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements
to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described
in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's
determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 17.06. Management is
responsible for the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion based on our
examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining,
on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected
asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of
selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether
the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected
activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures
were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by
the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not
designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred
prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or
amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this
report. We believe that our examination provides a

determination on the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria.

Board of Directors
National City Mortgage Co.

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying
Management's Assertion on Compliance with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that
National City Mortgage Company (NCM), complied with the servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB
for the residential mortgage loan servicing platform as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2007, except for Item 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(c),
1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which NCM has determined are not applicable
to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform
covered by this report. See Appendix A of management's assertion for the asset
backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for
NCM's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on management's assertion about NCM's compliance with the servicing
criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as
adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about NCM's
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination
included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions
and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the
servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether NCM
processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in
compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by the Interpretation
17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available
Telephone Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). Furthermore, our procedures
were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by
NCM during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed
to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to
our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported
by NCM during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or
any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on
NCM's compliance with the servicing criteria.

As described in management's assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi)
and 1122(d)(4)(xii), NCM has engaged various vendors to perform the activities
required by these servicing criteria. NCM has determined that these vendors are
not considered a "servicer" as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and NCM
has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation
17.06. As permitted by Interpretation 17.06, NCM has asserted that it has
policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that
the vendors' activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria
applicable to each vendor. NCM is solely responsible for determining that it
meets the SEC requirements to apply

(page)

Interpretation 17.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its
assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to NCM's eligibility to
apply Interpretation 17.06.
In our opinion, management's assertion that NCM complied with the aforementioned
servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 for the
residential mortgage loan servicing platform, is fairly stated, in all material
respects.

1122(d)(1)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not
applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2007. Management is responsible for the
Company's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management's assessment about the Company's compliance
based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those
selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We
believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria.

As described in the accompanying 2007 Certification Regarding Compliance with
Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i),
1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), the
Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by
these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that none of these vendors
is considered a "servicer" as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the
Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation
17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available
Telephone Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). As permitted by
Interpretation 17.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors'
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining
that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the
vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed
no procedures with respect to the Company's eligibility to apply
Interpretation 17.06.

compliance is determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described above, as

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors
The Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association:

We have examined the accompanying management's assertion, that The Corporate
Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Company)
complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the
Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for publicly-issued (i.e.,
transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended) residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial
mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities, for which the
Company provides master servicing, trustee, securities administration or paying
agent services, excluding transactions issued by any agency or instrumentality
of the U.S. government or any government sponsored entity and further excluding
the transactions issued prior to 2006 for which Wells Fargo outsources all
material servicing activities (as defined by Regulation AB) (the Platform),
except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v),
1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi),
1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has determined are not
applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of
and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. Management is responsible
for the Company's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management's assessment about the Company's
compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing

testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those
selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria.

As described in the accompanying management's Assessment of Compliance With
Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), the
Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these
servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not
considered a "servicer" as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the
Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i)
for which compliance is determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described
above, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 is fairly
stated, in all material respects.
