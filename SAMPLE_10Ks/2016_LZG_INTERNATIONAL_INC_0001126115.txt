FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The
U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC encourages reporting companies to disclose forward-looking information
so that investors can better understand future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This report contains these types
of statements. Words such as may, intend, expect, believe, anticipate, 
 estimate, project, or continue or comparable terminology used in connection with any
discussion of future operating results or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. All forward-looking statements
reflect our present expectation of future events and are subject to a number of important factors and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 

PART
I 

ITEM
1. BUSINESS 

 Historical
Development 

LZG
International, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Florida on May 22, 2000, as LazyGrocer.Com, Inc. We intended to establish
an online grocery solution, but we were unable to raise sufficient capital to continue operations and as a result limited our
operations in November 2001. On August 28, 2009, the Company s name was changed to LZG International, Inc. 

Emerging
Growth Company 

We
qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS
Act ). An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise
applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: 

A
 requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years
 of related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
 of Operations; 

Exemption
 from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company s
 internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 of 2002; 

Reduced
 disclosure about the emerging growth company s executive compensation arrangements;
 and 

No
 non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 

We
have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this annual report, which are also available to us as a smaller
reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), for complying
with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period and therefore our financial statements
may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company accounting standard effective dates. 

3 

We
could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year
in which our annual gross revenues exceed 1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as
defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates
exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which
we have issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. 

For
more details regarding this exemption, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies, below. 

Our
Business 

Our
business purpose is to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived
advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond will be to
achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business, rather than immediate, short-term earnings. Our search
for a business opportunity will not be limited to any particular geographical area or industry, including both U.S. and international
companies. Our management has unrestricted discretion in seeking and participating in a business opportunity, subject to the availability
of such opportunities, economic conditions and other factors. Our management believes that companies who desire a public market
to enhance liquidity for current stockholders or plan to acquire additional assets through issuance of securities rather than
for cash will be potential merger or acquisition candidates. 

We
are a blank check company based on our proposed business activities. The SEC defines those companies as any
company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Exchange Act, and that has no specific business
plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies. Under SEC
Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, we also qualify as a shell company because we have no or nominal assets (other
than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities
of blank check companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to
cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination.
We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements. 

The
analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our management. As of the date of this
filing, we have not entered into any definitive agreement with any party, nor have there been any specific discussions with any
potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the Company. We have unrestricted flexibility in
seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In our efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets,
we intend to consider the following factors: 

Potential
 for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 

Competitive
 position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry
 segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 

Strength
 and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 

Capital
 requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company
 or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures
 or similar arrangements or from other sources; 

The
 cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible
 values and potentials; 

The
 extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 

The
 accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional
 assistance and other required items; and 

Other
 relevant factors. 

4 

In
applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances
and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities
may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation
and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to our limited capital available for investigation,
we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. In addition, we will be competing
against other entities that possess greater financial, technical and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing business
combinations. 

In
evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible;
however, none of our management are professional business analysts. (See Item 10, below.) Our management has had limited experience
with mergers and acquisitions of business opportunities and has not been involved with an initial public offering. Potential investors
must recognize that due to our management s inexperience we may not adequately evaluate a potential business opportunity. 

We
are unable to predict when, and if, we may actually participate in any specific business endeavor. We anticipate that proposed
business ventures will be made available to us through personal contacts of our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders,
professional advisors, broker dealers in securities, venture capital personnel, members of the financial community and others
who may present unsolicited proposals. In certain cases, we may agree to pay a finder s fee or to otherwise compensate the
persons who submit a potential business endeavor in which we eventually participate. Such persons may include our directors, executive
officers and beneficial owners of our securities or their affiliates. In that event, such fees may become a factor
in negotiations regarding any potential venture and, accordingly, may present a conflict of interest for such individuals. Management
does not presently intend to acquire or merge with any business enterprise in which any has a prior ownership interest. 

In
addition, certain conflicts of interest exist or may develop between LZG International and our executive officers and directors.
Our management has other business interests to which they currently devote attention, which include their primary employment and
management of other shell reporting companies. (See Item 10, below.) They may be expected to continue to devote their attention
to these other business interests although management time should be devoted to our business. Also, in the process of negotiations
for an acquisition or merger, our management may consider their own personal pecuniary benefit or the interests of other shell
companies they are affiliated with rather than the best interests of LZG International and our stockholders. 

We
presently do not foresee entering into a merger or acquisition transaction with any business with which our officers or directors
are currently affiliated. We may acquire or merge with companies of which our management s affiliates or associates have
a direct or indirect ownership interest. If we determine in the future that a transaction with an affiliate would be in our best
interest, we are permitted by Florida law to enter into such a transaction if: 

The
 material facts regarding the relationship or interest of the affiliate in the contract
 or transaction are disclosed or are known to the board of directors. The board authorizes
 the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested
 directors, even though the disinterested directors constitute less than a quorum; however,
 a single director may not authorize the contract or transaction; or 

The
 material facts regarding the relationship or interest of the affiliate in the contract
 transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote on the transaction,
 and the contract or transaction is specifically approved by vote of the stockholders;
 or 

The
 contract or transaction is fair to the Company at the time it is authorized, approved
 or ratified by the board of directors or the stockholders. 

5 

We
expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business s incumbent management
and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information which is made available
to the Company. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage.
Our limited funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive
investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. We anticipate that we will rely upon
funds provided by advances and/or loans from management and significant stockholders to conduct investigation and analysis of
any potential target companies or businesses. We may also rely upon the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash payments
for services or expenses related to any analysis. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility
studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We
will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or other persons
associated with the target business seeking our participation. 

The
time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently
be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective
business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to the Company. Also, substantial fees are often paid
in connection with the completion of all types of acquisitions, reorganizations or mergers, ranging from a small amount to as
much as 300,000 or more. These fees are usually divided among promoters or founders or finders, after deduction of legal, accounting
and other related expenses, and it is not unusual for a portion of these fees to be paid to members of management or to principal
stockholders as consideration for their agreement to retire a portion of the shares of common stock owned by them. Management
may actively negotiate or otherwise consent to the purchase of all or any portion of their common stock as a condition to, or
in connection with, a proposed reorganization, merger or acquisition. It is not anticipated that any such opportunity will be
afforded to other stockholders or that such other stockholders will be afforded the opportunity to approve or consent to any particular
stock buy-out transaction. In the event that any such fees are paid, they may become a factor in negotiations regarding any potential
acquisition or merger by us, and accordingly, may also present a conflict of interest for such individuals. We have no present
arrangements or understandings respecting any of these types of fees or opportunities and we have not adopted any procedures or
policies for the review, approval or ratification of related party transactions. 

Our
common stock is not publicly traded at this time and we cannot assure that a market will develop or that a stockholder ever will
be able to liquidate his investments without considerable delay, if at all. If a market develops, our shares will likely be subject
to the rules of the Penny Stock Suitability Reform Act of 1990. The liquidity of penny stock is affected by specific disclosure
procedures required by this Act to be followed by all broker-dealers, including, but not limited to, determining the suitability
of the stock for a particular customer, and obtaining a written agreement from the customer to purchase the stock. This rule may
affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell our securities in
any future market. 

Form
of Acquisition 

The
manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires
of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters. 

It
is likely that we will acquire our participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of our common stock or other securities.
Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria
for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called tax free reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own
80 or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions
rather than other tax free provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances
retain 20 or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Under other circumstances, depending upon
the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20 of the total issued
and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those persons
who were our stockholders prior to such reorganization. 

6 

Our
present stockholders will likely not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the Company following a reorganization
transaction. As part of such a transaction, all or a majority of our directors may resign, and one or more new directors may be
appointed without any vote by stockholders. 

In
the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or
approval by stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the Company, it will likely be
necessary to call a stockholders' meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities.
The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed
transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek
to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval. 

It
is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant
agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial
cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs
incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation
in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Company of the related
costs incurred. 

In
addition, SEC regulations regarding shell companies and transactions with shell companies requires the filing of a Form 8-K within
four business days of the closing of any business combination and that report must include all information that would have been
required to have been filed had any such company filed a Form 10 Registration Statement with the SEC, along with required audited,
interim and pro forma financial statements. These regulations may eliminate many of the perceived advantages of these types of
transactions. These regulations also deny the use of Form S-8 for the registration of securities of a shell company, and limit
the use of Form S-8 to a reorganized shell company until the expiration of 60 days from when any such entity is no longer considered
to be a shell company. This prohibition could further restrict opportunities for us to acquire companies that may already have
stock option plans in place that cover numerous employees. In such an instance, there may be no exemption from registration for
the issuance of securities in any business combination to these employees, thereby necessitating the filing of a registration
statement with the SEC to complete any such reorganization, and incurring the time and expenses that are normally avoided by reverse
reorganizations. 

Competition 

Additionally,
we are in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating
a successful business combination. We are, and will continue to be, an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers
with, joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed
entities, including other small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies
that may be desirable target candidates for the Company. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources,
technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying
possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood
of our identifying and consummating a business combination. 

Effect
of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on Our Business Plan 

We
are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This Act created an independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct
of auditors, of public companies and to strengthen auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility
of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies;
establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities
analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members appointment, and compensation and oversight of the work of public
companies auditors; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; and establishes a federal crime
of securities fraud, among other provisions. 

7 

Section
14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply
with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to our
stockholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders
with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14A; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted
to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to our stockholders. 

We
are also required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and
to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant
amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

Employees 

We
presently do not have employees. Our directors and officers are engaged in outside business activities and anticipate that they
will devote very limited time to our business until a successful business opportunity has been identified. We do not expect significant
changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

AN
INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE IN NATURE AND INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. 

We
have minimal assets and no source of revenue. 

We
have few assets and have not recorded revenues since inception. We will not receive revenues until we select an industry in which
to commence business operations or complete an acquisition, reorganization or merger. We can provide no assurance that any selected
or acquired business will produce any material revenues for us or our stockholders, or that any such business will operate on
a profitable basis. 

We
will, in all likelihood, sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues, at least until the consummation of a merger
or other business combination with a private company. This may result in our incurring a net operating loss that will increase
unless we consummate a business combination with a profitable business. We cannot assure you that we can identify a suitable business
opportunity and consummate a business combination, or that any such business will be profitable at the time of its acquisition
by the Company or ever. 

There
can be no assurance that we will successfully consummate a business combination. 

We
can give no assurances that we will successfully identify and evaluate suitable business opportunities or that we will conclude
a business combination. Management has not identified any particular industry or specific business within an industry for evaluation.
We cannot guarantee that we will be able to negotiate a business combination on favorable terms. At the date of this filing, we
have no arrangement, agreement or understanding with respect to engaging in a merger with, joint venture with or acquisition of,
a private or public entity. No assurances can be given that we will successfully identify and evaluate suitable business opportunities
or that we will conclude a business combination.

There
is currently no trading market for our common stock, and liquidity of shares of our common stock is limited.

of our common stock are not registered under the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction, and accordingly there is
no public trading market for the common stock. Further, no public trading market is expected to develop in the foreseeable future
unless and until we complete a business combination with an operating business or the Company files and obtains effectiveness
of a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Therefore, outstanding
shares of common stock cannot be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred unless subsequently registered pursuant to, or
exempt from registration under, the Securities Act and any other applicable federal or state securities laws or regulations. Stockholders
may rely on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 of the Securities Act Rule 144 ), subject to certain
restrictions; namely, common stock may not be sold until one year after: 

(i) the
 completion of a business combination with a private company in a reverse merger or reverse
 takeover transaction after which the Company would cease to be a shell company 
 (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) and 

(ii) the
 disclosure of certain information on a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business
 days thereafter, and only if the Company has been current in all of its periodic SEC
 filings for the 12 months preceding the contemplated sale of stock. 

Compliance
with the criteria for securing exemptions under federal securities laws and the securities laws of the various states is extremely
complex, especially in respect of those exemptions affording flexibility and the elimination of trading restrictions in respect
of securities received in exempt transactions and subsequently disposed of without registration under the Securities Act or state
securities laws. 

We
expect to issue more shares in a merger or acquisition, which will result in substantial dilution. 

Our
Articles of Incorporation authorize the Company to issue an aggregate of 120,000,000 shares of capital stock, of which 100,000,000
are shares of common stock and 20,000,000 are shares of preferred stock. Any merger or acquisition effected by the Company may
result in the issuance of additional securities without stockholder approval and may result in substantial dilution in the percentage
of our common stock held by our then existing stockholders. Moreover, our common stock issued in any such merger or acquisition
transaction may be valued on an arbitrary or non-arm s-length basis by our management, resulting in an additional reduction
in the percentage of common stock held by our then existing stockholders. Our board of directors has the power to issue any or
all of such authorized but unissued shares without stockholder approval. To the extent that additional shares of common stock
or preferred stock are issued in connection with a business combination or otherwise, dilution to the interests of our stockholders
will occur and the rights of the holders of common stock might be materially adversely affected. 

It
is likely that our common stock will be considered penny stock, which may make it more difficult for investors to
sell their shares due to suitability requirements. 

Our
common stock may be deemed to be penny stock as that term is defined under the Exchange Act. Penny stocks generally
are equity securities with a price of less than 5.00. Penny stock rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers
who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. The term accredited investor 
refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of 5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of 1,000,000 or
an annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 jointly with their spouse. 

The
penny stock rules require a broker/dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver
a standardized disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature
and level of risks in the penny stock market. In addition, broker/dealers are required to determine whether an investment in a
penny stock is a suitable investment for a prospective investor. A broker/dealer must receive a written agreement to the transaction
from the investor setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. These requirements may reduce the
potential market for our common stock by reducing the number of potential investors. This may make it more difficult for investors
in our common stock to sell shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them. This could cause our stock price to decline.

Market
Information 

In
2012 we received notification from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA that our common stock was
cleared for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board using the symbol LZGI . As of the date of this report, there has
not been any trading activity in our common stock. We do not have any outstanding options or warrants to purchase our securities
or securities convertible into our common stock. 

Our
shares of common stock are subject to Section 15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Securities and Exchange Act, commonly referred to as
the penny stock rule. The rule defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than 5.00
per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to trade or maintain a market
in our common stock and may affect the ability of stockholders to sell their shares. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons
other than established customers and accredited investors must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of the
security. Accredited investors, in general, include individuals with assets in excess of 1,000,000 or annual income exceeding
 200,000 or 300,000 together with their spouse, and certain institutional investors. The rules require the broker-dealer to receive
the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase and require the broker-dealer to deliver a risk
disclosure document relating to the penny stock prior to the first transaction. A broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions
payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, and current quotations for the security. Finally, monthly
statements must be sent to customers disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks. 

Holders 

We
have 58 stockholders of record of our common stock as of August 17, 2016. The Company has not issued any shares of its preferred
stock. 

Dividends 

We
have not declared dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable

7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Executive
Overview 

We
have not recorded revenues from operations since inception and lack revenues to cover our operating costs. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently devoting our efforts to obtain capital from
management, significant stockholders and/or third parties to cover minimal expenses; however, there is no assurance that additional
funding will be available. Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find
a suitable company and acquire or enter into a merger with such company. 

The
type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our profitability for long term. We may consider a business
which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or
markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or
operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition
of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading
market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which
may occur through a public offering. 

Our
management has not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business
combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages
of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject
to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth
companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk,
and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance
that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. 

Our
management anticipates that we will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing
and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management s
plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification
should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one
venture against gains from another. 

We
anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions,
rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there
are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital which we will have and/or the perceived benefits of becoming a
publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating
or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors
in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater
flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business
combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative
investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
May 31, 2016, we had cash of 1,562 and total liabilities of 168,499 compared to cash of 3,716 and total liabilities of 151,544
at May 31, 2015. We have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs. During the year
ended May 31, 2016 we borrowed 5,300 from a third party to fund our operations and relied upon a stockholder, for administrative
and professional services totaling 6,900. During the year ended May 31, 2015 we borrowed 5,000 from a third party to fund our
operations and relied upon the shareholder for administrative and professional services totaling 10,375. 

12 

These
conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are currently devoting our efforts to
obtaining capital from management, significant stockholders and/or third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is
no assurance that additional funding will be available. Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent
upon our ability to find a suitable business opportunity and acquire or enter into a merger with such a company. 

The
type of business opportunity that we acquire or merge with will affect our profitability for the long term. We may consider a
business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products
or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial
or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition
of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading
market for its securities, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control
which may occur through a public offering. 

During
the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs related to the filing of Exchange Act reports, and possibly investigating, analyzing
and consummating an acquisition. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds provided by management, significant
stockholders and third parties. 

Results
of Operations 

We
did not record revenues in 2016 or 2015. General and administrative expenses decreased to 14,354 for 2016 compared to 18,538
for 2015. General and administrative expenses represented consulting, administrative, professional services and out of pocket
costs and the 2016 decrease is primarily due to reduced consulting and administrative fees. 

Total
other expense increased to 4,755 for 2016 compared to 4,230 for 2015 as a result of interest on loans. 

Our
net loss decreased to 19,109 for 2016 compared to 22,768 for 2015. Management expects net losses to continue until we acquire
or merge with a business opportunity. 

Obligations 

We
have relied upon loans and advances to fund our operational expenses. During the years ended May 31, 2009 and 2010, our Director
and President, Greg L. Popp, loaned an aggregate of 23,500 to the Company. On April 20, 2010, these loans were combined into
one promissory note which carries interest at 8 , is not collateralized and matured in June 2012. On June 9, 2015, Mr. Popp extended
the due date of this loan from June 30, 2015 to June 30, 2018. 

During
2016 we borrowed 5,300 from a third party for operating expenses. At May 31, 2016 we owe the third party 38,600 and interest
expense for this loan was 2,875 and 2,350 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. These loans are payable upon demand, are not collateralized
and bear interest at 8 per annum. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources and would be considered material to investors. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

We
qualify as an emerging growth company under the recently enacted JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and
intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, among other
things, we will not be required to: 

Have
 an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section
 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 

Submit
 certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay 
 and say-on-frequency 

Obtain
 shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and 

Disclose
 certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive
 compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to
 median employee compensation. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words,
an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply
to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements
may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first
fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed 1 billion; (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated
filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our
ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed
second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding
three-year period.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

 To
the Board of Directors and 
 Stockholders LZG International, Inc. 

 We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of LZG International, Inc. (the Company as of May 31, 2016 and 2015
and the related statements of operations, stockholders (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended. LGZ International
Inc. s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. 

 We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of LGZ
International, Inc. as of May 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for years the ended in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

 The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements, The Company, has not earned significant revenue, has suffered net losses and has had negative
cash flows from operating activities during the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015. These matters raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans concerning these matters are also described
in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying
amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

 Notes
to the Financial Statements 

 May
31, 2016 and 2015 

NOTE
1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

(A)
Organization 

LZG
International, Inc. (the Company) is a Florida company that was incorporated on May 22, 2000. The Company has not paid any dividends
and any dividends that may be paid in the future will depend upon the financial requirements of the Company and other relevant
factors. The Company business model intended to establish an online grocery solution. A wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, LazyGrocer.Com
Corp., was established as part of this model, but it was dissolved in 2001. 

Activities
from inception have included raising capital and development of the Company s business plan, Securities and Exchange Commission
filings and limited operations. 

(B)
Use of Estimates 

In
preparing financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

(C)
Cash Equivalents 

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. 

(D)
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

It
is not practicable to estimate the fair value of related party loans because there is no established market for these loans and
it is inappropriate to estimate future cash flows, which are largely dependent on the Company establishing or acquiring operations
at some future point. No financial instruments are held for trading purposes. 

(E) 
Basic and Fully Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share 

In
accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share ASC 260 (formerly SFAS No. 128) , the computations of
basic loss per share of common stock are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period of
the consolidated financial statements. 

The
computations of basic and fully diluted loss per share of common stock are based on the weighted average number of common shares

Concentration of Credit Risk 

Financial
instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash. Our cash
balances are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located in the United States. The
Company does not maintain amounts on deposit with a financial institution that are in excess of the federally insured limit of
 250,000. The Company had 0 of cash balances in excess of federally insured limits at December 31, 2016 and 2015. 

NOTE
2 Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has
current liabilities in excess of current assets, has incurred losses since inception, has negative cash flows from operations,
and has no revenue-generating activities. Its activities have been limited for the past several years and it is dependent upon
financing to continue operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. It is
management s plan to acquire or merge with other operating companies. 

NOTE
3 Income Taxes 

At
May 31, 2016, the Company has available unused net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 168,200 which may be applied
against future taxable income and which expire in various years from 2021 through 2035. Due to a substantial change in the Company s
ownership during June, 2008 there will be an annual limitation on the amount of previous net operating loss carryforwards that
can be utilized.

NOTE
3 Income Taxes (Continued) 

The
amount of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes is dependent,
in part, upon the tax laws in effect, the future earnings of the Company, and other future events, the effects of which cannot
be determined. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the net operating loss carryforwards, the Company has
established a valuation allowance equal to the tax effect of the net operating loss carryforwards and, therefore, no deferred
tax asset has been recognized for the net operating loss carryforwards. The net deferred tax assets are approximately 25,228
and 22,362 as of May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with an offsetting valuation allowance of the same amount resulting in
a change in the valuation allowance of approximately 2,866 during the year ended May 31, 2016. 

The
Company did not have any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits
will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. 

The
Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operations in the provision
for income taxes. As of May 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax
positions. 

The
tax years that remain subject to examination by major taxing jurisdictions are those for the years ended May 31, 2016, 2015 and
2014.

NOTE
7 Recent Pronouncements 

On
June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities
(Topic 915). Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage
entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US
GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date
information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders equity, (2) label the financial statements as those
of a development stage entity; (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged
and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been
in the development stage. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and
interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015; however, entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or
interim reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued. The Company has elected to early adopt
these amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial statements as those of a development stage entity and have not
presented inception-to-date information on the respective financial statements. 

NOTE
8 Subsequent Events 

Loans
from an officer of the Company totaling 23,500 (See Note 5, above) had an extended due date of June 30, 2016 and have been extended

ITEM
9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

We
have not had a change in or disagreement with accountants on accounting financial disclosure. 

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of
the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President, who serves as
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective
because we had a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to
ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations of our Company we are unable to remediate
this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another company with more personnel. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our principal executive officer is
responsible to design or supervise a process that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The policies and procedures include: 

maintenance
 of records in reasonable detail to accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
 dispositions of assets, 

provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
 of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
 and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
 of management and directors, and 

provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
 use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

For
the year ended May 31, 2016, management has relied on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
 Internal Control - Integrated Framework, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
Based upon that framework, management determined that in the preparation of the financial statements we did not have additional
personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information. Accordingly, our President
has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is ineffective because lack of an adequate control environment
constitutes a deficiency. Due to the size and operations of the Company we are unable to remediate this deficiency until we acquire
or merge with another company with more personnel. 

Our
management determined that there were no changes made in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter
of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

require a minimum of one director and our current directors serve until our next annual meeting or until each is replaced by a
qualified director. Our executive officers are chosen by our board of directors and serve at its discretion. There are no existing

Greg
L. Popp : Mr. Popp is the President of Marine Life Sciences, LLC, a Nevada company that wholesales and retails neutraceutical
products to companies. He has served as President of that company since April 2005. In addition, during the past five years he
has also served as Director and President of Investrio, Inc., a Utah corporation which has developed a software platform and educational
products for consumers. Neither Marine Life Sciences nor Investrio, Inc. is an affiliate or subsidiary of LZG International. 

His
professional qualifications include an MBA and extensive experience with small company operations including experience as a Director
and President of Wings Things, Inc., a company that has a class of securities registered with the SEC pursuant to Section
12. 

L.
Lee Perry: Ms. Perry serves as President of Business Builders, Inc., a privately held Utah corporation that provides business
consulting for small businesses which she co-founded in 1997. Her business experience includes operating a small consulting business
and prior experience as a director and executive officer of small reporting company that had a class of securities registered
with the SEC pursuant to Section 12. While serving as director and executive officer of this company, she participated in that
company s acquisition of a business opportunity. 

During
the past ten years none of our executive officers have been involved in any legal proceedings that are material to an evaluation
of their ability or integrity; namely: (1) filed a petition under federal bankruptcy laws or any state insolvency laws, nor had
a receiver, fiscal agent or similar officer appointed by a court for the business or property of such person, or any partnership
in which he/she was a general partner at or within two years before the time of such filing, or any corporation or business association
of which he/she was an executive officer at or within two years before the time of such filing; (2) been convicted in a criminal
proceeding or named subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (3) been
the subject of any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction,
permanently or temporarily enjoining him or her from or otherwise limiting his/her involvement in any type of business, securities
or banking activities; or (4) been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action, by the SEC or the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission to have violated any federal or state securities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the
SEC has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated. 

Compliance
with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act 

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors, executive officers and persons who own more than ten percent
of a registered class of our equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership
of common stock and our other equity securities. Officers, directors and greater than ten-percent beneficial owners are required
by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. We believe no reports were required to be
filed during the year ended May 31, 2016. 

25 

Code
of Ethics 

Since
we have only two persons serving as executive officers and directors and because we have minimal operations, we have not adopted
a code of ethics for our principal executive and financial officers. Our board of directors will revisit this issue in the future
to determine if adoption of a code of ethics is appropriate. In the meantime, our management intends to promote honest and ethical
conduct, full and fair disclosure in our reports to the SEC, and comply with applicable governmental laws and regulations. 

Corporate
Governance 

We
are a smaller reporting company with minimal operations and only two directors and executive officers. Our board of directors Board has general charge, supervision and control of the business and affairs of the Company. We believe this
leadership structure is appropriate for the size of the Company. In addition, the Board s role in the Company s risk
management process includes reviewing operational, financial, legal, regulatory, and strategic risks. The Board reviews these
factors to enable it to understand and assess the Company s risk identification, risk management and risk mitigation strategies.
The Board has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process. 

We
do not have a standing nominating committee for directors, nor do we have an audit committee with an audit committee financial
expert serving on that committee. Our Board acts as our nominating and audit committee. 

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

Executive
Officer Compensation 

Our
principal executive officer, Mr. Popp, did not receive compensation during the past fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. None of our
named executive officers received any cash or non-cash compensation during the past two fiscal years, nor did they have outstanding
equity awards at year end. We have not entered into employment contracts with our executive officers and their compensation, if
any, will be determined at the discretion of our board of directors. 

We
currently do not have a compensation committee and during the last completed fiscal year our board of directors did not consider
or approve any executive officer compensation. 

We
do not offer retirement benefit plans to our executive officers, nor have we entered into any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement,
whether written or unwritten, that provides for payments to a named executive officer at, or in connection with, the resignation,
retirement or other termination of a named executive officer, or a change in control of the company or a change in the named executive
officer s responsibilities following a change in control. 

Director
Compensation 

We
do not have any standard arrangement for compensation of our directors for any services provided as director, including services
for committee participation or for special assignments.

13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Transactions
with Related Parties 

The
following information summarizes transactions during the past two fiscal years that we have either engaged in or propose to engage
in, involving our executive officers, directors, more than 5 stockholders, or immediate family members of these persons. These
transactions were negotiated between related parties without arms length bargaining and, as a result, the terms
of these transactions may be different than transactions negotiated between unrelated persons. 

During
the fiscal years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, First Equity Holdings, Corp. First Equity ), a 20 stockholder, provided
consulting, administrative and professional services and provided to, or paid on behalf of the Company, out-of-pocket costs. During
the 2016 year First Equity billed the Company 6,900 for its services and advances and during the 2015 year First Equity billed
the Company 10,375. As of May 31, 2016 First Equity s account payable totals 86,100. Our board of directors acknowledged
the validity and fairness of the services performed and the costs incurred, and approved the charges. 

During
the years ended May 31, 2009 and 2010, our Director and President, Greg L. Popp, loaned an aggregate of 23,500 to the Company
in a series of loans. These funds were used for our operational expenses. On April 20, 2010, all of the loans were combined into
one promissory note which carries interest at 8 , is not collateralized and matured at June 30, 2012. On June 1, 2013, Mr. Popp
extended the due date of the note to June 30, 2018. 

Director
Independence 

None
of our directors are independent directors as defined by NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 5605(a)(2). This rule defines persons as independent 
who are neither officers nor employees of the company and have no relationships that, in the opinion of the board, would interfere
with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities as directors.

5. The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
