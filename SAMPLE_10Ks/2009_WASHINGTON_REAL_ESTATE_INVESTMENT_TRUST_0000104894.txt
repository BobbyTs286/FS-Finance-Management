ITEM 1: 
 BUSINESS WRIT Overview Washington Real Estate Investment Trust we or WRIT is a self-administered, self-managed, equity real estate investment trust REIT successor to a trust organized in 1960. Our business consists of the ownership and operation of income-producing real properties in the greater Washington metro region. We own a diversified portfolio of office buildings, medical office buildings,
industrial/flex properties, multifamily buildings and retail centers. We believe that we qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue
Code and intend to continue to qualify as such. To maintain our status as a REIT, we are required to distribute 90 of our ordinary taxable income to our shareholders. When selling properties, we have the option of (a) reinvesting the sale
price of properties sold, allowing for a deferral of income taxes on the sale, (b) paying out capital gains to the shareholders with no tax to us or (c) treating the capital gains as having been distributed to our shareholders, paying the
tax on the gain deemed distributed and allocating the tax paid as a credit to our shareholders. Over the last five years, dividends paid per share have
been 1.72 for 2008, 1.68 for 2007, 1.64 for 2006, 1.60 for 2005 and 1.55 for 2004. Our geographic focus is based on two principles: 

1. 
 Real estate is a local business and is more effectively selected and managed by owners located, and with expertise, in the region. 

2. 
 Geographic markets deserving of focus must be among the nation s best markets with a strong primary industry foundation and diversified enough to withstand downturns in their
primary industry. We consider markets to be local if they can be reached from Washington within two hours by car. While we have historically
focused most of our investments in the greater Washington metro region, in order to maximize acquisition opportunities we will consider investments within the two-hour radius described above. We also may consider opportunities to duplicate our
Washington-focused approach in other geographic markets which meet the criteria described above. All of our trustees, officers and employees live and work
in the greater Washington metro region and a majority of our officers average over 20 years of experience in this region. This section includes or refers
to certain forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on such forward-looking statements beginning on page 50. The Greater Washington Metro Area Economy In 2008, the Washington metro region experienced positive job growth, an
increase in gross regional product GRP ), and the lowest unemployment rate among the major markets in the nation. However, the national economic recession has still negatively affected our region. Current projections indicate that the
Washington metro region added 26,000 new jobs in 2008 as one of the few national markets with positive job growth in 2008. The professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, health care and federal/state government sectors led job
growth in the region. According to the Center for Regional Analysis CRA at George Mason University, the Washington area s GRP in 2008 is estimated to have increased 2.5 , which is similar to the experience of the 2001-2002
economic slowdown. Approximately one-third of the area s GRP was generated by the federal government. The region s unemployment rate was 4.1 at October 2008, up a full 1.0 as compared to 2007, but still remains the lowest rate among all
of the nation s largest metro areas. In addition, the region s unemployment rate is well below the national average of 6.5 in October 2008. Growth in the Washington metro region is expected to be modest compared to past years. According to CRA, The Washington Leading Index, which forecasts area economic performance over the next 18 months, was 107.0, as of September 2008, below
the 108.9 achieved in September 2007, but above the 20-year average of 102.1. GRP for the Washington metro region is forecasted to increase by only 1.5 in 2009 and gradually improve going forward into 2010. Job growth in the region is forecasted to
soften in 2009 and increase in 2010, adding 24,000 and 37,000 new jobs, respectively, compared to the long-term 15-year average of 53,000.

 Greater Washington Metro Region Real Estate Markets Despite softening economic conditions, we believe the greater Washington metro region remains one of the top performing real estate markets in the nation. The region experienced a decrease in investment sales in
excess of 70 from 2007 levels. However, the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate (AFIRE) has publicized that it now considers Washington, DC as the top global city for real estate investment. The area s economy has translated into
stronger relative real estate market performance in each of our segments, compared to other national metropolitan regions, as reported by Delta Associates / Transwestern Commercial Services Delta ), a national full service real estate
firm that provides market research and evaluation services for commercial property types including office, industrial, retail and apartments. Nevertheless, we believe the potential exists in the current economic environment for downward pressure on
rents in 2009. Market statistics and information from Delta are set forth below: Office and Medical Office Sectors 

Rents increased 0.1 in 2008 in the region compared to 2.2 in 2007. 

Vacancy was 10.5 at year-end 2008, up from 9.1 one year ago and up from 8.5 at year-end 2006. 

The region has the fifth lowest vacancy rate of large metro areas in the United States. 

Net absorption totaled 3.6 million square feet, down from 5.4 million square feet in 2007. 

Of the 15.4 million square feet of office space under construction at year-end 2008, 26 is pre-leased compared to 28 one year ago.

The overall vacancy rate is projected to increase to 11.8 by 2010. Retail Sector 

Rental rates at grocery-anchored centers increased 1.7 in the region in 2008, a decrease from the 3.9 increase in 2007. 

Vacancy rates increased to 3.7 at year-end 2008 from 2.3 in 2007. 

Sales volume for food retailers in the greater Washington metro area increased 4.0 in 2008. Multifamily Sector 

Rents for all investment grade apartments increased 1.3 in the greater Washington metro region during 2008. Class A rents grew only by 0.1 compared to 1.3 
in 2007. 

Rents are expected to remain relatively flat in the region depending on submarket, less than the long-term average of 4.4 per annum.

Vacancy rates for all apartments increased to 4.3 in 2008 from 3.7 in 2007. Class A vacancy increased to 4.5 from 3.6 in 2007.
 Industrial/Flex Sector 

Rental rates for the industrial sector increased 0.3 in the greater Washington region in 2008 compared to 2.8 in 2007. 

Overall vacancy was 10.1 at year-end 2008, up from 9.5 one year ago. 

Net absorption was 4.4 million square feet, compared to 6.6 million square feet in 2007. 

Of the 3.5. million square feet of industrial space under construction at year-end, 30 is pre-leased, compared to 24 of space under construction that was
pre-leased one year ago.

 Our Portfolio As of
December 31, 2008, we owned a diversified portfolio of 93 properties consisting of 28 office properties, 17 medical office properties, 14 retail centers, 12 multifamily properties, 22 industrial/flex properties and land under
development. Our principal objective is to invest in high quality properties in prime locations, then proactively manage, lease and direct ongoing capital improvement programs to improve their economic performance. The percentage of total real
estate rental revenue by property group for 2008, 2007 and 2006, and the percent leased, calculated as the percentage of physical net rentable area leased, as of December 31, 2008, were as follows:

Total real estate rental revenue from continuing operations was 282.3 million for 2008, 252.7 million for 2007
and 205.9 million for 2006. During the three year period ended December 31, 2008, we acquired eight office buildings, ten medical office buildings, two retail centers, one multifamily building and five industrial/flex properties. We also
placed into service from development one office building and two multifamily buildings. During that same time frame, we sold two office buildings and two industrial properties. These acquisitions and dispositions were the primary reason for the
shifting of each group s percentage of total real estate rental revenue reflected above. No single tenant accounted for more than 3.5 of real estate
rental revenue in 2008, 3.6 of revenue in 2007, and 3.7 of revenue in 2006. All federal government tenants in the aggregate accounted for approximately 2.1 of our 2008 total revenue. Federal government tenants include the Department of Defense,
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Office of Personnel Management, Secret Service, Federal Aviation Administration, NASA and the National Institutes of Health. Our larger non-federal government tenants include the
World Bank, Sunrise Senior Living, Inc., INOVA Health Systems, URS Corporation, Lafarge North America, Inc., George Washington University, Westat, Inc., IQ Solutions and Sun Microsystems. We expect to continue investing in additional income producing properties. We invest in properties which we believe will increase in income and value. Our properties
typically compete for tenants with other properties throughout the respective areas in which they are located on the basis of location, quality and rental rates.

 In prior years, we have been engaged in significant ground-up development in order to further strengthen our portfolio
with long-term growth prospects. In 2007 and 2008, we completed construction on three ground-up development projects. The first was Bennett Park, a 224-unit multifamily property located in Arlington, VA, with the majority of units delivered by the
end of 2007. The second development project was The Clayborne Apartments, a 74-unit multifamily property located in Alexandria, VA. All of the units at Clayborne were delivered during the first quarter of 2008. Bennett Park and Clayborne were 78 
and 64 leased, respectively, at December 31, 2008. The third development project was Dulles Station, a Class A office property located in Herndon, VA. Dulles Station is entitled for two office buildings totaling 540,000 square feet. The
first 180,000 square foot office building was completed in the third quarter 2007, and was 86 leased at December 31, 2008. Construction of the 360,000 square foot second building remains in the planning phase. We make capital improvements on an ongoing basis to our properties for the purpose of maintaining and increasing their value and income. Major improvements and/or
renovations to the properties in 2008, 2007, and 2006 are discussed under the heading Capital Improvements and Development Costs. Further
description of the property groups is contained in Item 2, Properties and in Schedule III. Reference is also made to Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. On February 18, 2009, we had 307 employees including 229 persons engaged in property management functions and 78 persons engaged in corporate, financial, leasing,
asset management and other functions. Tax Treatment of Recent Disposition Activity In June 2008, Sullyfield Center and The Earhart Building were sold for a gain of 15.3 million. The capital gain from the sales was paid out to shareholders. In September 2007, Maryland Trade Centers I and II were
sold for a gain of 25.0 million. The proceeds from the sales were reinvested in replacement properties. We did not dispose of any of our properties in 2006. We distributed all of our 2008, 2007 and 2006 ordinary taxable income to our shareholders.
No provision for income taxes was necessary in 2008, 2007 or 2006. Availability of Reports Copies of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to such reports are available,
free of charge, on the Internet on our website www.writ.com. All required reports are made available on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 1A: 
 RISK FACTORS Set forth below are the risks that we
believe are material to our shareholders. We refer to the shares of beneficial interest in WRIT as our common shares, and the investors who own shares as our shareholders. This section includes or refers to certain
forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on such forward-looking statements beginning on page 50. Recent disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing or have other adverse effects on us or the market price of our common shares. The United States and global equity and credit markets have recently experienced significant price volatility and liquidity disruptions which have caused the market
prices of stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have significantly negatively impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less
attractive or unavailable. Continued uncertainty in the equity and credit markets will negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms or at all. In the event of a debt financing, our cost of borrowing in the future
will likely be significantly higher than historical levels. In the case of a common equity financing, the disruptions in the financial markets could continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common shares, potentially
requiring us to issue more shares than we would otherwise have issued with a higher market value for our common shares. These financial market circumstances also will negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions, undertake new development
projects and refinance our debt. These circumstances have also made it more difficult for us to sell properties and may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers are experiencing increased costs of
financing and difficulties in obtaining financing.

 The current market conditions are also adversely affecting many of our tenants and their businesses, including their
ability to pay rents when due and renew their leases at rates at least as favorable as their current rates. As well, our ability to attract prospective new tenants in the future could be adversely affected. There is a risk that government responses
to the disruptions in the financial markets will not restore consumer confidence, stabilize the markets or increase liquidity and the availability of equity or credit financing. Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry. Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets are subject to the risk that if our office, medical office, retail, multifamily and industrial properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses,
debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the revenues generated by our commercial and multifamily
properties: 

downturns in the national, regional and local economic climate; 

the economic health of our tenants and the ability to collect rents; 

consumer confidence, unemployment rates, and consumer tastes and preferences; 

competition from similar asset type properties; 

local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, medical office, retail, multifamily and industrial properties;

changes in interest rates and availability of financing; 

vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space; 

increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes; 

inflation; 

civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war; and 

significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, which are generally not
reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property. We are dependent upon the economic climate of the
Washington metropolitan region. All of our properties are located in the Washington metropolitan region, which may expose us to a greater amount of
market dependent risk than if we were geographically diverse. General economic conditions and local real estate conditions in our geographic region may be dependent upon one or more industries, thus a downturn in one of the industries may have a
particularly strong effect. In particular, economic conditions in our market are directly affected by federal government spending in the region. In the event of reduced federal spending or negative economic changes in our region, we may experience a
negative impact to our profitability and may be limited in our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. We face risks associated with
property acquisitions. We intend to continue to acquire properties which would continue to increase our size and could alter our capital structure.
Our acquisition activities and results may be exposed to the following risks: 

we may be unable to finance acquisitions on favorable terms; 

acquired properties may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investments; 

we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors, including publicly traded real estate investment trusts,
institutional investment funds and private investors; 

even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property, it is subject to customary conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence
investigations which may have findings that are unacceptable; 

competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price; and 

our estimates of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be inaccurate.

 We may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without recourse, or with limited recourse with respect to unknown
liabilities. As a result, if liability were asserted against us based upon the acquisition of a property, we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to properties
acquired might include: 

liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination; 

claims by tenants, vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties; 

liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and 

claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. We face potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-leasing space. From 2009 through 2013, leases on our commercial properties will expire on a total of approximately 67 of our leased square footage as of December 31, 2008, with leases on approximately 12 of our leased square
footage expiring in 2009, 16 in 2010, 15 in 2011, 10 in 2012 and 14 in 2013. We derive substantially all of our income from rent received from tenants. Also, if our tenants decide not to renew their leases, we may not be able to re-let the
space. If tenants decide to renew their leases, the terms of renewals, including the cost of required improvements or concessions, may be less favorable than current lease terms. As a result, our cash flow could decrease and our ability to make
distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected. Residential properties are leased under operating leases with terms of generally one year or less. For the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006, the residential tenant retention rate was 67 ,
67 and 68 , respectively. We face potential adverse effects from major tenants bankruptcies or insolvencies. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by a property. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the bankruptcy of a large
retail tenant caused a loss of approximately 1.0 million. In light of the current economic recession, it is possible that additional major tenants could file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future. We cannot evict a tenant
solely because of its bankruptcy. On the other hand, a court might authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease. In such case, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid, future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be
substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. This shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results from operations. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely rental payments. Provision for losses on
accounts receivable for the entire portfolio increased to 4.3 million in 2008, from 2.0 million in 2007 and 1.2 million in 2006. This unfavorable trend could continue or worsen in 2009 and forward. We face risks associated with property development. Developing
properties present a number of risks for us, including risks that: 

the development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already
incurred, if we are unable to obtain all necessary zoning and other required governmental permits and authorizations or abandon the project for any other reason; 

the development and construction costs of the project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and increased materials, labor, leasing or other
costs, which could make the completion of the project less profitable because market rents may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increase in construction costs; 

construction and/or permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or may not be available at all, which may cause the cost of the project to increase
and lower the expected return; 

the project may not be completed on schedule as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as weather, labor conditions and
material shortages, which would result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses; and 

occupancy rates and rents at the newly completed property may not meet the expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable.
 Properties developed or acquired for development may generate little or no cash flow from the date of acquisition through the date of
completion of development. In addition, new development activities, regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful, may require a substantial portion of management s time and attention.

 These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and, under certain circumstances, could prevent
completion of development activities once undertaken, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the trading price of our common shares, and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations
and to pay dividends to shareholders. Our properties face significant competition. We face significant competition from developers, owners and operators of office, medical office, retail, multifamily, industrial and other commercial real estate. Substantially all of our properties face competition
from similar properties in the same market. Such competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge. These competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties, which may
result in their owners being willing to make space available at lower prices than the space in our properties. We face risks associated with the use of
debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk. We rely on borrowings under our credit facilities and offerings of debt
securities to finance acquisitions and development activities and for working capital. The commercial real estate debt markets are currently experiencing volatility due to a number of factors, including the tightening of underwriting standards by
lenders and credit rating agencies and the reported significant inventory of unsold mortgage backed securities in the market. The volatility has resulted in investors decreasing the availability of debt financing as well as increasing the cost of
debt financing. As a result, we may not be able to obtain debt financing in the future on favorable terms, or at all. If we were unable to borrow under our credit facilities or to refinance existing debt financing, our financial condition and
results of operations would likely be adversely affected. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt, including the risk that our cash flow
may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. Therefore, we are likely to need to refinance at least a portion of our
outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt. If principal payments due at maturity cannot be
refinanced, extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new equity capital, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant balloon payments come due. Rising interest rates would increase our interest costs. We may
incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service debt. As a protection against rising interest rates,
we may enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate exchange contracts. These agreements, however, increase our risks that other parties to the agreements may not perform or that the agreements may be
unenforceable. Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition. Our credit facilities contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness. We must maintain a minimum tangible net
worth and certain ratios, including a maximum of total liabilities to total gross asset value, a maximum of secured indebtedness to gross asset value, a minimum of annual EBITDA to fixed charges, a minimum of unencumbered asset value to unsecured
indebtedness, a minimum of net operating income from unencumbered properties to unsecured interest expense and a maximum of permitted investments to gross asset value. Our ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject to compliance with
our financial and other covenants. The recent economic downturn and disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect our ability to comply with these financial and other covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants under our unsecured credit facilities or other debt instruments could result in a default under one or more of our debt
instruments. This could cause our lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and would therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. Further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current shareholders. The interests of our existing shareholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future developments and acquisitions instead of incurring additional debt. Our ability to execute our
business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing.

 Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other laws could result in substantial
costs. The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that public buildings, including commercial and multifamily properties, be made
accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If, pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial
alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to
our shareholders. We may also incur significant costs complying with other regulations. Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fair housing, rent control and fire and life
safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we may incur fines or private damage awards. We believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with all of these regulatory requirements. However, we do not know
whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will adversely affect our cash flow and results from operations. Some potential losses are not covered by insurance. We carry
insurance coverage on our properties of types and in amounts that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. We believe all of our properties are adequately insured. The property insurance that we
maintain for our properties has historically been on an all risk basis, which is in full force and effect until renewal in September 2009. There are other types of losses, such as from wars or catastrophic acts of nature, for which we
cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. In the event of an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insurance limits, we could lose both the revenues generated from the affected property and the capital we have invested in the
affected property. Depending on the specific circumstances of the affected property it is possible that we could be liable for any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could adversely affect our business
and financial condition and results of operations. Also, we have to renew our policies in most cases on an annual basis and negotiate acceptable terms for
coverage, exposing us to the volatility of the insurance markets, including the possibility of rate increases. Any material increase in insurance rates or decrease in available coverage in the future could adversely affect our results of operations
and financial condition. Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. Under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or
toxic substances or petroleum products at our properties, regardless of our knowledge or responsibility, simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other state and local governmental authorities are increasingly involved in indoor air quality standards, especially with respect to asbestos, mold, medical waste and lead-based paint. The clean up
of any environmental contamination, including asbestos and mold, can be costly. If unidentified environmental problems arise, we may have to make substantial payments which could adversely affect our cash flow because: 

as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination;

the law typically imposes clean-up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination;

even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination, each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible
for all of the clean-up costs; and 

governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs. These costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the value of the contaminated property. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum
products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. In addition, applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the
government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with a contamination.

 We have a storage tank third party liability, corrective action and cleanup policy in place to cover potential hazardous
releases from underground storage tanks on our properties. This insurance is in place to mitigate any potential remediation costs from the effect of releases of hazardous or toxic substances from these storage tanks. Additional coverage is in place
under a pollution legal liability real estate policy. This would, dependent on circumstance and type of pollutants discovered, provide further coverage above and beyond the storage tank policy. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. Such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos:

properly manage and maintain the asbestos; 

notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos; and 

undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building.
 Such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third
parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. It is our policy to retain independent
environmental consultants to conduct Phase I environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to our acquisition of properties. These assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas, an
examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state, federal and historical documents, but do not always involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling. Where
appropriate, on a property-by-property basis, our practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing, including sampling for asbestos, for mold, for lead in drinking water, for soil contamination where underground storage tanks are or
were located or where other past site usages create a potential environmental problem, and for contamination in groundwater. Even though these environmental assessments are conducted, there is still the risk that: 

the environmental assessments and updates did not identify all potential environmental liabilities; 

a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments;

new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted; and 

future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability to us.
 Failure to qualify as a REIT would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for
payment of dividends. If we fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we would be taxed as a corporation. We believe that we are
organized and qualified as a REIT and intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we fail to qualify as a REIT
we could face serious tax consequences that could substantially reduce the funds available for payment of dividends for each of the years involved because: 

we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income and could be subject to federal income tax at regular
corporate rates; 

we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; 

unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during
which we are disqualified; and 

all dividends would be subject to tax as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits potentially eligible as qualified
dividends subject to the 15 income tax rate. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would no longer be required to pay
dividends. As a result of these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could adversely affect the value of our shares.

 Recently enacted changes in securities laws are likely to increase our costs. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, has required changes in some of our corporate
governance and accounting practices. In addition, the New York Stock Exchange has promulgated a number of regulations. We expect these laws, rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to continue to make some
activities more difficult, time consuming and costly. We also expect these rules and regulations to continue to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we incur significantly higher
costs to obtain coverage. These laws, rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of trustees, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.
 The market value of our securities can be adversely affected by many factors. As with any public company, a number of factors may adversely influence the public market price of our common shares, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include: 

level of institutional interest in us; 

perceived attractiveness of investment in us, in comparison to other REITs; 

attractiveness of securities of REITs in comparison to other asset classes taking into account, among other things, that a substantial portion of REITs 
dividends are taxed as ordinary income; 

our financial condition and performance; 

the market s perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends; 

government action or regulation, including changes in tax law; 

increases in market interest rates, which may lead investors to expect a higher annual yield from our distributions in relation to the price of our shares;

relatively low trading volume of shares of REITs in general, which tends to exacerbate a market trend with respect to our shares; and 

any negative change in the level of our dividend or the partial payment thereof in common shares. Provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or the MGCL, may limit a change in control. There are several provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or the MGCL, that may limit the ability of a third party to undertake a change in control, including: 

a provision where a corporation is not permitted to engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder, defined as any holder or
affiliate of any holder of 10 or more of the corporation s stock, for a period of five years after that holder becomes an interested stockholder; and 

a provision where the voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share acquisition, as defined in the MGCL, may be restricted,
such that the control shares have no voting rights, except to the extent approved by a vote of holders of two-thirds of the common shares entitled to vote on the matter. These provisions may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or a change in control that may involve a premium price for holders of our shares or otherwise be in their
best interests.

ITEM 7: 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Our revenues are derived primarily from the ownership and operation of income-producing properties in the
greater Washington metro region. As of December 31, 2008, we owned a diversified portfolio of 93 properties, consisting of 28 office properties, 22 industrial/flex properties, 17 medical office properties, 14 retail centers, and 12 multifamily
properties, encompassing in the aggregate 13.0 million net rentable square feet, and land for development. We have a fundamental strategy of regional focus, diversification by property type and conservative capital management. When evaluating our financial condition and operating performance, we focus on the following financial and non-financial indicators, discussed in further detail herein:

Net operating income NOI by segment, calculated as real estate rental revenue less real estate operating expenses excluding general and administrative
and depreciation. NOI is a non-GAAP supplemental measure to net income. 

Funds From Operations FFO ), calculated as set forth below under the caption Funds from Operations. FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental measure
to net income. 

Economic occupancy occupancy ), calculated as actual real estate rental revenue recognized for the period indicated as a percentage of gross potential
real estate rental revenue for that period. Percentage rents and expense reimbursements are not considered in computing economic occupancy percentages. 

Leased percentage, calculated as the percentage of available physical net rentable area leased for our commercial segments and percentage of apartments leased for
our multifamily segment. 

Rental rates. 

Leasing activity, including new leases, renewals and expirations. During 2008, we continued our fundamental strategy of investing in diversified property types in the greater Washington metro region. The area s economy softened as the national economy moved into recession. The
unemployment rate for the Washington metro area is 4.1 , compared to 6.5 nationally, as of October 2008. Job growth increased 1.2 , compared to a 1.4 decline nationally. Government, professional and business services, and education and health
sectors, led job growth in the metro area in 2008. The Washington metro area s economic growth is forecasted to moderate in 2009, adding 24,000 new payroll jobs, according to Delta Associates and economist Dr. Steven Fuller of George Mason
University. Our results of operations in 2008 were primarily impacted by acquisitions and dispositions and the performance of our core portfolio. We
completed total acquisitions and dispositions totaling 576.7 million and 99.1 million, respectively, during the prior two years. The performance of our core portfolio, consisting of properties owned for the entirety of 2008 and the same time
period in 2007, declined compared to 2007, primarily due to lower occupancy and higher bad debt expense.

 The performance of our five operating segments generally reflected market conditions in our region: 

The regional office market contracted during 2008, with vacancy increasing to 10.5 from 9.1 in 2007. The Washington metro region has the fifth lowest overall
vacancy rate in the United States at 10.5 . Vacancy in the submarkets was 12.4 for Northern Virginia, 11.5 for Suburban Maryland, and 7.3 in the District of Columbia. Net absorption (defined as the change in occupied, standing inventory from one
year to the next) was well below average in all submarkets, and the pipeline of new office properties in the region decreased to 15.4 million square feet from 20.6 million square feet in the prior year. Our office portfolio was 93.9 
leased at year-end 2008, a decrease from 96.7 leased in the prior year. By submarket, our office portfolio was 95.5 leased in Northern Virginia, 91.0 leased in Suburban Maryland, and 96.5 leased in the District of Columbia.

The medical office market in the region remains healthy. Our medical office portfolio was 97.0 leased as of year-end 2008, a small decrease from 97.5 in 2007.

The region s retail market declined in 2008. Vacancy in the region for grocery-anchored shopping centers was 3.7 , compared to 2.3 in 2007. Overall retail
rental rates in the region increased 1.7 in 2008, after rising by 3.9 in 2007. Our retail portfolio was 97.8 leased at year-end 2008, a slight increase from 97.6 in 2007. 

The region s multifamily sector also slowed in 2008. The region s vacancy rate for investment grade apartments increased to 4.3 from 3.7 a year ago. The
Washington metro area s vacancy rate remains well below the national rate of 6.1 . The region s rents increased by 1.3 in 2008, below the long-term average of 4.4 . Our multifamily portfolio was 91 leased at year-end 2008, up from 87 in
2007. 

The industrial market softened in 2008. Rents have increased only 0.3 and vacancy increased to 10.1 , compared to 9.5 one year ago. Net absorption decreased to
4.4 million square feet, compared to 6.6 million square feet in 2007. Our industrial portfolio was 91.3 leased at year-end 2008, a decrease from 95.1 in 2007. During 2008, we completed the development of Dulles Station Phase I, Bennett Park and Clayborne Apartments. Dulles Station Phase One is a Class A office property
located in Herndon, VA. Bennett Park is a Class A high-rise and mid-rise apartment community with retail space located in Arlington, VA. The Clayborne Apartments is a Class A apartment building with retail space located in Alexandria, VA.
 We summarize below our significant transactions during the two years ended December 31, 2008: 2008 

The acquisition of one office property for 181.4 million, adding approximately 290,000 square feet, which was 100.0 leased at the end of 2008.

The acquisition of one 374 unit apartment building for 58.3 million, adding approximately 269,000 square feet, which was 90.9 leased at the end of 2008.

The acquisition of one medical office property for 6.5 million, adding approximately 36,000 square feet, which was 100.0 leased at the end of 2008.

The acquisition of one industrial/flex property for 11.2 million, adding approximately 150,000 square feet, which was 100.0 leased at the end of 2008.

The disposition of two industrial/flex properties for a sales price of 41.1 million and a gain on sale of 15.3 million. 

The agreement to acquire one medical office property, currently under construction, for 19.5 million. The purchase is expected to occur by the end of the second
quarter of 2009 and will add 85,300 square feet of medical office space.

The completion of a public offering of 1,725,000 common shares priced at 35.00 per share, raising 57.6 million in net proceeds during the fourth quarter of 2008.

The issuance of 1.1 million common shares at a weighted average price of 36.15 under our sales agency financing agreement, raising 40.7 million in net

aggregate consideration paid to repurchase the notes was 70.8 million, which amount included the 8.7 million remarketing option value paid to the remarketing dealer and accrued interest paid to the holders. The loss on extinguishment of debt was
 8.4 million, net of unamortized loan premium costs, upon settlement of these securities. We refinanced the repurchase of these notes, and refinanced a portion of line outstandings, by issuing a 100 million two-year term loan. We also entered into
an interest rate swap on a notional amount of 100 million, which had the effect of fixing the interest rate on the term loan at 4.45 . 

The repurchase of 16.0 million of our 3.875 convertible notes at a 25 discount to par value, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of 3.5 million.

The execution of new leases for 1,765,000 square feet of commercial space, with an average rental rate increase of 17.3 . Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to estimated useful lives of
real estate assets, estimated fair value of acquired leases, cost reimbursement income, bad debts, contingencies and litigation. We base the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from
those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are also described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition Our multifamily properties are leased under operating leases with terms of generally one year or
less, and our commercial properties (our office, medical office, retail and industrial segments) are leased under operating leases with average terms of three to seven years. We recognize real estate rental revenue and rental abatements from our
residential and commercial leases when earned on a straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases . Recognition of real estate rental revenue commences when control of the facility has been given to the tenant.
We record a provision for losses on accounts receivable equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. This estimate is based on our historical experience and a review of the current status of our receivables. Percentage rents, which represent
additional rents based on gross tenant sales, are recognized when tenant sales exceed specified thresholds. In accordance with SFAS No. 66,
 Accounting for Sales of Real Estate , sales are recognized at closing only when sufficient down payments have been obtained, possession and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and we have no significant continuing
involvement. We recognize cost reimbursement income from pass-through expenses on an accrual basis over the periods in which the expenses were incurred.
Pass-through expenses are comprised of real estate taxes, operating expenses and common area maintenance costs which are reimbursed by tenants in accordance with specific allowable costs per tenant lease agreements. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts
receivable primarily represents amounts accrued and unpaid from tenants in accordance with the terms of the respective leases, subject to our revenue recognition policy. Receivables are reviewed monthly and reserves are established when, in the
opinion of management, collection of the receivable is doubtful. Reserves are established for tenants whose rent payment history or financial condition casts doubt upon the tenant s ability to perform under its lease obligation. When the
collection of a receivable is deemed doubtful in the same quarter that the receivable was established, then the allowance for that receivable is recognized as an offset to real estate revenues. When a receivable that was initially established in a
prior quarter is deemed doubtful, then the allowance is recognized as an operating expense. In addition to rents due currently, accounts receivable include amounts representing minimal rental income accrued on a straight-line basis to be paid by
tenants over the remaining term of their respective leases. Included in our accounts receivable balance are notes receivable totaling 7.4 million and
 0.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 7.3 million of the 2008 balance represents the fair value of a note receivable acquired with 2445 M Street during the fourth quarter of 2008. The note receivable is from a prior
tenant at that property. Real Estate and Depreciation We depreciate buildings on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from 28 to 50 years. We capitalize all capital improvement expenditures associated with replacements, improvements or major repairs to real property that
extend its useful life and depreciate them using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 
 
 21

three to 30 years. We also capitalize costs incurred in connection with our development projects, including capitalizing interest and other internal costs
during periods in which qualifying expenditures have been made and activities necessary to get the development projects ready for their intended use are in progress. In addition, we capitalize tenant leasehold improvements when certain criteria are
met, including when we supervise construction and will own the improvements. We depreciate all tenant improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the term of the related tenant lease. Real estate depreciation expense from
continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 69.2 million, 55.7 million and 44.1 million, respectively. Maintenance and repair costs that do not extend an asset s life are charged to expense as
incurred. We capitalize interest costs incurred on borrowing obligations while qualifying assets are being readied for their intended use in accordance
with SFAS No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost . Total interest expense capitalized to real estate assets related to development and major renovation activities was 2.1 million, 6.1 million and 3.8 million, for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest capitalized is amortized over the useful life of the related underlying assets upon those assets being placed into service. We recognize impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations and held for sale, development assets or land under development, if indicators of impairment are present and the net undiscounted cash flows
estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount and estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with future development expenditures. If such carrying amount is in excess of the estimated cash flows from the
operation and disposal of the property, we would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to the estimated fair value. During 2008, we expensed 0.6 million, included in general and administrative
expenses, related to development projects no longer considered probable. There were no property impairments recognized during the periods ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to the related physical assets and in-place leases based on their fair values, in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations . The total
acquisition cost comprises the acquisition-date fair value of all assets transferred, equity issued, and liabilities assumed. The fair values of acquired buildings are determined on an as-if-vacant basis considering a variety of factors,
including the physical condition and quality of the buildings, estimated rental and absorption rates, estimated future cash flows and valuation assumptions consistent with current market conditions. The as-if-vacant fair value is
allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on property tax assessments and other relevant information obtained in connection with the acquisition of the property. No goodwill was recorded on our acquisitions for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The fair value of in-place leases consists of the following components (a) the estimated cost to us to
replace the leases, including foregone rents during the period of finding a new tenant and foregone recovery of tenant pass-throughs (referred to as absorption cost ), (b) the estimated cost of tenant improvements, and other direct
costs associated with obtaining a new tenant (referred to as tenant origination cost (c) estimated leasing commissions associated with obtaining a new tenant (referred to as leasing commissions (d) the
above/at/below market cash flow of the leases, determined by comparing the projected cash flows of the leases in place to projected cash flows of comparable market-rate leases (referred to as net lease intangible and (e) the
value, if any, of customer relationships, determined based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the tenant (referred to as customer relationship value ). We have
attributed no value to customer relationship value as of December 31, 2008 or 2007. The amounts used to calculate net lease intangible are discounted
using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired. Tenant origination costs are included in income producing property on our balance sheet and are amortized as depreciation expense on a straight-line basis over the
remaining life of the underlying leases. Leasing commissions and absorption costs are classified as other assets and are amortized as amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the underlying leases. Net lease
intangible assets are classified as other assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis as a decrease to real estate rental revenue over the remaining term of the underlying leases. Net lease intangible liabilities are classified as other
liabilities and are amortized on a straight-line basis as an increase to real estate rental revenue over the remaining term of the underlying leases. Should a tenant terminate its lease, the unamortized portion of the tenant origination cost,
leasing commissions, absorption costs and net lease intangible associated with that lease are written off. Federal Income Taxes We believe that we qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code and intend to continue to qualify as such. To maintain our status as a REIT, we
are required to distribute 90 of our ordinary taxable income to our shareholders. When selling properties, we have the option of (a) reinvesting the sale price of properties sold, 
 
 22

allowing for a deferral of income taxes on the sale, (b) paying out capital gains to the shareholders with no tax to us or (c) treating the capital
gains as having been distributed to our shareholders, paying the tax on the gain deemed distributed and allocating the tax paid as a credit to our shareholders. In June 2008, two industrial properties, Sullyfield Center and The Earhart Building,
were sold for a gain of 15.3 million. The proceeds from the sales were treated as a distribution to shareholders. In September 2007, Maryland Trade Centers I and II were sold for a gain of 25.0 million. The proceeds from the sale were reinvested
in replacement properties. We did not dispose of any of our properties in 2006, and we distributed all of our 2008, 2007 and 2006 ordinary taxable income to our shareholders. No provision for income taxes was necessary in 2008, 2007 or 2006.
 Results of Operations The discussion that follows is
based on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The ability to compare one period to another may be significantly affected by acquisitions completed and dispositions made during those years.
 For purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance, we categorize our properties as core , non-core or discontinued
operations. A core property is one that was owned for the entirety of the periods being evaluated and is included in continuing operations. A non-core property is one that was acquired or placed into service during either of
the periods being evaluated and is included in continuing operations. Results for properties sold or held for sale during any of the periods evaluated are classified as discontinued operations. A total of four properties were acquired during 2008,
eight properties and land for development were acquired during 2007 and fourteen properties were acquired during 2006. Two development properties were placed into service in 2008, and one development property was placed into service during 2007. Two
properties were sold and one property was classified as held for sale in 2008, and two properties were sold in 2007. These held for sale and sold properties are classified as discontinued operations for the 2008, 2007 and 2006 periods. There were no
properties sold or classified as held for sale in 2006. To provide more insight into our operating results, our discussion is divided into two main
sections: (a) the consolidated results of operations section, in which we provide an overview analysis of results on a consolidated basis, and (b) the net operating income NOI section, in which we provide a detailed analysis
of core versus non-core NOI results by segment. NOI is a non-GAAP measure calculated as real estate rental revenue less real estate operating expenses. Consolidated Results of Operations Real Estate Rental Revenue Real estate rental revenue for properties classified as continuing operations is summarized as follows (all data in thousands except percentage amounts):

Real estate rental revenue is comprised of (a) minimum base rent, which includes rental revenues recognized
on a straight-line basis, (b) revenue from the recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, (c) provisions for doubtful accounts, which includes provisions for straight-line receivables, (d) revenue from the collection of lease
termination fees and (e) parking and other tenant charges such as percentage rents. Minimum Base Rent : Minimum base rent increased by 24.5
million in 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to properties acquired or placed into service in 2008 and 2007 22.5 million), combined with a 2.0 million increase in minimum base rent from core properties due to higher rental rates in all
segments, partially offset by higher vacancy in the commercial segments.

 Minimum base rent increased by 38.4 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due primarily to properties acquired or placed
into service in 2007 and 2006 31.6 million), combined with a 7.4 million increase in minimum base rent from core properties due to increased occupancy in the office and industrial segments and rental rate increases in all segments. Recoveries from Tenants: Recoveries from tenants increased by 5.9 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to properties acquired or placed into service
in 2008 and 2007 4.0 million), combined with a 1.9 million increase in recoveries from tenants from core properties primarily due to higher real estate tax reimbursements 1.6 million) and common area maintenance reimbursements 0.2 million).
 Recoveries from tenants increased by 7.7 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due primarily to properties acquired or placed into service in 2007 and 2006 4.0 million), combined with a 3.7 million increase in recovery income from core properties due to higher operating expenses and utilities 0.9 million), common area maintenance 0.9 million) and real estate taxes 1.8 million). Provisions for Doubtful Accounts: Provisions for doubtful accounts increased by 2.6 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 due to higher provisions in the retail 1.0 million), industrial 1.0 million) and office 0.6 million) segments. Provisions for bad debt in the multifamily and medical office segments were flat. The higher overall provision is reflective of the economic recession that began in 2008.
In addition to the provision for doubtful accounts included in real estate rental revenue, net recoveries of previously written-off receivables of 0.3 million were recorded in property operating expenses. Provisions for doubtful accounts increased by 0.8 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. Lease Termination Fees : Lease termination fees increased by 0.8 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to higher fees in the office 0.8 million) and industrial 0.2 million) segments, partially
offset by lower fees in the retail segment 0.2 million). Lease termination fees increased slightly by 0.2 million in 2007 as compared to 2006.
 Parking and Other Tenant Charges : Parking and other tenant charges increased by 1.1 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to higher
parking revenue 0.8 million) and miscellaneous fees 0.3 million). Parking and other tenant charges increased by 1.3 million in 2007 as compared to
2006 due to higher parking revenue and antenna rent. A summary of economic occupancy for properties classified as continuing operations by segment

Economic occupancy represents actual real estate rental revenue recognized for the period indicated as a
percentage of gross potential real estate rental revenue for that period. Percentage rents and expense reimbursements are not considered in computing economic occupancy percentages. Our overall economic occupancy decreased to 92.3 in 2008 from 94.5 in 2007, driven primarily by the lease-up during 2008 of our development properties in the office and multifamily segments. Our development
properties Bennett Park, Clayborne Apartments and Dulles Station, Phase I were placed into service at the end of 2007 and during 2008, and were 78 , 64 and 86 leased at year-end, respectively. Overall economic occupancy increased to 94.5 in 2007 from 93.8 in 2006 due primarily to occupancy gains in the office and industrial segments.

Real estate expenses as a percentage of revenue were 33.5 for 2008, 31.0 for 2007 and 30.0 for 2006.
 Property Operating Expenses : Property operating expenses include utilities, repairs and maintenance, property administration and management,
operating services, common area maintenance and other operating expenses. Property operating expenses increased 9.9 million in 2008 as compared to 2007
due primarily to properties acquired and placed into service in 2008 and 2007, which accounted for 9.0 million of the increase. Property operating expenses from core properties increased by 0.9 million, driven by higher repairs and maintenance
costs 0.5 million) and administrative costs 0.5 million). Property operating expenses increased by 11.8 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due
primarily to the properties acquired and placed into service in 2007 and 2006, which accounted for 9.0 million of the increase. Property operating expenses from core properties increased by 2.8 million, driven by higher utilities rates and an
increase in core economic occupancy to 95.1 from 94.3 . Real Estate Taxes : Real estate taxes increased 6.3 million in 2008 as compared to 2007
due primarily to the properties acquired or placed into service in 2008 and 2007, which accounted for 4.1 million of the increase. Real estate taxes on core properties increased by 2.1 million due primarily to higher rates and assessments across
the portfolio. Real estate taxes increased by 4.8 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due primarily to the properties acquired in 2007 and 2006, which
accounted for 2.9 million of the increase. Real estate taxes on core properties increased by 1.9 million due primarily to higher value assessments. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses are summarized as follows (all data in thousands except percentage

Depreciation and Amortization : Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 17.3 million in 2008 as
compared to 2007 due primarily to properties acquired and placed into service of 340.3 million and 411.4 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 18.8 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due primarily to properties acquired and placed into service of 411.4 million and 303.0 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest Expense : Interest expense increased 8.0 million in 2008 compared to 2007, reflecting a 4.0 million decrease in capitalized interest due to placing
development projects into service at the end of 2007 and during 2008. Also, mortgage interest increased by 3.9 million due to entering into three new mortgage notes during the second quarter of 2008, as well as assuming a mortgage as part of the
2445 M Street acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2008. The proceeds of the new mortgage notes were used to pay down floating rate credit facility debt.

 Interest expense increased 14.6 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased acquisition and development activity
offset by the refinancing of higher interest rate unsecured notes and mortgages. The acquisition and development activity in 2007 and 2006 was funded primarily by debt, including: (a) in January 2007 the issuance of 150.0 million of 3.875 
convertible notes due August 31, 2026, in June 2006 the issuance of 150.0 million of 5.95 unsecured notes due June 15, 2011, and in September 2006 the issuance of 110.0 million of 3.875 convertible notes due September 15, 2026,
(b) the increase in short-term borrowing on our lines of credit and (c) the assumption of mortgages totaling 26.8 million for the acquisitions of the Woodholme Portfolio 21.2 million) and Ashburn Farm Office Park 5.6 million), offset
somewhat by an increase in capitalized interest of 2.3 million. A summary of interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006

General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense decreased by 2.8 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to lower incentive compensation expense. Further, we incurred bondholder consent fees in 2007 that did not recur
in 2008. General and administrative expense increased by 2.5 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 due primarily to bondholder consent fees associated with
the modifications to our bond covenants, higher incentive compensation, equity compensation issued to the retiring Chief Executive Officer, higher trustee fees due to an increase in the value of annual equity awards and increased staff salaries
primarily due to the growth in our portfolio. Discontinued Operations We dispose of assets (sometimes using tax-deferred exchanges) that are inconsistent with our long-term strategic or return objectives and where market conditions for sale are favorable. The proceeds from the sales are
reinvested into other properties, used to fund development operations, used to otherwise support corporate needs or are distributed to our shareholders. We sold two industrial properties in 2008 and two office properties in 2007. Sullyfied Center and the Earhart Building were classified as held for sale in November 2007 and sold in June 2008. They were sold for a contract sales price of
 41.1 million, and we recognized a gain on sale of 15.3 million in accordance with SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate . Maryland Trade Centers I and II were classified as held for sale in March 2007 and sold as September
2007. They were sold for a contract sales price of 58.0 million, and we recognized a gain on disposal of 25.0 million. 15.3 million of the proceeds from the disposition were used to fund the purchase of CentreMed I II in August 2007 in a
reverse tax free property exchange, and 40.1 million of the proceeds from the disposition were escrowed in a tax free property exchange account and subsequently used to fund a portion of the purchase price of 2000 M Street in December 2007.
 In September 2008, we concluded that Avondale, a multifamily property, met the criteria specified in SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , necessary to classify this property as held for sale. Senior management has committed to, and actively embarked upon, a plan to sell the asset, and the sale is expected to be completed within one year under
terms usual and customary for such sales, with no indication that the plan will be significantly altered or abandoned. Depreciation on this property was discontinued at that time, but operating revenues and other operating expenses continue to be
recognized until the date of sale. Under SFAS No. 144, revenues and expenses of properties that are classified as held for sale or sold are treated as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the Statements of Income. For 2006, discontinued operations consist of the five properties classified as held for sale or sold in 2008 and 2007.

Income from operations of properties sold or held for sale decreased to 2.4 million in 2008 from 5.5 million
2007 due to the sale of Maryland Trade Center I II in September 2007 and the sale of Sullyfield Center and the Earhart Building in June 2008. Income
from operations of properties sold or held for sale increased to 5.5 million in 2007 from 3.8 million in 2006. The increase from is primarily due to the discontinuation of depreciation expense for Maryland Trade Center I II in March 2007.
 Net Operating Income NOI, defined as real estate
rental revenue less real estate expenses, is the primary performance measure we use to assess the results of our operations at the property level. We provide NOI as a supplement to net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). NOI does not represent net income calculated in accordance with GAAP. As such, it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating
performance. NOI is calculated as net income, less non-real estate other revenue and the results of discontinued operations (including the gain on sale, if any), plus interest expense, depreciation and amortization and general and
administrative expenses. A reconciliation of NOI to net income follows.

 Real estate rental revenue in 2008 increased by 29.6 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to the
acquisition or placing into service of five office properties, five medical office properties, three multifamily properties and two industrial properties in 2007 and 2008, which added approximately 2.3 million square feet of net rentable space.
These acquisition and development properties contributed 27.7 million of the increase. Real estate rental revenue from the core properties increased by 1.9 million primarily due to higher cash rental rates in all segments 6.0 million), partially
offset by higher bad debt expense 2.6 million) and lower core occupancy 1.6 million) in the commercial segments. Real estate expenses increased by
 16.2 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to acquisition and development properties, which contributed 13.1 million of the increase. Real estate expenses from core properties increased by 3.1 million due primarily to higher real
estate taxes 2.2 million), administrative expenses 0.5 million) and repairs and maintenance 0.4 million). Core economic occupancy decreased to 94.4 
in 2008 from 94.7 in 2007 due to lower core economic occupancy in the commercial property segments, partially offset by higher core economic occupancy in the multifamily segment. Non-core economic occupancy decreased to 82.2 in 2008 from 92.6 in
2007, driven by the lease-up of our development properties in the office and multifamily segments. During 2008, 60.8 of the commercial square footage expiring was renewed as compared to 79.9 in 2007. During 2008, 1.5 million commercial square
feet were leased at an average rental rate of 24.68 per square foot, an increase of 19.4 , with average tenant improvements and leasing costs of 13.36 per square foot. These leasing statistics do not include leases executed during 2008 for Dulles

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Structure We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach, generally seeking to
match the cash flow of our assets with a mix of equity and various debt instruments. We expect that our capital structure will allow us to obtain additional capital from diverse sources that could include additional equity offerings of common
shares, public and private secured and unsecured debt financings, and possible asset dispositions. Our ability to raise funds through the sale of debt and equity securities is dependent on, among other things, general economic conditions, general
market conditions for REITs, our operating performance, our debt rating and the current trading price of our common shares. We analyze which source of capital we believe to be most advantageous to us at any particular point in time. However, the
capital markets may not consistently be available on terms that we consider attractive. In particular, as a result of the current economic downturn and turmoil in the capital markets, unsecured notes financings for REITs have currently become
virtually unavailable and long-term credit has become significantly more costly. We cannot predict how long these conditions will continue. We currently
expect that our potential sources of liquidity for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties, plus operating and administrative will include: 

Cash flow from operations; 

Borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities or other short-term facilities; 

Issuances of our equity securities and/or common units in our operating partnership; 

Proceeds from long-term secured or unsecured debt financings; 

Investment from joint venture partners; and 

Net proceeds from the sale of assets. As noted
above, our current access to long-term secured and unsecured debt financings has been adversely affected by the current economic downturn and turmoil in the credit markets. We cannot predict how long these conditions will continue. During 2009, we expect that we will have modest capital requirements, including the following items. There can be no assurance that our capital requirements will not be
materially higher or lower than these expectations. 

Funding dividends on our common shares and minority interest distributions to third party unit holders; 

Approximately 35.0 - 40.0 million to invest in our existing portfolio of operating assets, including approximately 15.0 - 20.0 million to fund tenant-related
capital requirements and leasing commissions; 

Approximately 15.0 million to fund first generation tenant-related capital requirements and leasing commissions; 

Approximately 2.5 million to invest in our development projects; and 

Approximately 19.5 - 50.0 million to fund our expected property acquisitions. We believe that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations and have access to the capital resources necessary to fund our requirements. However, as a result of general market conditions in the greater
Washington metro region, economic downturns affecting the ability to attract and retain tenants, unfavorable fluctuations in interest rates or our share price, unfavorable changes in the supply of competing properties, or our properties not
performing as expected, we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have access to capital on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain capital from other sources, we may not be able to pay the dividend
required to maintain our status as a REIT, make required principal and interest payments, make strategic acquisitions or make necessary routine capital improvements or undertake re-development opportunities with respect to our existing portfolio of
operating assets. In addition, if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property, resulting in loss of income and asset value.

 Debt Financing We
generally use secured or unsecured, corporate-level debt, including mortgages, unsecured notes and our unsecured credit facilities, to meet our borrowing needs. Long-term, we generally use fixed rate debt instruments in order to match the returns
from our real estate assets. We also utilize variable rate debt for short-term financing purposes. At times, our mix of variable and fixed rate debt may not suit our needs. At those times, we may use derivative financial instruments including
interest rate swaps and caps, forward interest rate options or interest rate options in order to assist us in managing our debt mix. We may either hedge our variable rate debt to give it an effective fixed interest rate or hedge fixed rate debt to
give it an effective variable interest rate. Typically we have obtained the ratings of two credit rating agencies in the underwriting of our unsecured
debt. As of December 31, 2008, Standard Poor s had assigned its BBB+ rating with a stable outlook, and Moody s Investor Service has assigned its Baa1 rating with a stable outlook, to our unsecured debt offerings. A
downgrade in rating by either of these rating agencies could result from, among other things, a change in our financial position. Any such downgrade could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing or could increase the interest rates
on our existing debt. However, we have no debt instruments under which the principal maturity would be accelerated upon a downward change in our debt rating. A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and each rating is
subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Our total debt at December 31, 2008 is summarized as follows (in
thousands): 

Total Debt 
 
 Fixed rate mortgages 

421,286 
 
 Unsecured credit facilities

 Unsecured notes payable

1,391,186 

If principal amounts due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or paid with proceeds of other capital
transactions, such as new equity capital, our cash flow may be insufficient to repay all maturing debt. Prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of a refinancing, such as possible reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate
loans, may result in higher interest rates and increased interest expense. Mortgage Debt At December 31, 2008, our 421.3 million in fixed rate mortgages, which includes a net 8.1 million in unamortized discounts due to fair value adjustments, bore an
effective weighted average fair value interest rate of 6.1 and had a weighted average maturity of 5.6 years. We may either initiate secured mortgage debt or assume mortgage debt from time-to-time in conjunction with property acquisitions.
 On May 29, 2008 we executed three mortgage notes payable totaling 81.0 million secured by 3801 Connecticut Avenue, Walker House and Bethesda Hill.
The mortgages bear interest at 5.71 per annum and interest only is payable monthly until May 31, 2016, at which time all unpaid principal and interest are payable in full. On February 17, 2009, we executed a mortgage note of 37.5 million at a fixed rate of 5.37 for a term of ten years, secured by Kenmore Apartments. The proceeds from the note were used to pay down borrowings
under our lines of credit and to repurchase a portion of our convertible notes. Unsecured Credit Facilities Our primary source of liquidity is our two revolving credit facilities. We can borrow up to 337.0 million under these lines, which bear interest at an adjustable spread
over LIBOR based on our public debt rating. Credit Facility No. 1 is a four-year, 75.0 million unsecured credit facility expiring in June 2011. We
had 5.4 million in letters of credit issued as of December 31, 2008, related to Credit Facility No. 1. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at our option of LIBOR plus a spread based on the credit rating on our publicly issued debt
or the higher of SunTrust Bank s prime rate and the Federal Funds Rate in effect plus 0.5 . All outstanding advances are due and payable upon maturity in June 2011. Interest only payments are due and payable generally on a monthly basis. In
addition, we pay a facility fee based on the credit rating of our publicly issued debt which currently equals 0.15 per annum of the 75.0 million committed capacity, without regard to usage. Rates and fees may be adjusted up or down based on
changes in our senior unsecured credit ratings.

 Credit Facility No. 2 is a four-year 262.0 million unsecured credit facility expiring in November 2010, with a one
year extension option. We had 67.0 million outstanding and 0.9 million in letters of credit issued as of December 31, 2008, related to Credit Facility No. 2. Advances under this agreement bear interest at our option of LIBOR plus a
spread based on the credit rating of our publicly issued debt or the higher of Wells Fargo Bank s prime rate and the Federal Funds Rate in effect on that day plus 0.5 . All outstanding advances are due and payable upon maturity in November
2010. Interest only payments are due and payable generally on a monthly basis. Credit Facility No. 2 requires us to pay the lender a facility fee on the total commitment of 0.15 per annum. These fees are payable quarterly. Our unsecured credit facilities contain financial and other covenants with which we must comply. Some of these covenants include: 

A minimum tangible net worth; 

A maximum ratio of total liabilities to gross asset value, calculated using an estimate of fair market value of our assets; 

A maximum ratio of secured indebtedness to gross asset value, calculated using an estimate of fair market value of our assets; 

A minimum ratio of annual EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to fixed charges, including interest expense;

A minimum ratio of unencumbered asset value, calculated using a fair value of our assets, to unsecured indebtedness; 

A minimum ratio of net operating income from our unencumbered properties to unsecured interest expense; and 

A maximum ratio of permitted investments to gross asset value, calculated using an estimate of fair market value of our assets. Failure to comply with any of the covenants under our unsecured credit facilities or other debt instruments could result in a default under one or more of our debt
instruments. This could cause our lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and would therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with our loan covenants. However, our ability to draw on our unsecured credit facilities or incur other unsecured
debt in the future could be restricted by the loan covenants. We anticipate that in the near term we may rely to a greater extent upon our unsecured
credit facilities and potentially maintain balances on our unsecured credit facilities for longer periods than has been our historical practice. To the extent that we maintain larger balances on our unsecured credit facilities or maintain balances
on our unsecured credit facilities for longer periods, adverse fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on earnings. Unsecured Notes We generally issue senior unsecured notes to fund our real estate assets long-term. We intend to ladder the maturities of our
debt to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk in future years. Depending upon market conditions, opportunities to issue unsecured notes on attractive
terms may not be available. In particular, as noted above, current access to unsecured notes financings for REITs has become virtually unavailable as a result of the current economic downturn and turmoil in the credit markets. Accordingly, as noted
above we anticipate that in the near term we may rely to a greater extent upon our unsecured credit facilities and potentially maintain balances on our unsecured credit facilities for longer periods than has been our historical practice. To the
extent that we maintain larger balances on our unsecured credit facilities or maintain balances on our unsecured credit facilities for longer periods, adverse fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on earnings.

 On or after September 20, 2011, we may redeem the convertible notes at a redemption price equal to the principal
amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the purchase date. In addition, on September 15, 2011, September 15, 2016 and September 15, 2021 or following the occurrence of certain
change in control transactions prior to September 15, 2011, holders of these notes may require us to repurchase the notes for an amount equal to the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
 Our unsecured notes contain covenants with which we must comply. These include: 

Limits on our total indebtedness; 

Limits on our secured indebtedness; 

Limits on our required debt service payments; and 

Maintenance of a minimum level of unencumbered assets. Failure to comply with any of the covenants under our unsecured notes could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments. This could cause our debt holders to accelerate the timing of payments and would therefore have a
material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with our
unsecured notes covenants. If principal amounts due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions, such
as new equity capital, our cash flow may be insufficient to repay all maturing debt. Prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of a refinancing, such as possible reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans, may result in
higher interest rates and increased interest expense. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we repurchased 16.0 million of our 3.875 convertible notes at a
25 discount to par value, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of 3.5 million. Subsequent to year end, we repurchased an additional 19.5 million of our 3.875 convertible notes at discounts ranging from 16 to 20 . We may from time to
time seek to repurchase and cancel our outstanding notes through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual
restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Term Loan On February 21, 2008 we entered into a 100 million unsecured term loan (the 2010 Term Loan with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The 2010 Term
Loan has a maturity date of February 19, 2010 and bears interest at our option of LIBOR plus 1.50 or Wells Fargo s prime rate. To hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the 100 million note, we entered into an interest rate
swap on a notional amount of 100 million, which had the effect of fixing the LIBOR portion of the interest rate on the term loan at 2.95 through February 2010. The current interest rate, taking into account the swap, is 4.45 (2.95 plus 150 basis
points). The interest rate swap agreement will settle contemporaneously with the maturity of the loan. Common Equity We have authorized for issuance 100.0 million common shares, of which 52.4 million shares were outstanding at December 31, 2008.

 During the second quarter of 2008, we completed a public offering of 2.6 million common shares priced at 34.80 per
share, raising 86.7 million in net proceeds. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay borrowings under our lines of credit. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed a public offering of 1.725 million common shares priced at
 35.00 per share, raising 57.6 million in net proceeds. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay borrowings under our lines of credit and for general corporate purposes. During the third quarter of 2008, we entered into a sales agency financing agreement with BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC relating to the issuance and sale of up to 150.0 million of our common shares from time to
time over a period of no more than 36 months. Sales of our common shares are made at market prices prevailing at the time of sale. Net proceeds for the sale of common shares under this program are used for the repayment of borrowings under our lines
of credit, acquisitions and general corporate purposes. As of the end of 2008, we had issued 1.1 million common shares at a weighted average price of 36.15 under this program, raising 40.7 million in net proceeds. We have a dividend reinvestment program whereby shareholders may use their dividends and optional cash payments to purchase common shares. The common shares sold under
this program may either be common shares issued by us or common shares purchased in the open market. Net proceeds under this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of the end of 2008, 125,348 common shares were issued at a weighted
average price of 32.75 per share, raising 4.1 million in net proceeds. During the second quarter of 2007, we completed a public offering of
1.6 million common shares priced at 37.00 per share, raising 57.8 million in net proceeds. The net proceeds were used for the repayment of debt. Dividends We pay dividends quarterly. The maintenance of these dividends is subject to various factors, including the discretion of our
Board of Trustees, the ability to pay dividends under Maryland law, the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of REIT distribution requirements, which require at least 90 of our taxable income to be distributed
to shareholders. The table below details our dividend and distribution payments for 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in thousands).

Dividends paid for 2008 as compared to 2007 increased as a direct result of a dividend rate increase from 1.68
per share in 2007 to 1.72 per share in 2008. The dividends paid also increased due to our issuance of 4.325 million shares pursuant to public offerings and our issuance of 1.1 million under our sales agency financing agreement during
2008. Dividends paid for 2007 as compared to 2006 increased as a direct result of a dividend rate increase from 1.64 per share in 2006 to 1.68 per share
in 2007 as well as our issuance of 1.6 million shares in our public offering in June 2007. Cash flows from operations are an important factor in our
ability to sustain our dividend at its current rate. Cash flows from operations decreased to 97.0 million in 2008 from 115.5 million in 2007, primarily due to higher interest payments, lower prepaid rents and payout of contactors retainage
related to our development projects. If our cash flows from operations were to decline significantly, we may have to borrow on our lines of credit to sustain the dividend rate or reduce our dividend. Capital Commitments We will require capital for development and
redevelopment projects currently underway and in the future. As of December 31, 2008, we had under development Dulles Station Phase II and 4661 Kenmore, in which we had invested 25.8 million and 4.8 million, respectively. We are pursuing a
number of potential redevelopment projects at properties such as Montrose and 7900 Westpark. Projects placed into service in 2008 included Bennett Park, Clayborne Apartments and Dulles Station Phase I, in which we had invested 86.3 million, 36.6
million and 44.6 million as of December 31, 2008, respectively, including land and carrying costs. We expect our total project costs for Bennett Park, Clayborne Apartments and Dulles Station Phase I, to be 86.9 million, 36.7 million and
 60.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, we were committed to approximately 13.4 million of development spending during 2009, including 12.8 million of Dulles Station Phase I tenant-related capital.

December 31, 2008. We expect to meet our requirements using cash generated by our real estate operations, through borrowings on our unsecured credit facilities, secured financings of our properties or raising additional debt or equity capital
in the public market. Contractual Obligations Below

 Committed building capital additions based on contracts in place as of December 31, 2008.
 We have various standing or renewable contracts with vendors. The majority of these contracts are cancelable with immaterial or no
cancellation penalties, with the exception of our elevator maintenance, electricity sales and natural gas purchase agreements, which are included above on the purchase obligations line. Contract terms on cancelable leases are generally one year or
less. We are currently committed to fund tenant-related capital improvements as described in the table above for executed leases. However, expected leasing levels could require additional tenant-related capital improvements which are not currently
committed. We expect that total tenant-related capital improvements, including those already committed, will be approximately 21.0 million in 2009. Due to the competitive office leasing market we expect that tenant-related capital costs will
continue at this level into 2009.

 Operations generated 97.0 million of net cash in 2008 compared to 115.5 million in 2007. The decrease in cash
provided by operating activities in 2008 as compared to 2007 was due primarily to higher interest payments, lower prepaid rents and the payout of contractors retainage related to our development projects. Operations generated 115.5 million of net cash in 2007 compared to 86.5 million in 2006. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006
was due primarily to properties acquired in 2006 and 2007. The level of net cash provided by operating activities was also affected by the timing of receipt of revenues and payment of expenses. Our investing activities used net cash of 181.2 million in 2008 and 348.6 million in 2007. The decrease in cash used by investing activities in 2008 was primarily due
to the 168.2 million of cash invested in acquisitions, net of assumed debt, throughout 2008, which was 125.9 million lower than 2007. In addition, cash spent on our development projects decreased to 15.3 million from 66.5 million in 2007, as our
three major development projects (Bennett Park, Clayborne Apartments and Dulles Station, Phase I) were completed and placed into service during 2007 and 2008. Our investing activities used net cash of 348.6 million in 2007 and 334.7 million in 2006. The change in cash used by investing activities in 2007 was primarily due to the 294.2 million of cash invested in acquisitions, net of assumed
debt, throughout 2007, which was 67.7 million higher than 2006. This was offset by net cash received of 56.3 million from the sale of Maryland Trade Center I II. Our financing activities provided net cash of 74.6 million in 2008 and 245.9 million in 2007. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 was the primarily result of using much of the
borrowings and proceeds from equity issuances to pay down the lines of credit and to pay off the 60 million MOPPRS debt and the related 8.4 million loss on extinguishment. Also, on December 17, 2008 we repurchased 16.0 million of the
convertible notes for 12.5 million. The 2007 borrowings and proceeds from equity issuance were primarily used for the acquisition of new properties. Our
financing activities provided net cash of 245.9 million in 2007 and 251.9 million in 2006. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 was the primarily result of higher debt and equity offerings in 2006 and an increase in
dividends paid in 2007, offset by larger borrowings on lines of credit in 2007. Net borrowings/repayments on the lines of credit provided 131.5 million in 2007, offset somewhat by payment of dividends of 78.1 million and mortgage principal
payments of 11.4 million. Dividends increased in 2007 due to the issuance of 1,600,000 shares in June and an increase in the dividend rate. Capital
Improvements and Development Costs Capital improvements and development costs of 52.6 million were incurred in 2008, including tenant improvements.
These improvements to our properties in 2007 and 2006 were 107.6 million and 106.5 million, respectively.

Accretive Capital Improvements Acquisition related improvements are capital improvements to properties acquired during the preceding three years which were anticipated at the time we acquired the properties. These types of improvements were made in
2008 to 2000 M Street, 2440 M Street, 6100 Columbia Park Drive, Randolph Shopping Center and Alexandria Professional Center. Expansion projects increase
the rentable area of a property, while major renovation projects are improvements sufficient to increase the income otherwise achievable at a property. 2008 expansions and major renovations included garage and deck renovations at 7900 Westpark; roof
replacements at Bradlee Shopping Center and NVIP; common area and unit renovations for Bethesda Hill, Country Club Towers and the Ashby at McLean; and elevator modernization at One Central Plaza. Development costs represent expenditures for ground up development of new operating properties. Redevelopment costs represent expenditures for improvements intended to
re-position properties in their markets and increase income that would be otherwise achievable. Development costs in each of the years presented include costs associated with the ground up development of Bennett Park, Clayborne and Dulles Station.
Completion of Bennett Park, our residential project under development in Arlington, VA, occurred during 2007. Completion of Clayborne Apartments, our residential project under construction in Alexandria, VA, occurred in the first quarter 2008.
Completion of Phase I of Dulles Station, our 540,000 square foot office project in Herndon, VA, of which Phase I represents 180,000 square feet, occurred in the third quarter of 2007 and the property was substantially leased in the third quarter of
2008. Additionally in 2007, we acquired land for future development of medical office space at 4661 Kenmore in Alexandria, VA. Development spending in 2008 includes pre-development activities related to this project. In 2007 and 2006, re-development
costs were incurred for the Shoppes of Foxchase, which was substantially completed in 2006.

Excludes properties sold or classified as held for sale. The 0.73
decrease in tenant improvement costs per square foot of space leased for office buildings in 2008 was primarily due to leases executed at 6110 Executive Boulevard and 30 West Gude requiring 1.3 million and 0.7 million, respectively, in tenant
improvements in 2007, including 1.1 million and 0.4 million, respectively, for a single tenant. The 5.17 increase in tenant improvement costs per square foot of space leased for medical office buildings in 2008 was primarily due to leases
executed at Woodburn II, requiring 1.6 million in tenant improvements, including 1.2 million for a single tenant; and at 8503 Arlington Boulevard, for leases requiring 0.5 million in improvements for a single tenant. The 3.83 decrease in tenant
improvement costs per square foot of space leased for medical office buildings in 2007 was primarily due to leases executed in 2006 at 15001 Shady Grove and Woodburn I requiring 1.8 million in tenant improvements, primarily to a single tenant. The
 1.77 increase in tenant improvement costs per square foot of retail space leased in 2008 was primarily due to a lease executed at Montrose Center, requiring 0.5 million in tenant improvements. The 1.79 increase in tenant improvement costs per
square foot of retail space leased in 2007 was primarily due to leases executed at Montrose Center, The Shoppes of Foxchase and South Washington Street requiring 0.3 million in combined tenant improvements for single tenants. The 1.08 decrease in
tenant improvement costs per square foot of industrial space leased in 2008 was primarily due to leases executed in 2007 at Dulles Business Park and Gorman Road requiring 0.8 million and 0.4 million, respectively, in tenant improvements, entirely
for single tenants. These transactions also were the primary cause of the 0.73 increase in tenant improvement costs per square foot over 2006. The retail
and industrial tenant improvement costs are substantially lower than office and medical office improvement costs due to the tenant improvements required in these property types being substantially less extensive than in office and medical office.
Excluding properties sold or classified as held for sale, approximately 61 of our office tenants renewed their leases with us in 2008, compared to 83 in 2007 and 68 in 2006. Renewing tenants generally require minimal tenant improvements. In
addition, lower tenant improvement costs are a benefit of our focus on leasing to smaller office tenants. Smaller office suites have limited configuration alternatives. Therefore, we are often able to lease an existing suite with limited tenant
improvements. Other Capital Improvements Other capital improvements are those not included in the above categories. These are also referred to as recurring capital improvements. Over time these costs will be recurring in nature to maintain a property s income and value. In
our residential properties, these include new appliances, flooring, cabinets and bathroom fixtures. These improvements, which are made as needed upon vacancy of an apartment, totaled 0.8 million in 2008, and averaged 814 per apartment for the 33 
of apartments turned over relative to our total portfolio of apartment units. In our commercial properties and residential properties, aside from apartment turnover discussed above, these include installation of new heating and air conditioning
equipment, asphalt replacement, new signage, permanent landscaping, window replacements, new lighting and new finishes. In addition, during 2008, we incurred repair and maintenance expenses of 11.1 million that were not capitalized, to maintain the
quality of our buildings. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements include each of the statements in Item 1: Business and Item 7: Management s Discussion and

debt service coverage for the periods shown: 

Year Ended December 31, 

2008 
 
 2007 
 
 2006 
 
 Earnings to fixed charges

 Debt service coverage

 2.56x 
 
 2.76x 
 We computed the ratio of earnings to fixed charges by dividing earnings by fixed charges. For this purpose,
earnings consist of income from continuing operations plus fixed charges, less capitalized interest. Fixed charges consist of interest expense, including amortized costs of debt issuance, and interest costs capitalized. We computed the debt service coverage ratio by dividing EBITDA (which is earnings before interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization and gain on sale
of real estate) by interest expense and principal amortization. Both the earnings to fixed charges ratio and the debt service coverage ratio for the year
ended December 31, 2008 include the impact of the net loss on extinguishment of debt of 5.0 million (see Item 2: Consolidated Results of Operations. Funds From Operations FFO is a widely used measure of operating performance for real estate companies. We provide
FFO as a supplemental measure to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Although FFO is a widely used measure of operating performance for REITs, FFO does not represent net income calculated in accordance with GAAP. As such, it should not be
considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance. In addition, FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions
and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of our liquidity. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. NAREIT defines
FFO (April, 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property plus real estate depreciation and amortization. We consider FFO to be a standard supplemental measure for REITs because
it facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of our properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which historically assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.
Since real estate values have instead historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that FFO more accurately provides investors an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and fund other needs.
Our FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs. These other REITs may not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently.

ITEM 7A: 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The principal material financial market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to refinancing long-term fixed rate obligations, the opportunity cost of fixed rate obligations
in a falling interest rate environment and our variable rate lines of credit. We primarily enter into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes, including acquisition of real estate properties, capital improvements and working capital
needs. In the past we have used interest rate hedge agreements to hedge against rising interest rates in anticipation of imminent refinancing or new debt issuance. The table below presents principal, interest and related weighted average fair value interest rates by year of maturity, with respect to debt outstanding on December 31, 2008.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Accounting, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives,
and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Accounting, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2008. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Accounting concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective at a reasonable assurance level. Internal Control over Financial Reporting See the Report of Management in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. See the Reports of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During the three months ended December 31, 2008, there was no change in our internal control over financial

 MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management
of Washington Real Estate Investment Trust (the Trust is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial
reporting. The Trust s internal control system over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Trust s principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions. In connection with the preparation of the Trust s annual consolidated financial statements, management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the Trust s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO Framework). Management s assessment included
an evaluation of the design of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as of December 31, 2008, the Trust s internal control over financial reporting was effective at a reasonable assurance level regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst Young
LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Trust s consolidated financial statements included in this report, have issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust s internal control over
financial reporting, a copy of which appears on the next page of this annual report.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting The Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Washington Real Estate Investment Trust We have audited Washington Real Estate Investment Trust and Subsidiaries 
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
Washington Real Estate Investment Trust s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Washington Real Estate Investment Trust and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria . We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Washington Real Estate Investment Trust and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 and the related consolidated statements of
income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 of Washington Real Estate Investment Trust and Subsidiaries and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst Young LLP McLean, Virginia February 27, 2009

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Washington Real Estate Investment
Trust We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Washington Real Estate Investment Trust and Subsidiaries as of December 31,
2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 15(A). These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Washington
Real Estate Investment Trust and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United

Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst Young LLP McLean, Virginia February 27, 2009

 WASHINGTON REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 NOTE 1: NATURE OF BUSINESS Washington Real Estate Investment Trust We or WRIT ), a Maryland real estate investment trust, is a self-administered, self-managed equity real
estate investment trust, successor to a trust organized in 1960. Our business consists of the ownership and development of income-producing real estate properties in the greater Washington Metro region. We own a diversified portfolio of office
buildings, medical office buildings, industrial/flex centers, multifamily buildings and retail centers. Federal Income Taxes We believe that we qualify as a real estate investment trust (REIT) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code and intend to continue to qualify as such. To
maintain our status as a REIT, we are required to distribute 90 of our ordinary taxable income to our shareholders. When selling properties, we have the option of (a) reinvesting the sale price of properties sold, allowing for a deferral of
income taxes on the sale, (b) paying out capital gains to the shareholders with no tax to the Company or (c) treating the capital gains as having been distributed to the shareholders, paying the tax on the gain deemed distributed and
allocating the tax paid as a credit to the shareholders. In June 2008, two industrial properties, Sullyfield Center and The Earhart Building, were sold for a gain of 15.3 million. The proceeds from the sale were treated as a distribution to
shareholders. In September 2007, Maryland Trade Centers I and II were sold for a gain of 25.0 million. The proceeds from the sale were reinvested in replacement properties. We did not dispose of any of our properties in 2006, and we
distributed all of our 2008, 2007, and 2006 ordinary taxable income to our shareholders. Generally, no provisions for income taxes are necessary except for taxes on undistributed REIT taxable income and taxes on the income generated by our taxable
REIT subsidiaries TRS ). A TRS is subject to corporate federal and state income taxes on its taxable income at regular statutory rates. There were no tax provisions or material deferred income tax items for our TRS for the three-year
period ended December 31, 2008. The following is a breakdown of the taxable percentage of our dividends for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively

majority owned subsidiaries, after eliminating all intercompany transactions. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS No. 157 ). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. On February 12, 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2,
 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (the FSP ). The FSP amends SFAS No. 157 to delay the effective date for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for those that are recognized or disclosed at
fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (i.e. at least annually). The FSP defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years for
items within the scope of the proposed FSP. The effective date of the statement related to those items not covered by the deferral (all financial assets and liabilities or non-financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring
basis) is for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not have significant assets or liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, and therefore the adoption of this statement on January 1, 2008 did not have a
material impact on our financial statements. However, this statement requires us to provide expanded disclosures of our valuation techniques. In February
2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 . SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure eligible items
at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been

elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We have not
elected the fair value option for any assets or liabilities, and therefore the adoption of the statement did not have a material impact on our financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations , a revision of SFAS No. 141. This statement changes the accounting for acquisitions by specifically eliminating the step
acquisition model, changing the recognition of contingent consideration from being recognized when it is probable to being recognized at the time of acquisition, disallowing the capitalization of transaction costs, and delaying when restructuring
related to acquisitions can be recognized. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and will only impact the accounting for acquisitions we make after our adoption. The impact of this pronouncement on our
financial statements is dependent on the volume of our acquisition activity in 2009 and beyond. We currently expect the most significant impact of this statement to be the treatment of transaction costs, which will be expensed as a period cost upon
adoption of this statement. Also in December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements , which clarifies the classification of noncontrolling interests in consolidated statements of financial position and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling
interests. Under the new standard noncontrolling interests are considered equity and should be reported as an element of consolidated equity. Net income will encompass the total income of all consolidated subsidiaries and there will be a separate
disclosure on the face of the income statement of the attribution of that income between the controlling and noncontrolling interests. Increases and decreases in the noncontrolling ownership interest amount will be accounted for as equity
transactions. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The statement will require us to change the presentation of minority interests on our financial statements. In March 2008 the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 FAS 161 ). This statement requires entities to provide greater transparency about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows. To meet these objectives, FAS 161 requires (a) qualitative disclosures about objectives for using derivatives by primary underlying risk exposure and by purpose or strategy, (b) information about the
volume of derivative activity, (c) tabular disclosures about balance sheet location and gross fair value amounts of derivative instruments, income statement and other comprehensive income location and amounts of gains and losses on derivative
instruments by type of contract, and (d) disclosures about credit risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. FAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. This
statement will require us to provide expanded disclosures of our interest rate hedge contract. On May 9, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
APB 14-a (the convertible debt FSP ). This guidance clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (including partial cash settlement) upon conversion. This guidance will significantly impact the
accounting of the Company s convertible debt by requiring bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in stockholders equity, and then accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to result in interest
expense equal to the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. Other than the impact on net income from the debt discount amortization, the calculation of earnings-per-share will not be affected. The convertible debt FSP will be effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We estimate that the adoption of the convertible debt FSP as of January 1, 2009 will cause (i) approximately 21.5 million of our convertible debt s original carrying amount to
be reclassified into shareholders equity, (ii) a decrease in retained earnings of approximately 8.8 million, primarily due to the debt discount amortization, and (iii) additional interest expense of 4.0 million to 4.5 million to be
recorded each year going forward. On June 16, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03-6-1 (the dividend rights FSP ). This
guidance clarifies the accounting for unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents by proscribing that such awards be included in the computation of earnings per share EPS pursuant to the two-class method. The dividend rights FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We believe that the adoption of the dividend rights FSP will not have a material impact
on our EPS calculation. Revenue Recognition Residential properties (our multifamily segment) are leased under operating leases with terms of generally one year or less, and commercial properties (our office, medical office, retail and industrial segments) are leased under operating
leases with average terms of three to seven years. We recognize rental income and rental abatements from our residential and commercial leases when earned on a straight-line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases .
Recognition of rental income commences when control of the facility has been given to the tenant. We record a provision for losses on accounts receivable equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. This estimate is based on our historical
experience and a review of the current status of the Company s receivables. Percentage rents, which represent additional rents based on gross tenant sales, are recognized when tenants sales exceed specified thresholds.

 In accordance with SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate , sales are recognized at closing only
when sufficient down payments have been obtained, possession and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and we have no significant continuing involvement. We recognize cost reimbursement income from pass-through expenses on an accrual basis over the periods in which the expenses were incurred. Pass-through expenses are comprised of real estate taxes, operating expenses
and common area maintenance costs which are reimbursed by tenants in accordance with specific allowable costs per tenant lease agreements. Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable primarily represents amounts accrued and unpaid from tenants in accordance with the
terms of the respective leases, subject to our revenue recognition policy. Receivables are reviewed monthly and reserves are established when, in the opinion of management, collection of the receivable is doubtful. Reserves are established for
tenants whose rent payment history or financial condition casts doubt upon the tenant s ability to perform under its lease obligation. When the collection of a receivable is deemed doubtful in the same quarter that the receivable was
established, then the allowance for that receivable is recognized as an offset to real estate revenues. When a receivable that was initially established in a prior quarter is deemed doubtful, then the allowance is recognized as an operating expense.
In addition to rents due currently, accounts receivable include amounts representing minimal rental income accrued on a straight-line basis to be paid by tenants over the remaining term of their respective leases. Included in our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2008, is a notes receivable balance of 7.3 million, which represents the fair value of a note receivable
acquired with 2445 M Street during the fourth quarter of 2008. The note receivable is from a prior tenant at that property. There was no notes receivable balance as of December 31, 2007. Minority Interests We entered into an operating partnership agreement with a member of the entity that previously
owned Northern Virginia Industrial Park in conjunction with the acquisition of this property in May 1998. This resulted in a minority ownership interest in this property based upon defined company ownership units at the date of purchase. The
operating partnership agreement was amended and restated in 2002 resulting in a reduced minority ownership percentage interest. We account for this activity by recording minority interest expense by applying the minority owner s percentage
ownership interest to the net income of the property and including such amount in our general and administrative expenses, thereby reducing net income. In
August 2007 we acquired a 0.8 acre parcel of land located at 4661 Kenmore Avenue, Alexandria, Virginia for future medical office development. The acquisition was funded by issuing operating partnership units in our operating partnership, which is a
consolidated subsidiary of WRIT. This resulted in a minority ownership interest in this property based upon defined company operating partnership units at the date of purchase. Minority interest expense was 211,000, 216,900 and 204,100 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively. Quarterly distributions are made to the minority owners equal to the quarterly
dividend per share for each operating partnership unit. Deferred Financing Costs External costs associated with the issuance or assumption of mortgages, notes payable and fees associated with the lines of credit are capitalized and amortized using the effective interest rate method or the
straight-line method which approximates the effective interest rate method over the term of the related debt. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007 deferred financing costs of 20.8 million and 23.9 million, respectively, net of accumulated
amortization of 5.9 million and 7.9 million, were included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the balance sheets. The amortization is included in interest expense in the accompanying statements of income. The amortization of debt costs
included in interest expense totaled 2.6 million, 2.5 million and 1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Deferred Leasing Costs Costs associated with the successful negotiation of leases, both external commissions and internal direct costs, are
capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. If an applicable lease terminates prior to the expiration of its initial lease term, the carrying amount of the costs are written-off to amortization
expense. As of December 31, 2008 
 
 68

 Index to Financial Statements 

and 2007 deferred leasing costs of 31.4 million and 23.8 million, respectively, net of accumulated amortization of 10.4 million and 8.3 million, were
included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the balance sheets. The amortization of deferred leasing costs included in amortization expense for properties classified as continuing operations totaled 3.6 million, 3.0 million and 2.3 million
for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Real Estate and Depreciation We depreciate buildings on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from 28 to 50 years. We capitalize all capital improvement expenditures associated
with replacements, improvements or major repairs to real property that extend its useful life and depreciate them using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to 30 years. We also capitalize costs incurred in
connection with our development projects, including capitalizing interest and other internal costs during periods in which qualifying expenditures have been made and activities necessary to get the development projects ready for their intended use
are in progress. In addition, we capitalize tenant leasehold improvements when certain criteria are met, including when we supervise construction and will own the improvements. We depreciate all tenant improvements over the shorter of the useful
life of the improvements or the term of the related tenant lease. Real estate depreciation expense from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 69.2 million, 55.7 million and 44.1 million, respectively.
Maintenance and repair costs that do not extend an asset s life are charged to expense as incurred. We capitalize interest costs incurred on
borrowing obligations while qualifying assets are being readied for their intended use in accordance with SFAS No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost . Total interest expense capitalized to real estate assets related to development and
major renovation activities was 2.1 million, 6.1 million and 3.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest capitalized is amortized over the useful life of the related underlying assets upon those
assets being placed into service. We recognize impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations and held for sale, development assets or land
held for future development, if indicators of impairment are present and the net undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount and estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with
future development expenditures. If such carrying amount is in excess of the estimated cash flows from the operation and disposal of the property, we would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount
to the estimated fair value. During 2008, we expensed 0.6 million, included in general and administrative expenses, related to development projects no longer considered probable. There were no property impairments recognized during the periods
ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to the related physical assets and in-place leases based on their
fair values, in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations . The total acquisition cost comprises the acquisition-date fair value of all assets transferred, equity issued, and liabilities assumed. The fair values of acquired
buildings are determined on an as-if-vacant basis considering a variety of factors, including the physical condition and quality of the buildings, estimated rental and absorption rates, estimated future cash flows and valuation
assumptions consistent with current market conditions. The as-if-vacant fair value is allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on property tax assessments and other relevant information obtained in connection with the
acquisition of the property. No goodwill was recorded on our acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The fair value of
in-place leases consists of the following components (a) the estimated cost to us to replace the leases, including foregone rents during the period of finding a new tenant and foregone recovery of tenant pass-throughs (referred to as
 absorption cost ), (b) the estimated cost of tenant improvements, and other direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant (referred to as tenant origination cost (c) estimated leasing commissions associated
with obtaining a new tenant (referred to as leasing commissions (d) the above/at/below market cash flow of the leases, determined by comparing the projected cash flows of the leases in place to projected cash flows of comparable
market-rate leases (referred to as net lease intangible and (e) the value, if any, of customer relationships, determined based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall
relationship with the tenant (referred to as customer relationship value ). We have attributed no value to customer relationship value as of December 31, 2008 or 2007. The amounts used to calculate net lease intangible are discounted using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired. Tenant origination costs are included in income producing property
on our balance sheet and are amortized as depreciation expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the underlying leases. Leasing commissions and absorption costs are classified as other assets and are amortized as amortization
expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the underlying leases. Net lease intangible assets are classified as other assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis as a decrease to real estate rental revenue over the remaining
term of the underlying leases. Net lease intangible liabilities are classified as other liabilities and are amortized on a straight-line basis as an increase to real estate rental revenue over the remaining term of the underlying leases. Should a
tenant terminate its lease, the unamortized portion of the tenant origination cost, leasing commissions, absorption costs and net lease intangible associated with that lease are written off.

 Amortization of these components combined was 11.2 million, 9.0 million and 4.0 million for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, we have a below-market ground lease intangible asset from a 2007 acquisition with gross and net carrying values of 12.1 million and 11.9 million, respectively, as of
December 31, 2008. No value had been assigned to customer relationship value at December 31, 2008 or December 31, 2007. Discontinued
Operations We classify properties as held for sale when they meet the necessary criteria specified by SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , and EITF 03-13, Applying the Conditions in Paragraph 42 of FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, in Determining Whether to Report Discontinued
Operations . These include: (a) senior management commits to and actively embarks upon a plan to sell the assets, (b) the sale is expected to be completed within one year under terms usual and customary for such sales and
(c) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. Depreciation on these properties is discontinued, but operating revenues, operating
expenses and interest expense continue to be recognized until the date of sale. Under SFAS No. 144, revenues and expenses of properties that are
either sold or classified as held for sale are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated statements of income. Interest on debt that can be identified as specifically attributed to these properties is
included in discontinued operations. We do not have significant continuing involvement in the operations of any of our disposed properties. Cash and
Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of 90 days or
less. Restricted Cash Restricted cash at
December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 consisted of 18.8 million and 6.0 million, respectively, in funds escrowed for tenant security deposits, real estate tax, insurance and mortgage escrows and escrow deposits required by lenders on
certain of our properties to be used for future building renovations or tenant improvements.

 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements , requires quantitative disclosures about the fair value measurements separately for each major
category of assets and liabilities. The only assets or liabilities the Company has at December 31, 2008 that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are the assets held in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Program SERP and an interest rate hedge contract. The Company s valuations related to these items are based on assumptions derived from significant other observable inputs and accordingly fall into Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of
these assets and liabilities at December 31, 2008 is as follows (in millions):

Derivative Instruments In February 2008, we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of 100 million that qualifies as a cash flow hedge under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (see Note 6 for
further details). We enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable rate interest risk. We do not purchase derivatives for speculation. Our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value. The effective portion of changes in fair
value of cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of cash flow hedges is recorded in earnings in the period affected. We assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at
inception and on an ongoing basis. The hedge was deemed effective for the year ended December 31, 2008. We did not have any cash flow hedges during 2007 or 2006. Derivative instruments expose us to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparty under the terms of the interest rate hedge agreement. We believe that we minimize our credit risk on these
transactions by dealing with major, creditworthy financial institutions. As part of our on-going control procedures, we monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and our exposure to any single entity, thus minimizing our credit risk
concentration. Stock Based Compensation We previously
maintained a Share Grant Plan and Incentive Stock Option Plans as described in Note 7, and pursuant to those plans we made restricted share grants and granted share options to officers, eligible employees and trustees in 2006 and prior. In March
2007, the WRIT Board of Trustees adopted, and in July 2007 WRIT shareholders approved, the Washington Real Estate Investment Trust 2007 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan 2007 Plan ). This plan replaced the Share Grant Plan, which formally
expired on December 15, 2007, as well as the Incentive Stock Option Plans. The 2007 Plan provides for the award to WRIT s trustees, officers and non-officer employees of restricted shares, restricted share units, options and other awards up to
an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares over the ten year period in which the plan will be in effect. The shares and options granted pursuant to the Share Grant Plan and the Incentive Stock Option Plan were not affected by the adoption of the 2007 Plan.
 Under the plans above, officer and non-officer employee share grants vesting over five years vest in annual installments commencing one year after the
date of grant, and share grants vesting over three years vest twenty-five percent from date of grant in years one and two and fifty percent in year three. Officer performance share units, granted under an amendment to the Share Grant Plan, cliff
vest at the end of a three year performance period. Trustee share grants are fully vested immediately upon date of share grant and are restricted from transferability for the period of the trustee s service. 
 71 

Table of Contents 

 Index to Financial Statements 

 If an award under the Share Grant Plan is forfeited or an award of options granted under the Incentive Stock Option Plan
expires without being exercised, the shares covered by those awards will not be available for issuance under the 2007 Plan. If an award under the 2007 Plan of restricted shares or restricted share units is forfeited or an award of options or any
other rights granted under the 2007 Plan expires without being exercised, the shares covered by any such award would again become available for issuance under new awards. Compensation expense is recognized for share grants over the vesting period equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. Compensation cost for restricted performance share units is initially
measured at fair value at the issuance date as payouts are probable, is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates until all award conditions are established and a grant date has occurred, and is amortized to expense over the service period.
Compensation expense for the trustee grants, which fully vest immediately, is fully recognized upon issuance based upon the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. The unvested portion of officer and non-officer employee share grants
is recognized in compensation cost over the vesting period. Unvested shares are forfeited upon an employee s termination except for employees
eligible for retirement whose unvested shares fully vest upon retirement. For shares granted to employees who are eligible for retirement or will become eligible for retirement during the vesting period, compensation cost is recognized through the
date that the employee is no longer required to provide service to earn the award (e.g. the date the employee is eligible to retire). As noted above,
stock options were historically issued to officers, non-officer key employees and trustees under the Incentive Stock Option Plans. They were last issued to officers in 2002, to non-officer key employees in 2003 and to trustees in 2004. The options
vested over a 2-year period in annual installments commencing one year after the date of grant, except for trustee options which vested immediately upon the date of grant. All stock options were issued prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) and
were accounted for in accordance with APB No. 25, whereby if options are priced at fair market value or above at the date of grant and if other requirements are met then the plans are considered fixed and no compensation expense is recognized.
Accordingly, we have recognized no compensation cost for stock options. Earnings per Common Share We calculate basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share . Basic earnings per share excludes dilution
and is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common shares were exercised or converted into common shares, and then shared in our earnings. Sources of potentially dilutive common shares are our share based compensation plans, operating partnership units and senior convertible notes. The senior
convertible notes were not dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Income Taxes FIN 48 ), an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes , prescribes how we should recognize, measure and
present in our financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. Pursuant to FIN 48, we recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that a particular tax
position will be sustained upon examination or audit. To the extent that the more likely than not standard has been satisfied, the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely
of being recognized upon settlement. We have not recognized any uncertain tax provisions for the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. We are
subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of the states of Maryland and Virginia, and the District of Columbia, but as a REIT, we generally are not subject to income tax on our net income distributed as dividends to our shareholders.
 Tax returns filed for 2005 through 2008 tax years are subject to examination by taxing authorities. We classify interest and penalties related to
uncertain tax positions, if any, in our financial statements as a component of general and administrative expense. Use of Estimates in the Financial
Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Reclassifications Certain prior
year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

 Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) We recorded other comprehensive loss of 2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 to account for the change in valuation of an interest rate swap agreement that qualifies as a cash flow hedge under SFAS
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . We recorded no other comprehensive income for the years ending December 31, 2008 and 2007.

The amounts above reflect properties classified as continuing operations, which means they are to be held and used
in rental operations (income producing property). We have several properties that were recently in development in our office and multifamily segments. In
the office segment, Dulles Station, Phase I was placed into service during the third quarter of 2008. Dulles Station, Phase II remains in development. In the multifamily segment, Bennett Park was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of
2007, and the Clayborne Apartments were substantially completed in the first quarter of 2008. In the medical office segment, we have land under development at 4661 Kenmore Avenue. The cost of our real estate portfolio in development as of

Our results of operations are dependent on the overall economic health of our markets, tenants and the specific
segments in which we own properties. These segments include general purpose office, medical office, retail, multifamily and industrial. All segments are affected by external economic factors, such as inflation, consumer confidence, unemployment
rates, etc. as well as changing tenant and consumer requirements. Because the properties are located in the Washington metro region, the Company is subject to a concentration of credit risk related to these properties. As of December 31, 2008 no single property or tenant accounted for more than 10 of total assets or total real estate rental revenue.

We accounted for these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. As discussed in Note 2, we allocate
the purchase price to the related physical assets (land, building and tenant improvements) and in-place leases (absorption, tenant origination costs, leasing commissions, and net lease intangible assets/liabilities) based on their fair values in
accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations . The results of operations of the acquired properties are included in the income statement as of their respective acquisition date.

A note receivable with a fair value of 7.3 million was acquired in conjunction with 2445 M Street and is recorded separately as a note receivable in accounts receivable and other
assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The weighted remaining average life in months for the components above, other than land and
building, are 113 months for tenant origination costs, 106 months for leasing commissions/absorption costs, 111 months for net lease intangible assets, 99 months for net lease intangible liabilities, and 57 months for furniture, fixtures and
equipment. The acquisition of 2000 M Street on December 4, 2007 included a ground lease with 62 years remaining. The terms include a fixed annual
payment as well as an additional contingent amount based on the excess of gross income over predetermined levels. The difference in total 2008 contract
purchase price of properties acquired of 257.4 million and the acquisition cost per the consolidated statements of cash flows of 168.2 million is primarily the 101.9 million mortgage note assumed, offset by cash escrow accounts acquired totaling
 11.4 million, both related to the 2445 M Street purchase. The remaining difference of 1.3 million is for additional settlement costs, closing costs and non-cash adjustments on all 2008 acquisitions. The difference in total 2007 contract purchase
price of properties acquired of 319.3 million and the acquisition cost per the consolidated statements of cash flows of 294.2 million is the 26.8 million in mortgages assumed on the acquisitions of Woodholme Medical Office Building, Woodholme
Center and Ashburn Farm Office Park, offset by 1.7 million for additional settlement costs, closing costs and adjustments on all acquisitions. The difference in total 2006 contract purchase price of properties acquired of 303.0 million and the
acquisition cost per the consolidated statements of cash flows of 226.5 million is the 76.5 million in mortgages assumed on the acquisitions of 9707 Medical Center Drive, Plumtree Medical Center, 15005 Shady Grove Road, West Gude Drive, The Ridges
and The Crescent. The following unaudited pro-forma combined condensed statements of operations set forth the consolidated results of operations for the
years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 as if the above described acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the period of acquisition and the same period in the year prior to the acquisition. The unaudited pro-forma information does not

 Discontinued Operations We dispose of assets (sometimes using tax-deferred exchanges) that no longer meet our long-term strategy or return objectives and where market conditions for sale are favorable. The proceeds from the sales may be reinvested into other
properties, used to fund development operations or to support other corporate needs, or distributed to our shareholders. Properties are considered held for sale when they meet the criteria specified by SFAS No. 144 (see Note 2 
Discontinued Operations). Depreciation on these properties is discontinued at that time, but operating revenues, other operating expenses and interest continue to be recognized until the date of sale. We had one property classified as held for sale
at December 31, 2008 and three held for sale at December 31, 2007, as follows (in thousands):

We sold two properties and classified one property as held for sale in 2008. The two sold properties, Sullyfield
Center and The Earhart Building, were classified as held for sale in November 2007, and sold on June 6, 2008. They were sold for a contract sales price of 41.1 million, and we recognized a gain on sale of 15.3 million, in accordance with SFAS
No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate . In September 2008, we concluded that Avondale, a multifamily property, met the criteria specified
in SFAS No. 144 necessary for classification as held for sale. Senior management has committed to, and actively embarked upon, a plan to sell the asset, and the sale is expected to be completed within one year under terms usual and customary
for such sales, with no indication that the plan will be significantly altered or abandoned. Depreciation on this property was discontinued at that time, but operating revenues and other operating expenses continue to be recognized until the date of
sale. Under SFAS No. 144, revenues and expenses of properties that are classified as held for sale or sold are treated as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the statements of income. We sold two properties in 2007. The two sold properties, Maryland Trade Centers I and II, were classified as held for sale as of March 31, 2007 and sold on
September 26, 2007. They were sold for a contract sales price of 58.0 million, and we recognized a gain on disposal of 25.0 million, in accordance with SFAS No. 66. 15.3 million of the proceeds from the disposition was used to fund the
purchase of CentreMed I II on August 16, 2007 in a reverse tax free property exchange, and 40.1 million of the proceeds from the disposition were escrowed in a tax free property exchange account and subsequently used to fund a portion of
the purchase price of 2000 M Street on December 4, 2007. Operating results of the properties classified as discontinued operations are summarized as

The fair value of the mortgage notes payable was estimated upon acquisition by WRIT based upon market information and data, such as dealer quotes for instruments with similar
terms and maturities. There is no notation when the fair value at the inception of the mortgage is the same as the carrying value. 

If the loan is not repaid on August 11, 2010, from and after August 11, 2010, the interest rate adjusts to one of the following rates: (i) the greater of
(A) 10.82 or (B) the Treasury Rate (determined as of August 11, 2010, and defined as the yield calculated using linear interpolation approximating the period from August 11, 2010 to August 11, 2033 on the basis of Federal
Reserve Stat. Release H.15-Selected Interest Rates under the heading U.S. Governmental Security/Treasury Constant Maturities) plus 5 ; or (ii) if the Note is an asset of an entity formed for purposes of securitization and pursuant thereto
securities rated by a rating agency have been issued, then the rate will equal: the greater of (A) 7.82 or (B) the Treasury Rate plus 2 . Due to the high probability that the mortgage will be paid off on August 11, 2010, that date is
reflected in the future maturities schedule. Total carrying amount of the above mortgaged properties was 666.0 million and 449.3
million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Scheduled principal payments during the five years subsequent to December 31, 2007 and thereafter are as follows (in thousands):

 262.0 million unsecured line of credit maturing in November 2010 Credit Facility No. 2 ). Credit Facility No. 1
 We had no balance outstanding as of December 31, 2008 related to Credit Facility No. 1, and 5.4 million in letters of credit issued, with
 69.6 million unused and available for subsequent acquisitions or capital improvements. We had 70.0 million outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2007. During 2008, we borrowed 40.0 million to partially fund an acquisition. 110.0

 Borrowings under the facility bear interest at our option of LIBOR plus a spread based on the credit rating on our
publicly issued debt or the higher of SunTrust Bank s prime rate and the Federal Funds Rate in effect plus 0.5 . All outstanding advances are due and payable upon maturity in June 2011. Interest only payments are due and payable generally on a
monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we recognized interest expense (excluding facility fees) of 1.6 million and 0.8 million representing an average interest rate of 5.16 and 5.52 , respectively. In addition, we pay a facility fee based on the credit rating of our publicly issued debt which currently equals 0.15 per annum of the 75.0 million committed
capacity, without regard to usage. Rates and fees may be adjusted up or down based on changes in our senior unsecured credit ratings. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we incurred facility fees of 103,800 and 53,700,
respectively. Credit Facility No. 2 We had 67.0
million outstanding as of December 31, 2008 related to Credit Facility No. 2, and 0.9 million in letters of credit issued, with 194.1 million unused and available for subsequent acquisitions or capital improvements. 122.5 million was

 NOTE 6: NOTES PAYABLE On August 13, 1996, we issued 50.0 million of 7.25 unsecured 10-year notes due August 13, 2006 at 98.166 of par resulting in an effective interest rate of 7.49 . Net proceeds to the Trust after
deducting underwriting expenses were 48.8 million. These notes were paid in full on August 13, 2006, with advances from Credit Facility No.1 and Credit Facility No. 3. On February 20, 1998, we issued 50.0 million of 7.25 unsecured notes due February 25, 2028 at 98.653 to yield approximately 7.36 . We also sold 60.0 million in unsecured Mandatory Par Put Remarketed Securities MOPPRS at an effective borrowing rate through the remarketing date (February 2008) of approximately 6.74 . On February 25, 2008, we repaid the 60 million outstanding principal balance under the MOPPRS notes. The total aggregate
consideration paid to repurchase the notes was 70.8 million, which included 8.7 million for the remarketing option value paid to the remarketing dealer and accrued interest paid to the noteholders. Accordingly, WRIT recognized a loss on
extinguishment of debt of 8.4 million, net of unamortized loan premium costs, upon settlement of these securities. WRIT refinanced the repurchase of these notes, and refinanced a portion of the line outstanding under a credit facility, by issuing
the 100 million 2-year term loan described below. On March 17, 2003, we issued 60.0 million of 5.125 unsecured notes due March 2013. The notes
bear an effective interest rate of 5.23 . Our total proceeds, net of underwriting fees, were 59.1 million. We used portions of the proceeds of these notes to repay advances on our lines of credit and to fund general corporate purposes. 
 On December 11, 2003, we issued 100.0 million of 5.25 unsecured notes due January 2014. The notes bear an effective interest rate of 5.34 . Our total proceeds,
net of underwriting fees, were 99.3 million. We used portions of the proceeds of these notes to repay advances on our lines of credit. On April 26,
2005, we issued 50.0 million of 5.05 unsecured notes due May 1, 2012 and 50.0 million of 5.35 unsecured notes due May 1, 2015, at effective yields of 5.064 and 5.359 respectively. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes of 99.1
million were used to repay borrowings under our lines of credit totaling 90.5 million and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. On
October 6, 2005, we issued an additional 100.0 million of the series of 5.35 unsecured notes due May 1, 2015, at an effective yield of 5.49 . 93.5 million of the 98.1 million net proceeds from the sale of these notes was used to repay
borrowings under our lines of credit and the remainder was used to fund general corporate purposes. On June 6, 2006, we issued 100.0 million of
5.95 unsecured notes due June 15, 2011 at 99.951 of par, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.96 . Our total proceeds, net of underwriting fees, were 99.4 million. We used the proceeds of these notes to repay advances on one of our
lines of credit. On July 26, 2006, we issued an additional 50.0 million of the series of 5.95 unsecured notes due June 15, 2011 at 100.127 of
par, resulting in an effective yield of 5.92 . Our total proceeds, net of underwriting fees, were 50.2 million. We used the proceeds of these notes to repay borrowings under our lines of credit and to fund general corporate purposes. On September 11, 2006, we issued 100.0 million of 3.875 convertible notes due September 15, 2026. On September 22, 2006, we issued an additional 10.0
million of the 3.875 convertible notes due September 15, 2026, upon the exercise by the underwriter of an over-allotment option granted by WRIT. The notes were issued at 99.5 of par, resulting in an effective interest rate of 4.000 . Our
total proceeds, net of underwriting fees, were 106.7 million. We used the proceeds of these notes to repay borrowings under our lines of credit and to fund general corporate purposes.

 On January 22, 2007, we issued an additional 135.0 million of the 3.875 convertible notes due September 15,
2026. On January 30, 2007, we issued an additional 15.0 million of the 3.875 convertible notes due September 15, 2026, upon the exercise by the underwriter of an over-allotment option granted by WRIT. The notes were issued at 100.5 of
par, resulting in an effective interest rate of 4.003 . Our total proceeds, net of underwriting fees, were 146.0 million. We used the proceeds of these notes to fund the acquisition of 270 Technology Park and a portion of the acquisition of
Monument II, to repay borrowings under our lines of credit and to fund general corporate purposes. The convertible notes are convertible into our common
shares at the option of the holder, under specific circumstances or on or after July 15, 2026, at an initial exchange rate of 20.090 common shares per 1,000 principal amount of notes. This is equivalent to an initial conversion price of 49.78
per common share, which represents a 22 premium over the 40.80 closing price of our common shares at the time the September 2006 transaction was priced and a 21 premium over the 41.17 closing price of our common shares at the time the January
2007 transaction was priced. Holders may convert their notes into our common shares prior to the maturity date based on the applicable conversion rate during any fiscal quarter if the closing price of our common shares for at least 20 trading days
in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediate preceding fiscal quarter is more than 130 of the conversion price per common share on the last day of such preceding fiscal quarter. The initial conversion
rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances including an adjustment to the rate if the quarterly dividend rate to common shareholders is in excess of 0.4125 per share. In addition, the conversion rate will be adjusted if we make
distributions of cash or other consideration by us or any of our subsidiaries in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for our common shares, to the extent such cash and the value of any such other consideration per common share validly
tendered or exchanged exceeds the closing price of our common shares as defined in the note offering. Upon an exchange of notes, we will settle any amounts up to the principal amount of the notes in cash and the remaining exchange value, if any,
will be settled, at our option, in cash, common shares or a combination thereof. The convertible notes could have a dilutive impact on our earnings per share calculation in the future. However, these convertible notes are not dilutive for the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, and are not included in our earnings per share calculations. On or after September 20, 2011, we may
redeem the convertible notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the convertible notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the purchase date. In addition, on September 15,
2011, September 15, 2016 and September 15, 2021 or following the occurrence of certain change in control transactions prior to September 15, 2011, holders of these convertible notes may require us to repurchase the convertible
notes for an amount equal to the principal amount of the convertible notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. On December 17, 2008, we
repurchased 16.0 million of the convertible notes, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of 3.5 million. As of December 31, 2008, the amount outstanding on the convertible notes is 244.0 million. On February 21, 2008, we entered into a 100 million unsecured term loan (the 2010 Term Loan with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The 2010 Term
Loan has a maturity date of February 19, 2010 and bears interest at our option of LIBOR plus 1.50 or Wells Fargo s prime rate. To hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the 100 million note, we entered into an interest rate
swap on a notional amount of 100 million, which had the effect of fixing the LIBOR portion of the interest rate on the term loan at 2.95 through February 2010. The current interest rate, taking into account the swap, is 4.45 (2.95 plus 150 basis
points). The interest rate swap agreement will settle contemporaneously with the maturity of the loan. This swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge as discussed in Note 2.

Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually. These notes contain certain financial and non-financial
covenants, all of which we have met as of December 31, 2008. The covenants under our line of credit agreements require us to insure our properties
against loss or damage in amounts customarily maintained by similar businesses or as they may be required by applicable law. The covenants for the notes require us to keep all of our insurable properties insured against loss or damage at least equal
to their then full insurable value. We have an insurance policy which has no terrorism exclusion, except for nuclear acts of terrorism and non-certified chemical and biological acts of terrorism. Our financial condition and results of operations are
subject to the risks associated with acts of terrorism and the potential for uninsured losses as the result of any such acts. Effective November 26, 2002, under this existing coverage, any losses caused by certified acts of terrorism would be
partially reimbursed by the United States under a formula established by federal law. Under this formula the United States pays 85 of covered terrorism losses exceeding the statutorily established deductible paid by the insurance provider, and
insurers pay 10 until aggregate insured losses from all insurers reach 100 billion in a calendar year. If the aggregate amount of insured losses under this program exceeds 100 billion during the applicable period for all insured and insurers
combined, then each insurance provider will not be liable for payment of any amount which exceeds the aggregate amount of 100 billion. On December 26, 2007, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 was signed into law
and extends the program through December 31, 2014. NOTE 7: SHARE OPTIONS AND GRANTS Options In March 2007, the WRIT Board of Trustees adopted, and in
July 2007 WRIT shareholders approved, the Washington Real Estate Investment Trust 2007 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan 2007 Plan ). This plan replaced the Share Grant Plan, which expired on December 15, 2007, as well as the 2001
Stock Option Plan and Stock Option Plan for Trustees. The shares and options granted pursuant to the above plans are not affected by the adoption of the 2007 Plan. However, if an award under the Share Grant Plan is forfeited or an award of options
granted under the Option Plans expires without being exercised, the shares covered by those awards will not be available for issuance under the 2007 Plan.

 The 2007 Plan provides for the award to WRIT s trustees, officers and non-officer employees of restricted shares,
restricted share units, options and other awards up to an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares over the ten year period in which the plan will be in effect. If an award under the 2007 Plan of restricted shares or restricted share units is forfeited or an
award of options or any other rights granted under the 2007 Plan expires without being exercised, the shares covered by any such award would again become available for issuance under new awards. The previous Option Plans provided for the grant of qualified and non-qualified options. Options granted under the plans were granted with exercise prices equal to the
market price on the date of grant, vested 50 after year one and 50 after year two and expire ten years following the date of grant. Options granted to trustees were granted with exercise prices equal to the market price on the date of grant and
were fully vested on the grant date. As discussed in Note 2, option awards were accounted for in accordance with APB No. 25, and we have recognized no compensation cost for stock options. The last option awards to officers were in 2002, to
non-officer key employees in 2003 and to trustees in 2004. The following chart details the previously issued and currently outstanding and exercisable stock options:

 The 317,000 options outstanding at December 31, 2008, all of which are exercisable, have exercise prices
between 14.47 and 33.09, with a weighted-average exercise price of 25.31 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.5 years. The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding exercisable shares at December 31, 2008 was 0.9 million.
The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 1.1 million, 0.1 million and 1.2 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options forfeited in 2008 was 28,000. Share Grants, Performance Share Units and Restricted Share Units As
discussed in Note 2, we previously maintained a Share Grant Plan for officers, trustees and other members of management. In 2004 and 2005, awards were granted to officers and other members of management in the form of restricted shares, with a value
equal to various percentages of a participant s salary based upon WRIT s performance compared to an appropriate benchmark target, with minimum and maximum thresholds. The awards were valued based on market value at the date of grant.
Shares vest ratably over a five year period from the date of grant. Beginning in 2005, annual long-term incentive compensation for trustees was changed
from options of 2,000 shares plus 400 restricted shares to 30,000 in restricted shares. In May 2007, the value of the restricted shares awarded to trustees was increased to 55,000. These shares vest immediately and are restricted from sale for the
period of the trustee s service. The 2007 Plan provides for the granting of restricted share units to officers and other members of management and
performance share units to officers, based upon various percentages of their salaries and their positions with WRIT. WRIT s Chairman and prior Chief Executive Officer prior CEO was excluded from long-term awards under the program
in view of his announced intention to retire in 2007. For officers, one-third of the award is in the form of restricted share units that vest 20 per year based upon continued employment and two-thirds of the award is in the form of performance
share units. For other members of management, 100 of the award is in the form of restricted share units that vest 20 per year from date of grant based on performance targets. With respect to the performance share units, performance targets will be set annually based on appropriate benchmarks with minimum and maximum payout thresholds. The grants and each award are based on cumulative
performance over three years, and performance share units cliff vest at the end of the three year period. These performance share units are based on three-year cumulative performance targets set at the beginning of each year, as such, the grant date
does not occur until all such targets are set and thus the significant terms of the award are known. Because payouts are probable, WRIT estimates the compensation expense at each reporting period based on the current fair market value of the
probable award, until the vesting occurs and as progress towards meeting target is known, and recognizes this expense ratably over the three-year period. The expense related to the 2006 performance share units at the end of the three-year period was
approximately 1.3 million of which 179,000, 575,000 and 554,000 were recognized during the years ending 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2008, 43,000 performance share units were granted for the 2006 award tranche. The estimated expense
related to the 2007 performance share units at the end of the three-year period was approximately 1.3 million of which 29,000 and 806,000 was recognized during the years ending 2008 and 2007, respectively. The estimated expense related to the
2008 performance share units at the end of the three-year period was approximately 650,000 of which 217,000 was recognized during the year ending 2008. The program provides that participants who terminate prior to the end of the three-year
performance period forfeit their entire portion of the award.

 With respect to restricted share units, there were 21,877 restricted share units awarded to officers and other members of
management in December 2006, 24,344 restricted share units awarded to the prior CEO in the second quarter of 2007, and 38,228 restricted share units awarded to officers and other members of management in December 2007. There were 47,865 restricted
share units awarded to officers and other members of management in 2008. Performance and restricted share units awarded were initially valued at a
weighted average price per share based upon the market value on the date of grant, as follows:

 There were no shares granted during 2008. During 2007 and 2006 we issued 15,962 and 75,128 share grants,
respectively, to officers and other members of management. The 75,128 shares awarded in 2006 included an award of 64,700 shares to officers. The 64,700 shares vest twenty-five percent from date of grant in years one and two and fifty percent in year
three except shares awarded to the prior CEO, totaling 21,349 shares, who retired in 2007, which shares vested and were expensed immediately upon date of grant. The 15,962 shares awarded in 2007 were issued to the prior CEO at a price of 37.59 per
share based on the market value on the date of grant. They vested and were expensed immediately upon date of grant. In August 2008 as the result of an
award modification per the terms of the departing Chief Financial Officer s termination agreement, 7,820 share grants issued between 2004 and 2006 were remeasured under FAS 123(R) based on the market value of WRIT s stock at the time of
the award modification. The modification accelerated the vesting of the 7,820 share grants to be fully vested by February 28, 2009. In addition, 4,560 restricted share units awarded to the departing Chief Financial Officer in 2006 and 2007 were
revalued based on the market value of WRIT s stock at the time of the award modification. The modification also accelerated the vesting of the 4,560 restricted share units to be fully vested by February 28, 2009. The following are tables of activity for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 related to our share grants and restricted share unit grants.

The value of unvested restricted share units at December 31, 2008 was 3.0 million, which is expected to be
recognized as compensation cost over a weighted average period of 45 months on a straight-line basis. Total compensation expense recognized for share
based awards, including share grants and restricted share units, in each of the three years ending 2008 was (in millions):

 2006 included 1.2 million related to the accelerated vesting of
prior CEO share grant awards as required by SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payments FAS 123(R) ), and 358,000 related to the severance of the former Chief Investment Officer. 2007 included 0.6 million related to the
accelerated vesting of prior CEO share grant awards as required by FAS 123(R). 2008, included 0.2 million related to the accelerated vesting of departing Chief Financial Officer share grant and restricted unit awards as required by FAS 123(R).
 Under the 2007 Plan described in Note 2, elected deferrals of short term incentive awards by officers are converted into restricted
share units which vest immediately on the grant date and WRIT will match 25 of the deferred short term incentive in restricted share units, which vest at the end of three years. Dividends on these restricted share units are paid in the form of
restricted share units valued based on the market value of WRIT s stock on the date dividends are paid. WRIT granted 876 and 4,783 restricted share units to officers in 2008 and 2007, respectively, pursuant to elective short term incentive
deferrals. During 2008, WRIT granted 263 restricted share units on dividends.

 NOTE 8: OTHER BENEFIT PLANS We have a Retirement Savings Plan (the 401K Plan ), which permits all eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401K Plan, the
Company may make discretionary contributions on behalf of eligible employees. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company made contributions to the 401K plan of 0.4 million, 0.4 million and 0.3 million, respectively.
 We have adopted a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for the officers and members of the Board of Trustees. The plan allows for a deferral of a
percentage of annual cash compensation and trustee fees. The plan is unfunded and payments are to be made out of the general assets of the Trust. During 2008 the prior Chief Executive Officer received a lump sum distribution of the present value of
his deferred compensation. The deferred compensation liability was 0.8 million and 2.1 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We
established a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP effective July 1, 2002 for the benefit of our prior Chief Executive Officer. Under this plan, upon the prior Chief Executive Officer s termination of employment from
the Trust for any reason other than death, permanent and total disability, or discharge for cause, he is entitled to receive an annual benefit equal to his accrued benefit times his vested interest. We accounted for this plan in accordance with SFAS
No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions , whereby we accrued benefit cost in an amount that resulted in an accrued balance at the end of the prior Chief Executive Officer s employment in June 2007 which was not less than the
present value of the estimated benefit payments to be made. At December 31, 2008 the accrued benefit liability was 1.9 million. For the three years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized current service cost of 132,000,
 253,000 and 467,000, respectively. On December 31, 2006, WRIT adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158. SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans-an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(r) FAS 158 ), required the Trust to recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of
its pension plan in the December 31, 2006 statement of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Because the prior Chief Executive Officer s SERP is unfunded, the adoption of
FAS 158 did not have an effect on the Trust s consolidated financial condition at December 31, 2006, or for any prior period presented and it will not affect the Trust s operating results in future periods. The Trust currently has an
investment in corporate owned life insurance intended to meet the SERP benefit liability since the Chief Executive Officer s retirement. Benefit payments to the prior Chief Executive Officer began in 2008. In November 2005, the Board of Trustees approved the establishment of a SERP for the benefit of the officers, other than the prior Chief Executive Officer. This is a
defined contribution plan under which, upon a participant s termination of employment from WRIT for any reason other than death, discharge for cause or total and permanent disability, the participant will be entitled to receive a benefit equal
to the participant s accrued benefit times the participant s vested interest, offset by the corresponding change in the liability. We account for this plan in accordance with EITF 97-14, Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements
Where Amounts Earned are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested and SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities , whereby the investments are reported at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and
losses are included in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized current service cost of 311,000, 245,000 and 269,000, respectively. NOTE 9: FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments , requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments. The following disclosures of estimated fair value were determined by management using available market information and established valuation methodologies, including
discounted cash flow. Many of these estimates involve significant judgment. The estimated fair value disclosed may not necessarily be indicative of the amounts we could realize on disposition of the financial instruments The use of different market
assumptions or estimation methodologies could have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts. In addition, fair value estimates are made at a point in time and thus, estimates of fair value subsequent to 2008 may differ significantly from the
amounts presented. Below is a summary of significant methodologies used in estimating fair values and a schedule of fair values at December 31, 2008.

 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash and commercial paper with original maturities of less than 90 days, which are valued at the carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. Notes Receivable The fair value of the notes is estimated based on
quotes for debt with similar terms and characteristics or a discounted cash flow methodology using market discount rates if reliable quotes are not available. Derivatives The company reports its interest rate swap at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 133, and thus the carrying value is
the fair value. Mortgage Notes Payable Mortgage notes
payable consist of instruments in which certain of our real estate assets are used for collateral. The fair value of the mortgage notes payable is estimated based primarily upon lender quotes for instruments with similar terms and maturities.
 Lines of Credit Payable Lines of credit payable
consist of bank facilities which we use for various purposes including working capital, acquisition funding or capital improvements. The lines of credit advances are priced at a specified rate plus a spread. The carrying value of the lines of credit
payable is estimated to be market value given the adjustable rate of these borrowings. Notes Payable The fair value of these securities is estimated based primarily on lender quotes for securities with similar terms and characteristics.

increase in future years based on agreed-upon percentages or in some instances, changes in the Consumer Price Index. Percentage rents from retail centers, based on a percentage of tenants gross sales, were 0.4 million, 0.3 million
and 0.4 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Real estate tax, operating expense and common area maintenance reimbursement income from continuing operations was 31.6 million, 25.8 million and 18.1 million for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

 NOTE 11: COMMITTMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Development Commitments At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had various contracts outstanding with third parties
in connection with our ongoing development projects. Remaining contractual commitments for development projects at December 31, 2008 were 13.4 million. Litigation We are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings, lawsuits, examinations by various tax authorities and claims
that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the resolution of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Other At December 31, 2008, we were contingently liable under
an unused letter of credit in the amount of 4.0 million to ensure our acquisition of Landsdowne Medical Office Building, a building currently under construction, and unused letters of credit in the amounts of 885,000 and 815,000, related to our
assumption of mortgage debt on Dulles Business Park and West Gude, respectively, to ensure the funding of certain tenant improvements and leasing commissions over the term of the debt. We were also contingently liable under unused letters of credit
totaling 536,000 related to our development projects at Clayborne Apartments and Bennett Park, to ensure the complete installation of public improvements in accordance with the projects related site plans. NOTE 12: SEGMENT INFORMATION We have five reportable
segments: office, medical office, retail, multifamily and industrial/flex properties. Office buildings provide office space for various types of businesses and professions. Medical office buildings provide offices and facilities for a variety of
medical services. Retail centers are typically neighborhood grocery store or drug store anchored retail centers. Multifamily properties provide rental housing for families throughout the Washington metropolitan area. Industrial/flex centers are used
for flex-office, warehousing, services and distribution type facilities. Real estate rental revenue as a percentage of the total for each of the five
reportable operating segments is as follows:

 The accounting policies of each of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2. We evaluate performance
based upon operating income from the combined properties in each segment. Our reportable operating segments are consolidations of similar properties. SFAS No.131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information , requires
that segment disclosures present the measure(s) used by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segments performance. Net operating income is a key measurement of our segment profit and loss. Net operating income is
defined as segment real estate rental revenue less segment real estate expenses.

EQUITY During the second quarter of 2008, we completed a public offering of 2.6 million common shares priced at 34.80 per share, raising 86.7
million in net proceeds. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay borrowings under our lines of credit. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed a public offering of 1.725 million common shares priced at 35.00 per share, raising
 57.6 million in net proceeds. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay borrowings under our lines of credit and for general corporate purposes. During the third quarter of 2008, we entered into a sales agency financing agreement with BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC relating to the issuance and sale of up to 150.0 million of the our common shares from time to time over a period of
no more than 36 months. Sales of our common shares are made at market prices prevailing at the time of sale. Net proceeds for the sale of common shares under this program are used for the repayment of borrowings under our lines of credit,
acquisitions, and general corporate purposes. As of the end of 2008, we had issued 1.1 million common shares at a weighted average price of 36.15 under this program, raising 40.7 million in net proceeds. We have a dividend reinvestment program, whereby shareholders may use their dividends and optional cash payments to purchase common shares. The common shares sold under
this program may either be common shares issued by us or common shares purchased in the open market. Net proceeds under this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of the end of 2008, 125,348 common shares were issued at a weighted
average price of 32.75 per share, raising 4.1 million in net proceeds. During the second quarter of 2007, we completed a public offering of 1.6 million
common shares priced at 37.00 per share, raising 57.8 million in net proceeds. The net proceeds were used for the repayment of debt.

 CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT FOR SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT GENERAL COUNSEL THIS CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT Agreement is made and entered into as of this 7 th day of
October, 2008, by and between Washington Real Estate Investment Trust, a real estate investment trust organized under the laws of the State of Maryland (the Trust ), and Thomas C. Morey Employee ). WHEREAS, Employee currently is employed in a key position with the Trust; and WHEREAS, the parties believe it is in their mutual best interests to reach an understanding concerning the Trust s obligations to continue
Employee s compensation and certain health benefits should Employee s employment be terminated under certain conditions described herein; NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree to the following terms: 1. Definitions : For the purposes of this Agreement, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings set forth below: A. Change in Control : Change in Control means an event or occurrence set forth in any one or more of subsections
(i) through (iv) below (including any event or occurrence that constitutes a Change in Control under one of such subsections but is specifically exempted from another such subsection): (i) the acquisition by an individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) (a Person of beneficial ownership of any shares of beneficial interest in the Trust if, after such acquisition, such Person beneficially owns (within the meaning of rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) 40 or more of either (A) the then-outstanding shares of beneficial interest in the Trust (the Outstanding Trust Shares or (B) the combined voting power of the then-outstanding shares of
beneficial interest the Trust entitled to vote generally in the election of trustees (the Outstanding Trust Voting Shares provided, however, that for purposes of this subsection (i), the following acquisitions shall not constitute a
Change in Control: (A) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Trust or any corporation controlled by the Trust, or (B) any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a transaction
which complies with clauses (A) and (B) of subsection (iii) of this Section 1(A); or 
 Page 1 of 5 

(ii) such time as the Continuing Trustees (as defined below) do not constitute a majority
of the Board (or, if applicable, the Board of Directors or Trustees of a successor corporation or other entity to the Trust), where the term Continuing Trustee means at any date a member of the Board (A) who was a member of the Board on
the date hereof or (B) who was nominated or elected subsequent to the date hereof with the approval of other Board members who themselves constitute Continuing Trustees at the time of such nomination or election; provided, however, that there
shall be excluded from this clause (B) any individual whose initial assumption of office occurred as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of trustees or other actual or threatened
solicitation of proxies or consents, by or on behalf of a person other than the Board; or (iii) the consummation of a
merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or statutory share exchange involving the Trust or a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Trust in one or a series of transactions (a Business
Combination ), unless, immediately following such Business Combination, each of the following two conditions is satisfied: (A) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners of the Outstanding Trust
Shares and Outstanding Trust Voting Shares immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 60 of the then-outstanding shares of beneficial interest or stock, as the case may be, and the combined
voting power of the then-outstanding shares or stock, as the case may be, entitled to vote generally in the election of trustees, or directors, as the case may be, respectively, of the resulting or acquiring corporation or other entity in such
Business Combination (which shall include, without limitation, a corporation or other entity which as a result of such transaction owns the Trust or substantially all of the Trust s assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries)
(such resulting or acquiring corporation or other entity referred to herein as the Acquiring Entity in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such Business Combination, of the Outstanding Trust
Shares and Outstanding Trust Voting Shares, respectively; and (B) no Person (excluding the Acquiring Entity or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) maintained or sponsored by the Trust or by the Acquiring Entity) beneficially owns,
directly or indirectly, 40 or more of the then outstanding shares of beneficial interest or stock, as the case may be, of the Acquiring Entity, or of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding shares of such corporation or other entity
entitled to vote generally in the election of trustees or directors, as the case may be; or (iv) approval by the
shareholders of the Trust of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Trust. B. Involuntarily Terminated :
 Employee s employment will be deemed to have been involuntarily terminated due to a Change in Control if, on or after the date on which a Change in Control occurs, (i) Employee s employment is terminated by the Trust or the
successor owner of the Trust without cause or (ii) Employee resigns because Employee s duties, responsibilities or compensation are diminished; provided that if a termination otherwise covered by (i) or (ii) occurs during the
ninety (90) day period before the date on which a Change in Control occurs, the termination will be presumed to be due to the Change in Control unless the Trust or the successor owner of the Trust can show, through a preponderance of the
evidence, that the termination did not occur because of the impending Change in Control. C. Termination For Cause : A
termination for cause shall be deemed to occur only if the Trust or the successor owner of the Trust terminates Employee s employment for any of the following reasons: 1) commission by Employee of a felony or crime of moral turpitude; 2)
conduct by Employee in the performance of Employee s duties which is illegal, dishonest, fraudulent or disloyal; 3) the breach by Employee of any fiduciary duty Employee owes to 
 
 Page 2 of 5 

the Trust; or 4) gross neglect of duty or poor performance which is not cured by Employee to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trust within 30 days of
Employee s receipt of written notice from the Trust advising Employee of said gross neglect or poor performance. 2. Termination
Benefits : In the event Employee s employment with the Trust or the successor owner of the Trust is involuntarily terminated due to a Change in Control but not for cause, and such termination occurs within 24 months of the Change in
Control, the Trust or the successor owner shall provide Employee with the following termination benefits: A. continuation of
Employee s base salary at the rate in effect as of the termination date for a period of 24 months from the date of termination (in the event of Employee s death, said salary shall be paid to Employee s estate); B. payment of an annual bonus for each calendar year or partial calendar year in which Employee receives salary continuation pursuant to
Section 2(A) above, in an amount equal to the average annual bonus received by Employee during the three years prior to the involuntary termination, provided that, if Employee was employed for fewer than three years prior to the termination,
the bonus will be based on the average of the bonuses received by Employee in the year or years Employee received a bonus; and provided further, that if Employee receives salary continuation for a partial calendar year pursuant to Section 2(A)
above, the bonus will be pro-rated to reflect the number of full months Employee receives such salary continuation in such calendar year, rounded to the nearest number of months; C. the Trust will pay the full cost for Employee to continue coverage under the Trust s group health insurance plan pursuant to the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act COBRA for the period of time Employee receives salary continuation pursuant to Section 2(A) above up to a maximum of 18 months or until Employee obtains other comparable coverage,
whichever is sooner; D. immediate vesting in all then unvested options granted to Employee under the Trust s Incentive Stock
Option Plan and immediate vesting in all unvested accrued dividend equivalent units under the Trust s Dividend Equivalent Plan, and Employee shall have the right, in Employee s sole discretion, to exercise all or any of such options and to
sell the shares acquired pursuant thereto. In the event that Employee wishes to sell Employee s shares within 60 days of the involuntary termination, the shares must first be offered to the Trust for purchase at the Trust s option at the
then current fair market value. The Trust shall respond within one business day to the offer or its rights to purchase the shares shall expire. Sales occurring more than 60 days after the involuntary termination shall not be subject to this option;
and E. immediate vesting in all then unvested share grants granted to Employee under the Trust s Share Grant Plan and Employee
shall have the right, in Employee s sole discretion, to sell the shares acquired pursuant thereto. In the event that Employee wishes to sell Employee s shares within 60 days of the involuntary termination, the shares must first be offered
to the Trust for purchase at the Trust s option at the then current fair market value. The Trust shall respond within one business day to the offer or its rights to purchase the shares shall expire. Sales occurring more than 60 days after the
involuntary termination shall not be subject to this option; and 
 Page 3 of 5 

F. if, by virtue of receipt of the Termination Benefits described above, Employee is subject to
excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Trust or its successor owner shall make a supplemental cash payment to Employee no later than sixty (60) days after the date upon which Employee presents to the Trust or
its successor owner a letter setting forth a reasonable basis upon which Employee or Employee s advisors have determined that such excise tax is applicable to Employee. The amount of such supplemental payment shall be equal to such amount as
will provide Employee with funds equal to (i) the excise tax attributable to the Termination Benefits; (ii) any excise tax attributable to the supplemental payment itself; and (iii) any federal or local income taxes attributable to the
supplemental payment itself, it being the intention of the parties that Employee be placed in the same position for Federal and local income tax purposes as if Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code had no application to Employee.
 3. Mitigation : If a Change in Control occurs while Employee is employed by the Trust, and Employee s employment is involuntarily
terminated as a result of the Change in Control, Employee shall have no obligation to seek other employment in order to mitigate the payment of the Termination Benefits described in paragraph 2 hereunder; provided, that should Employee continue to
be employed by the Trust or the successor owner of the Trust after a Change in Control occurs, Employee s entitlement to receive the Termination Benefits described in subsections 2(A) and (B) hereunder shall be reduced for one-half of that
period of time (rounded to the nearest month) that Employee continues to be thus employed after the Change in Control occurs without being involuntarily terminated. For example, should Employee continue to be thus employed for ten (10) months
after the Change in Control occurs, Employee s entitlement to the Termination Benefits described in subsections 2(A) and (B) would be reduced by five (5) months. If Employee (despite the lack of obligation to seek other employment)
does in fact obtain other employment, the compensation to Employee from such other employment shall not be applied as an offset to Employee s Termination Benefits described in subsections 2(A) and (B) hereunder. 4. Limitations of Agreement : Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require the Trust or its successor owner to continue to employ Employee for
any definite period of time. Either Employee or the Trust may terminate the employment relationship at any time with or without cause, unless otherwise expressly required by law or contract, and provided that the terms of this Agreement are
observed. 5. Arbitration : Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement which cannot be resolved informally
by the parties shall be submitted to arbitration and adjudicated in Washington, D.C. pursuant to the commercial rules (single arbitrator) of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and
binding on all parties hereto. Each party shall bear its own costs in any arbitration proceeding held hereunder and the parties shall share the costs of the arbitrator. 6. Severability : In the event that any provision of this Agreement conflicts with the law under which this Agreement is to be construed, or if any such provision is held invalid or unenforceable by a
court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator, such provision shall be deleted from this Agreement and the Agreement shall be construed to give full effect to the remaining provisions thereof. 7. Governing Law : This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and governed according to the laws of the State of Maryland, without regard to the
principles of conflicts of law thereof. 
 Page 4 of 5 

8. Assignability : Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned by either
party without the prior written consent of the other. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and assigns. 9. Entire Agreement : This Agreement contains and represents the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior agreements, representations or
understandings, oral or written, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof, which are hereby terminated and of no further force or effect. This Agreement may not be modified or amended in any way unless in a writing signed by
both parties. 10. Counterparts : This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original
and together which shall constitute one and the same instrument. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement,
to be effective as of the day first above written.

calendar year, rounded to the nearest number of months; C. the Trust will pay the full cost for Employee to continue coverage under
the Trust s group health insurance plan pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act COBRA for the period of time Employee receives salary continuation pursuant to Section 2(A) above up to a maximum of 18
months or until Employee obtains other comparable coverage, whichever is sooner; D. immediate vesting in all then unvested options
granted to Employee under the Trust s Incentive Stock Option Plan and immediate vesting in all unvested accrued dividend equivalent units under the Trust s Dividend Equivalent Plan, and Employee shall have the right, in Employee s
sole discretion, to exercise all or any of such options and to sell the shares acquired pursuant thereto. In the event that Employee wishes to sell Employee s shares within 60 days of the involuntary termination, the shares must first be
offered to the Trust for purchase at the Trust s option at the then current fair market value. The Trust shall respond within one business day to the offer or its rights to purchase the shares shall expire. Sales occurring more than 60 days
after the involuntary termination shall not be subject to this option; and E. immediate vesting in all then unvested share grants
granted to Employee under the Trust s Share Grant Plan and Employee shall have the right, in Employee s sole discretion, to sell the shares acquired pursuant thereto. In the event that Employee wishes to sell Employee s shares within
60 days of the involuntary termination, the shares must first be offered to the Trust for purchase at the Trust s option at the then current fair market value. The Trust shall respond within one business day to the offer or its rights to
purchase the shares shall expire. Sales occurring more than 60 days after the involuntary termination shall not be subject to this option; and 
 Page 3 of 5 

F. if, by virtue of receipt of the Termination Benefits described above, Employee is subject to
excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Trust or its successor owner shall make a supplemental cash payment to Employee no later than sixty (60) days after the date upon which Employee presents to the Trust or
its successor owner a letter setting forth a reasonable basis upon which Employee or Employee s advisors have determined that such excise tax is applicable to Employee. The amount of such supplemental payment shall be equal to such amount as
will provide Employee with funds equal to (i) the excise tax attributable to the Termination Benefits; (ii) any excise tax attributable to the supplemental payment itself; and (iii) any federal or local income taxes attributable to
the supplemental payment itself, it being the intention of the parties that Employee be placed in the same position for Federal and local income tax purposes as if Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code had no application to Employee.
 3. Mitigation : If a Change in Control occurs while Employee is employed by the Trust, and Employee s employment is involuntarily
terminated as a result of the Change in Control, Employee shall have no obligation to seek other employment in order to mitigate the payment of the Termination Benefits described in paragraph 2 hereunder; provided, that should Employee continue to
be employed by the Trust or the successor owner of the Trust after a Change in Control occurs, Employee s entitlement to receive the Termination Benefits described in subsections 2(A) and (B) hereunder shall be reduced for one-half of that
period of time (rounded to the nearest month) that Employee continues to be thus employed after the Change in Control occurs without being involuntarily terminated. For example, should Employee continue to be thus employed for ten (10) months
after the Change in Control occurs, Employee s entitlement to the Termination Benefits described in subsections 2(A) and (B) would be reduced by five (5) months. If Employee (despite the lack of obligation to seek other employment)
does in fact obtain other employment, the compensation to Employee from such other employment shall not be applied as an offset to Employee s Termination Benefits described in subsections 2(A) and (B) hereunder. 4. Limitations of Agreement : Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require the Trust or its successor owner to continue to employ Employee for
any definite period of time. Either Employee or the Trust may terminate the employment relationship at any time with or without cause, unless otherwise expressly required by law or contract, and provided that the terms of this Agreement are
observed. 5. Arbitration : Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement which cannot be resolved informally
by the parties shall be submitted to arbitration and adjudicated in Washington, D.C. pursuant to the commercial rules (single arbitrator) of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and
binding on all parties hereto. Each party shall bear its own costs in any arbitration proceeding held hereunder and the parties shall share the costs of the arbitrator. 6. Severability : In the event that any provision of this Agreement conflicts with the law under which this Agreement is to be construed, or if any such provision is held invalid or unenforceable by a
court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator, such provision shall be deleted from this Agreement and the Agreement shall be construed to give full effect to the remaining provisions thereof. 7. Governing Law : This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and governed according to the laws of the State of Maryland, without regard to the
principles of conflicts of law thereof.

8. Assignability : Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned by either
party without the prior written consent of the other. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and assigns. 9. Entire Agreement : This Agreement contains and represents the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior agreements, representations or
understandings, oral or written, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof, which are hereby terminated and of no further force or effect. This Agreement may not be modified or amended in any way unless in a writing signed by
both parties. 10. Counterparts : This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original
and together which shall constitute one and the same instrument. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement,
to be effective as of the day first above written.
