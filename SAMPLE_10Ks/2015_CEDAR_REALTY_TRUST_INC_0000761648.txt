 Part I. 
 Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties 
 General Cedar Realty Trust, Inc.
(the Company is a fully-integrated real estate investment trust that focuses primarily on ownership and operation of grocery-anchored shopping centers straddling the Washington DC to Boston corridor. At December 31, 2014, the
Company owned and managed a portfolio of 59 operating properties (excluding properties held for sale/conveyance totaling approximately 9.2 million square feet of gross leasable area GLA ). The portfolio was 93.3 leased
and 92.9 occupied at December 31, 2014. The Company has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust REIT under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). To qualify as a REIT under those provisions, the Company must have a preponderant percentage of its assets invested in, and income derived from,
real estate and related sources. The Company s objectives are to provide to its shareholders a professionally-managed real estate portfolio consisting primarily of grocery-anchored shopping centers straddling the Washington DC to Boston
corridor, which will provide substantial cash flow, currently and in the future, taking into account an acceptable modest risk profile, and which will present opportunities for additional growth in income and capital appreciation. 
 The Company, organized as a Maryland corporation, has established an umbrella partnership structure through the contribution of substantially
all of its assets to Cedar Realty Trust Partnership L.P. (the Operating Partnership ), organized as a limited partnership under the laws of Delaware. The Company conducts substantially all of its business through the Operating
Partnership. At December 31, 2014, the Company owned 99.5 of the Operating Partnership and is its sole general partner. The 393,000 limited Operating Partnership Units OP Units are economically equivalent to the Company s
common stock and are convertible into the Company s common stock at the option of the holders on a one-to-one basis. The Company
derives substantially all of its revenues from rents and operating expense reimbursements received pursuant to long-term leases. The Company s operating results therefore depend on the ability of its tenants to make the payments required by the
terms of their leases. The Company focuses its investment activities on grocery-anchored shopping centers. The Company believes that, because of the need of consumers to purchase food and other staple goods and services generally available at such
centers, its type of necessities-based properties should provide relatively stable revenue flows even during difficult economic times. 
 The Company, the Operating Partnership, their subsidiaries and affiliated partnerships are separate legal entities. For ease of reference, the
terms we , our , us , Company and Operating Partnership (including their respective subsidiaries and affiliates) refer to the business and properties of all these entities, unless the context
otherwise requires. The Company s executive offices are located at 44 South Bayles Avenue, Port Washington, New York 11050-3765 (telephone 516-767-6492). The Company also maintains property management, construction management and/or leasing
offices at several of its shopping-center properties. The Company s website can be accessed at www.cedarrealtytrust.com, where a copy

(a) 
 Average base rent is calculated as the aggregate, annualized contractual minimum rent for all occupied spaces divided by the aggregate GLA of all occupied spaces as of December 31, 2014. Tenant concessions are
reflected in this measure except for a limited number of short-term (generally one to three months) free rent concessions provided to new tenants that took occupancy prior to the end of the reporting period but within the concession period. Average
base rent would have been 12.66 per square foot if all such free rent concessions were reflected. 

(b) 
 Major tenants are determined as tenants with 15,000 or more sq.ft of GLA, tenants at single-tenant properties, or the largest tenant at a property, based on GLA. 
 The terms of the Company s retail leases generally vary from tenancies at will to 25 years, excluding renewal options. Anchor tenant
leases are typically for 10 to 25 years, with one or more renewal options available to the lessee upon expiration of the initial lease term. By contrast, smaller store leases are typically negotiated for five-year terms. The longer terms of major
tenant leases serve to protect the Company against significant vacancies and to assure the presence of strong tenants which draw consumers to its centers. The shorter terms of smaller store leases allow the Company under appropriate circumstances to
adjust rental rates periodically and, where possible, to upgrade or adjust the overall tenant mix. Most leases contain provisions
requiring tenants to pay their pro rata share of real estate taxes, insurance and certain operating costs. Some leases also provide that tenants pay percentage rent based upon sales volume generally in excess of certain negotiated minimums. 
 Excluding properties held for sale/conveyance, Giant Food Stores, LLC and Stop Shop, Inc., each of which is owned by Ahold N.V., a
Netherlands corporation, leased an aggregate of approximately 11 , 12 and 13 of the Company s GLA at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and accounted for an aggregate of approximately 14 , 15 and 14 of the Company s
total revenues during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. No other tenant leased more than 10 of GLA at December 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012, or contributed more than 10 of total revenues during 2014, 2013 or 2012.

 Executive Offices 
 The Company s executive offices are located at 44 South Bayles Avenue, Port Washington, New York, in which it presently occupies 12,252
square feet pursuant to a lease which lease expires in February 2020. Competition 
 The Company believes that competition for the acquisition and operation of grocery-anchored shopping centers is highly fragmented. It faces
competition from institutional investors, public and private REITs, owner-operators engaged in the acquisition, ownership and leasing of shopping centers, as well as from numerous local, regional and national
real estate developers and owners in each of its markets. It also faces competition in leasing available space at its properties to prospective tenants. Competition for tenants varies depending upon the characteristics of each local market in which
the Company owns and manages properties. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in its market areas are location, price and other lease terms, the presence of anchor tenants, the mix, quality and sales
results of other tenants, and maintenance, appearance, access and traffic patterns of its properties. Environmental Matters 
 Under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate
and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or other contaminants at property owned, leased, managed or otherwise operated by such person, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, and for investigation
and cleanup costs in connection with such contamination. The cost of investigation, remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such conditions, may
adversely affect the owner s, lessor s or operator s ability to sell or rent such property or to arrange financing using such property as collateral. In connection with the ownership, operation and management of real estate, the
Company may potentially become liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other related costs and liabilities, including governmental fines and injuries to persons and/or property. Generally, the Company s tenants must comply
with environmental laws and meet any remediation requirements. In addition, leases typically impose obligations on tenants to indemnify the Company from any compliance costs the Company may incur as a result of environmental conditions on the
property caused by the tenant. However, if a lease does not require compliance and/or indemnification, or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply, the Company could be forced to pay these costs. 
 The Company believes that environmental studies conducted at the time of acquisition with respect to its properties did not reveal any
material environmental liabilities for which the Company is responsible and that would have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or liquidity. However, no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with
respect to any of the properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner of or tenant at a property did not create a material environmental condition not known to the Company, or that a material environmental condition does not
otherwise exist at any one or more of its properties. If a material environmental condition does in fact exist, it could have an adverse impact upon the Company s financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2014, the Company had 71 employees (69 full-time and two part-time). The Company believes that its relations with its
employees are good. Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Economic conditions in the U.S. economy in general, and any uncertainty in the credit markets and retail environment, could adversely affect our ability
to continue to pay dividends or cause us to reduce further the amount of our dividends . We paid dividends
totaling 0.20 per share during each of 2014, 2013 and 2012. However, any downturn in the state of the U.S. economy, weakness in capital markets and/or difficult retail environment may cause us to reduce or suspend the payment of dividends. 
 Any volatility or instability in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain new financing or to refinance existing
indebtedness . Any instability in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access debt
financing, to arrange property-specific financing or to refinance our existing debt as it matures on favorable terms or at all. As a result, we may be forced to seek potentially less attractive financings,
including equity investments, on terms that may not be favorable to us. In doing so, we may be compelled to dilute the interests of existing shareholders that could also adversely reduce the trading price of our common stock. 
 Our properties consist primarily of grocery-anchored shopping centers. Our performance therefore is linked to economic conditions in the market for
retail space generally . Our properties consist primarily of grocery-anchored shopping centers, and our
performance therefore is linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space generally. This also means that we are subject to the risks that affect the retail environment generally, including the levels of consumer spending, the
willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers, tenant bankruptcies, the impact of internet sales on the demand for retail space, ongoing consolidation in the retail sector, and changes in economic conditions and consumer
confidence. A downturn in the U.S. economy and reduced consumer spending could impact our tenants ability to meet their lease obligations due to poor operating results, lack of liquidity or other reasons, and therefore decrease the revenue
generated by our properties and/or the value of our properties. Our ability to lease space and negotiate and maintain favorable rents could also be negatively impacted by the state of the U.S. economy. Moreover, the demand for leasing space in our
shopping centers could also significantly decline during a significant downturn in the U.S. economy that could result in a decline in our occupancy percentage and reduction in rental revenues. Any sustained levels of high unemployment can be
expected to have a serious negative impact on consumer spending and sales by tenants at our shopping centers. In addition, increases in
energy costs in this country may cause shoppers to restrict their trips by automobile to shopping centers, reduce their purchases of gasoline and other products from the fuel service stations at several of our properties, as well as reduce their
levels of discretionary spending, all of which, in turn, could adversely affect sales at our properties.

 Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with real estate assets and with the real estate
industry. Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with real estate assets and with the real estate industry,
including, among other things, risks related to adverse changes in national, regional and local economic and market conditions. Our continued ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders depends on our ability to generate
sufficient revenues to meet operating expenses, future debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Events and conditions generally applicable to owners and operators of real property that are beyond our control may decrease cash available for
distribution and the value of our properties. These events and conditions include, but may not be limited to, the following: 

1. 
 local oversupply, increased competition or declining demand for real estate; 

2. 
 local economic conditions, which may be adversely impacted by plant closings, business layoffs, industry slow-downs, weather conditions, natural disasters and other factors;

3. 
 non-payment or deferred payment of rent or other charges by tenants, either as a result of tenant-specific financial ills, or general economic events or circumstances adversely affecting consumer disposable income or
credit; 

4. 
 vacancies or an inability to rent space on acceptable terms; 

5. 
 increased operating costs, including real estate taxes, insurance premiums, utilities, and repairs and maintenance; 

6. 
 volatility and/or increases in interest rates, or the non-availability of funds in the credit markets in general; 

7. 
 increased costs of complying with current, new or expanded governmental regulations; 

8. 
 the relative illiquidity of real estate investments; 

9. 
 changing market demographics; 

10. 
 changing traffic patterns; and 

11. 
 an inability to refinance maturing debt in acceptable amounts and/or on acceptable terms. The level of
our indebtedness and any constraints on credit may impede our operating performance, and put us at a competitive disadvantage. 
 The level of our indebtedness may harm our business and operating results by (1) requiring us to use a substantial portion of our
available liquidity to pay required debt service and/or repayments or establish additional reserves, which would reduce amounts available for distributions, (2) placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less
debt or debt at more favorable terms, (3) making us more vulnerable to economic and industry 
 14 

Table of Contents 

downturns and reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions, and (4) limiting our ability to borrow more money for operations or capital expenditures.
In addition, increases in interest rates may impede our operating performance and put us at a competitive disadvantage. Further, payments of required debt service or amounts due at maturity, or creation of additional reserves under loan agreements,
could adversely affect our liquidity. As substantially all of our revenues are derived from rental income, failure of tenants to pay rent or delays
in arranging leases and occupancy at our properties could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition. 
 Substantially all of our revenues are derived from rental income from our properties. Our tenants may experience a downturn in their
respective businesses and/or in the economy generally at any time that may weaken their financial condition. As a result, any such tenants may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its
expiration, become insolvent, or declare bankruptcy. Any leasing delays, failure to make rental or other payments when due, or tenant bankruptcies, could result in the termination of tenants leases, which would have a negative impact on our
operating results. In addition, adverse market and economic conditions and competition may impede our ability to renew leases or re-let space as leases expire, which could harm our business and operating results. 
 Our business may be seriously harmed if a major tenant fails to renew its lease(s) or vacates one or more properties and prevents us from
re-leasing such premises by continuing to pay base rent for the balance of the lease terms. In addition, the loss of such a major tenant could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants at the affected properties, as
provided in their respective leases. No tenant leased more than 10 of GLA at December 31, 2014 or contributed more than 10 of total revenues during 2014, except for Giant Food Stores, LLC and Stop Shop, Inc., each of which is owned
by Ahold N.V., a Netherlands corporation, which leased an aggregate of approximately 11 of our GLA, excluding properties held for sale, at December 31, 2014, and accounted for an aggregate of approximately 14 of our total revenues, excluding
properties held for sale, during 2014. We may be restricted from re-leasing space based on existing exclusivity lease provisions with
some of our tenants. In these cases, the leases contain provisions giving the tenant the exclusive right to sell particular types of merchandise or provide specific types of services within the particular retail center, which limits the ability of
other tenants within that center to sell such merchandise or provide such services. When re-leasing space after a vacancy by one of such other tenants, such lease provisions may limit the number and types of prospective tenants for the vacant space.
The failure to re-lease space or to re-lease space on satisfactory terms could harm operating results. Any bankruptcy filings by, or
relating to, one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would generally bar efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from that tenant, or lease guarantor, unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court. A bankruptcy by
a tenant or lease guarantor could delay efforts to collect past due balances, and could ultimately preclude full or, in fact, any collection of such sums. If a lease is affirmed by the tenant in bankruptcy, all pre-bankruptcy balances due under the
lease must generally be paid in full. However, if a lease is disaffirmed by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only an unsecured claim for damages, which would be paid normally only to the extent that funds are available, and
 
 15 

Table of Contents 

only in the same percentage as is paid to all other members of the same class of unsecured creditors. It is possible, and indeed likely, that we would recover substantially less than, or in fact
no portion of, the full value of any unsecured claims we hold, and would be required to write off any straight-line rent receivable recorded for such tenant, which may in turn harm our financial condition. 
 New Technology developments may negatively impact our tenants and our business. 
 We may be adversely affected by developments in new technology which may cause the business of certain of our tenants to become substantially
diminished or functionally obsolete, with the result that such tenants may be unable to pay rent, become insolvent, file for bankruptcy protection, close their stores, or terminate their leases. Examples of the potentially adverse effects of new
technology on retail businesses include, among other things, the effect of e-books and small screen readers on book stores, and increased sales of many products on-line. 
 Recent annual increases in on-line sales have also caused many retailers to sell products on-line on their websites with pick-ups at a store
or warehouse or through deliveries, which may have the effect of decreasing the reported amount of their in-store sales and the amount of rent we are able to collect from them. With respect to grocer tenants, on-line grocery orders have become
increasingly available, particularly in urban areas, but have not yet become a major factor affecting grocers in our portfolio. We cannot predict with certainty how growth in internet sales will impact the demand for space at our properties or how
much revenue will be generated at bricks and mortar store locations in the future. If we are unable to anticipate and respond promptly to trends in retailer and consumer behavior, our occupancy levels and financial results could suffer.
 We face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks, loss of confidential information and other business disruptions. 
 We rely extensively on computer systems to manage our business and process transactions. Our business is at risk from and may be impacted by
cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and other electronic security breaches. Such cyber-attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology
systems to more sophisticated security threats. While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats including password protection, backup servers and annual penetration testing, there is no guarantee such efforts will
be successful in preventing a cyber-attack. Cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of
data, system downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. In the event a security breach or failure results in the disclosure of sensitive tenant or other
third-party data, or the transmission of harmful/malicious code to third parties, we could be subject to liability or claims. Competition may
impede our ability to renew leases or re-let spaces as leases expire, which could harm our business and operating results. 
 We also face competition from similar retail centers within our respective trade areas that may affect our ability to renew leases or re-let
space as leases expire. Certain national retail 
 16 

Table of Contents 

chain bankruptcies and resulting store closings/lease disaffirmations have generally resulted in increased available retail space which, in turn, has resulted in increased competitive pressure to
renew tenant leases upon expiration and to find new tenants for vacant space at such properties. In addition, any new competitive properties that are developed within the trade areas of our existing properties may result in increased competition for
customer traffic and creditworthy tenants. Increased competition for tenants may require us to make tenant and/or capital improvements to properties beyond those that we would otherwise have planned to make. Any unbudgeted tenant and/or capital
improvements we undertake may reduce cash that would otherwise be available for distributions to shareholders. Ultimately, to the extent we are unable to renew leases or re-let space as leases expire, our business and operations could be negatively
impacted. The financial covenants in our loan agreements may restrict our operating or acquisition activities, which may harm our financial
condition and operating results. The financial covenants in our loan agreements may restrict our operating or acquisition
activities, which may harm our financial condition and operating results. Our unsecured credit facilities and the mortgages on our properties contain customary negative covenants, such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent
of the lender, to sell or otherwise transfer any ownership interest, to further mortgage the applicable property, to enter into leases, or to discontinue insurance coverage. Our ability to borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facility is
subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants, including restrictions on the maximum availability, which is based on the adjusted net operating income of designated unencumbered properties, the payment of dividends, and overall
restrictions on the amount of indebtedness we can incur. If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders could declare a default and require us to repay the debt immediately and, if the debt is secured, take possession of the property or
properties securing the loan. The geographic concentration of our properties in the Washington DC to Boston corridor exposes us to greater economic
risks than if the distribution of our properties encompassed a broader region. Our properties are located largely in the region
that straddles the Washington DC to Boston corridor, which exposes us to greater economic risks than if our properties were more diversely located (in particular, 26 of our properties are located in Pennsylvania). Any adverse economic or real estate
developments resulting from the regulatory environment, business climate, fiscal problems or weather in such regions could have an adverse impact on our prospects. In addition, the economic condition of each of our markets may be dependent on one or
more industries. An economic downturn in one of these industry sectors may result in an increase in tenant vacancies, which may harm our performance in the affected markets. 
 Competition and saturation in our existing markets may limit our ability for further growth in these geographic regions. 
 Numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us seeking properties for acquisition in our existing target markets.
This competition may operate to reduce the properties available for acquisition in these markets, increase the cost of the properties we acquire, reduce the rate of return on these properties, and interfere with our ability to attract and retain
tenants.

 High barriers to entry in the Washington DC to Boston corridor due to mature economies, road
patterns, density of population, restrictions on development, and high land costs, coupled with large numbers of often overlapping government jurisdictions, may make it difficult for us to continue to grow in these areas. 
 Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. 
 Our success depends on the efforts of key personnel, whose continued service is not guaranteed. Key personnel could be lost because we could
not offer, among other things, competitive compensation programs. The loss of services of key personnel could materially and adversely affect our operations because of diminished relationships with lenders, sources of equity capital, construction
companies, and existing and prospective tenants, and the ability to conduct our business and operations without material disruption. Natural
disasters and severe weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results. Some of our
properties could be subject to potential natural or other disasters. In addition, we may acquire properties that are located in areas which are subject to natural disasters. Properties could also be affected by increases in the frequency or severity
of hurricanes or other storms, whether such increases are caused by global climate changes or other factors. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties,
increase operating costs, increase future property insurance costs, and/or negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space. If insurance is unavailable to us, or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or if our insurance is not adequate to cover
business interruption or losses from such events, our earnings, liquidity and/or capital resources could be adversely affected. Our redevelopment
activities may not yield anticipated returns, which would harm our operating results and reduce funds available for distributions to shareholders. 
 Redevelopment projects entail considerable risks, including: 

Time lag between commencement and completion, leaving us exposed to higher-than-estimated construction costs, including labor and material costs; 

Failure or inability to obtain construction or permanent financing on favorable terms; 

Expenditure of money and time on projects that may never be completed; 

Inability to secure key anchor or other tenants; 

Inability to achieve projected rental rates or anticipated pace of lease-up; and 

Delays in completion relating to weather, labor disruptions, construction or zoning delays. 
 The failure of our redevelopment projects to yield their anticipated return could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating
results.

 Potential losses may not be covered by insurance. 
 Potential losses may not be covered by insurance. We carry comprehensive liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance
under a blanket policy covering all of our properties. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. We do not carry insurance
for losses related to war, nuclear accidents, and nuclear, biological and chemical occurrences from terrorist s acts. Some of the insurance, such as those covering losses due to wind, floods and earthquakes, is subject to limitations involving
large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover losses. Additionally, certain tenants have termination rights in respect of certain casualties. If we receive casualty proceeds, we may not be able to reinvest
such proceeds profitably or at all, and we may be forced to recognize taxable gain on the affected property. If we experience losses that are uninsured or that exceed policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as
well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.
 Future terrorist attacks could harm the demand for, and the value of, our properties. 
 Future terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington DC on September 11, 2001, and
other acts of terrorism or war, could harm the demand for, and the value of, our properties. Terrorist attacks could directly impact the value of our properties through damage, destruction, loss or increased security costs, and the availability of
insurance for such acts may be limited or may be subject to substantial cost increases. To the extent that our tenants are impacted by future attacks, their ability to continue to honor obligations under their existing leases could be adversely
affected. We could incur significant costs related to government regulation and litigation over environmental matters and various other federal,
state and local regulatory requirements. All real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal,
state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials, environmental protection and human health and safety. Accordingly, we or our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances
released on properties we own or operate, and also may be required to pay other related costs. Our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us for any compliance costs we may incur as a result of environmental conditions on
the property caused by the tenant. If a tenant fails to or is unable to comply, we could be forced to pay these costs. If not addressed, environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or re-lease the affected properties in the future,
result in lower sales prices or rent payments, and restrict our ability to borrow funds using the affected properties as collateral. We
could incur significant costs related to government regulations and litigation over environmental matters. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate
and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or other contaminants at property owned, leased, managed or otherwise operated by such person, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, and for investigation,
remediation and cleanup costs in connection with such 
 19 

Table of Contents 

contamination. The cost of investigation, remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such conditions,
may adversely affect the owner s, lessor s or operator s ability to sell or rent such property or to arrange financing using such property as collateral. We may be liable without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for,
the environmental contamination and with respect to properties we have acquired, whether the contamination occurred before or after the acquisition. 
 We believe environmental studies conducted at the time of acquisition with respect to all of our properties did not reveal any material
environmental liabilities for which the Company is responsible, and we are unaware of any subsequent environmental matters that would have created a material liability. If one or more of our properties were not in compliance with federal, state and
local laws, including environmental laws, we could be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance. If we incur substantial costs to comply with such requirements, our business and operations could be adversely affected.
If we fail to comply with such requirements, we might additionally incur governmental fines or private damage awards. There can be no assurance that existing requirements will not change or that future requirements will not require us to make
significant unanticipated expenditures that will adversely impact our business and operations. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the
 ADA could require us to take remedial steps with respect to our properties. We may incur significant costs to comply
with the ADA, as amended, and similar laws, which require that all public accommodations meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons, and with various other federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state
and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to continue as a REIT, our distributions will not be deductible, and our income will be
subject to taxation, thereby reducing earnings available for distribution. If we do not continue to qualify as a REIT, our
distributions will not be deductible, and our income will be subject to taxation, reducing earnings available for distribution. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. A REIT will generally not be subject to federal income taxation on
that portion of its income that qualifies as REIT taxable income, to the extent that it distributes at least 90 of its taxable income to its shareholders and complies with certain other requirements. In addition, if we did not continue to qualify
as a REIT, we would likely be subject to state and local income taxes in certain of the jurisdictions in which our properties are located. 
 We intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the requirements of the Code. However, differences in timing between the
recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets, borrow funds or pay a portion of the dividend in common stock to meet the 90 distribution requirement of the Code. Certain assets generate substantial
differences between taxable income and income recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). Such assets include, without limitation, operating real estate that was acquired through
structures that may limit or completely eliminate the depreciation deduction that would otherwise be available for income tax purposes. As a result, the Code requirement to distribute a substantial portion of our
 
 20 

Table of Contents 

otherwise net taxable income in order to maintain REIT status could cause us to (1) distribute amounts that could otherwise be used for future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment
of debt, (2) borrow on unfavorable terms, (3) sell assets on unfavorable terms, or (4) if necessary, pay a portion of our common dividend in common stock. If we fail to obtain debt or equity capital in the future, it could limit our
operations and our ability to grow, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock. Dividends payable by
REITs do not qualify for reduced tax rates under the Code. Currently, the maximum federal individual tax rate for nonqualified dividends payable is 39.6 ; qualified dividends from most C corporations received by individuals are subject to a
reduced federal rate of 20 . In addition to these rates, certain high income individuals may be subject to an additional 3.8 tax on certain investment income, including dividends and capital gains. The more favorable federal tax rates
applicable to regular corporate dividends may result in the stock of REITs being perceived to be less attractive than the stock of corporations that pay dividends qualifying for reduced rates of tax, which may adversely affect the value of the stock
of REITs. Our charter and Maryland law contain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction and depress our stock
price. Our charter and Maryland law contain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction and
depress the price of our common stock. The charter, subject to certain exceptions, authorizes directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable relating to qualification as a REIT, and to limit any person to beneficial ownership of no
more than 9.9 of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit, but may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed
transferee whose direct or indirect ownership could jeopardize our status as a REIT. These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if our Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to
qualify as, or to be, a REIT. This ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of shareholders. Based on our ability to
determine the underlying beneficial ownership interests of the holders of our common stock, our Board of Directors has waived the ownership limit to permit companies affiliated with each of Inland American Real Estate Trust, Inc. Inland ), Blackrock, Inc. and Cohen and Steers Capital Management, Inc. to acquire up to 14 , 14.9 and 15 , respectively, of our common stock. In addition, Inland has agreed to various voting restrictions and standstill provisions.

 We may authorize and issue stock and OP Units without shareholder approval. Our charter
authorizes the Board of Directors to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock, to issue additional OP Units, to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock, and to set the preferences, rights and other terms
of such classified or unclassified shares. We have agreed not to use our preferred stock for anti-takeover purposes or in connection with a shareholder rights plan unless we obtain shareholder approval. Certain provisions of the Maryland General
Corporation Law (the MGCL may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of shares of our common stock
with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such shares, including: 

1. 
 business combination provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested stockholder (defined generally as any person or an affiliate
thereof who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of our shares) for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes special appraisal rights and special
stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and 

2. 
 control share provisions that provide that our control shares (defined as shares that, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of
three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a control share acquisition (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares) have no voting rights except to the extent
approved by our shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares. 
 We have opted out of these provisions of the MGCL. However, the Board of Directors may, by resolution, elect to opt in to the business
combination provisions of the MGCL, and we may, by amendment to our bylaws, opt in to the control share provisions of the MGCL.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements
and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. Executive Summary 
 Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. (the Company is a fully-integrated real estate investment trust that focuses primarily on ownership and
operation of grocery-anchored shopping centers straddling the Washington DC to Boston corridor. At December 31, 2014, the Company owned and managed a portfolio of 59 operating properties (excluding properties held for
sale/conveyance totaling approximately 9.2 million square feet of gross leasable area GLA ). The portfolio was 93.3 leased and 92.9 occupied at December 31, 2014. 
 The Company, organized as a Maryland corporation, has established an umbrella partnership structure through the contribution of substantially
all of its assets to Cedar Realty Trust Partnership L.P. (the Operating Partnership ), organized as a limited partnership under the laws of Delaware. The Company conducts substantially all of its business through the Operating
Partnership. At December 31, 2014, the Company owned 99.5 of the Operating Partnership and is its sole general partner. The 393,000 limited Operating Partnership Units OP Units are economically equivalent to the Company s
common stock and are convertible into the Company s common stock at the option of the holders on a one-to-one basis. The Company
derives substantially all of its revenues from rents and operating expense reimbursements received pursuant to long-term leases. The Company s operating results therefore depend on the ability of its tenants to make the payments required by the
terms of their leases. The Company focuses its investment activities on grocery-anchored shopping centers. The Company believes that, because of the need of consumers to purchase food and other staple goods and services generally available at such
centers, its type of necessities-based properties should provide relatively stable revenue flows even during difficult economic times. 
 Significant Transactions - 2014 Acquisition
 On March 21, 2014, the Company acquired Quartermaster Plaza located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The purchase price for the
property was approximately 92.3 million, of which approximately 53.4 million was funded from the assumption of (1) a 42.1 million mortgage loan payable, bearing interest at the rate of 5.3 per annum and maturing in October 2015, and
(2) an 11.3 million mortgage loan payable, bearing interest at the rate of 5.5 per annum and payable in October 2014 (repaid in June 2014), with the remainder being funded from the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility. The
Company incurred costs of 2.9 million in connection with this acquisition.

management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, real estate investments and purchase accounting allocations
related thereto, asset impairment, and derivatives used to hedge interest-rate risks. Management s estimates are based both on information that is currently available and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates and those estimates could be different under varying assumptions or conditions. 
 The Company has identified the following critical accounting policies, the application of which requires significant judgments and estimates:

income with scheduled rent increases is recognized using the straight-line method over the respective terms of the leases. The aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight-line basis over base rents under applicable lease provisions
is included in straight-line rents receivable on the consolidated balance sheet. Leases also generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the Company for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred; such
income is recognized in the periods earned. In addition, certain operating leases contain contingent rent provisions under which tenants are required to pay a percentage of their sales in excess of a specified amount as additional rent. The Company
defers recognition of contingent rental income until those specified targets are met. The Company must make estimates as to the
collectability of its accounts receivable related to base rent, straight-line rent, expense reimbursements and other revenues. Management analyzes accounts receivable by considering tenant creditworthiness, current economic conditions, and changes
in tenants payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. These estimates have a direct impact on net income, because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income, whereas a
lower bad debt allowance would result in higher net income. Real Estate Investments 
 Real estate investments are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The provision for depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
method based on estimated useful lives. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and betterments that do not materially prolong the normal useful life of an asset are charged to operations as incurred. Expenditures for betterments that substantially
extend the useful lives of real estate assets are capitalized. Real estate investments include costs of development and redevelopment
activities, and construction in progress. Capitalized costs, including interest and other carrying costs during the construction and/or renovation periods, are included in the cost of the related asset and charged to operations through depreciation
over the asset s estimated useful life. The Company is required to make subjective estimates as to the useful lives of its real estate assets for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis. These
assessments have a direct impact on net income. A shorter estimate of the useful life of an asset would have the effect of increasing depreciation expense and lowering net income, whereas a longer estimate of the useful life of an asset would have
the effect of reducing depreciation expense and increasing net income.

 A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of a property, such
as pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs, and other costs incurred during the period of development. After a
determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. The Company ceases capitalization on the portions substantially completed and occupied, or held available for occupancy, and
capitalizes only those costs associated with the portions under construction. The Company considers a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but not later than one
year from cessation of major development activity. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The effect of a longer capitalization period would be to increase
capitalized costs and would result in higher net income, whereas the effect of a shorter capitalization period would be to reduce capitalized costs and would result in lower net income. 
 The Company allocates the fair value of real estate acquired to land, buildings and improvements. In addition, the fair value of in-place
leases is allocated to intangible lease assets and liabilities. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, which value is then allocated to land, buildings and
improvements based on management s determination of the fair values of such assets. In valuing an acquired property s intangibles, factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods,
such as real estate taxes, insurance, other operating expenses, and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods based on its evaluation of current market demand. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases,
including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, legal and other related costs. The values of acquired above-market and below-market
leases are recorded based on the present values (using discount rates which reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the differences between the contractual amounts to be received and management s estimate of market lease
rates, measured over the terms of the respective leases that management deemed appropriate at the time of the acquisitions. Such valuations include a consideration of the non-cancellable terms of the respective leases as well as any applicable
renewal period(s). The fair values associated with below-market rental renewal options are determined based on the Company s experience and the relevant facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the acquisitions. The values of
above-market leases are amortized to rental income over the terms of the respective non-cancelable lease periods. The portion of the values of below-market leases associated with the original non-cancelable lease terms are amortized to rental income
over the terms of the respective non-cancelable lease periods. The portion of the values of the leases associated with below-market renewal options that are likely of exercise are amortized to rental income over the respective renewal periods. The
value of other intangible assets (including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, etc.) is amortized to expense over the applicable terms of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration or not renewed,
all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be recognized in operations at that time. Management is required to make subjective
assessments in connection with its valuation of real estate acquisitions. These assessments have a direct impact on net income, because (1) above-market and below-market lease intangibles are amortized to rental income, and (2) the
 
 34 

Table of Contents 

value of other intangibles is amortized to expense. Accordingly, higher allocations to below-market lease liability and other intangibles would result in higher rental income and amortization
expense, whereas lower allocations to below-market lease liability and other intangibles would result in lower rental income and amortization expense. 
 Management reviews each real estate investment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a real
estate investment may not be recoverable. The review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future cash flows that are expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition. These estimates of cash flows
consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If an impairment event exists due to the projected inability to recover the carrying value of a
real estate investment, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value. A real estate investment held for sale is carried at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value, less the cost
of a potential sale. Depreciation and amortization are suspended during the period the property is held for sale. Management is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate
properties. These assessments have a direct impact on net income, because an impairment loss is recognized in the period that the assessment is made.

Revenues were higher primarily as a result of (1) an increase of 8.9 million in rental revenues
and expense recoveries for properties acquired in the first quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013, (2) an increase of 1.4 million in rental revenues and expense recoveries at the Company s same-property portfolio, and (3) an
increase of 0.6 million in rental revenues and expense recoveries at the Company s redevelopment properties, partially offset by (1) a decrease of 2.0 million in rental revenues and expense recoveries at properties classified in 2014 as
real estate held for sale/conveyance, both sold and still held for sale, and (2) a decrease of 0.2 million in management fee income related to the Cedar/RioCan joint venture; the management agreement was terminated effective January 31,
2013. Property operating expenses were higher primarily as a result of (1) an increase of 1.5 million in property operating
expenses at properties acquired in the first quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013, (2) a 0.7 million increase in snow removal costs, and (3) a 0.6 million increase in other operating expenses, primarily repairs and maintenance
and non-billable expenses.

 Acquisition costs in 2014 relate to the purchase of Quartermaster Plaza, located in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Acquisition costs in 2013 relate to the purchase of Big Y Shopping Center, located in Fairfield County, Connecticut. 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses were lower primarily as a result of (1) accelerated depreciation of 6.7 million in 2013
relating to the redevelopment and lease up of vacant spaces which required the demolition of certain existing buildings resulting in accelerated depreciation expense, and (2) a reduction of 1.5 million in depreciation and amortization expense
related to properties classified in 2014 as real estate held for sale/conveyance as the carrying values of these properties are now measured at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value, less cost to sell, partially offset by an increase of 2.5
million in depreciation and amortization expenses relating to properties acquired in the first quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013. 
 Gain on sales in 2014 relates to the sales of properties treated as held for sale/conveyance subsequent to
December 31, 2013. Gain on sales in 2013 relates to the sales of land parcels treated as held for sale/conveyance . 
 Impairment (charges)/reversals, net in 2014 relate to the impairments of properties classified in 2014 as real estate held for
sale/conveyance. Impairment charges/(reversals) in 2013 relates to the 1.1 million partial cash recovery on a loan receivable previously written off, partially offset by 0.9 million of impairments relating to a property and land parcels. 
 Interest expense was lower primarily as a result of (1) 1.7 million as a result of a lower weighted average interest rate, and
(2) 0.9 million as a result of a decrease in the overall outstanding principal balance of debt. Early extinguishment of debt
costs in 2014 and 2013 relates to defeasement fees and the write-off of unamortized fees associated with the prepayment of certain mortgage loans payable. 
 Discontinued operations for 2014 and 2013 include the results of operations, impairment reversals/(charges), net, gain on
extinguishment of debt obligations, and gain on sales for properties sold or treated as discontinued operations on or before December 31, 2013, as more fully discussed elsewhere in this report.

 Acquisition costs in 2013 relate to the purchase of Big Y Shopping Center located in
Fairfield County, Connecticut. Acquisition costs in 2012 relate to the purchases of (1) Meadows Marketplace, located in Hershey, Pennsylvania, (2) Fieldstone Marketplace, located in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and (3) Franklin Village
Plaza, located in Franklin, Massachusetts. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher primarily as a result of (1) an
increase of 2.3 million relating to properties acquired in 2013 and 2012, (2) an increase of 0.5 million in depreciation relating to the redevelopment and lease up of vacant spaces which required the demolition of certain existing buildings
resulting in accelerated depreciation expense (2013 - 6.7 million and 2012 - 6.2 million), offset by a 1.8 million reduction due to the completion of scheduled depreciation and amortization. 
 Gain on sales in 2013 and 2012 relate principally to sales of land parcels treated as held for sale/conveyance . 
 Impairment reversals/(charges), net in 2013 relates to the 1.1 million partial cash recovery on a loan receivable previously written
off, partially offset by 0.9 million of impairments relating to a property and land parcels. Impairment reversals/(charges), net in 2012 relates to (1) the 4.4 million write-off of the aforementioned loan receivable, and (2) 1.1 million
of impairments relating to certain land parcels treated as held for sale/conveyance . Interest expense was
lower primarily as a result of (1) 4.0 million as a result of a lower weighted average interest rate, and (2) 0.3 million relating to a decrease in amortization expense of deferred financing costs, partially offset by a (1) a 0.4
million decrease in capitalized interest, and (2) a 0.2 million increase due to the overall outstanding principal balance of debt. 
 Early extinguishment of debt costs in 2013 relate to the write-off of unamortized fees associated with prepaid mortgage loans payable.

 Same-Property Net Operating Income 
 Same-property net operating income same-property NOI is a widely-used non-GAAP financial measure for REITs that the Company
believes, when considered with financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, is useful to investors as it provides an indication of the recurring cash generated by the Company s properties by excluding certain non-cash revenues and
expenses, as well as other infrequent items such as lease termination income which tends to fluctuate more than rents from year to year. Properties are included in same-property NOI if they are owned and operated for the entirety of both periods
being compared, except for properties undergoing significant redevelopment and expansion until such properties have stabilized, and properties classified as held for sale/conveyance . Consistent with the capital treatment of such costs
under GAAP, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other direct leasing costs are excluded from same-property NOI. Same-property
NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. Further, same-property NOI is a measure for which there is no standard industry definition and, as such, it is not
consistently defined or reported on among the Company s peers, and thus may not provide an adequate basis for comparison between REITs. The following table reconciles same-property NOI to the Company s consolidated operating income:

and Capital Resources The Company funds operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including debt service, tenant
improvements, leasing commissions, preferred and common dividend distributions and distributions to minority interest partners, if made, primarily from its operations. The Company may also use its revolving credit facility for these purposes. The
Company expects to fund long-term liquidity requirements for property acquisitions, redevelopment costs, capital improvements, and maturing debt initially with its revolving credit facility, and ultimately through a combination of issuing and/or
assuming additional debt, the sale of equity securities, the issuance of additional OP Units, and/or the sale of properties. Although the Company believes it has access to secured and unsecured financing, there can be no assurance that the Company
will have the availability of financing on completed development projects, additional construction financing, or proceeds from the refinancing of existing debt. 
 On February 5, 2015, the Company amended its existing 310 million unsecured credit facility, which consists of (1) a 260 million
revolving credit facility, expiring on February 5, 2019, and (2) a 50 million term loan, expiring on February 5, 2020. The revolving credit facility may be extended, at the Company s option, for an additional one-year period,
subject to customary conditions. Under an accordion feature, the facility can be increased to 750 million, subject to customary conditions and lending commitments. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility component can range from LIBOR plus
135 bps to 195 bps (150 bps on February 5, 2015) and borrowing under the term loan component can range from 130 to 190 bps (145 bps on February 5, 2015), based on the Company s leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2014, the Company
had 187.7 million available for additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility.

 On February 11, 2014, the Company closed 150 million of unsecured term loans comprised of a
five-year 75 million term loan, maturing on February 11, 2019, and a seven-year 75 million term loan, maturing on February 11, 2021. As amended on February 5, 2015, borrowing under the five-year 75 million term loan can range from
LIBOR plus 130 bps to 190 bps (145 bps on February 5, 2015) and borrowings under the seven-year 75 million term loan can range from LIBOR plus 170 bps to 230 bps (180 bps on February 5, 2015), each based on the Company s leverage
ratio. Additionally, the Company has entered into forward interest rate swap agreements which convert the LIBOR rates to fixed rates for these term loans beginning July 1, 2014 through their maturities. Reflecting the February 5, 2015
amendment, the new effective fixed interest rates are 3.1 for the five-year 75 million term loan and 4.1 for the seven-year 75 million term loan. 
 On February 5, 2015, the Company closed 100 million of new unsecured term loans comprised of a five-year 50 million term loan maturing
February 5, 2020 (all of which was borrowed at closing), and a seven-year 50 million term loan maturing February 5, 2022. Proceeds from the seven-year term loan can be drawn at any time from closing until July 1, 2015. Borrowings
under the five-year 50 million term loan can range from 130 to 190 bps (145 bps on February 5, 2015) and borrowing under the seven-year 50 million term loan can range from LIBOR plus 155 bps to 215 bps (170 bps as of February 5, 2015),
each based on the Company s leverage ratio. Additionally, the Company entered into forward interest rate swap agreements which converted the LIBOR rates to fixed rates for these term loans beginning July 1, 2015 through their maturities.
As a result, the effective fixed interest rates will be 2.9 for the five-year 50 million term loan and 3.4 for the seven-year 50 million term loan. 
 The Company s unsecured credit facility and term loans contain financial covenants including, but not limited to, maximum debt leverage,
maximum secured debt, minimum fixed charge coverage, and minimum net worth. In addition, the facility contains restrictions including, but not limited to, limits on indebtedness, certain investments and distributions. The Company s failure to
comply with the covenants or the occurrence of an event of default under the loan agreements could result in the acceleration of the related debt. As of December 31, 2014, the Company is in compliance with all financial covenants.

 Property-specific mortgage loans payable mature at various dates through 2029. The terms of
several of the Company s mortgage loans payable require the Company to deposit certain replacement and other reserves with its lenders. Such restricted cash is generally available only for property-level requirements for which the
reserves have been established, and is not available to fund other property-level or Company-level obligations. On January 13, 2014,
the Company concluded a public offering of 6,900,000 shares of its common stock (including 900,000 shares relating to the exercise of an over-allotment option by the underwriters), and realized net proceeds, after offering expenses, of approximately
 41.3 million. The Company has at-the-market offering programs, under which it may offer and sell, from time-to-time, shares of its
common and preferred stock. During 2014, there were no shares sold under these programs. On January 12, 2015, the Company concluded
a public offering of 5,750,000 shares of its common stock (including 750,000 shares relating to the exercise of an over-allotment option by the underwriters), and realized net proceeds, after offering expenses, of approximately 41.9 million. 
 In order to continue qualifying as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least 90 of its REIT taxable income , as
defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). The Company paid common and preferred stock dividends during 2014 and 2013. While the Company intends to continue paying regular quarterly dividends, future dividend
declarations will continue to be at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and will depend on the cash flow and financial condition of the Company, capital requirements, annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, and
such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant.

 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities, before net changes in operating assets and liabilities, was 57.3 million and 53.2 million for 2014
and 2013, respectively. The 4.1 million increase was primarily attributable to a reduction in interest expense of 3.8 million, as property operating income contributed by acquisitions, net of acquisition costs, was substantially offset by a
reduction in property operating income associated with properties sold. The net change in operating assets and liabilities from 2014 to 2013 was 2.7 million, primarily due from the timing of collections of receivables and payments of accounts
payable and accrued liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities, before net changes in operating assets and liabilities, was
 53.2 million and 53.2 million for 2013 and 2012, respectively. These results remained consistent, as property operating income contributed by acquisitions, net of acquisition costs, and reductions in interest expense and property-level and general
administrative overhead savings resulting from employee headcount reductions implemented by management in the latter part of 2012 was substantially offset by a reduction in property operating income associated with properties sold. The net change in
operating assets and liabilities from 2013 to 2012 was a 0.9 million decrease, primarily due from the timing of collections of receivables and payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

property acquisitions and expenditures for property improvements. During 2014, the Company received 102.1 million in proceeds from sales of properties classified as held for sale/conveyance and received 2.1 million in construction escrows and
other, offset by the purchase of a shopping center for 38.9 million, and expenditures of 16.3 million for property improvements. During 2013, the Company purchased a shopping center for 32.8 million, had expenditures of 20.3 million for property
improvements, offset by 34.7 million in proceeds from sales of properties classified as held for sale/conveyance, 2.2 million in proceeds from construction escrows and other, and a 1.1 million repayment of a note receivable. During 2012, the

proceeds from the sale of shares of its 7.25 Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, and a 50.0 million advance under a term loan. During 2012, the Company paid 124.9 million for redemptions and repurchases of shares of its 8.875 Series
A cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, made 85.3 million of net repayments under the revolving credit facility, 79.6 million of repayments of mortgage loans payable, 29.2 million of preferred and common stock distributions, a 6.1 million

 Funds From Operations Funds From
Operations FFO is a widely-recognized non-GAAP financial measure for REITs that the Company believes, when considered with financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, is useful to investors in understanding financial
performance and 
 45 

Table of Contents 

providing a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. In addition, FFO is useful to investors as it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate
generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets. Investors should review FFO, along with GAAP net income, when trying to understand a REIT s operating performance. The
Company considers FFO an important supplemental measure of its operating performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. 
 The Company computes FFO in accordance with the White Paper published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), which defines FFO as net income applicable to common shareholders (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment charges, gains or losses from debt restructurings and sales of properties, plus real estate-related
depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for partnerships and joint ventures (which are computed to reflect FFO on the same basis). FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an
alternative to net income applicable to common shareholders or to cash flow from operating activities. FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. Although FFO is a measure
used for comparability in assessing the performance of REITs, as the NAREIT White Paper only provides guidelines for computing FFO, the computation of FFO may vary from one company to another. The following table sets forth the Company s
calculations of FFO for 2014, 2013 and 2012:

Inflation 
 Inflation has been relatively low in recent years and has not had a significant detrimental impact on the Company s results of operations.
Should inflation rates increase in the future, substantially all of the Company s tenant leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the negative impact of inflation in the near term. Such lease provisions include clauses that
require tenants to reimburse the Company for real estate taxes and many of the operating expenses it incurs. Significant inflation rate increases over a prolonged period of time may have a material adverse impact on the Company s business.

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 One of the principal market risks facing the Company is the risk of interest rate changes, primarily through its variable-rate revolving credit
facility and term loans. The Company s objectives with respect to interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on operations and cash flows, and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, the
Company may borrow at either fixed rates or at variable rates and enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to mitigate its interest rate risk. The Company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions
for speculative purposes. The Company is not subject to foreign currency risk. On February 11, 2014, the Company closed 150 million
of unsecured term loans. The Company has entered into forward interest rate swap agreements which convert the LIBOR rates to fixed rates for the new term loans beginning July 1, 2014 through their maturities. As a result, the effective fixed
interest rates are 3.2 for the 75.0 million five-year term loan and 4.1 for the 75.0 million seven-year term loan at December 31, 2014, based on the Company s current leverage ratio. At December 31, 2014, the Company had
 2,777,000 included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet relating to the fair value of the interest rate swaps applicable to the 150 million unsecured term loans. 
 On February 5, 2015, the Company closed 100 million of additional unsecured term loans. The Company also entered into forward interest
rate swap agreements which convert the LIBOR rates to fixed rates for the new term loans beginning July 1, 2015 through their maturities. As a result, the effective fixed interest rates will be 2.9 for the 50.0 million five-year term loan and
3.4 for the 50.0 million seven-year term loan, based on the Company s leverage ratio at closing. At December 31, 2014,
long-term debt consisted of fixed-rate mortgage loans payable, unsecured term loans, and the Company s unsecured variable-rate credit facility. The average interest rate on the 543.4 million of fixed-rate indebtedness outstanding was 4.9 ,
with maturities at various dates through 2029. The average interest rate on the 122.0 million of unsecured variable-rate revolving credit facility and term loan was 1.9 . With respect to the 122.0 million of variable-rate debt outstanding at
December 31, 2014, if contractual interest rates either increase or decrease by 100 bps, the Company s interest cost would increase or decrease respectively by approximately 1.2 million per annum.

 Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 December 31, 2014 Note 1.
Business and Organization Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. (the Company is a real estate investment trust REIT that
focuses primarily on ownership and operation of grocery-anchored shopping centers straddling the Washington, DC to Boston corridor. At December 31, 2014, the Company owned and managed a portfolio of 59 operating properties (excluding properties
 held for sale/conveyance ). Cedar Realty Trust Partnership, L.P. (the Operating Partnership is the entity through
which the Company conducts substantially all of its business and owns (either directly or through subsidiaries) substantially all of its assets. At December 31, 2014, the Company owned a 99.5 economic interest in, and was the sole general
partner of, the Operating Partnership. The limited partners interest in the Operating Partnership (0.5 at December 31, 2014) is represented by Operating Partnership Units OP Units ). The carrying amount of such interest is
adjusted at the end of each reporting period to an amount equal to the limited partners ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership s net equity. The 393,000 OP Units outstanding at December 31, 2014 are economically equivalent
to the Company s common stock. The holders of OP Units have the right to exchange their OP Units for the same number of shares of the Company s common stock or, at the Company s option, for cash. 
 As used herein, the Company refers to Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, including the
Operating Partnership or, where the context so requires, Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. only. Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 Principles of Consolidation/Basis of Preparation 
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company, the Operating Partnership, its subsidiaries, and
certain joint venture partnerships in which it participates. The Company consolidates all variable interest entities VIEs for which it is the primary beneficiary. Generally, a VIE is an entity with one or more of the following
characteristics: (1) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk
(a) lack the power through voting or similar rights to make decisions about the entity s activities that significantly impact the entity s performance, (b) have no obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or
(c) have no right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity, or (3) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity s activities either
involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately fewer voting rights. A VIE is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE has (1) the power to direct the activities
that most significantly impact the entity s 
 56

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 December 31, 2014 
 
economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Significant judgments related to
these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair values, performance of real estate held by these VIEs, and general market conditions. 
 The Company has a 60 -owned joint venture originally formed to develop the project known as Crossroads II. This joint venture is consolidated
as it is deemed to be a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company (1) guarantees all related debt, (2) does not require its partners to fund additional capital requirements, (3) has an economic interest greater than
its voting proportion and (4) participates in the management activities that significantly impact the performance of the joint venture. At December 31, 2014, this VIE owned real estate with a carrying value of 40.5 million and no mortgage
loan payable. With respect to its two other consolidated joint venture properties at December 31, 2014 (New London Mall and San
Souci Plaza), the Company is the general partner and has a partnership interest of 40 in each. As such entities are not VIEs, and the Company is the sole general partner and exercises substantial operating control over these entities, the Company
has determined that such entities should be consolidated. On January 23, 2015, the Company acquired the New London joint venture s 60 ownership interest, giving the Company a 100 ownership interest in this property. The purchase price
was 27.3 million, consisting of 10.9 million in cash, and 16.4 million representing the 60 share of the in-place mortgage financing. 
 The Company also had two 60 -owned joint ventures originally formed to develop the projects known as Heritage Crossings and Upland Square.
Heritage Crossings was sold in May 2013 (see Note 4 Discontinued Operations and the Company acquired the remaining 40 interest in Upland Square in October 2013 (see Note 3 Real Estate ). Prior to these
respective dates, these joint ventures were consolidated as they were deemed to be VIEs and the Company was the primary beneficiary. The Company (1) had guaranteed all related debt, (2) did not require its partners to fund additional
capital requirements, (3) had an economic interest greater than its voting proportion, and (4) participated in the management activities that significantly impacted the performance of the joint venture. 
 The Company also had a 20 interest in the Cedar/RioCan joint venture, which the Company accounted for under the equity method (the Company
exited the joint venture in October 2012). Although the Company provided management and other services, RioCan had significant management participation rights, thus the Company had determined that this joint venture was not a VIE (see Note 5 -
 Investment in Cedar/RioCan Joint Venture ). With respect to its interest in the Homburg joint venture properties (buy/sell
provisions were concluded in October 2012 - see Note 4 Discontinued Operations ), the Company was the general partner and had partnership interests of 20 in each of the venture s nine properties. As (1) such entities
were not VIEs, and (2) the Company was the sole general partner and exercised substantial operating control over these entities, the Company had determined that such entities should be consolidated for financial statement purposes.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 December 31, 2014 
 The accompanying financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods covered by the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 The consolidated financial statements reflect reclassifications of prior period amounts relating primarily to one operating property
previously classified as discontinued operations that was determined in 2014 to be treated as continuing operations. Accordingly, applicable amounts have been reclassified from real estate held for sale/conveyance to real estate
held for use on the prior-year consolidated balance sheet, and from discontinued operations to continuing operations on all prior years consolidated statements of operations. The reclassifications had no impact on
previously-reported net income attributable to common shareholders or earnings per share. Real Estate Investments 
 Real estate investments are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The provision for depreciation is calculated using the straight-line
method based upon the estimated useful lives of the respective assets of between 3 and 40 years. Depreciation expense amounted to 35.0 million, 41.1 million and 40.0 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Expenditures for betterments that
substantially extend the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs, and betterments that do not substantially prolong the normal useful life of an asset are charged to operations as incurred. 
 Real estate investments include costs of ground-up development and redevelopment activities, and construction in progress. Capitalized costs,
including interest and other carrying costs during the construction and/or renovation periods, are included in the cost of the related asset and charged to operations through depreciation over the asset s estimated useful life. A variety of
costs are incurred in the development and leasing of a property, such as pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs, and
other costs incurred during the period of development. After a determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. The Company ceases capitalization on the portions substantially
completed and occupied, or held available for occupancy, and capitalizes only those costs associated with the portions under development. The Company considers a construction project to be substantially completed and held available for occupancy
upon the completion of tenant improvements, but not later than one year from cessation of major construction activity.

 The Company allocates the fair value of real estate acquired to land, buildings and
improvements. In addition, the fair value of in-place leases is allocated to intangible lease assets and liabilities. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, which
value is then allocated to land, buildings and improvements based on management s determination of the fair values of these assets. In valuing an acquired property s intangibles, factors considered by management include an estimate of
carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, such as real estate taxes, insurance, other operating expenses, and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods based on its evaluation of current market demand.
Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, legal and other related costs. 
 The values of acquired above-market and below-market leases are recorded based on the present values (using discount rates which reflect the
risks associated with the leases acquired) of the differences between the contractual amounts to be received and management s estimate of market lease rates, measured over the terms of the respective leases that management deemed appropriate at
the time of the acquisitions. Such valuations include a consideration of the non-cancellable terms of the respective leases as well as any applicable renewal periods. The fair values associated with below-market rental renewal options are determined
based on the Company s experience and the relevant facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the acquisitions. The values of above-market leases are amortized to rental income over the terms of the respective non-cancelable lease
periods. The portion of the values of below-market leases associated with the original non-cancelable lease terms are amortized to rental income over the terms of the respective non-cancelable lease periods. The portion of the values of the leases
associated with below-market renewal options that are likely of exercise are amortized to rental income over the respective renewal periods. The value of other intangible assets (including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, etc.) is amortized
to expense over the applicable terms of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration or not renewed, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be recognized in operations at that time. 
 Management reviews each real estate investment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a real
estate investment may not be recoverable. The review of recoverability of real estate investments held for use is based on an estimate of the future cash flows that are expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual
disposition. These cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of leasing demand, capital expenditures, competition and other factors. If an impairment event exists due to the
projected inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value. 
 Sales of real estate are recognized only when sufficient down payments have been obtained, possession and other attributes of ownership have
been transferred to the buyer and the Company has no significant continuing involvement. The Company believes these criteria were met for all real estate sold during 2014, 2013 and 2012.

 Properties Held For Sale/Conveyance 
 In accordance with the newly-adopted guidance for reporting discontinued operations (see below), the carrying values of the assets and
liabilities of properties determined to be held for sale/conveyance, principally the net book values of the real estate and the related mortgage loans payable to be assumed by the buyers (or conveyed to the mortgagees), are reclassified as
 held for sale/conveyance on the Company s consolidated balance sheets at the time such determinations are made, on a prospective basis only. In addition, the Company anticipates that sales of all such properties remaining classified
as held for sale/conveyance at the balance sheet date will be concluded within one year from such date. The Company conducts
a continuing review of the values for all remaining properties held for sale/conveyance based on final sales prices and sales contracts entered into. Impairment charges/reversals, if applicable, are based on a comparison of the carrying
values of the properties with either (1) actual sales prices less costs to sell for properties sold, or contract amounts for properties in the process of being sold, (2) estimated sales prices based on discounted cash flow analyses, if no
contract amounts were as yet being negotiated (see Note 6 Fair Value Measurements ), or (3) with respect to land parcels, estimated sales prices, less cost to sell, based on comparable sales completed in the selected market
areas. Prior to the Company s determination to dispose of properties, which are subsequently reclassified to held for sale/conveyance , the Company performs recoverability analyses based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows that
were expected to result from the real estate investments use and eventual disposal. The projected undiscounted cash flows of each property reflects that the carrying value of each real estate investment would be recovered. However, as a result
of the properties meeting the held for sale criteria, such properties were written down to the lower of their carrying value and estimated fair values less costs to sell. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents / Restricted Cash 
 Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and short-term investments with original maturities when purchased of less than ninety days,
and include cash at consolidated joint ventures of 0.8 million and 1.5 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The
terms of several of the Company s mortgage loans payable require the Company to deposit certain replacement and other reserves with its lenders. Such restricted cash is generally available only for property-level requirements for
which the reserves have been established.

 December 31, 2014 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 The accounting guidance for fair value measurement establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used
to measure fair value into three levels: 

Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly,
for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 
 The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value,
the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible while also considering counterparty credit risk in the assessment of fair value. 
 Revenue Recognition and Receivables 
 Management has determined that all of the Company s leases with its various tenants are operating leases. Rental income with scheduled
rent increases is recognized using the straight-line method over the respective non-cancelable terms of the leases. The aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual base rents is included in receivables
on the consolidated balance sheet. Leases also generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the Company for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred, generally attributable to their respective
allocable portions of gross leasable area. Such income is recognized in the periods earned. In addition, a limited number of operating leases contain contingent rent provisions under which tenants are required to pay, as additional rent, a
percentage of their sales in excess of a specified amount. The Company defers recognition of contingent rental income until those specified sales targets are met. Revenues also include items such as lease termination fees, which tend to fluctuate
more than rents from year to year. Termination fees are fees that the Company has agreed to accept in consideration for permitting certain tenants to terminate their lease prior to the contractual expiration. The Company recognizes lease termination
income when the following conditions are met: (1) the lease termination agreement has been executed, (2) the lease termination fee is determinable, (3) all the Company s landlord services pursuant to the terminated lease have
been rendered, and (4) collectability of the lease termination fee is assured. The Company must make estimates as to the
collectability of its accounts receivable related to base rent, straight-line rent, percentage rent, expense reimbursements and other 
 61

revenues. When management analyzes accounts receivable and evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, it considers such things as historical bad debts, tenant
creditworthiness, current economic trends, current developments relevant to a tenant s business specifically and to its business category generally, and changes in tenants payment patterns. The allowance for doubtful accounts was 4.3
million and 5.1 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The provision for doubtful accounts (included in operating, maintenance and management expenses) was 1.9 million, 1.8 million and 1.9 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. Income Taxes 
 The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). A REIT will generally
not be subject to federal income taxation on that portion of its income that qualifies as REIT taxable income, to the extent that it distributes at least 90 of such REIT taxable income to its shareholders and complies with certain other
requirements. As of December 31, 2014, the Company was in compliance with all REIT requirements. The Company follows a two-step
approach for evaluating uncertain federal, state and local tax positions. Recognition (step one) occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination.
Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that more-likely-than-not will be realized upon settlement. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position
no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. The Company has not identified any uncertain tax positions which would require an accrual. 
 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 The Company occasionally utilizes derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates. The Company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment, and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments must be effective in reducing the
Company s interest rate risk exposure in order to qualify for hedge accounting. When the terms of an underlying transaction are modified, or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist, all changes in the fair value of the instrument are
marked-to-market with changes in value included in net income for each period until the derivative financial instrument matures or is settled. Any derivative financial instrument used for risk management that does not meet the hedging criteria is
marked-to-market with the changes in value included in net income. The Company has not entered into, and does not plan to enter into, derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

 Noncontrolling Interest - Limited Partners Mezzanine OP Units 
 The Company follows the accounting guidance related to noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, which states that a
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary (minority interests or certain limited partners interest, in the case of the Company), subject to the classification and measurement of redeemable securities, is an ownership interest in a consolidated
entity which should be reported as equity in the parent company s consolidated financial statements. The guidance requires a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of equity attributable to noncontrolling interests and disclosure,
on the face of the consolidated income statement, of those amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests. The Company classifies the balances related to minority interests in consolidated joint ventures and limited
partners interest in the Operating Partnership into the consolidated equity accounts, as appropriate. Certain noncontrolling interests of the Company are classified in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet (the mezzanine OP
Units as such OP Units do not meet the requirements for equity classification (certain of the holders of such OP Units have registration rights that provide such holders with the right to demand registration under the federal securities laws
of the common stock of the Company issuable upon conversion of such OP Units). The Company adjusts the carrying value of the mezzanine OP Units each period to equal the greater of its historical carrying value or its redemption value. Through
December 31, 2014, there have been no cumulative net adjustments recorded to the carrying amounts of the mezzanine OP Units. Share-Based
Compensation The Company s 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2012 Plan establishes the procedures for the granting
of, among other things, restricted stock awards. The maximum number of shares of the Company s common stock that may be issued pursuant to the 2012 Plan is 4.5 million, and the maximum number of shares that may be granted to a participant
in any calendar year may not exceed 500,000. All grants issued pursuant to the 2012 Plan generally vest (1) at the end of designated time periods for time-based grants, or (2) upon the completion of a designated period of performance for
performance-based grants and satisfaction of performance criteria. Time based grants are valued according to the market price for the Company s common stock at the date of grant. For performance-based grants, the Company generally engages
an independent appraisal company to determine the value of the shares at the date of grant, taking into account the underlying contingency risks associated with the performance criteria. The value of all grants are being expensed on a straight-line
basis over their respective vesting periods (irrespective of achievement of the performance-based grants) adjusted, as applicable, for forfeitures. For restricted share grants subject to graded vesting, the amounts expensed are at least equal to the
measured expense of each vested tranche. Based on the terms of the 2012 Plan, those grants of restricted shares that are contributed to the Rabbi Trusts are classified as treasury stock on the Company s consolidated balance sheet.

discontinued operations. Under the amended guidance, a disposal of an individual property or group of properties is required to be reported in discontinued operations only if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will
have, a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results. The amended guidance also requires additional disclosures about both discontinued operations and the disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that
does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the financial statements. The Company has adopted the provisions of this guidance as of January 1, 2014, and has applied the provisions prospectively. The results of operations for
properties classified as held for sale/conveyance prior to the adoption of this guidance will continue to be reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance which amends the accounting for revenue recognition. Under the amended guidance, a company will
recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance is effective for interim and
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption not permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

 In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance which requires management to evaluate whether there
are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one
year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a
material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Note 3. Real Estate

 2014 Acquisition 
 On March 21, 2014, the Company acquired Quartermaster Plaza located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The purchase price for the property was
approximately 92.3 million, of which approximately 53.4 million was funded from the assumption of (1) a 42.1 million mortgage loan payable, bearing interest at the rate of 5.3 per annum and maturing in October 2015, and (2) an
 11.3 million mortgage loan payable, bearing interest at the rate of 5.5 per annum and payable in October 2014 (repaid in June 2014), with the remainder being funded from the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility. The Company
incurred costs of 2.9 million in connection with this acquisition. 2013 Acquisitions 
 On August 16, 2013, the Company exercised the buy/sell option pursuant to the terms of the 60 -owned joint venture originally formed for
the development of the Upland Square project, and the Company s partner opted not to meet the offered purchase option. The Company acquired the remaining 40 interest in the property on October 31, 2013 for approximately 1.6 million,
reflecting the impact of the Company s preferred interest in the joint venture. As the property was previously controlled and consolidated by the Company, the acquisition of the 40 noncontrolling interest was recorded as a capital transaction.
As such, the excess 0.5 million) paid by the Company over the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest was recorded as a decrease in the Company s shareholders equity. 
 On November 18, 2013, the Company acquired the Big Y Shopping Center located in Fairfield County, Connecticut. The purchase price for the
property was approximately 34.5 million, of which approximately 33 million was funded from the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility and the 1.5 million balance by the issuance of approximately 270,000 OP Units (based on the market
price of the Company s common stock). The Company incurred costs of 0.2 million in connection with this acquisition. 2012 Acquisitions
 As more fully discussed in Note 5 Investment in Cedar/RioCan Joint Venture , on October 10, 2012, the
Company acquired a 100 interest in Franklin Village Plaza, located in Franklin, Massachusetts. As more fully discussed in Note 4 Discontinued Operations , on October 12, 2012, the Company acquired the non-controlling 80 
ownership interests in Meadows Marketplace, located in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and Fieldstone Marketplace, located in New Bedford, Massachusetts.

In February 2011, Homburg had exercised its buy/sell option pursuant to the
terms of the joint venture agreements for each of the nine properties owned by the venture. The Company made elections to purchase Homburg s 80 interest in two of the nine properties, Meadows Marketplace, located in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and
Fieldstone Marketplace, located in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The Company also determined not to meet Homburg s buy/sell offers for each of the remaining seven properties, which were thereupon treated as held for sale/conveyance .
Pursuant to the agreements, the Company acquired Homburg s 80 ownership in Meadows Marketplace, located in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and Fieldstone Marketplace, located in New Bedford,

Massachusetts, for approximately 27.3 million, including the assumption of related in-place mortgage financing of 21.8 million, giving the Company a 100 ownership interest in these two
properties. As the two properties were previously controlled and consolidated by the Company, the acquisitions of the 80 noncontrolling interests were recorded as a capital transaction. As such, the excess 7.6 million) of the carrying amount of
the noncontrolling interests over amounts paid by the Company was recognized as an increase in the Company s shareholders equity and a corresponding decrease in noncontrolling interests. In addition, the Company sold to Homburg its 20 
ownership interest in the remaining seven joint venture properties for approximately 23.6 million, including the assumption of related in-place mortgage financing of 14.5 million. In connection with the transactions, the Company has recorded a
gain of 3.9 million relating to the sale of the seven properties. The Company s property management agreements for the sold properties terminated upon the closing of the sale. 
 Note 5. Investment in Cedar/RioCan Joint Venture 
 On October 10, 2012, the Company concluded definitive agreements with RioCan to exit the 20 Cedar / 80 RioCan joint venture that owned
22 retail properties. Pursuant to the agreements, the Company exchanged its 20 interest in the joint venture for (1) a 100 ownership interest in Franklin Village Plaza, located in Franklin, Massachusetts, at an agreed-upon value of
approximately 75.1 million, including the assumption of related in-place mortgage financing of approximately 43.1 million, and (2) approximately 41.6 million in cash, which was initially used to reduce the outstanding balance under the
Company s revolving credit facility. The Company continued to manage the properties acquired by RioCan subject to a management agreement which terminated effective January 31, 2013. In connection with the transactions, the Company recorded
a net gain of 30.5 million relating to the exit from the joint venture in 2012. The Company earned fees from the joint venture of

Note 6. Fair Value Measurements 
 The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, rents and other receivables, certain other assets, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities, and variable-rate debt approximate fair value due to their terms and/or short-term nature. The fair value of the Company s investments and liabilities related to share-based compensation were determined to be Level 1
within the valuation hierarchy, and were based on independent values provided by financial institutions. The valuation of the liabilities
for the Company s interest rate swaps, which are measured on a recurring basis, were determined to be Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy, and were based on independent values provided by financial institutions. Such valuations were
determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analyses, on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The analyses reflect the contractual terms of the swaps, including the period to maturity, and
user-observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves significant other observable inputs ). The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance using significant unobservable inputs 
such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default. The Company has concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, the fair value associated with the significant unobservable inputs relating
 
 73 

Table of Contents

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

to the Company s risk of non-performance was insignificant to the overall fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and, as a result, that the relevant inputs for purposes of
calculating the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements, in their entirety, were based upon significant other observable inputs . 
 Nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the consolidated financial statements consist of real estate held for
sale/conveyance, which are measured on a nonrecurring basis, have been determined to be (1) Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy, where applicable, based on the respective contracts of sale, adjusted for closing costs and expenses, or
(2) Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy, where applicable, based on estimated sales prices, adjusted for closing costs and expenses, determined by discounted cash flow analyses, direct capitalization analyses or a sales comparison approach
if no contracts had been concluded. The discounted cash flow and direct capitalization analyses include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specific holding period and, where applicable, any estimated debt premiums. These cash flows were
comprised of unobservable inputs which included forecasted rental revenues and expenses based upon existing in-place leases, market conditions and expectations for growth. Capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in these analyses were based
upon observable rates that the Company believed to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective properties. The sales comparison approach was utilized for certain land values and include comparable sales that were
completed in the selected market areas. The comparable sales utilized in these analyses were based upon observable per acre rates that the Company believed to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective properties. 
 Valuations were prepared using internally-developed valuation models. These valuations are reviewed and approved, during each reporting
period, by a diverse group of management, as deemed necessary, including personnel from the acquisition, accounting, finance, operations, development and leasing departments, and the valuations are updated as appropriate. In addition, the Company
may engage third party valuation experts to assist with the preparation of certain of its valuations.

 The fair values of the Company s fixed rate mortgage loans and unsecured revolving credit facility and term loans were estimated using
available market information and discounted cash flow analyses based on borrowing rates the Company believes it could obtain with similar terms and maturities. As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, the aggregate
fair values of the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility and term loans approximated the carrying values. As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the aggregate fair values of the Company s fixed rate mortgage loans
payable and mortgage loans payable real estate held for sale/conveyance, which were determined to be Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy, were approximately 410.8 million and 495.1 million, respectively; the carrying values of such loans
were 393.4 million and 481.1 million, respectively.

 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents in
excess of insured amounts and tenant receivables. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its tenants and requires certain tenants to provide
security deposits and/or suitable guarantees.

 Excluding properties held for sale, Giant Food Stores, LLC and Stop Shop, Inc.,
each of which is owned by Ahold N.V., a Netherlands corporation, accounted for an aggregate of approximately 14 , 15 and 14 of the Company s total revenues during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
 The Company s properties are located largely in the region straddling the Washington DC to Boston corridor, which exposes it to greater
economic risks than if the properties it owned were located in a greater number of geographic regions (in particular, 26 of the Company s properties are located in Pennsylvania).

During the fourth quarter of 2012, a 4.1 million loan receivable collateralized by a mortgage on a
development parcel went into default. The Company concluded that the loan was unlikely to be paid and wrote off the loan and accrued interest, resulting in an impairment charge of 4.4 million during 2012, which is included in continuing operations
in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Subsequently, on March 28, 2013, the borrowers sold the development land parcel for approximately 1.1 million and, simultaneously, the Company accepted 1.1 million in full
satisfaction of the loan. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment reversal of 1.1 million during the first quarter of 2013, which is included in continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

 At December 31, 2013, the Company had a mortgage loan payable of approximately 11.9 million, subject to an interest rate swap which converted the LIBOR-based variable rate to a fixed annual rate of 5.2 per
annum. Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans 
 On August 13, 2013, the Company entered into a 310 million unsecured credit facility which, as amended on February 5, 2015, consists
of (1) a 260 million revolving credit facility, expiring on February 5, 2019, and (2) a 50 million term loan, expiring on February 5, 2020. The revolving credit facility may be extended, at the Company s option, for an
additional one-year period, subject to customary conditions. Under an accordion feature, the facility can be increased to 750 million, subject to customary conditions and lending commitments. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility component
can range from LIBOR plus 135 bps to 195 bps (150 bps on February 5, 2015) and borrowing under the term loan component can range from 130 to 190 bps (145 bps on February 5, 2015), each based on the Company s leverage ratio. As of
December 31, 2014, the Company had 187.7 million available for additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility. On
February 11, 2014, the Company closed 150 million of unsecured term loans comprised of a five-year 75 million term loan, maturing on February 11, 2019, and a seven-year 75 million term loan, maturing on February 11, 2021. As
amended on February 5, 2015, borrowing under the five-year 75 million term loan can range from LIBOR plus 130 bps to 190 bps (145 bps on February 5, 2015) and borrowings under the seven-year 75 million term loan can range from LIBOR plus
170 bps to 230 bps (180 bps on February 5, 2015), each based on the Company s leverage ratio. Additionally, the Company has entered into forward interest rate swap agreements which convert the LIBOR rates to fixed rates for these term
loans beginning July 1, 2014 through their maturities. Reflecting the February 5, 2015 amendment, the new effective fixed interest rates are 3.1 for the five-year 75 million term loan and 4.1 for the seven-year 75 million term loan.

Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 December 31, 2014 
 On February 5, 2015, the Company closed 100 million of new unsecured term loans
comprised of a five-year 50 million term loan maturing February 5, 2020 (all of which was borrowed at closing), and a seven-year 50 million term loan maturing February 5, 2022. Proceeds from the seven-year term loan can be drawn at any
time from closing until July 1, 2015. Borrowings under the five-year 50 million term loan can range from 130 to 190 bps (145 bps on February 5, 2015) and borrowing under the seven-year 50 million term loan can range from LIBOR plus 155
bps to 215 bps (170 bps as of February 5, 2015), each based on the Company s leverage ratio. Additionally, the Company entered into forward interest rate swap agreements which converted the LIBOR rates to fixed rates for these term loans
beginning July 1, 2015 through their maturities. As a result, the effective fixed interest rates will be 2.9 for the five-year 50 million term loan and 3.4 for the seven-year 50 million term loan. 
 The Company s unsecured credit facility and term loans contain financial covenants including, but not limited to, maximum debt leverage,
maximum secured debt, minimum fixed charge coverage, and minimum net worth. In addition, the facility contains restrictions including, but not limited to, limits on indebtedness, certain investments and distributions. The Company s failure to
comply with the covenants or the occurrence of an event of default under the facility could result in the acceleration of the related debt. As of December 31, 2014, the Company is in compliance with all financial covenants. 
 Scheduled Principal Payments 
 Scheduled principal payments on mortgage loans payable, term loans, and the credit facility at December 31, 2014, due on various dates

 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 As discussed above, on February 11, 2014, the Company closed 150 million of unsecured term loans for which it entered into forward
interest rate swap agreements, which became effective on July 1, 2014. On May 29, 2014, the Company sold Townfair Center, which
collateralized an 11.8 million mortgage loan payable subject to an interest rate swap having a fair value recorded as a liability of 0.7 million. At closing, the buyer assumed both the outstanding mortgage loan payable and the related interest
rate swap, and the aforementioned 0.7 million was removed from both accumulated other comprehensive loss and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 
 At December 31, 2014, the Company had 2,777,000 on the consolidated balance sheet included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities
relating to the fair value of the interest rate swaps applicable to the 150 million unsecured term loans which closed on February 11, 2014. Charges and/or credits relating to the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are made to
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), noncontrolling interests (minority interests in consolidated joint ventures and limited partners interest), or operations (included in interest expense), as applicable. Over time, the unrealized
gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings as an increase or reduction to interest expense in the same periods in which the hedged interest payments affect earnings. The Company estimates
that approximately 2.7 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified as a charge to earnings within the next twelve months.

Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies 
 The Company is a party to certain legal actions arising in the normal course of business. Management does not expect there
to be adverse consequences from these actions that would be material to the Company s consolidated financial statements. Under
various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or petroleum product releases, at its properties. The owner may be
liable to governmental entities or to third parties for property damage, and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with any contamination. Generally, the Company s tenants must comply with environmental laws
and meet any remediation requirements. In addition, leases typically impose obligations on tenants to indemnify the Company from any compliance costs the Company may incur as a result of environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant.
However, if a lease does not require compliance, or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply, the Company could be forced to pay these costs. Management is unaware of any environmental matters that would have a material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements. The Company s executive offices are located at 44 South Bayles Avenue, Port Washington, New York.
The terms of the lease, which will expire in February 2020, provide for future minimum rents as follows: 2015 - 463,000, 2016 - 476,000, 2017 - 489,000, 2018

 The 2012 Plan authorizes 4.5 million shares to be available for grant and sets the maximum number of shares that may be granted to a
participant in any calendar year at 500,000. At December 31, 2014, 1.6 million shares remained available for grants pursuant to the 2012 Plan and, at that date, there remained an aggregate of 8.6 million applicable to all grants and
awards to be expensed over a weighted average period of 3.2 years. During 2014, there were 133,000 time-based restricted shares granted,
with a weighted average grant date fair value of 6.32 per share. During 2013, there were 584,000 time-based restricted shares granted with a weighted average grant date fair value of 5.65 per share. During 2012, in addition to shares issued to the
Company s President and Chief Executive Officer, as discussed below, there were 698,000 other time-based restricted shares granted with a weighted average grant date fair value of 4.75 per share. 
 The total fair values of shares vested during 2014, 2013, and 2012 were 943,000, 1,863,000, and 2,126,000, respectively (the 2012 amount
include 585,000, applicable to accelerated vestings). In June 2011, the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer was to
receive restricted share grants totaling 2.5 million shares as provided in his employment agreement, one-half of which to be time-based, vesting upon the seventh anniversary of the date of grant (vesting on June 15, 2018), and the other
half to be performance-based, to be earned if the total annual return on an investment in the Company s common stock TSR is at least an average of 6.5

per year for the seven years ending June 15, 2018. An independent appraisal determined the value of the performance-based award to be 4.39 per share compared to a market price at the date
of grant of 4.98 per share. As a result of a per-person limitation within the Company s prior stock incentive plan, only 500,000 shares had been issued through June 2012, 1.5 million shares had been accounted for as an equity
award , and 500,000 shares had been accounted for as a liability award . The values of the equity and liability awards were expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. As specifically provided in the 2012 Plan, the
2.0 million shares previously designated as equity and liability awards were issued, with the liability award being reclassified to equity. Consistent with such awards to other recipients, dividends have been paid on all the shares, including
the equity and liability award shares, with the dividends paid on the equity award shares treated as distributions to common shareholders and included in the statement of equity, and the dividends paid on the liability award shares treated as
compensation and included in the statement of operations. In addition, with respect to the liability award, adjustments to reflect changes in the fair value of the award (based on changes in the market price of the Company s common stock) were
also charged to operations. Note 18. Nonconcontrolling Interest Limited Partners Mezzanine OP Units

such shares have non-forfeitable rights to receive dividends). Unvested restricted shares are not allocated net losses and/or any excess of dividends declared over net income, as such amounts are
allocated entirely to the common shareholders. For 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company had 3.7 million, 3.8 million and 3.3 million, respectively, of weighted average unvested restricted shares outstanding. The following table provides a

Fully-diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common stock were exercised or converted into shares of common stock. The net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of the Operating Partnership has been excluded from the numerator and the related OP Units have been excluded from the
denominator for the purpose of calculating diluted EPS as there would have been no effect had such amounts been included. The weighted average number of OP Units outstanding was 433,000, 297,000 and 459,000 for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
Financial Disclosure None 
 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
its filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is reported within the time periods specified in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). In this regard, the Company has formed a Disclosure
Committee currently comprised of several of the Company s executive officers as well as certain other employees with knowledge of information that may be considered in the SEC reporting process. The Committee has responsibility for the
development and assessment of the financial and non-financial information to be included in the reports filed with the SEC, and assists the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in connection with their certifications
contained in the Company s SEC filings. The Committee meets regularly and reports to the Audit Committee on a quarterly or more frequent basis. The Company s principal executive and financial officers have evaluated its disclosure controls
and procedures as of December 31, 2014, and have determined that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There have
been no changes in the internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, these internal controls over financial reporting during the last quarter of 2014.
 Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The
Company s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control
systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2014. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control 2013 Integrated Framework . Based on
such assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2014, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 
 Ernst Young LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an opinion on the Company s
internal control over financial reporting, which appears elsewhere in this report.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cedar
Realty Trust, Inc. We have audited Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. s (the Company internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Item 9A. Controls and
Procedures Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 of Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. and our report dated February 19, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

 SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT 
 SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT made as of this 19th day of October, 2012, by and among Cedar Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland
corporation (the Corporation ), Cedar Realty Trust Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the Partnership ), and Nancy Mozzachio (the Executive ). 
 1. Position and Responsibilities . 
 1.1 The Executive initially shall serve in an executive capacity as Vice President of Leasing of both the Corporation and the Partnership with
duties consistent therewith and shall perform such other functions and undertake such other responsibilities as are customarily associated with such capacity; provided, however, that the Corporation and the Partnership shall have the right at any
time and from time to time to change the Executive s position, duties and responsibilities, including the right to reduce or enlarge such position, duties and responsibilities. The Executive shall also hold such directorships and officerships
in the Corporation, the Partnership and any of their subsidiaries to which, from time to time, the Executive may be elected or appointed during the term of this Agreement. 
 1.2 The Executive shall devote Executive s full business time and skill to the business and affairs of the Corporation and the
Partnership and to the promotion of their interests. 2. Term of Employment . 
 2.1 The term of employment shall end October 31, 2015 unless sooner terminated as provided in this Agreement. By executing this Second
Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, the Executive agrees that the proviso contained in Section 2.1 of the Executive s Amended and Restated Employment Agreement has been satisfied and the Executive s restricted shares of common
stock shall not immediately vest on October 31, 2012, but shall continue to vest in accordance with their terms. 

2.2 Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.1 hereof, each of the Corporation and the
Partnership shall have the right, on written notice to the Executive, to terminate the Executive s employment for Cause (as defined in Section 2.3) or without Cause, such termination to be effective as of the date on which notice is given
or as of such later date otherwise specified in the notice and, upon a termination of employment for Cause, Executive shall not be entitled to receive any additional compensation hereunder. The Executive shall have the right, on 30 days advance
written notice to the Corporation and the Partnership, to resign the Executive s employment for Good Reason (as defined in Section 2.4) or upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in Section 4.2), such termination to be
effective as of the 30th day following when such notice is given or as of such later date otherwise specified in the notice; provided, however, that Good Reason shall cease to exist for any event on the 90th day following the occurrence of the event
unless the Executive has given the Corporation and the Partnership written notice, in accordance with this Section 2.2; and provided, further, however, that any notice of termination as the result of a Change of Control must be provided within
90 days following the occurrence of the Change of Control. 2.3 For purposes of this Agreement, the term Cause shall mean any
of the following actions by the Executive: (a) failure to comply with any of the material terms of this Agreement, which shall not be cured within 30 days after written notice, or if the same is not of a nature that it can be completely cured
within such 30 day period, if Executive shall have failed to commence to cure the same within such 30 day period and shall have failed to pursue the cure of the same diligently thereafter; (b) engagement in gross misconduct injurious to the
 
 2 

business or reputation of the Corporation or the Partnership; (c) knowing and willful neglect or refusal to attend to the material duties assigned to the Executive by the Board of Directors
of the Corporation, which shall not be cured within 30 days after written notice; (d) intentional misappropriation of property of the Corporation or the Partnership to the Executive s own use; (e) the commission by the Executive of an
act of fraud or embezzlement; (f) Executive s conviction for a felony; (g) Executive s engaging in any activity which is prohibited pursuant to Section 5 of this Agreement, which shall not be cured within 30 days after
written notice. 2.4 For purposes of this Agreement, the term Good Reason shall mean any of the following: (i) a material
breach of this Agreement by the Corporation or the Partnership which shall not be cured within 30 days after written notice; or (ii) the relocation of the Executive s office or the Corporation s or Partnership s executive offices
to a location more than 30 miles from New York City. The Corporation or the Partnership, as applicable, shall have 30 days after receipt of the Executive s notice of termination for Good Reason in which to cure the failure, breach or infraction
described in the notice of termination. If the failure, breach or infraction is timely cured by the Corporation or the Partnership, the notice of termination for Good Reason shall become null and void. 
 3. Compensation . 3.1 The
Partnership shall pay to the Executive for the services to be rendered by the Executive hereunder to the Corporation and the Partnership a base salary at the rate of 310,000 per annum. The base salary shall be payable in accordance with the
Corporation s or Partnership s normal payroll practices, but not less frequently than twice a month. Such base salary will be reviewed at least annually and may be increased or decreased by the Board of Directors of the Corporation in its
sole discretion. The Board of Directors of the Corporation in its sole discretion may grant to the Executive a bonus to be paid by the Corporation or Partnership, at any time and from time to time. 
 3 

3.2 The Executive shall be entitled to participate in, and receive benefits from, on the basis
comparable to other senior executives, any insurance, medical, disability, or other employee benefit plan of the Corporation, the Partnership or any of their subsidiaries which may be in effect at any time during the course of Executive s
employment by the Corporation and the Partnership and which shall be generally available to senior executives of the Corporation, the Partnership or any of their subsidiaries. 
 3.3 The Partnership agrees to reimburse the Executive for all reasonable and necessary business expenses incurred by the Executive on behalf
of the Corporation or the Partnership in the course of Executive s duties hereunder upon the presentation by the Executive of appropriate vouchers therefor, including continuing legal education, professional licenses and organizations and
conferences approved by the CEO. 3.4 The Executive shall be entitled each year of this Agreement to paid vacation in accordance with the
Corporation s or Partnership s policies but not less than 4 weeks plus personal and floating holidays (and a ratable number of sick days), which if not taken during such year will be forfeited (unless management requests postponement).
 3.5 In recognition of Executive s need for an automobile for business purposes, the Corporation or the Partnership will reimburse
the Executive for Executive s use of an automobile, including lease payments, if any, and all related costs, including maintenance, gasoline and insurance; provided, however, that such amount shall not exceed 500.00 a month. Insurance,
maintenance and gas for business use is additional. 
 4 

3.6 If, during the period of employment hereunder, because of illness or other incapacity, the
Executive shall fail for a period of 90 consecutive days, or for shorter periods aggregating more than six months during the term of this Agreement, to render the services contemplated hereunder, then the Corporation or the Partnership, at either of
their options, may terminate the term of employment hereunder by notice from the Corporation or the Partnership, as the case may be, to the Executive, effective on the giving of such notice. During any period of disability of Executive during the
term hereof, the Corporation shall continue to pay to Executive the salary and bonus which the Executive has earned and accrued as of the date of termination of employment. 
 3.7 In the event of the death of the Executive during the term hereof, the employment hereunder shall terminate on the date of death of the
Executive. 3.8 Each of the Corporation and the Partnership shall have the right to obtain for their respective benefits an appropriate
life insurance policy on the life of the Executive, naming the Corporation or the Partnership as the beneficiary. If requested by the Corporation or the Partnership, the Executive agrees to cooperate with the Corporation or the Partnership, as the
case may be, in obtaining such policy. 4. Severance Compensation Upon Termination of Employment . 
 4.1 If the Executive s employment with the Corporation or the Partnership shall be terminated (a) by the Corporation or Partnership
other than for Cause or pursuant to Sections 3.6 or 3.7, or (b) by the Executive for Good Reason, then the Corporation and the Partnership shall: 
 (i) pay to the Executive as severance pay, within five days after termination, a lump sum payment equal to 100 of the sum of
the Executive s annual salary at the rate applicable on the date of termination and the average of the Executive s annual bonus for the preceding two full fiscal years; 
 5 

(ii) arrange to provide Executive, for a 12 month period (or such shorter period
as Executive may elect), with disability, accident and health insurance substantially similar to those insurance benefits which Executive is receiving immediately prior to the date of termination to the extent obtainable upon reasonable terms;
provided, however, if it is not so obtainable the Corporation shall pay to the Executive in cash the annual amount paid by the Corporation or the Partnership for such benefits during the previous year of the Executive s employment. Benefits
otherwise receivable by Executive pursuant to this Section 4.1(ii) shall be reduced to the extent comparable benefits are actually received by the Executive during such 12 month period following his termination (or such shorter period elected
by the Executive), and any such benefits actually received by Executive shall be reported by the Executive to the Corporation; and 
 (iii) the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall determine whether or not to vest any
options granted to Executive to acquire common stock of the Corporation and any restricted shares of common stock of the Corporation and any other awards granted to the Executive under any employee benefit plan that have not vested. 
 4.2(a) If the Executive s employment with the Corporation or the Partnership shall be terminated by the Executive as the result of a
Change of Control, then the Corporation and the Partnership shall: 
 6 

(i) pay to the Executive as severance pay, within five days after termination, a
lump sum payment equal to 250 of the sum of the Executive s annual salary at the rate applicable on the date of termination and the average of the Executive s annual bonus for the preceding two full fiscal years; 
 (ii) arrange to provide Executive, for a 12 month period (or such shorter period as Executive may elect), with disability,
accident and health insurance substantially similar to those insurance benefits which Executive is receiving immediately prior to the date of termination to the extent obtainable upon reasonable terms; provided, however, if it is not so obtainable
the Corporation shall pay to the Executive in cash the annual amount paid by the Corporation or the Partnership for such benefits during the previous year of the Executive s employment. Benefits otherwise receivable by Executive pursuant to
this Section 4.2(ii) shall be reduced to the extent comparable benefits are actually received by the Executive during such 12 month period following his termination (or such shorter period elected by the Executive), and any such benefits
actually received by Executive shall be reported by the Executive to the Corporation; and (iii) any options granted to
Executive to acquire common stock of the Corporation, any restricted shares of common stock of the Corporation issued to the Executive and any other awards granted to the Executive under any employee benefit plan that have not vested shall
immediately vest on said termination. (b) As used herein, a Change in Control shall be deemed to occur if: (i) there
shall be consummated (x) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation or the Partnership in which the Corporation or the Partnership is not the continuing or surviving 
 7 

corporation or pursuant to which the stock of the Corporation or the units of the Partnership would be converted into cash, securities or other property, other than a merger or consolidation of
the Corporation or Partnership in which the holders of the Corporation s stock immediately prior to the merger or consolidation hold more than fifty percent (50 of the stock or other forms of equity of the surviving corporation
immediately after the merger, or (y) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or series of related transactions) of all, or substantially all, the assets of the Corporation or the Partnership; (ii) the Board approves
any plan or proposal for liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation or Partnership; or (iii) any person acquires more than 29 of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Corporation. 
 4.3(a) The Executive shall not be required to mitigate damages or the amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement by seeking other
employment or otherwise, nor, except to the extent provided in Section 4.1 or 4.2 above, shall the amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by the Executive as a result of employment by
another employer or by insurance benefits after the date of termination, or otherwise. (b) The provisions of this Agreement, and any
payment provided for hereunder, shall not reduce any amounts otherwise payable, or in any way diminish the Executive s existing rights, or rights which would accrue solely as a result of the passage of time, under any benefit plan of the
Corporation or Partnership, or other contract, plan or arrangement. 
 8 

5. Other Activities During Employment . 
 5.1 The Executive shall not during the term of this Agreement undertake or engage in any other employment, occupation or business enterprise.
Subject to compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Executive may engage in reasonable activities with respect to personal investments of the Executive. 
 5.2 During the term of this Agreement, without the prior approval of the Board of Directors, neither the Executive nor any entity in which he
may be interested as a partner, trustee, director, officer, employee, shareholder, option holder, lender of money or guarantor, shall be engaged directly or indirectly in the retail shopping center business other than through the Corporation and the
Partnership, except for activities existing on the date of this Agreement which have been disclosed to the Corporation; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed to (a) prohibit the Executive from being on the Board of Directors
of another entity, (b) prevent the Executive from investing in securities if such class of securities in which the investment is so made is listed on a national securities exchange or is issued by a company registered under Section 12(g)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, so long as such investment holdings do not, in the aggregate, constitute more than 1 of the voting stock of any company s securities or (c) prohibit passive investments. 
 5.3 The Executive shall not at any time during this Agreement or after the termination hereof directly or indirectly divulge, furnish, use,
publish or make accessible to any person or entity any Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined), except pursuant to subpoena, court order or applicable law. Any records of Confidential Information prepared by the Executive or which come
into Executive s possession during this Agreement are and remain the property of the Corporation or the Partnership, as the case may be, and upon termination of Executive s employment all such records and copies thereof shall be either
left with or returned to the Corporation or the Partnership, as the case may be. 
 9 

5.4 The term Confidential Information shall mean information disclosed to the
Executive or known, learned, created or observed by Executive as a consequence of or through employment by the Corporation and the Partnership, not generally known in the relevant trade or industry, about the Corporation s or the
Partnership s business activities, services and processes, including but not limited to information concerning advertising, sales promotion, publicity, sales data, research, copy, leasing, other printed matter, artwork, photographs,
reproductions, layout, finances, accounting, methods, processes, business plans, contractors, lessee and supplier lists and records, potential lessee and supplier lists, and contractor, lessee or supplier billing. 
 6. Post-Employment Activities . 
 6.1 During the term of employment hereunder, and for a period of one year after termination of employment, regardless of the reason for such
termination, other than by (x) the Corporation or Partnership without Cause or (y) the Executive for Good Reason or as the result of a reduction in the Executive s salary or position with the Corporation, the Executive shall not
directly or indirectly become employed by, act as a consultant to, or otherwise render any services to any person, corporation, partnership or other entity which is engaged in, or about to become engaged in, the retail shopping center business or
any other business which is competitive with the business of the Corporation, the Partnership or any of their subsidiaries nor shall Executive use Executive s talents to make any such business competitive with the business of the Corporation,
the Partnership or any of their subsidiaries. For the purpose of this Section, a retail shopping center business or other business shall be 
 10 

deemed to be competitive if it involves the ownership, operation, leasing or management of any retail shopping centers which draw from the same related trade area, which is deemed to be within a
radius of 5 miles from the location of (a) any then existing shopping centers of the Corporation, the Partnership or any of their subsidiaries or (b) any proposed centers for which the site is owned or under contract, is under construction
or is actively being negotiated. The Executive shall be deemed to be directly or indirectly engaged in a business if Executive participates therein as a director, officer, stockholder, employee, agent, consultant, manager, salesman, partner or
individual proprietor, or as an investor who has made advances or loans, contributions to capital or expenditures for the purchase of stock, or in any capacity or manner whatsoever; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed to
prevent the Executive from investing in securities if such class of securities in which the investment is so made is listed on a national securities exchange or is issued by a company registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, so long as such investment holdings do not, in the aggregate, constitute more than 1 of the voting stock of any company s securities. 
 6.2 The Executive acknowledges that Executive has been employed for Executive s special talents and that Executive s leaving the
employ of the Corporation and the Partnership would seriously hamper the business of the Corporation and the Partnership. The Executive agrees that the Corporation and the Partnership shall each be entitled to injunctive relief, in addition to all
remedies permitted by law, to enforce the provisions of Sections 5 and 6 hereof. The Executive further acknowledges that Executive s training, experience and technical skills are of such breadth that they can be employed to advantage in
other areas which are not competitive with the present business of the Corporation and the Partnership and consequently the foregoing obligation will not unreasonably impair Executive s ability to engage in business activity after the
termination of Executive s present employment. 
 11 

6.3 The Executive will not, during the period of one year after termination of employment,
regardless of the reason for such termination, hire or offer to hire or entice away or in any other manner persuade or attempt to persuade, either in Executive s individual capacity or as agent for another, any of the Corporation s, the
Partnership s or any of their subsidiaries officers, employees or agents to discontinue their relationship with the Corporation, the Partnership or any of their subsidiaries nor divert or attempt to divert from the Corporation, the
Partnership or any of their subsidiaries any business whatsoever by influencing or attempting to influence any contractor, lessee or supplier of the Corporation, the Partnership or any of their subsidiaries. 
 7. Assignment . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Corporation, the Partnership and their successors
and assigns, and upon the Executive and Executive s heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives. The Corporation and the Partnership will require any successor or assign to all or substantially all of their business or assets to
assume and perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Corporation and the Partnership would be required to perform if no such succession or assignment had taken place. This Agreement shall not be assignable by the
Executive. 8. No Third Party Beneficiaries . This Agreement does not create, and shall not be construed as creating, any rights
enforceable by any person not a party to this Agreement, except as provided in Section 7 hereof. 9. Headings . The headings of
the sections hereof are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part hereof nor to affect the meaning thereof. 
 12 

10. Interpretation . In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been contained herein. If, moreover, any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to duration, geographical scope, activity or
subject, it shall be construed by limiting and reducing it, so as to be enforceable to the extent compatible with the applicable law as it shall then appear. 
 11. Notices . All notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given at the time when mailed by
registered or certified mail, addressed to the address below stated of the party to which notice is given, or to such changed address as such party may have fixed by notice: 

To the Corporation 

or the Partnership: 

Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. 

44 South Bayles Avenue 

Port Washington, NY 11050 

Attn: President 

To the Executive: 
 
 Nancy Mozzachio 

18 Quail Hollow Drive 

Sewell, NJ 08080 
 provided, however, that any notice of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt. 
 12. Waivers . If either party should waive any breach of any provision of this Agreement, he or it shall not thereby be deemed to have
waived any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other provision of this Agreement. 
 13 

13. Complete Agreement; Amendments . The foregoing is the entire agreement of the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and may not be amended, supplemented, cancelled or discharged except by written instrument executed by both parties hereto. 
 14. Governing Law . This Agreement is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without
giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. 15. Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which
together shall constitute one agreement binding on all of the parties hereto, notwithstanding that all such parties are not signatories to the same counterpart. 
 16. Arbitration . Mindful of the high cost of litigation, not only in dollars but time and energy as well, the parties intend to and do
hereby establish a quick, final and binding out-of-court dispute resolution procedure to be followed in the unlikely event any controversy should arise out of or concerning the performance of this Agreement. Accordingly, the parties do hereby
covenant and agree that any controversy, dispute or claim of whatever nature arising out of, in connection with or in relation to the interpretation, performance or breach of this Agreement, including any claim based on contract, tort or statute,
shall be settled, at the request of any party to this Agreement, through arbitration by a dispute resolution process administered by JAMS or any other mutually agreed upon arbitration firm involving final and binding arbitration conducted at a
location determined by the arbitrator in New York City administered by and in accordance with the then existing rules of practice and procedure of such arbitration firm and judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any
state or federal court having jurisdiction thereof; provided, however, that the Corporation and the Partnership shall be entitled to seek judicial relief to enforce the provisions of Sections 5 and 6 of this Agreement. 
 14 

17. Indemnification . During this Agreement and thereafter, the Corporation and the
Partnership shall indemnify the Executive to the fullest extent permitted by law against any judgments, fine, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with any claim, action or proceeding
(whether civil or criminal) against the Executive as a result of the Executive serving as an officer or director of the Corporation or the Partnership, in or with regard to any other entity, employee benefit plan or enterprise (other than arising
out of the Executive s act of willful misconduct, gross negligence, misappropriation of funds, fraud or breach of this Agreement). This indemnification shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnification the Executive shall
be entitled to pursuant to the Corporation s or Partnership s Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws, Agreement of Limited Partnership or otherwise. Following the Executive s termination of
employment, the Corporation and the Partnership shall continue to cover the Executive under the then existing director s and officer s insurance, if any, for the period during which the Executive may be subject to potential liability for
any claim, action or proceeding (whether civil or criminal) as a result of his service as an officer or director of the Corporation or the Partnership or in any capacity at the request of the Corporation or the Partnership, in or with regard to any
other entity, employee benefit plan or enterprise on the same terms such coverage was provided during this Agreement, at the highest level then maintained for any then current or former officer or director. 
 15 

18. Section 409A . 
 18.1 It is the intention of the Corporation and the Partnership that all payments and benefits under this Agreement shall be made and provided
in a manner that is either exempt from or intended to avoid taxation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended Section 409A ), to the extent applicable. Any ambiguity in this Agreement shall be interpreted
to comply with the above. The Executive acknowledges that the Corporation and the Partnership have made no representations as to the treatment of the compensation and benefits provided hereunder and the Executive has been advised to obtain his own
tax advice. 18.2 Each amount or benefit payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed a separate payment for purposes of
Section 409A. 18.3 For all purposes under this Agreement, any iteration of the word termination (e.g.,
 terminated with respect to the Executive s employment, shall mean a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A. 
 18.4 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event the stock of the Corporation is publicly traded on an
established securities market or otherwise and the Executive is a specified employee (as determined under the Corporation s administrative procedure for such determinations, in accordance with Section 409A) at the time of the
Executive s termination of employment, any payments under this Agreement that are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A shall not be paid or begin payment until the earlier of (i) the Executive s death or
(ii) the first payroll date following the six (6) month anniversary of the Executive s date of termination of employment; provided, however, that the Corporation if so requested by the Executive agrees to contribute any such payments
required to be made to the Executive to a rabbi trust established by the Corporation for the benefit of the Executive. 
 16 

18.5 Any reimbursements provided under this Agreement shall be made no later than the
December 31st following the year in which such expenses are incurred, or such earlier date as provided under any plan or policy of the Corporation or Partnership, as applicable. 
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.

for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will
promptly distribute to each Lender its Commitment Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative
Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment
shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. 
 (b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any LIBO Rate Advance (or, in the case of any Base Rate Advance, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Loan Advance) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such
Lender s share of such Loan Advance, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.1 (or, in the case of a Base Rate Advance, that such Lender has made
such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.1 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Loan Advance available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with
interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of
the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent
in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate 
 41 

Advances. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower
the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Loan Advance to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Loan
Advance and the Borrower shall have no further obligation with respect thereto under this Section 2.3.11(b)(i) in respect of such Lender s share of the Loan Advance; it being understood that such amount advanced by such Lender shall
constitute a Loan for all purposes hereunder. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
 (ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder, stating that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume
that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact
made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds
with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative
Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the
Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. (c)
 Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan Advance to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Section 2 , and such funds are
not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Section 5 are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent
shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. (d) Funding
Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan Advance in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan
Advance in any particular place or manner. 
 42 

2.3.12 Billings. The Administrative Agent may submit monthly billings
reflecting payments due; however, any changes in the interest rate which occur between the date of billing and the due date may be reflected in the billing for a subsequent month. Neither the failure of the Administrative Agent to submit a billing
nor any error in any such billing shall excuse the Borrower from the obligation to make full payment of all the Borrower s payment obligations when due. 
 2.3.13 Default Rate. 
 (a) If any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing pursuant to Section 10.1.1 , the Borrower shall pay
interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. 
 (b) In the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent or upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any other Event of
Default exists, the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.

demand. 2.3.14 Late Charges.

compensate the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for administrative and processing costs incident to late payments, (c) are not interest, and (d) shall not be subject to refund or rebate or credited against any other amount due. 
 2.3.15 Breakage Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders,
immediately upon request and notwithstanding contrary provisions contained in any of the Loan Documents, such amounts as shall, in the conclusive judgment of the Administrative Agent (in the absence of manifest error), compensate the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders for the loss, cost or expense which it may reasonably incur as a result of (i) any payment or prepayment, under any circumstances whatsoever, whether voluntary or involuntary, of all or any portion of a LIBO Rate Advance
on a date other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period of a LIBO Rate Advance, (ii) the conversion, for any reason whatsoever, whether voluntary or involuntary, of any LIBO Rate Advance to a Base Rate Advance on a date other than
the last day of the applicable Interest Period, (iii) the failure of all or a portion of a Loan Advance which was to have borne interest at the LIBO Rate pursuant to the request of the Borrower to be made under the Loan Agreement (except as a
result of any act or 
 43 

omission of Lender), or (iv) the failure of the Borrower to borrow in accordance with any request submitted by it for a LIBO Rate Advance. Such amounts payable by the Borrower shall be equal
to any administrative costs actually incurred plus any amounts required to compensate for any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or redeployment of deposits or other funds acquired by the Administrative Agent or any Lender
to fund or maintain a LIBO Rate Advance (herein, collectively, the Breakage Fee ). A certificate from a Lender provided to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent setting forth the calculation and amount of its Breakage Fee shall
be conclusive absent manifest error. 2.3.16 Borrower Information. The parties understand that the applicable
interest rate for the Borrower s Obligations and certain fees set forth herein may be determined and/or adjusted from time to time based upon certain financial ratios and/or other information to be provided or certified to the Lenders by
Borrower (the Borrower Information ). If it is subsequently determined that any such Borrower Information was incorrect (for whatever reason, including without limitation because of a subsequent restatement of earnings by the
Borrower) at the time it was delivered to the Agent, and if the applicable interest rate or fees calculated for any period were different than they should have been had the correct information been timely provided, then, such interest rate and such
fees for such period shall be automatically recalculated using correct Borrower Information. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrower in writing of any additional interest and fees due because of such recalculation, and the Borrower
shall pay such additional interest or fees due to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such written notice. Borrower shall receive a credit or refund of any overpayment promptly
after such determination. Any recalculation of interest or fees required by this provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and this provision shall not in any way limit any of the Administrative Agent s, the L/C Issuer s,
or any Lender s other rights under this Agreement.

Administrative Agent for the account of the parties specified therein the various fees in accordance with the Fee Letter.

the amount of any outstanding Swing Line Loans). The Line Fee shall be payable to the Administrative Agent quarterly in arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter for the immediately preceding calendar quarter or portion thereof, with a final
payment on the Maturity Date and the first and last payments to be prorated based upon the partial calendar quarters to which they apply.

funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, in the case of facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Fee Letter, fees paid under this Agreement shall not be refundable under any

(iii) the Total Revolving Outstandings held by any Lender (other than the Swing Line Lender) shall not exceed such Lender s Revolving Commitment, (y) the Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any
outstanding Swing Line Loan, and (z) the Swing Line Lender shall not be under any obligation to make any Swing Line Loan if it shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that there exists any
Defaulting Lender, unless the Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender has been fully Cash Collateralized. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this
Section 2.5, prepay under this Section 2.5, and reborrow under this Section 2.5. Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate Advance. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Lender s Commitment Percentage times the amount of such Swing Line Loan. 
 2.5.2 Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon the Borrower s irrevocable notice to the
Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify
(i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of 25,000, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the
Administrative Agent of a written Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by the Borrower. Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Loan Notice, the Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by
telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has
received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the 
 45 

Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 3:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing
Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in clause (x) of the proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.5.1, or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 5.2 is not then satisfied, then,
subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 4:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower at its office by crediting the
account of the Borrower on the books of the Swing Line Lender in immediately available funds. 2.5.3 Refinancing of
Swing Line Loans. (a) The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower
(which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Lender make a Base Rate Advance in an amount equal to such Lender s Commitment Percentage of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding.
Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.1.2 , without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein
for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Total Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 5.2. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable
Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall make an amount equal to its Commitment Percentage of the amount specified in such Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in immediately
available funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swing Line Loan) for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agent s Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day
specified in such Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.5.3(b) , each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Advance to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the
funds so received to the Swing Line Lender. (b) If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Loan
in accordance with Section 2.5.3(a) , the request for Base Rate Advances submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation
in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.5.3(a) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. 
 (c) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount
required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.5.3 by the time specified in Section 2.5.3(a) , the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the
Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is 
 46 

immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Swing Line Lender in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the
amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in the relevant Credit Extension or funded participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through
the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (c) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (d) Each Lender s obligation to make Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to
this Section 2.5.3 shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line
Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided ,
 however , that each Lender s obligation to make Loans pursuant to this Section 2.5.3 is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 . No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair
the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein. 2.5.4 Repayment
of Participations. (a) At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line
Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Commitment Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender. 
 (b) If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to
be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances set forth in this Agreement (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its
Commitment Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such
demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
 2.5.5 Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender . The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower
for interest on the Swing Line Loans. Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Advances or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.5 to refinance such Lender s Commitment Percentage of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such
Commitment Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender. 
 47 

2.5.6 Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall make all
payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender. 2.5.7 Swing
Line Note. The Swing Line Loans shall be evidenced by a separate promissory note of the Borrower in substantially the form of Exhibit G hereto (the Swing Line Note ), dated the date of this Agreement and completed with appropriate
insertions. The Swing Line Note shall be payable to the order of the Swing Line Lender in the principal face amount equal to the Swing Line Sublimit and shall be payable as set forth above. 

2.6 
 Additional Provisions Related to Interest Rate Selection. 2.6.1
 Increased Costs. If any Change in Law shall: (a) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit,
compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the LIBO Rate) or the L/C Issuer; 
 (b) subject any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of
Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or any LIBO Rate Advance made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the L/C Issuer in respect thereof; or 
 (c) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this
Agreement or LIBO Rate Advances made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the
foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any LIBO Rate Advance (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or
maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal,
interest or any other amount) then, promptly upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C
Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. A certificate from a Lender provided to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent setting forth such amounts together with calculations thereof shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. 2.6.2 Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in
Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity ratios or requirements has or would have the effect of reducing
the rate of return on such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s capital or on the capital of such 
 48 

Lender s or the L/C Issuer s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit
held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking
into consideration such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s policies and the policies of such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time (and in any event within twenty
(20) days) the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s holding company for any
such reduction suffered. A certificate from a Lender provided to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent setting forth such amounts together with calculations thereof shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 2.6.3 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Change in Law shall make it unlawful,
or any central bank or Governmental Authority shall assert by directive, guideline or otherwise, that it is unlawful, for any Lender to make or maintain LIBO Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain LIBO Rate Advances, and such Lender,
without cost or expense, cannot hold or administer its Commitment from an office where maintaining and funding LIBO Rate Advances can be accomplished, then, on written notice thereof and demand by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower,
(a) the obligation of the Administrative Agent to make LIBO Rate Advances and to convert or continue any Loan as LIBO Rate Advances shall terminate and (b) at the end of the applicable Interest Period, the Borrower shall convert all
principal outstanding under this Agreement into Base Rate Advances. 2.6.4 Availability. If, before or after the
Borrower has selected to take or maintain a LIBO Rate Advance, but before the Interest Period with respect thereto commences, the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that: 
 (a) Dollar deposits in the amount and for the maturity requested are not available to the Lenders in the London interbank
market at the rate specified in the definition of LIBO Rate set forth above, or (b) Reasonable means do not exist for the
Administrative Agent to determine the LIBO Rate for the amounts and maturity requested, then the principal which would have been a LIBO
Rate Advance shall be a Base Rate Advance. 2.6.5 Base Rate Advances. Each Base Rate Advance shall continue as a
Base Rate Advance until the Revolving Facility Maturity, unless sooner converted, in whole or in part, to a LIBO Rate Advance, subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 
 2.6.6 Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant
to the foregoing provisions of this Section 
 49 

shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or
the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the
change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or the L/C Issuer s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is
retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
 2.6.7 Mitigation. 
 (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under this Section 2.6 ,
or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.8 , then such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall, as
applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such
Lender or the L/C Issuer, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.8 or 2.6.1 , 2.6.2 , as the case may be, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such
Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by any Lender or the L/C Issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) Replacement of
Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Sections 2.6.1 or 2.6.2 , or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
 Section 2.8 , the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 13.2.4 . 2.6.8
 Survival. All of the Borrower s obligations under this Section 2.6 shall survive termination of the Total Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and resignation of the Administrative Agent. 
 2.6.9 Taxes. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no additional amounts shall be payable by Borrower under
this Section 2.6 with respect to Taxes on any amounts payable under the Loan Documents, which shall be governed by the provisions of Section 2.8 hereof. 

2.7

Revolving Commitment, and (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. Each request by the Borrower for the issuance or amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation
by the Borrower that the L/C Credit Extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower s ability to
obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. All Existing
Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant hereto, and from and after the Closing Date shall be subject to and governed by the terms and conditions hereof.

Cash Collateral in an amount equal to the undrawn amount of such Letter of Credit, with the Borrower hereby irrevocably requesting a Base Rate Advance to fund such Cash Collateral payment in the event the Borrower does not deliver such Cash
Collateral to the Administrative Agent on the due date thereof. 
 51 

(c) The L/C Issuer shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of
Credit if: (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to
enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Legal Requirement applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over
the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction,
reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing
Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it; (ii) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would
violate one or more policies of the L/C Issuer; (iii) except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the L/C

the provisions of Section 13.2.4 . (d) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of
Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such
Letter of Credit. (e) The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it
and the documents associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in Article 13 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer
in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or 
 52 

proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term Administrative Agent as used in Article 13 included
the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer. 
 2.7.2 Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit. 
 (a) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to the L/C
Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C Issuer and the
Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed
issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer:
(A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to
be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably
require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (1) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (2) the
proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (3) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (4) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require. Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to the L/C Issuer
and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may reasonably require. 
 (b) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a
copy thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one
or more applicable conditions contained in Section 5.2 shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower
or the applicable Borrower Subsidiary or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer s usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit,
each Lender shall be 
 53 

deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender s
Commitment Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit. (c) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter
of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit provided that any such
Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not
later than a day (the Non-Extension Notice Date in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required
to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter
of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date unless all the Lenders have approved such later expiry date, subject to Section 2.7.7 ; provided , however, that the L/C Issuer shall not
permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the
provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.7.1(c) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or
more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 5.2 are not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension. 
 (d) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that permits the automatic reinstatement of all or a portion of the stated amount thereof after any drawing thereunder (each, an Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit ). Unless otherwise
directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer to permit such reinstatement. Once an Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit has been issued, except as provided in the following sentence, the
Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to reinstate all or a portion of the stated amount thereof in accordance with the provisions of such Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such
Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit permits the L/C Issuer to decline to reinstate all or any portion of the stated amount thereof after a drawing thereunder by giving notice of such non-reinstatement within a specified number of days after such
drawing (the Non-Reinstatement Deadline ), the L/C Issuer shall not permit such reinstatement if it 
 54 

has received a notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days before the Non-Reinstatement Deadline (A) from the Administrative Agent that
the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such reinstatement or (B) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 5.2 are not then satisfied
(treating such reinstatement as an L/C Credit Extension for purposes of this clause) and, in each case, directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such reinstatement. 
 (e) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect
thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 
 2.7.3 Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations. 
 (a) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C
Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an Honor Date ), the
Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender
of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the Unreimbursed Amount ), and the amount of such Lender s Commitment Percentage thereof. In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Base Rate
Advance to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.1 for the principal amount of the Loan, but subject to the amount of the
unutilized portion of the Total Commitment and the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 . Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.7.3(a) may be given by telephone if immediately
confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
 (b) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.7.3(a) make funds available to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent s Office in an amount equal to its Commitment Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the Business Day specified in such notice by the
Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.7.3(c) , each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Advance to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall
remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer. 
 55 

(c) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a
Loan Advance because the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is
not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer
pursuant to Section 2.7.3(b) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this
 Section 2.7 . (d) Until each Lender funds its Commitment Percentage of any Loan Advance or L/C Advance pursuant
to this Section 2.7.3 to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Commitment Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer. 
 (e) Each Lender s obligation to make Loan Advances or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under
Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.7.3 , shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such
Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default; or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the
foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender s obligation to make Loan Advances pursuant to this Section 2.7.3 is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 . No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or
otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
 (f) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to
be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.7.3 by the time specified in Section 2.7.3(b) , the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative
Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds
Rate and a rate determined by the L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this
clause (f) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 56 

2.7.4 Repayment of Participations. 
 (a) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such
Lender s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.7.3 , if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon
(whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Commitment Percentage thereof (appropriately adjusted,
in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender s L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. 
 (b) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to
 Section 2.7.3(a) is required to be returned under any of the provisions of this Agreement (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the L/C Issuer its Commitment Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
 2.7.5 Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each
Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: 
 (a) Any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document; 
 (b) The existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower or any Borrower Subsidiary may
have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
 (c) Any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; 
 57 

(d) Any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against
presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy,
debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under
any Debtor Relief Law; or (e) Any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the
foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any Borrower Subsidiary. 
 The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of
any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower s instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will, immediately after discovery thereof, notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against
the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 2.7.6 Role of L/C Issuer. Each
Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of
Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Affiliates nor
any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable;
(ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer
Document. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the
Borrower s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Affiliates nor any correspondent,
participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (a) through (e) of Section 2.7.5 ; provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower
which the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C Issuer s willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and
certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept 
 58 

documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be
responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be
invalid or ineffective for any reason. 2.7.7 Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent,
(i) if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason
remains outstanding, the Borrower shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations (without duplication for Cash Collateral delivered and held as required under Section 2.7.1(b)(ii) above).
The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, a security interest in all such Cash Collateral and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked,
non-interest bearing deposit accounts at KeyBank. 2.7.8 Applicability of ISP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by
the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit. 
 2.7.9 Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in
accordance with its Commitment Percentage an annual Letter of Credit fee (the Letter of Credit Fee for each standby Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBO Rate Advances times the maximum stated amount available
to be drawn under such Letter of Credit; provided that any Letter of Credit Fee otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash Collateral or
entered in to other arrangements satisfactory to L/C Issuer pursuant to this Agreement shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective Commitment
Percentages allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.9.1(d), with the balance of such fee (other than the fees attributable to L/C Obligations for which Borrower has provided Cash Collateral), if any, payable to L/C Issuer for
its own account. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 2.7.13 . Letter of Credit Fees shall be
(i) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears and (ii) due and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter
of Credit and on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date. The first and last payments of such Letter of Credit fee are to be prorated based upon the partial calendar quarters to which they apply. If there is any change in the Applicable Margin for LIBO
Rate Advances during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each standby Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Margin for LIBO Rate Advances separately for each period during such quarter that such
Applicable Rate was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate. 
 59 

2.7.10 Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C
Issuer. The Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit, equal to the greater of (i) one eighth of one percent (.125 per annum, computed on the maximum stated
amount of such Letter of Credit or (ii) 500. Such fronting fee shall be due and payable at such time as the Letter of Credit is issued. For purposes of computing the maximum stated amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the
amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 2.7.13 . In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other
processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable. 
 2.7.11 Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any
Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control. 2.7.12 Letters of Credit Issued for Borrower Subsidiaries. 
Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Borrower Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all
drawings under such Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Borrower Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrower s business derives substantial
benefits from the businesses of such Borrower Subsidiaries. 2.7.13 Amount. Unless otherwise specified herein, the
amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the stated amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time; provided , however , that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any
Issuer Document related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such
increases, whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at such time. 

2.8 
 Taxes. 2.8.1 Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold;
Payments on Account of Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder
or under any other Loan Document (including, without limitation, each Guaranty) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes. If, however, applicable Laws require a
Loan Party or the Administrative Agent to 
 60 

withhold or deduct any Tax, such Tax shall be withheld or deducted in accordance with such Laws as determined by such Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, upon the basis of
the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.8.5 below. (b) If the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such
deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to Section 2.8.5 below (unless the Administrative Agent is not a United States
person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, in which case Borrower shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Borrower to be required based on the information and documentation it has received
pursuant to Section 2.8.5 below), (B) the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code (unless the Administrative Agent is not a
 United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, in which case Borrower shall timely pay the full amount withheld and deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code), and
(C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or
deduction been made. 2.8.2 Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of
 Section 2.8.1 above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws. 
 2.8.3 Tax Indemnifications. 
 (a) Without limiting the provisions of Sections 2.8.1 or 2.8.2 above, the Borrower shall, and does hereby,
indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 20 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) withheld or deducted by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent or paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and
any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The Borrower shall
also, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within twenty (20) days after written demand therefor, for any amount 
 61 

which a Lender or the L/C Issuer for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required by clause (b) of this subsection. A certificate as to the amount of any such
payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest
error. (b) Without limiting the provisions of Sections 2.8.1 or 2.8.2 above, each Lender and the L/C Issuer
shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within twenty (20) days after written demand therefor, against any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims,
liabilities, penalties, interest and expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Borrower or the Administrative Agent by any Governmental
Authority as a result of the failure by such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to deliver, or as a result of the inaccuracy, inadequacy or deficiency of, any documentation required to be delivered by such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the
case may be, to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.8.5 . Each Lender and the L/C Issuer hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or
the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (b). The agreements in this clause (b) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of
the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. 
 2.8.4 Evidence of Payments. Upon request by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any
payment of Taxes by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 2.8, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the
case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Law to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be. 2.8.5 Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation. 
 (a) Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable
Laws or when reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Laws or by the taxing authorities of any jurisdiction and such other reasonably requested
information as will permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine (A) whether or not payments made hereunder or under any other Loan Document are subject to Taxes, (B) if applicable, the required rate of
 
 62 

withholding or deduction, and (C) such Lender s entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender by
the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender s status for withholding tax purposes in the applicable jurisdiction. 
 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, 
 (i) Any Lender that is a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent
as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; and 
 (ii) Each Foreign Lender that is entitled under the Code or any applicable treaty to an exemption from or reduction of
withholding tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such
Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is
applicable: (A) Executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income
tax treaty to which the United States is a party, (B) Executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, 
 (C) Executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY and all required supporting documentation, 
 (D) In the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the
Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a bank within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of
section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or 
 63 

(E) Executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Laws as a
basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Laws to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the
withholding or deduction required to be made. (c) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject
to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as
prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their
obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.8.5(c) ,
 FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. (d) Each Lender shall
promptly (A) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (B) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it,
in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any jurisdiction that the Borrower or the Administrative Agent make any
withholding or deduction for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender. 2.8.6 Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless
required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes
withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or
Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of
indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all 
 64 

reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the
relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties,
interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the
Borrower or any other Person. 

2.9 
 Defaulting Lenders. 2.9.1 Adjustments . Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws: 
 (a) Waivers and Amendments . That Defaulting Lender s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or
consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and in Section 13.4.1 . 
 (b) Defaulting Lender Waterfall . Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article XI or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 12.2 
shall be applied at such time or times as may be reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second , to the
payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; third , to Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuer s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender;
 fourth , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined
by the Administrative Agent; fifth , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in an interest bearing deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender s potential
future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuer s future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this
Agreement; sixth , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender against
such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh , so long as no Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its 
 65 

obligations under this Agreement; and eighth , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a
payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the
conditions set forth in Section 5.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied first to pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of
any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments
hereunder without giving effect to Section 2.9.1(d) . Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral
pursuant to this Section 2.9.1(b) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
 (c) Certain Fees . 
 (i) No Defaulting Lender (x) shall be entitled to receive any Line Fee pursuant to Section 2.4.2 for any
period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender) pursuant to Section 2.4.2 for any period
during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender and the Borrower shall (A) except to the extent Borrower has provided Cash Collateral with respect to such Defaulting Lender s Fronting Exposure, be required to pay to the Swing Line Lender,
as applicable, the amount of such fee allocable to its Fronting Exposure arising from that Defaulting Lender and (B) not be required to pay the remaining amount of such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that
Defaulting Lender, and (y) shall be limited in its right to receive Letter of Credit Fees as provided in Section 2.7.9 . 
 (ii) Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fees for any period during which that Lender is a
Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Commitment Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to the terms hereof. 
 (d) Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure . All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s
participation in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender s Commitment) but only
to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower shall be
deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Total Revolving Outstandings of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting
Lender s Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a
Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 
 66 

(e) Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swing Line Loans . If the reallocation
described in clause (d) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected due to any Non-Defaulting Lender s Total Revolving Outstandings after giving effect to such reallocation exceeding such Non-Defaulting Lender s Revolving
Commitment (other than with respect to the Swing Line Lender), the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable Law, (x) first, prepay Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to the Swing
Line Lenders Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure in accordance with the provisions hereof. 
 2.9.2 Defaulting Lender Cure. If Borrower, Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, and L/C Issuer agree in writing in
their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions

the Borrower or to provide a lost note indemnity in lieu thereof. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a

the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 13.4.1 that affects such Participant. Subject to Section 13.3.5 , the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be

Document is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its
capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 13.3.5
 Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.8 , 2.3.15 , 2.6.1 or 2.6.2 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive
with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower s prior written consent, provided in no instance shall the Borrower s Obligations be increased
as a result thereof. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.8 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant

Lender. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender hereunder; provided , however , that no
failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of KeyBank as L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender. If KeyBank resigns as L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate

any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result from a claim brought by the Borrower or any other Loan Party against an Indemnitee for breach in
bad faith of such Indemnitee s obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the Borrower or such other Loan Party has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction. 15.9.3 Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to
indefeasibly pay any amount required hereunder Sections 15.9.1 or 15.9.2 to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the L/C Issuer or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the L/C Issuer or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender s Commitment Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or
indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any
such sub-agent) or the L/C Issuer in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or L/C Issuer in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the
Lenders under this Section 15.9.3 are subject to the provisions of Section 12.2. 
 123

hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof, with the exception of any such damages claimed against the Administrative Agent or any Lender by a third party as to which the

recipients of any information or other materials distributed to such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual damages resulting from a claim described in clause (x) or (y) of Section 15.9.2 . 
 15.9.5 Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than ten (10) Business Days after
demand therefor. 15.9.6 Survival . The agreements in this Section shall survive the resignation of the

 15.10 Regarding Consents. Except to the extent expressly provided herein, any and all consents to be made hereunder by the
Administrative Agent, Required Lenders, or Lenders shall be in the discretion of the Party to whom consent rights are given hereunder. 
 15.11 Obligations Absolute. Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law which cannot be waived, the Obligations of
Borrower and the obligations of the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents shall be joint and several, absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents under all circumstances
whatsoever, including, without limitation, the existence of any claim, set off, defense or other right which Borrower or any Loan Party may have at any time against the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders whether in connection with the Loan
or any unrelated transaction. 15.12 Table of Contents, Title and Headings . Any Table of Contents, the titles and the
headings of sections are not parts of this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document and shall not be deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any of its or their provisions. 
 15.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts),
each of which shall constitute an original, but 
 124 

all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter
hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 5.1 , this Agreement shall become effective when the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each party hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or other electronic imaging means shall
be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 15.14 Satisfaction of Commitment Letter. The
Loan being made pursuant to the terms hereof and of the other Loan Documents is being made in satisfaction of Administrative Agent s and each of the Lenders obligations under the Commitment Letter. The terms, provisions and conditions of

Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents may only be amended, terminated, extended or otherwise modified by a writing signed by the party against which enforcement is sought (except no such writing shall be required for any party which,
pursuant to a specific provision of any Loan Document, is required to be bound by changes without such party s assent). In no event shall any oral agreements, promises, actions, inactions, knowledge, course of conduct, course of dealings or the
like be effective to amend, terminate, extend or otherwise modify this Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. 15.17
 Monthly Statements. While the Administrative Agent may issue invoices or other statements on a monthly or periodic basis (a Statement ), it is expressly acknowledged and agreed that: (i) the failure of the
Administrative Agent to issue any Statement on one or more occasions shall not affect the Borrower s obligations to make payments under the Loan Documents as and when due; (ii) the inaccuracy of any Statement shall not be binding upon
Lenders and so the Borrower shall always remain obligated to pay the full amount(s) required under the Loan Documents as and when due notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in any Statement; (iii) all Statements are issued for
information purposes only and shall never constitute any type of offer, acceptance, modification, or waiver of the Loan Documents or any of Lenders rights or remedies thereunder; and (iv) in no event shall any Statement serve as the basis
for, or a component of, any course of dealing, course of conduct, or trade practice which would modify, alter, or otherwise affect the express written terms of the Loan Documents. 
 15.18 No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In connection with all aspects of each transaction completed hereby, the Borrower
and each other Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the credit facility provided for hereunder and any related arranging or other services in connection therewith (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification
hereof or of any other Loan Document) are arm s-length commercial transactions between the Borrower, each other Loan Party and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, 
 125 

and the Administrative Agent and the Arranger, on the other hand, and the Borrower and each other Loan Party is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms,
risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents (including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or thereof); and (ii) the Administrative Agent and the Arranger have not provided and
will not provide any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document) and each of the Borrower and
the other Loan Parties has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate. Each of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent and the Arranger with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty. The Administrative Agent, each Lender and their respective affiliates may have economic interests
that conflict with those of the Loan Parties, their stockholders and/or their affiliates. 15.19 USA PATRIOT Act. Each
Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined) and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56
(signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the Act ), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower and each other Loan Party, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower
and each other Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower and each other Loan Party in accordance with the Act. The Borrower shall, promptly following a request
by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, provide all documentation and other information that the Administrative Agent or such Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable know your customer and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the Act. 15.20 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. 
Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates 
respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, trustees, advisors and representatives to the extent such parties require such information in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood that the
Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have
jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to
any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or
thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement or any Eligible Assignee invited to be a Lender pursuant to Section 2.1.1 or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its
obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or 
 126 

(h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender,
the L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. In addition, each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and the information
about this Agreement to service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to
the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any
Subsidiary. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. Each of the Administrative Agent,
the Lenders and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of
material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws. 
 15.21 Amendment and Restatement. The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the lenders party to the Existing Agreement that are
Lenders under this Agreement each hereby agrees that, at such time as this Agreement shall have become effective, the Existing Agreement automatically shall be deemed replaced and superseded by this Agreement and the Borrower and the lenders party
to the Existing Agreement shall no longer have any obligations thereunder (other than those obligations in the Existing Agreement that expressly survive the termination of the Existing Agreement) and instead all obligations of the Borrower and the
lenders under the Existing Agreement are now evidenced by this Agreement. It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that this Agreement not operate as a novation of the obligations under the Existing Agreement and shall not operate as a
novation or waiver of any right, power or remedy of the Administrative Agent or any Lender. [The balance of this page is intentionally

 FORM OF GUARANTY
 This Guaranty (hereinafter, the Guaranty is given pursuant to the terms and conditions of that certain Third
Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, dated as of February 5, 2015 (as amended, restated, extended, supplemented or otherwise modified in writing from time to time, the Loan Agreement ), among Cedar Realty Trust Partnership, L.P.
(the Borrower ), the Lenders from time to time party thereto, and KeyBank National Association, as Administrative Agent (in such capacity as Administrative Agent, the Agent ). Capitalized terms used herein and
not otherwise specifically defined shall have the same meaning herein as in the Loan Agreement. FOR VALUE RECEIVED, and to induce
Agent and the Lenders to extend credit to the Borrower as provided for in the Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents, CEDAR REALTY TRUST, INC., a Maryland corporation (hereinafter, Guarantor ), hereby unconditionally agrees as
follows: Guaranty . Each Guarantor, as a primary party and not merely as a surety, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the
prompt and full payment (and not merely the collectability), performance, and observance of all of the obligations, terms and conditions to be paid, performed or observed by Borrower under the Note, Loan Agreement and each other Loan Document and
any Swap Contract, to or on behalf of the Agent, the Lenders, or any one of them, each as the same may be hereafter amended, modified, extended, renewed or recast, including, without limitation, all of the Obligations and the payment of all
principal, interest, fees, all obligations and other charges when due under the Note, the Loan Agreement and each other Loan Document and any Swap Contract (hereinafter, the Guaranteed Obligations ). 
 Upon the occurrence of and during the continuance of any Event of Default under the Loan Agreement, or any of the other Loan Documents, or if
Agent has accelerated the Loan pursuant to a right to do so under the Loan Agreement, Agent may at its option proceed directly and at once, without notice (except as otherwise provided under the Loan Agreement), against Guarantor hereunder, without
proceeding against Borrower, any other Guarantor, or any other person for the Obligations or the Guaranteed Obligations. If Borrower, or
Guarantor if so required, shall fail or refuse to perform or continue performance of all of the Obligations on the part of Borrower to be kept and performed, then, if an Event of Default exists on account thereof under the Loan Documents or this
Guaranty, in addition to any other rights and remedies which Agent or any Lender may have hereunder or elsewhere, and not in limitation thereof, Agent or any Lender, at such party s option, may exercise any or all of its rights and remedies
under the Loan Agreement and each other Loan Document. This Guaranty shall survive and continue in full force and effect beyond and after
the payment and satisfaction of the Guaranteed Obligations and the Obligations in the event Agent or any Lender is required to disgorge or return any payment or property received as a result of any laws pertaining to preferences, fraudulent
transfers or fraudulent conveyances. 
 Exhibit F-1 - 1

Waivers . Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes to the fullest extent now or hereafter
not prohibited by applicable law: 

1.1 
 all suretyship defenses and defenses in the nature thereof; 

1.2 
 any right or claim of right to cause a marshaling of the assets of Borrower, or, if there shall be more than one Guarantor, to require Agent to proceed against any other Guarantor or any of Guarantors in any
particular order; 

1.3 
 until satisfaction in full of the Obligations of the Borrower to the Agent and the Lenders, and the satisfaction in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, all rights and remedies, including, but not limited to, any
rights of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, exoneration or indemnification pursuant to any agreement, express or implied, or now or hereafter accorded by applicable law to indemnitors, guarantors, sureties or accommodation parties; provided,
however, unless Agent otherwise expressly agrees in writing, such waiver by Guarantor shall not be effective to the extent that by virtue thereof Guarantor s liability under this Guaranty is rendered invalid, voidable, or unenforceable under
any applicable state or federal law dealing with the recovery or avoidance of so-called preferences or fraudulent transfers or conveyances or otherwise; 

1.4 
 notice of the acceptance hereof, presentment, demand for payment, protest, notice of protest, or any and all notice of nonpayment, nonperformance, nonobservance or default, or other proof or notice of demand
whereby to charge Guarantor therefor; 

1.5 
 the pleading of any statute of limitations as a defense to Guarantor s obligations hereunder; 

1.6 
 the right to a trial by jury in any matter related to this Guaranty; and 

1.7 
 the benefit of all other provisions of law which may be validly waived. GUARANTOR,
AGENT AND LENDERS MUTUALLY HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED ON THIS GUARANTY, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTY OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALINGS, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS OR ACTIONS OF AGENT OR ANY LENDER RELATING TO
THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LOAN OR ENFORCEMENT OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, AND AGREE THAT NONE OF THE PARTIES WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY
LAW, 
 Exhibit F-1 - 2

GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO CLAIM OR RECOVER IN ANY LITIGATION ANY SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES OTHER THAN, OR IN ADDITION TO, ACTUAL
DAMAGES. GUARANTOR CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF AGENT OR ANY LENDER HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT AGENT OR ANY LENDER WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER. THIS WAIVER
IS GIVEN AS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO AGENT AND THE LENDERS TO ACCEPT THIS GUARANTY AND TO MAKE THE LOAN. Cumulative Rights .
Agent s and any Lender s rights under this Guaranty shall be in addition to and not in limitation of all of the rights and remedies of Agent and any Lender under the Loan Documents. All rights and remedies of Agent and any Lender shall be
cumulative and may be exercised in such manner and combination as Agent or any Lender may determine. No Impairment . The liability
of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be limited or impaired by, and Guarantor hereby assents to and agrees to be bound by, any amendment or modification of the provisions of the Loan Documents and any Swap Contract to or with Agent or any Lender

 any amendment to or modification of any of the Loan Documents and any Swap Contract; 

1.10 
 any sale or assignment of the Loan, or any sale, transfer or exchange of all or part of any Borrowing Base Property; 

1.11 
 any exculpatory, or nonrecourse, or limited recourse, provision in any of the Loan Documents and any Swap Contract limiting Agent s or any Lender s rights to a deficiency judgment against Borrower or
any other person or entity; 

1.12 
 the accuracy or inaccuracy of any of the representations or warranties made by or on behalf of Borrower, any general partner, owner, principal, or agent of Borrower, or Guarantor, under any Loan Document or
otherwise; 

1.13 
 the release of Borrower, any general partner, owner, principal, or agent of Borrower, or any other person or entity, from performance or observance of any of the agreements, covenants, terms or conditions
contained in any of the Loan Documents and any Swap Contract by operation of law, Agent s or any Lender s voluntary act, or otherwise; 

1.14 
 the filing of any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding by or against Borrower or any general partner, owner, principal, or agent of Borrower or Guarantor;

1.15

1.16

 Any of the foregoing may be accomplished with or without notice to Borrower, any general partner, owner, principal, or agent of Borrower, or
Guarantor, and with or without consideration. Delay Not Waiver . No delay on Agent s or any Lender s part in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver of any such privilege, power or right. No waiver by Agent or any Lender in any instance shall constitute a waiver in any other instance. 
 Warranties and Representations . Guarantor warrants and represents to Agent and each of the Lenders for the express purpose of inducing
Agent and the Lenders to enter into the Loan Agreement, to make each Loan Advance, to accept this Guaranty, and to otherwise complete the transactions contemplated by the Loan Agreement, that as of the date of this Guaranty, upon the date of each
Loan Advance, and at all times thereafter until the Loan is repaid and all Guaranteed Obligations to Agent and the Lenders have been satisfied in full, as follows:

thereof and no material and adverse change has occurred in Guarantor s financial condition or business since the respective dates thereof; and each financial statement of Guarantor submitted in the future shall fairly present Guarantor s
financial condition as of the dates thereof. 

1.18 
 No Violation . The payment and performance by Guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations and Guarantor s obligations under this Guaranty does not and shall not constitute a violation of any law, order,

1.19 
 No Litigation . There is no material litigation now pending or, to the best of Guarantor s knowledge threatened in writing, against Guarantor which, if adversely decided would materially impair the

relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The obligations and undertakings of a Qualified Keepwell Provider with respect to any Swap Counterparty under this paragraph shall remain in full force and
effect until all Swap Obligations of such Swap Counterparty in respect of which a Supported Guarantor has provided a Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full. The parties intend this provision to constitute, and this provision
shall be deemed to constitute, a guarantee of the obligations of, and a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit of, each Supported Guarantor for all purposes of the CEA.

specifies a subsequent effective date. Guarantor means any person or entity issuing or providing a Guaranty. 
 Guaranty means a guaranty or assumption of liability as surety with respect to obligations of one or more Swap Counterparties.

of the CEA by entering into a keepwell. Supported Guarantor means with respect to a Swap Counterparty, each person specified as such
in this Writing, and if no such persons are specified, each Guarantor in respect of Swap Obligations of such Swap Counterparty that is, as of the Eligibility Date, (i) a corporation, partnership, proprietorship, organization, trust or other entity
other than a commodity pool as defined in Section 1a(10) of the CEA and CFTC regulations thereunder that would not be an ECP on the Eligibility Date but for the effect of these Keepwell Terms or (ii) a person that the CFTC has determined
is eligible to qualify as an ECP under Section 1a(18) of the CEA by virtue of being a beneficiary of a keepwell and that would not qualify as an ECP but for the effect of these Keepwell Terms. 
 Swap means any swap as defined in Section 1a(47) of the CEA and regulations thereunder other than (i) a swap entered into on,
or subject to the rules of, a DCM, or (ii) a commodity option entered into pursuant to CFTC Regulation 32.3(a). Swap Counterparty 
means any party hereto who is party to a Swap with one or more Swap Providers, whether at inception, by novation, or otherwise, including any successors to such party.

Counterparty and a Swap Provider of such Swap Counterparty. 
 Exhibit F-2 

Swap Provider with respect to a Swap Counterparty, means the person or persons specified as
such in this Writing, and if no such persons are specified, each person who is the counterparty to a Swap with such Swap Counterparty hereunder, whether at inception, by novation, or otherwise, including any successors to such party.

any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is
owed, at the Administrative Agent s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Commitment Percentage (or other
applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding
Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of
time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. (b)(i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by
Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any LIBO Rate Advance (or, in the case of any Base Rate Advance, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Loan Advance)
that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Loan Advance, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
 Section 2.1 (or, in the case of a Base Rate Advance, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.1 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Loan Advance available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation,
 plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate
Advances. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by
 
 40 

the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Loan Advance to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included
in such Loan Advance and the Borrower shall have no further obligation with respect thereto under this Section 2.3.11(b)(i) in respect of such Lender s share of the Loan Advance; it being understood that such amount advanced by such
Lender shall constitute a Loan for all purposes hereunder. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
 (ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder, stating that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower
has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally
agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error. (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to
the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan Advance to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Section 2 , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the
conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Section 5 are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such
Lender, without interest. (d) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the
funds for any Loan Advance in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan Advance in any particular place or manner. 
 2.3.12 Billings. The Administrative Agent may submit monthly billings reflecting payments due; however, any changes in
the interest rate which occur between the date of billing and the due date may be reflected in the billing for a subsequent month. 
 41 

Neither the failure of the Administrative Agent to submit a billing nor any error in any such billing shall excuse the Borrower from the obligation to make full payment of all the Borrower s
payment obligations when due. 2.3.13 Default Rate. 
 (a) If any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing pursuant to Section 10.1.1 , the Borrower shall pay
interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. 
 (b) In the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent or upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any other Event of
Default exists, the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.

demand. 2.3.14 Late Charges.

Agent and the Lenders for the loss, cost or expense which it may reasonably incur as a result of (i) any payment or prepayment, under any circumstances whatsoever, whether voluntary or involuntary, of all or any portion of a LIBO Rate Advance
on a date other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period of a LIBO Rate Advance, (ii) the conversion, for any reason whatsoever, whether voluntary or involuntary, of any LIBO Rate Advance to a Base Rate Advance on a date other than
the last day of the applicable Interest Period, (iii) the failure of all or a portion of a Loan Advance which was to have borne interest at the LIBO Rate pursuant to the request of the Borrower to be made under the Loan Agreement (except as a
result of any act or omission of Lender), or (iv) the failure of the Borrower to borrow in accordance with any request submitted by it for a LIBO Rate Advance. Such amounts payable by the Borrower shall be equal to any administrative costs
actually incurred plus any amounts required to compensate for any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or redeployment of deposits or other funds acquired by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to fund or maintain a LIBO
Rate Advance (herein, collectively, the Breakage Fee ). A certificate from a Lender provided to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent setting forth the calculation and amount of its Breakage Fee shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. 
 42

interest rate for the Borrower s Obligations and certain fees set forth herein may be determined and/or adjusted from time to time based upon certain financial ratios and/or other information to be provided or certified to the Lenders by
Borrower (the Borrower Information ). If it is subsequently determined that any such Borrower Information was incorrect (for whatever reason, including without limitation because of a subsequent restatement of earnings by the
Borrower) at the time it was delivered to the Agent, and if the applicable interest rate or fees calculated for any period were different than they should have been had the correct information been timely provided, then, such interest rate and such
fees for such period shall be automatically recalculated using correct Borrower Information. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrower in writing of any additional interest and fees due because of such recalculation, and the Borrower
shall pay such additional interest or fees due to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such written notice. Borrower shall receive a credit or refund of any overpayment promptly
after such determination. Any recalculation of interest or fees required by this provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and this provision shall not in any way limit any of the Administrative Agent s or any Lender s
other rights under this Agreement

if any Change in Law shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or Governmental Authority shall assert by directive, guideline or otherwise, that it is unlawful, for any Lender to make or maintain LIBO Rate Advances or to continue to fund or
maintain LIBO Rate Advances, and such Lender, without cost or expense, cannot hold or administer its Commitment from an office where maintaining and funding LIBO Rate Advances can be accomplished, then, on written notice thereof and demand by the

the Borrower shall convert all principal outstanding under this Agreement into Base Rate Advances. 2.6.4

Base Rate Advance until the Maturity Date, unless sooner converted, in whole or in part, to a LIBO Rate Advance, subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 
 2.6.6 Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for
any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s intention to claim
compensation therefor (except that, if the change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
 2.6.7 Mitigation. 
 (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under this Section 2.6 ,
or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.8 , then such Lender shall, as applicable, use
 
 45 

reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.8 or 2.6.1 , 2.6.2 , as the case may be, and (ii) in each case,
would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment. (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Sections
2.6.1 or 2.6.2 , or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.8 , the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance

Loan Party or the Administrative Agent to withhold or deduct any Tax, such Tax shall be withheld or deducted in accordance with such Laws as determined by such Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, upon the basis of the
information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.8.5 below. (b) If the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such
deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to Section 2.8.5 below (unless the 
 46 

Administrative Agent is not a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, in which case Borrower shall withhold or make such deductions as are
determined by the Borrower to be required based on the information and documentation it has received pursuant to Section 2.8.5 below), (B) the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code (unless the Administrative Agent is not a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, in which case Borrower shall timely pay the full
amount withheld and deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code), and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower
shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be,
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made. 2.8.2

imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) withheld or deducted by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent or paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The Borrower shall also, and does hereby,
indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within twenty (20) days after written demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required
by clause (b) of this subsection. A certificate as to the amount of any such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of

 2.8.2 above, each Lender shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within twenty (20) days after written demand therefor, against any and all Taxes and any and
all related losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and expenses (including the 
 47 

fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Borrower or the Administrative Agent by any Governmental Authority
as a result of the failure by such Lender to deliver, or as a result of the inaccuracy, inadequacy or deficiency of, any documentation required to be delivered by such Lender to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent pursuant to
 Section 2.8.5 . Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative

Laws or when reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Laws or by the taxing authorities of any jurisdiction and such other reasonably requested
information as will permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine (A) whether or not payments made hereunder or under any other Loan Document are subject to Taxes, (B) if applicable, the required rate of
withholding or deduction, and (C) such Lender s entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to
establish such Lender s status for withholding tax purposes in the applicable jurisdiction. (b) Without limiting the

requirements; and (ii) Each Foreign Lender that is entitled under the Code or any applicable treaty to an exemption from
or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date
on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the

applicable Laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Laws to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent
to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. (c) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document
would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable),
such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative 
 49 

Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including
as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their

Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges
imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall

Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise

all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,

proceeding.

Property Owner as a result of a transaction permitted hereunder. Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required

13.2 
 Respecting Loans and Payments. 13.2.1 Adjustments. If,
after the Administrative Agent has paid each Lender s proportionate share of any payment received or applied by the Administrative Agent in respect of the Loan and other Obligations, that payment is rescinded or must otherwise be returned or

of such payment or application to the Administrative Agent, together with such Lender s proportionate share of any interest or other amount required to be paid by the Administrative Agent with respect to such payment or application. 
 13.2.2 Setoff. If any Lender (including the Administrative Agent), acting in its individual capacity, shall exercise
any right of setoff against a deposit balance or other account of the Borrower held by such Lender on account of the obligations of the Borrower under this Loan Agreement, such Lender shall remit to the Administrative Agent all such sums received
pursuant to the exercise of such right of setoff, and the Administrative Agent shall apply all such sums for the benefit of all of the Lenders hereunder in accordance with the terms of this Loan Agreement. 
 13.2.3 Distribution by the Administrative Agent. If in the opinion of the Administrative Agent distribution of any
amount received by it in such capacity hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents might involve any liability, it may refrain from making distribution until its right to make distribution shall have been adjudicated by a court of competent
jurisdiction or has been resolved by the mutual consent of all Lenders. In addition, the Administrative Agent may request full and complete indemnity, in form and substance satisfactory to it, prior to making any such distribution. If a court of
competent jurisdiction shall adjudge that any amount received and distributed by the Administrative Agent is to be repaid, each Person to whom any such distribution shall have been made shall either repay to the Administrative Agent its
proportionate share of the amount so adjudged to be repaid or shall pay over to the same in such manner and to such Persons as shall be determined by such court. 
 13.2.4 Removal or Replacement of a Lender. If any Lender requests compensation under Sections 2.6.1 or
 2.6.2 , or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.8 , or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then in addition

the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 13.3 ), all of its interests, rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:

for compensation under Sections 2.6.1 or 2.6.2 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.8 , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and 
 (d) Such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws. 
 A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 13.2.5
 Holders. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the Lender designated in the Register as the proportionate owner of such interest in the Obligations for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the assignment, transfer or
endorsement thereof, as the case may be, shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. Any request, authority or consent of any Person or entity who, at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any
designated interest in the Obligations shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or endorsee, as the case may be, of such interest in the Obligations.

 (i) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender s Commitment and the Loans at the
time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
 (ii) in any case not described in Section 13.3.2(a)(i) , the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this
purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and
Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than 5,000,000 unless each of the
Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an
Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such
minimum amount has been met. (b) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned.

date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of
the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.8 , 2.6.1 , 2.6.2 , 2.3.15 , and
 15.9 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender; provided that such new Note shall be
dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall be otherwise in the form of Exhibit B . To the extent a Lender has assigned all of its Commitment and Loans, it covenants to return any outstanding Note to the Borrower
or to provide a lost note indemnity in lieu thereof. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and
principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the

Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that
such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 13.4.1 that affects such
Participant. Subject to Section 13.3.5 , the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.8 , 2.6.1 , 2.6.2 and 2.3.15 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 13.3.2 . To the extent permitted by Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.2 as though it were a Lender, provided such
Participant agrees to be subject to Section 12.2 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a
participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each

registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no
responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 13.3.5 Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant
shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.8 , 2.3.15 , 2.6.1 or 2.6.2 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower s prior written consent, provided in no instance shall the Borrower s Obligations be increased as a result thereof. A Participant that would be
a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.8 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant complies with Section 2.8.5 as
though it were a Lender. 13.3.6 Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or foreclosure with respect to any such
pledge shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee for such Lender as a party hereto.

 (e) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and
act upon any notices (including telephonic Loan Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form
of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Related Parties of each of them from all

modified in writing from time to time, the Loan Agreement ), among Cedar Realty Trust Partnership, L.P. (the Borrower ), the Lenders from time to time party thereto, and KeyBank National Association, as
Administrative Agent (in such capacity as Administrative Agent, the Agent ). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise specifically defined shall have the same meaning herein as in the Loan Agreement. 
 FOR VALUE RECEIVED, and to induce Agent and the Lenders to extend credit to the Borrower as provided for in the Loan Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, CEDAR REALTY TRUST, INC., a Maryland corporation (hereinafter, Guarantor ), hereby unconditionally agrees as follows: 
 Guaranty . Each Guarantor, as a primary party and not merely as a surety, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the prompt and full
payment (and not merely the collectability), performance, and observance of all of the obligations, terms and conditions to be paid, performed or observed by Borrower under the Note, Loan Agreement and each other Loan Document and any Swap Contract,
to or on behalf of the Agent, the Lenders, or any one of them, each as the same may be hereafter amended, modified, extended, renewed or recast, including, without limitation, all of the Obligations and the payment of all principal, interest, fees,
all obligations and other charges when due under the Note, the Loan Agreement and each other Loan Document and any Swap Contract (hereinafter, the Guaranteed Obligations ). 
 Upon the occurrence of and during the continuance of any Event of Default under the Loan Agreement, or any of the other Loan Documents, or if
Agent has accelerated the Loan pursuant to a right to do so under the Loan Agreement, Agent may at its option proceed directly and at once, without notice (except as otherwise provided under the Loan Agreement), against Guarantor hereunder, without
proceeding against Borrower, any other Guarantor, or any other person for the Obligations or the Guaranteed Obligations. If Borrower, or
Guarantor if so required, shall fail or refuse to perform or continue performance of all of the Obligations on the part of Borrower to be kept and performed, then, if an Event of Default exists on account thereof under the Loan Documents or this
Guaranty, in addition to any other rights and remedies which Agent or any Lender may have hereunder or elsewhere, and not in limitation thereof, Agent or any Lender, at such party s option, may exercise any or all of its rights and remedies
under the Loan Agreement and each other Loan Document. This Guaranty shall survive and continue in full force and effect beyond and after

transfers or fraudulent conveyances.

generally), Guarantor, and each affiliated entity, agrees not to accept any payment or satisfaction for any kind of indebtedness of Borrower to Guarantor, or any affiliated entity, and hereby assigns such indebtedness to Agent, on behalf of the
Lenders, including, but not limited to, the right to file proofs of claim and to vote thereon in connection with any such case under any Debtor Relief Laws, as now or hereafter in effect, and the right to vote on any plan of reorganization.

subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, exoneration, indemnification, or reimbursement arising out of any payment made on this Guaranty, whether such claim is based upon an express or implied contract, or operation of law, are hereby waived;
 provided , however , unless Agent otherwise expressly agrees in writing, such waiver by Guarantor shall not be effective to the extent that by virtue thereof Guarantor s liability under this Guaranty or under any other Loan Document
is rendered invalid, voidable, or unenforceable under any applicable state or federal law dealing with the recovery or avoidance of so-called preferences or fraudulent conveyances or otherwise. 
 Legal Fees, Costs and Expenses . Guarantor further agrees to pay within thirty (30) days after demand all costs and expenses
reasonably incurred by Agent and the Lenders, or their successors or assigns, in connection with enforcing any of the rights or remedies of Agent or any Lender, or such successors or assigns, under or with respect to this Guaranty including, but not

 Exhibit F-1 - 8

and apply the same to any liability or obligation of Guarantor even though unmatured and regardless of the adequacy of any other collateral securing the Loan. Within five (5) Business Days of making any such set-off, Agent agrees to notify
Guarantor thereof, provided that the failure by Agent to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off.

 Incorporation These ISDA ECP Guarantor Keepwell Terms Keepwell Terms may be incorporated
into any agreement, document, instrument, confirmation or other writing, whether in physical or electronic form Writing by indicating in the Writing that, or the extent to which, these Keepwell Terms are incorporated into or otherwise
applicable to such Writing. These Keepwell Terms will be deemed to be part of or otherwise applicable to such a Writing to the same extent as if set forth therein except as otherwise modified or provided in that Writing. Terms defined herein shall
have their meanings solely for purposes of these Keepwell Terms unless otherwise provided in the relevant Writing. 

(b) 
 Keepwell Each Qualified Keepwell Provider with respect to a Swap Counterparty hereby absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other credit support as may be needed by any Supported Guarantor of such Swap Counterparty from time to time to honor all of such Supported Guarantor s obligations under any
Guaranty in respect of Swap Obligations of such Swap Counterparty (but, in each case, only up to the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering such party s obligations hereunder voidable under applicable law
relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The obligations and undertakings of a Qualified Keepwell Provider with respect to any Swap Counterparty under this paragraph shall remain in full force and
effect until all Swap Obligations of such Swap Counterparty in respect of which a Supported Guarantor has provided a Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full. The parties intend this provision to constitute, and this provision
shall be deemed to constitute, a guarantee of the obligations of, and a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit of, each Supported Guarantor for all purposes of the CEA.

 ECP means an eligible contract participant as defined in the CEA and regulations thereunder. 
 Eligibility Date means, with respect to a Guarantor and a Swap, the date on which a Guaranty becomes effective with respect to such Swap.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Eligibility Date shall be the date of the execution of a Swap if the corresponding Guaranty is then in effect, and otherwise it shall be the date of execution and delivery of such Guaranty unless the Guaranty
specifies a subsequent effective date. Guarantor means any person or entity issuing or providing a Guaranty. 
 Guaranty means a guaranty or assumption of liability as surety with respect to obligations of one or more Swap Counterparties. 
 Qualified Keepwell Provider means with respect to a Swap Counterparty, each person specified as such in this Writing, and if no such
persons are specified, each Guarantor in respect of Swap Obligations of such Swap Counterparty that is, as of the Eligibility Date, (i) a corporation, partnership, proprietorship, organization, trust, or other entity other than a commodity
pool as defined in Section 1a(10) of the CEA and CFTC regulations thereunder that has total assets exceeding 10,000,000 or (ii) an ECP that can cause another person to qualify as an ECP on the Eligibility Date under Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II)
of the CEA by entering into a keepwell. Supported Guarantor means with respect to a Swap Counterparty, each person specified as such
in this Writing, and if no such persons are specified, each Guarantor in respect of Swap Obligations of such Swap Counterparty that is, as of the Eligibility Date, (i) a corporation, partnership, proprietorship, organization, trust or other entity
other than a commodity pool as defined in Section 1a(10) of the CEA and CFTC regulations thereunder that would not be an ECP on the Eligibility Date but for the effect of these Keepwell Terms or (ii) a person that the CFTC has determined
is eligible to qualify as an ECP under Section 1a(18) of the CEA by virtue of being a beneficiary of a keepwell and that would not qualify as an ECP but for the effect of these Keepwell Terms. 
 Swap means any swap as defined in Section 1a(47) of the CEA and regulations thereunder other than (i) a swap entered into on,
or subject to the rules of, a DCM, or (ii) a commodity option entered into pursuant to CFTC Regulation 32.3(a). Swap Counterparty 
means any party hereto who is party to a Swap with one or more Swap Providers, whether at inception, by novation, or otherwise, including any successors to such party. 
 Swap Obligation means any obligation to pay or perform under any agreement, contract or transaction that constitutes a Swap between a Swap
Counterparty and a Swap Provider of such Swap Counterparty. 
 207 

Swap Provider with respect to a Swap Counterparty, means the person or persons specified as
such in this Writing, and if no such persons are specified, each person who is the counterparty to a Swap with such Swap Counterparty hereunder, whether at inception, by novation, or otherwise, including any successors to such party.
