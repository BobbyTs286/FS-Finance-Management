BUSINESS. As used in this Annual Report, we, us, our, LFC, Company or our Company refers to Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc. History We were incorporated in Nevada on November 29, 2006 under the name Sparking Events, Inc., and on September 16, 2013 our corporate name was changed to Cala Energy Corp., (formally, Xodtec LED, Inc.) under which we were engaged in the business of offering services, such as enhanced oil recovery and material supplies, to gas and oil fields predominantly located in Southeast Asia. We were not successful in our efforts and discontinued this line of business. On March 31, 2015, the Company, pursuant to share exchange agreement (the "Share Exchange Agreement"), among the Company, Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc. LFC ), and the holders of all of the outstanding common stock and convertible notes of LFC exchanged their common stock and convertible notes of LFC for a total of 16,750,000 shares of common stock, which represented 84.70 of the Company's common stock after giving effect to the issuance of the shares pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement and the shares of common stock issued in the private placement described in the following paragraph. The issuance of the 16,750,000 shares of common stock to the former holders of LFC's common stock and convertible notes in exchange for the capital stock of LFC is referred to as the reverse acquisition transaction. The sole director and chief executive officer of LFC became a director and the chief executive officer of the Company. As a result of the reverse acquisition, the Company's business has become the business of LFC. As a result of the reverse acquisition with LFC, we ceased to be a shell company on March 31, 2015. Effective as of April 1, 2015, we changed our name to Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc. a name which more accurately represents our new business. We effected the name change by virtue of a short form merger, pursuant to which LFC (our wholly owned subsidiary after the LFC Acquisition) merged with and into the Company, with the Company remaining as the surviving parent corporation. In connection with the name change, we submitted to FINRA a voluntary request for the change of our OTC trading symbol. Our Common Stock now trades under the symbol BOTY . As a result of, and in connection with, the reverse acquisition, the Company changed its fiscal year to December 31, which was LFC s fiscal year, from a fiscal year ending February 28. On April 20, 2015, the Company effected a one-for-800 reverse split, pursuant to which each share of common stock was converted into, and became 1/800 of a share of common stock, with fractional shares being rounded up to the next higher whole number of shares. As a result of the reverse split, the 339,757,357 shares of common stock, then outstanding, became and were converted into 424,977 shares. All references to shares of common stock and per share information retroactively reflect the reverse split. On September 14, 2016, Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (the Company filed an amendment to its articles of incorporation (the Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, which, among other things, established the designation, powers, rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions of the Series A Preferred Stock, 0.001 par value per share (the Series A Preferred Stock ). Among other provisions, each one (1) share of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have voting rights equal to (x) 0.019607 multiplied by the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company eligible to vote at the time of the respective vote (the Numerator ), divided by (y) 0.49, minus (z) the Numerator. For purposes of illustration only, if the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company eligible to vote at the time of the respective vote is 5,000,000, the voting rights of one share of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be equal to 102,036 (0.019607 x 5,000,000) / 0.49) (0.019607 x 5,000,000) = 102,036). Fifty-one (51) shares of Series A Preferred Stock were authorized and fifty-one (51) shares of Series A Preferred Stock were issued to Shaun Donnelly, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company. On November 22, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation (the Amendment with the Secretary of State of Nevada to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, par value 0.001 per share, from four hundred million (400,000,000) shares to one billion (1,000,000,000) shares. A true and correct copy of the Amendment is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this report. 4 Table of Contents On January 23, 2017, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation (the Amendment with the Secretary of State of Nevada to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, par value 0.001 per share, from one billion (1,000,000,000) shares to one billion two hundred million (1,200,000,000) shares. The Company did not timely comply with the requirements of Regulation 14C under the Exchange Act for the above referenced increases in the Company s authorized common shares. This would have required us to circulate an information statement describing the corporate actions taken above by the written consent of a majority of our shareholders at least 20 days prior to the effective date of the corporate action. We did however have super majority shareholder consent as required for amending the articles of incorporation. The failure to initially comply with Regulation 14C in a timely manner was inadvertent, and while not probable, could cause the SEC to bring an enforcement action or commence litigation against us for failure to comply with Regulation 14C. Such enforcement could subject us to penalties including the payment of fines or damages. Any such claims or actions could cause us to expend financial resources to defend ourselves, and could divert the attention of our management from our core business. On November 2, 2017, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation (the Amendment with the Secretary of State of Nevada to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, par value 0.001 per share, from one billion two hundred million (1,200,000,000) shares to five billion (5,000,000,000) shares. A true and correct copy of the Amendment is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this report. Our Business Our LFC business and brand is focused on building and establishing a sports entertainment league that utilizes wrestling and mixed martial arts MMA fighting techniques for purposes of providing entertainment. We seek to promote and market our brand, our programming, our events and our products. Our mission is to establish the popularity of our LFC league and brand based on holding live events and to promote our athletes via a reality series and merchandise such a t-shirts and calendars. Our uniqueness is derived from our predominantly all female league structure, where a vast array of beautiful, attractive and unique women engage in wrestling and MMA fighting techniques against one another for purposes of delivering high quality entertainment to mature audiences. Our management believes that the LFC league and our unique approach in applying a predominantly all female league structure to wrestling and mixed martial arts gives us a substantial competitive advantage to build the popularity of the LFC league in general. Our Events Our operations seek to be organized around the development, promotion and distribution of our live events and televised entertainment programming. We also seek to develop branding and merchandising avenues for revenues. Live Events Our live events are a unique mix of MMA and professional wrestling performed before a live audience and recorded and edited by our in-house production team. To date, we have hosted 13 live events across the U.S. and Europe as well as more than 80 episodes of a reality series which are normally 30 minutes each. Our brand is growing on social media where our content has been viewed by more than 50 million people. Video Programming We are an independent producer of video programming for digital home video and intend to develop such video programming for broadcast television, cable television, pay-per-view and video-on-demand markets. We produce scripted style fights featuring attractive and athletic females of the LFC league clothed in lingerie. Our featured episodes, called the Lingerie Fighting Championships, include live action content stylized and modeled in the format of a reality television series. 5 Table of Contents Television Programming; Pay-Per View Programming We will produce and own our television programming and video library and believe that pay-per-view and video-on- demand television distribution presents opportunities to generate revenue for our business. In an effort to build our LFC brand, we plan to distribute our live event programming through pay-per-view and video-on-demand television outlets in the future. Home Video We expect to pursue opportunities in the home video market by licensing, on a distribution fee and/or royalty basis our growing video library to third parties to develop, produce, manufacture, and sell DVDs for the home video market. We hope to develop a video library with proprietary material from our live events, television broadcasts, special events and behind the scenes content of live events. To date, we have developed and produced an LFC DVD entitled Lingerie Fighting Championships: Lace vs Leather which is currently being sold on the LFC official website (www.lingeriefc.com) as well as Amazon.com. It is intended that we will continue to produce develop our video programming to be sold in DVD volume installments in retail stores and on-line via such e-commerce platforms such as the LFC official site (www.lingeriefc.com) and other third party retailers including, but not limited to, Amazon and iTunes . We are currently in discussion with various other retailers specializing in home video distribution. All references herein to Amazon , iTunes , YouTube or Facebook are to websites operated by such entities and we do not have any rights, affiliation or license with them other than the presence of our media or products on such media platforms as set forth herein. Online Programming We utilize the Internet to communicate with our fans and market and distribute our various programming. Through our network of websites and social media, our fans and customers can obtain the latest news and information on the LFC, purchase our live event tickets, home video programming, and purchase our branded merchandise. Our main site is www.lingeriefc.com. Branded Merchandise Licensing and Direct Sales. We believe that licensing of LFC names, logos and copyrighted works on a variety of retail products presents a further opportunity to generate revenues. As our brand grows, we expect to pursue greater opportunities to expand our licensing efforts through a more comprehensive licensing program. Competition Competition for Viewers . The entertainment market in which we operate has a limited fan base and is highly competitive. We must compete for the time and attention of viewers with more established content programming and entertainment value. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of experience, relevance, accessibility, perceptions of ad load, brand awareness and reputation. List of Competitors . Our events, we anticipate, caters to a niche audience. Our audience, we anticipate, will consist primarily of a mature audience with an appreciation of MMA and contact sports and professional wrestling. We compete with athletic events as well as mature audience entertainment. While we do pride our business model on having an athletic appeal, we do not deem ourselves as a conventional full contact sport, and our events are designed as scripted fictional entertainment. For additional details on risks related to competition for listeners, please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors. 6 Table of Contents Our competitors include among others: Sports Entertainment Providers. We compete on a national basis primarily with World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., and its subsidiaries (collectively, the WWE and Zuffa, LLC, the American sports promotion company specializing in mixed martial arts and parent company of the Ultimate Fighting Championship league (collectively, the UFC ). We will have to compete with WWE and the UFC in many aspects of our business, including viewership, application of mixed martial arts, access to arenas, the sale and licensing of branded merchandise and distribution channels for our televised programs. We also directly compete to find, hire and retain talented performers. WWE and UFC has substantially greater financial resources than we do, and already has an established fan base and following, and are affiliated with television cable networks on which WWE s and UFC s programs are aired. Other sources of competition in our sports entertainment market are regional promoters of wrestling events. Television Network Scheduling . Conventional sports channels may not accept us or may limit us to less popular time slots. Because we are not a conventional sports league, and due to the mature target audience for our events, mainstream sporting channels may not accept us or may limit our events to mid-day, late night or "half time" type channel slots, as opposed to prime-time televised scheduling. Other Forms of Media . We compete for the time and attention of our listeners with providers of other forms of in- home and mobile entertainment. We rely on having a modest but growing YouTube following. To the extent existing or potential viewers choose to watch cable television, stream video from on-demand services such as Netflix, Hulu, VEVO or YouTube or play interactive video games on their home-entertainment system, computer or mobile phone rather than view our LFC programming or attend our live events, these content services pose a competitive threat. Government Regulation Live Events . In various states in the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, athletic commissions and other applicable regulatory agencies require fighting leagues to obtain licenses for promoters, medical clearances and/or other permits or licenses for performers and/or permits for events in order for us to promote and conduct live events. Since we are scripted and not a full contact competitive sport, we are not subject to such regulation. If rules change or if our business structure changes or if we are perceived as being an athletic full contact sport, we could become subject to such regulation. In the event that we fail to comply with the regulations of a particular jurisdiction, we may be prohibited from promoting and conducting our live events in that jurisdiction. The inability to present our live events over an extended period of time or in a number of jurisdictions could lead to a decline in the various revenue streams generated from our live events, which could adversely affect our operating results. Television Programming . The production of television programming by independent producers is not directly regulated by the federal or state governments, but the marketplace for television programming in the United States and internationally is substantially affected by government regulations applicable to, as well as social and political influences on, television stations, television networks and cable and satellite television systems and channels. We voluntarily designate the suitability of each of our television shows using standard industry ratings. Changes in governmental policy and private- sector perceptions could further restrict our program content and adversely affect our levels of viewership and operating results. Online Programming . The Company intends to conduct business on the internet and will be subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy, among other things. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In the area of information security and data protection, the laws in several states require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of information. Likewise, all but a few states have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their information. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities. Intellectual Property Trademarks and Copyrights . We believe that intellectual property and merchandising will be material to our business and we will expend cost and effort in an attempt to develop and protect our intellectual property and to maintain compliance vis- -vis other parties' intellectual property. A principal focus of our efforts is to protect the intellectual property relating to our originally created characters portrayed by our performers, which encompasses images, likenesses, names and other identifying indicia of these characters. We have registered the domain name www.lingeriefc.com as our website. We currently do not have any registered trademarks. We may, however, seek to register or assert common law rights with respect to the names, terms, slogans, titles and event names we have been using to date. 7 Table of Contents We anticipate some revenues from branding merchandise, apparel, and particularly lingerie and swimwear using both our and other licensed brands. To accomplish this, we will have to rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, contractual restrictions, technological measures and other methods. Further, we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights by, among other things, searching the internet to ascertain unauthorized use of our intellectual property, seizing goods that feature unauthorized use of our intellectual property and seeking restraining orders and/or damages in court against individuals or entities infringing our intellectual property rights. Our failure to curtail piracy, infringement or other unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights effectively, or our infringement of others' intellectual property rights, could adversely affect our operating results. We may be the subject of trademark and copyright infringements suits from other companies that seek to protect their names or marks on the basis of similarity or dilution, and no assurance can be made that we will be able to defend such actions. Employees The Company has one employee, Shaun Donnelly, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Cast and crew are hired on a contract basis for each live event.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

However, from time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. On August 24, 2018, Mr. Jeffrey Stone, a former consultant of the Company, filed suit against the Company and our CEO, Mr. Shaun Donnelly, in New York County Civil Court alleging that the Company failed to provide some of the promised shares of common stock as compensation for services rendered pursuant to an agreement whereby Mr. Stone was to provide investor relations services to the Company.

For a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from results discussed in the forward-looking statements, see "Forward Looking Statements." Overview LFC is a media company focused on the development, production, promotion and distribution of original entertainment which we plan to make commercially available predominantly through live entertainment events, as well as through digital home video, broadcast television networks, video-on-demand and digital media channels. As a result, we have ceased to be a shell company. Effective as of April 1, 2015, we changed our name to "Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc.," (by virtue of the short form merger with our new LFC subsidiary) to reflect our new business focus. Results of Operations Year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the Year ended December 31, 2019 Our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and the changes between those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, Changes Statement of Operations Data: 2020 2019 Amount Revenue 27,776 27,376 400 1 Cost of Services (27,652 (38,819 11,167 - Total operating expenses (233,052 (210,437 (22,615 11 Other expense (2,173,096 (2,079,663 (93,433 4 Net loss (2,406,024 (2,301,543 (104,481 5 10 Table of Contents Revenues We generated revenues of 27,776 and 27,376 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company s revenue derives from the development, promotion and distribution of our live events and televised entertainment programming. Cost of Services We incurred total cost of services of 27,652 and 38,819 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The cost of services incurred consist of labor, material, equipment and subcontractor expenses. Operating Expenses We incurred total operating expenses of 233,052 and 210,437 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the increase in professional fees and travel expense. Other Income (Expenses) We incurred total other expense of 2,173,096 and 2,079,663 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in other expense was mainly attributed to 1,922,876 loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities from the convertible notes and warrants during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to loss on change in fair value of derivative liabilities of 1,842,035 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Net Income (Loss) We incurred net loss of 2,406,024 and 2,301,543 during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in our net loss was mainly attributed to the increase in operating expenses and other expense during the year ended December 31, 2020.

The Company intends to fund future operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending December 31, 2020. 11 Table of Contents The ability of the Company to realize its business plan is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of its business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The following table sets forth certain information about our cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019: Year Ended December 31, Changes Cash Flows Data: 2020 2019 Amount Cash Flows used in Operating Activities (78,915 (164,732 85,817 (52 Cash Flows provided by Financing Activities 39,350 205,000 (165,650 (81 Net increase (decrease) in cash during period (39,565 40,268 (79,833 (198 Cash Flows from Operating Activities We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was 205,000 consists of proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes of 203,250 and advancement from related party of 1,750. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2020, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 12 Table of Contents Significant Accounting Estimates and Policies The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products and services in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue Recognition following the five steps procedure: Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with customers Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract Step 3: Determine the transaction price Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations Step 5: Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation Convertible Instruments and Derivatives The Company evaluates and account for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging Activities. Fair Value Measurement The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amounts of our short and long term credit obligations approximate fair value because the effective yields on these obligations, which include contractual interest rates taken together with other features such as concurrent issuances of warrants and/or embedded conversion options, are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar credit risk. ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable Level 3 inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions) The derivative liability in connection with the conversion feature of the convertible debt, classified as a level 3 liability, is the only financial liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 13 Table of Contents Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740 Income Taxes . Pursuant to ASC 740 deferred income taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The provision for income taxes represents the tax expense for the period, if any, and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. ASC 740 also provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. Under ASC 740, the impact of an uncertain tax position on the income tax return may only be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. Recent accounting pronouncements In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options . The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and, (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on its financial statements. In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This guidance will be effective for entities for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. For the Company, the new standard was effective on January 1, 2021 and we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements. ITEM 7A.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company s significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ BF Borgers CPA PC BF Borgers CPA PC We have served as the Company's auditor since 2018 Lakewood, CO June 3, 2021 F-2 Table of Contents LINGERIE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIPS, INC.

(the Company is a Nevada corporation incorporated on November 29, 2006 under the name Sparking Events, Inc. The Company s corporate name was changed to Xodtec Group USA, Inc. in June 2009, Xodtec LED, Inc. in May 2010, Cala Energy Corp. in September 2013 and Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc. on April 1, 2015. The Company focuses on developing, producing, promoting, and distributing entertainment through live entertainment events, digital home videos, broadcast television networks, video on demand, and digital media channels in the United States. It offers wrestling and mixed martial arts fights featuring women under the LFC brand name. NOTE 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company continually evaluates its estimates and judgments. The Company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even for estimates and judgments that are not deemed critical. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had 4,142 and 43,707 in cash and cash equivalents as at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products and services in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue Recognition following the five steps procedure: Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with customers Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract Step 3: Determine the transaction price Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations Step 5: Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation The Company s revenue derives from the development, promotion and distribution of our live events and televised entertainment programming. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized revenue of 27,776 and 27,376 and cost of sales of 27,652 and 38,819, resulting in gross profit of 124 and gross loss of 11,443, respectively. F-7 Table of Contents Earnings (Loss) per Share The Company computes basic and diluted net loss per share amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if convertible notes to issue common stock were converted resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the loss of the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, convertible notes and warrants were dilutive instruments and were not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share as their effect would be antidilutive. December 31, December 31, 2020 2019 (Shares) (Shares) Convertible notes payable 10,031,194,872 30,046,590,267 Warrants 5,438,166,666 969,833,333 15,469,361,538 31,016,423,600 Related Party Balances and Transactions The Company follows FASB ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures , for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transaction. (See Note 8) Beneficial Conversion Feature of Convertible Debt The Company accounts for convertible debt in accordance with the guidelines established by FASB ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options . The Beneficial Conversion Feature BCF of convertible debt is normally characterized as the convertible portion or feature of certain debt that provide a rate of conversion that is below market value or in-the-money when issued. The Company records a BCF related to the issuance of convertible debt when issued, and also records the estimated fair value. Beneficial Conversion Features that are contingent upon the occurrence of a future event are recorded when the event is resolved. Convertible Instruments and Derivatives The Company evaluates and account for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging Activities. Share-Based Compensation The Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Employee awards are accounted for under ASC 718 - where the awards are valued at grant date. Awards given to nonemployees are accounted for under ASC 505 where the awards are valued at earlier of commitment date or completion of services. Compensation cost for employee awards is recognized over the vesting or requisite service period. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of options or warrants granted. Fair Value Measurement The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amounts of our short and long term credit obligations approximate fair value because the effective yields on these obligations, which include contractual interest rates taken together with other features such as concurrent issuances of warrants and/or embedded conversion options, are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar credit risk. F-8 Table of Contents ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable Level 3 inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions) The derivative liability in connection with the conversion feature of the convertible debt, classified as a level 3 liability, is the only financial liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis. (See Note 7) The following table summarizes fair value measurement by level at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, measured at fair value on a recurring basis: December 31, 2020 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets None - - - - Liabilities Derivative liabilities - - 4,610,130 4,610,130 December 31, 2019 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets None - - - - Liabilities Derivative liabilities - - 3,068,168 3,068,168 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options . The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and, (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on its financial statements. In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This guidance will be effective for entities for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. For the Company, the new standard was effective on January 1, 2021 and we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements. Management has considered all other recent accounting pronouncements issued. The Company s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. F-9 Table of Contents NOTE 3 GOING CONCERN The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has generated nominal revenues since inception, has sustained losses since its organization and requires funding to generate revenue. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

F-20 Table of Contents NOTE 10 RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES In early 2020, the World Health Organization declared the rapidly spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic. This pandemic has resulted in governments worldwide enacting emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus. The Company considered the impact of COVID-19 on the assumptions and estimates used and determined that there were no retroactive material adverse impacts on the Company s results of operations and financial position at December 31, 2020. The full extent of the future impacts of COVID-19 on the Company s operations is uncertain. A prolonged outbreak could have a material adverse impact on financial results and business operations of the Company in the future. The Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of its assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. NOTE 11 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Subsequent to December 31, 2020 and through the date that these financials were made available, the Company had the following subsequent events: Conversion of convertible notes and accrued interest to common stock The Company issued 239,246,512 shares of common stock for conversion of convertible note principal amount of 3,746 and accrued interest of 5,824. Exercise of warrants to common stock The Company issued 195,483,870 shares of common stock from the exercise of 207,034,884 units of common stock purchase warrants. Issuance of senior secured promissory note On March 4, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Auctus Fund, LLC to issue a senior secured promissory note of 300,000 to the unrelated party, which bears interest at 12 of the principal amount.

There are no reportable events under this item for the year ended December 31, 2020. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures In connection with the preparation and filing of this Annual Report, we completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. This evaluation was conducted pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the framework set forth in the report Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013), or COSO (2013). Based on the evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2020 due to the material weaknesses noted below in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees in the normal course of their work. b) Management's Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting As evidenced by the material weaknesses described below, we determined that entity-level controls related to the control environment did not operate effectively resulting in material weaknesses in such COSO (2013) component. The deficiencies in control environment each represent a separate material weakness. These material weaknesses contributed to an environment where there is a more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the interim and annual financial statements could occur and not be prevented or detected. During our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, management identified material weaknesses related to (i) the lack of any accounting personnel (ii) the lack of internal audit functions, (iii) the lack of segregation of duties, and (iv) the lack of proper internal control procedures and documentation. As of December 31, 2020, we had one executive, our chief executive and financial officer. As a result there was no segregation of duties. A material weakness (within the meaning of PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting. Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this annual report. Because of the material weaknesses described above, management believes that, as of December 31, 2020, we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting based on the COSO (2013) criteria. Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our Company s financial results. c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. As defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, there were no changes that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

The following table sets forth, as of May 28, 2021, certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock by each shareholder known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our Common Stock and by each of our current directors and executive officers. Each person has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares of Common Stock, except as otherwise indicated. Under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the security, or investment power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the security. The person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities, and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which he or she may not have any pecuniary beneficial interest. Shares of Common Stock which an individual or group has a right to acquire within 60 days pursuant to the exercise or conversion of options are deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of such individual or group, but are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person shown in the table below. Name of Beneficial Owner (1) Shares of Series A Preferred (3) Percent of Series A Preferred (2) Shares of Common Stock Percent of Common Stock (2) Shaun Donnelly 51 100 9,350,000 0.354 Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer All officers and directors as a group (1 person) 51 100 9,350,000 0.354 Name of beneficial owner (5 18 Table of Contents None (1) Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with Rule 13D-3(a) of the Exchange Act and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities.

Director Independence Since our common stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange, we have used the definition of independence of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an independent director is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship that, in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if: 19 Table of Contents the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the company; the director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of 120,000 during any period of 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including, among other things, compensation for board or board committee service); a family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer of the company; the director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling stockholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5 of the recipient s consolidated gross revenue for that year or 200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions); the director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three years, any of the executive officers of the company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or The director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the company s outside auditor, or at any time during the past three years was a partner or employee of the company s outside auditor, and who worked on the company s audit. Based upon the above criteria, we have no independent directors. ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES.
