 BUSINESS. 

GENERAL 

 RadioShack
 Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1967. We primarily engage in the
 retail sale of consumer electronics goods and services through our RadioShack
 store chain and non-RadioShack branded kiosk operations. Our strategy is to
 provide cost-effective solutions to meet the routine electronics needs and
 distinct electronics wants of our customers. Throughout
 this
 report, the terms our, we, us and RadioShack refer to RadioShack
 Corporation, including its subsidiaries. 

Our
 day-to-day
 focus is concentrated in four major areas: 

Provide
 our
 customers a positive in-store
 experience 

Grow
 gross
 profit dollars by increasing the overall value of each
 ticket 

Reduce
 costs
 continually throughout the
 organization 

Allocate
 the
 dollars generated from operations appropriately, investing only in
 projects that have an adequate return or are operationally
 necessary 

Additional
 information regarding our business segments is presented below and in
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
 Operations MD A elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 For
 information regarding the net sales and operating revenues and operating income
 for each of our business segments for fiscal years ended December 31, 2006,
 2005
 and 2004, please see Note 27 - Segment Reporting in the Notes to Consolidated
 Financial Statements. 

RADIOSHACK
 COMPANY-OPERATED STORES 

 At
 December 31, 2006, we operated 4,467 company-operated stores under the
 RadioShack brand, located throughout the United States, as well as in Puerto
 Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These stores are located in major shopping
 malls and strip centers, as well as individual storefronts. Each location
 carries a broad assortment of both private label and third-party branded
 consumer electronics products. Our product lines include wireless telephones
 and
 communication devices such as scanners and two-way radios; flat panel
 televisions, residential telephones, DVD players, computers and direct-to-home
 DTH satellite systems; home entertainment, wireless, imaging and computer
 accessories; general and special purpose batteries; wire, cable and connectivity
 products; and digital cameras, radio-controlled cars and other toys, satellite
 radios and memory players. We also provide consumers access to third-party
 services such as wireless telephone and DTH satellite activation, satellite
 radio service, prepaid wireless airtime and extended service plans.

KIOSKS 

 At
 December 31, 2006, we operated 772 kiosks located throughout the United States.
 These kiosks are primarily inside SAM S CLUB locations, as well as stand-alone
 Sprint Nextel kiosks in major shopping malls. These locations, which are not
 RadioShack-branded, offer primarily wireless handsets, their associated
 accessories, and DTH satellite systems. We also provide consumers access to
 third-party wireless telephone services. 

OTHER 

 In
 addition to the reportable segments discussed above, we have other sales
 channels and support operations, described in more detail below. 

Dealer
 Outlets: 
 At December 31,
 2006, we had a network of 1,587 RadioShack dealer outlets, including 36 located
 outside of North America and 14 in Canada. These outlets provide private label
 and third-party branded products and services to smaller communities. These
 independent dealers are often engaged in other retail operations and augment
 their businesses with our products and service offerings. Our dealer sales
 derived outside of the United States are not material. 

RadioShack.com: 
 Products and
 information are available through our commercial Web site www.radioshack.com .
 Online customers
 can purchase, return or exchange various products available through this Web
 site. Additionally, certain products ordered online may be picked up, exchanged
 or returned at neighborhood RadioShack locations. 

RadioShack
 Service Centers:
 We
 maintain a
 service and support network to service the consumer electronics and personal
 computer retail industry in the U.S. We are a vendor-authorized service provider
 for many top tier manufacturers, such as Hewlett-Packard, LG Electronics,
 Motorola, Nokia, RCA/Thomson, and Sony, among others. In addition, we perform
 repairs for third-party extended service plan providers. At December 31, 2006,
 we had seven RadioShack service centers in the U.S. and one in Puerto Rico
 that
 repair certain name-brand and private label products sold through our various
 sales channels. 

International
 Operations: At
 December 31,
 2006, we had 9 company-operated stores located in major shopping malls and
 strip
 centers and 14 dealer outlets in Canada. As of January 31, 2007, we had closed
 all of our locations in Canada. Additionally, as of December 31, 2006, there
 were 146 RadioShack-branded stores and 25 dealers in Mexico. These
 RadioShack-branded stores and dealer outlets are overseen by a joint
 venture in which we are a minority owner with Grupo Gigante, S.A. de C.V.
 Our
 revenues from foreign customers are not material, and we do not have a material
 amount of long-lived assets located outside of the United States. We do not
 consolidate the operations of the Mexican joint venture in our consolidated
 financial statements. 

Support
 Operations: 

 Our
 retail stores,
 along with our kiosks and dealer outlets, are supported by an established
 infrastructure. Below are the major components of this support
 structure. 

Distribution
 Centers -
 At December 31,
 2006, we had six distribution centers shipping over one million cartons each
 month, on average, to our retail stores and dealer outlets. One of these
 distribution centers also serves as a fulfillment center for our online
 customers. 

RadioShack
 Technology Services RSTS 
 - Our
 management
 information system architecture is composed of a distributed, online network
 of
 computers that links all stores, customer channels, delivery locations, service
 centers, credit providers, distribution facilities and our home office into
 a
 fully integrated system. Each store has its own server to support the
 point-of-sale POS system. The majority of our company-operated stores
 communicate through a broadband network, which provides efficient access to
 customer support data. This design also allows store management to track sales
 and inventory at the product or sales associate level. RSTS provides the
 majority of our programming and systems analysis needs. 

RadioShack
 Global Sourcing RSGS -
 RSGS serves our
 wide-ranging international import/export, sourcing, evaluation, logistics and
 quality control needs. RSGS s activities support our branded and private label
 business. 

RadioShack
 Customer Support -
 Using
 state-of-the-art telephone systems, Web self-help guides and data networks,
 RadioShack Customer Support responds to more than 1.3 million phone calls and
 e-mails annually. The responses include answers to customers unique requests
 for hard-to-find parts, batteries and accessories; customer service inquiries;
 and direct sales requests related to our retail stores. Additionally, in 2006,
 we outsourced calls regarding our service plans and direct sales requests
 related to our Web site. 

Consumer
 Electronics Manufacturing -
 We operate two
 manufacturing facilities in the United States and one overseas manufacturing
 operation in China. These three manufacturing facilities employed approximately
 1,600 employees as of December 31, 2006. We manufacture a variety of products,
 primarily sold through our retail outlets, including telephony, antennas, wire
 and cable products, and a variety of hard-to-find parts and accessories for
 consumer electronics products. 

SEASONALITY 

 As
 with most other specialty retailers, our net sales and operating revenues,
 operating income and cash flows are greater during the winter holiday season
 than during other periods of the year. There is a corresponding pre-seasonal
 inventory build-up, which requires working capital related to the anticipated
 increased sales volume. This is described in Cash Flow and Liquidity under
 MD A. Also, refer to Note 26 - Quarterly Data (Unaudited) in the Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements for our quarterly data, which shows
 seasonality trends. We expect this seasonality to continue. 

PATENTS
 AND
 TRADEMARKS 

 We
 own or are licensed to use many trademarks and service marks related to our
 RadioShack stores in the United States and in foreign countries. We believe
 the
 RadioShack name and marks are well recognized by consumers and that the name
 and
 marks are associated with high-quality products and services. We also believe
 the loss of the RadioShack name and RadioShack marks would have a material
 adverse impact on our business. Our private label manufactured products are
 sold
 primarily under the RadioShack trademark and under the Accurian or Gigaware
 trademark. We also own various patents and patent applications relating to
 consumer electronic products. 

We
 do not own any material patents or trademarks associated with our kiosk
 operations. 

SUPPLIERS
 AND BRANDED RELATIONSHIPS 

 Our
 business
 strategy depends, in part, upon our ability to offer private label and
 third-party branded products, as well as to provide our customers access to
 third-party services. We utilize a large number of suppliers located in various
 parts of the world to obtain raw materials and private label merchandise. We
 do
 not expect a lack of availability of raw materials or any single private label
 product to have a material impact on our operations overall or on any of our
 operating segments. W e
 have formed
 vendor and third-party service provider relationships with well-recognized
 companies such as Sprint Nextel, AT T, Apple Computer, EchoStar Satellite
 Corporation (DISH Network), Hewlett-Packard Company and Sirius Satellite Radio.
 In the aggregate, these relationships have or are expected to have a significant
 impact on both our operations and financial strategy. C ertain
 of these
 relationships are important to our business; the loss of or disruption in supply
 from these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our net sales
 and operating revenues until new relationships are formed. Additionally, we
 have
 been limited from time to time by various vendors and suppliers strictly on
 an
 economic basis where demand has exceeded supply. 

ORDER
 BACKLOG 

 We
 have no material backlog of orders in any of our operating segments for the
 products or services that we sell. 

COMPETITION 

 Due
 to consumer
 demand for wireless products and services, as well as rapid consumer acceptance
 of new digital technology products, the consumer electronics retail business
 continues to be highly competitive, primarily driven by technology and product
 cycles. 

In
 the consumer electronics retailing business, competitive factors include price,
 product availability, quality and features, consumer services, manufacturing
 and
 distribution capability, brand reputation and the number of competitors. We
 compete in the sale of our products and services with several retail formats,
 including consumer electronics retailers such as Circuit City and Best Buy.
 Department and specialty retail stores, such as Sears and The Home Depot,
 compete on a more select product category scale. AT T, Sprint Nextel, and
 other wireless providers compete directly with us in the wireless telephone
 category through their own retail and online presence. Mass merchandisers such
 as Wal-Mart and Target, and other alternative channels of distribution such
 as
 mail order and e-commerce retailers, compete with us on a more widespread basis.
 Numerous domestic and foreign companies also manufacture products similar to
 ours for other retailers, which are sold under nationally-recognized brand
 names
 or private labels. 

Management
 believes
 we have two primary factors differentiating us from our competition. First,
 we
 have an extensive physical retail presence with convenient locations throughout
 the United States. Second, our specially trained sales staff is capable of
 providing cost-effective solutions for our customers routine electronics needs
 and distinct electronics wants, assisting with the selection of appropriate
 products and accessories and, when applicable, assisting customers with service
 activation. 

While
 we believe we
 have an effective business strategy, we cannot give assurance that we will
 continue to compete successfully in the future, given the highly competitive
 nature of the consumer electronics retail business. Also, in light of the
 ever-changing nature of the consumer electronics retail industry, we would
 be
 adversely affected if our competitors were able to offer their products at
 significantly lower prices. Additionally, we would be adversely affected if
 our
 competitors were able to introduce innovative or technologically superior
 products not yet available to us, or if we were unable to obtain certain
 products in a timely manner or for an extended period of time. Furthermore,
 our
 business would be adversely affected if we failed to offer value-added solutions
 or if our competitors were to enhance their ability to provide these value-added
 solutions. 

EMPLOYEES 

 As
 of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 40,000 employees, including temporary
 seasonal employees. Approximately 3,000 temporary employees, hired for the
 holiday selling season, remained at year end. Our employees are not covered
 by
 collective bargaining agreements, nor are they members of labor unions. We
 consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

ITEM
 1A.
 RISK FACTORS. 

One
 should
 carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties described below, as
 well as other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There
 may be additional risks that are not presently material or known, and the
 following list should not be construed as an exhaustive list of all factors
 that
 could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in
 forward-looking statements made by us. 

We
 may be
 unable to successfully execute our strategy to provide cost-effective solutions
 to meet the routine electronics needs and distinct electronics wants of our
 customers. 

To
 achieve our strategy, we have undertaken a variety of strategic initiatives.
 Our
 failure to successfully execute our strategy or the occurrence of any of the
 following events could have a material adverse effect on our
 business: 

Our
 inability
 to keep our extensive store distribution system updated and conveniently
 located near our target customers 

Our
 employees inability to provide solutions, answers, and information
 related to increasingly complex consumer electronics
 products 

Our
 inability
 to recognize evolving consumer electronics trends and offer products
 that
 customers need and want 

Our
 inability to increase or maintain profitability in both our wireless and
 non-wireless platforms could adversely affect our results. 

A
 critical component of our business strategy is to improve our overall
 profitability. Our ability to increase profitable sales in existing stores
 may
 also be affected by: 

Our
 success
 in attracting customers into our
 stores 

Our
 ability
 to choose the correct mix of products to
 sell 

Our
 ability
 to keep stores stocked with merchandise customers will
 purchase 

Our
 ability
 to maintain fully-staffed stores and trained
 employees 

Any
 reductions or changes in the growth rate of the wireless industry or changes
 in
 the dynamics of the wireless communications industry could cause a material
 adverse effect on our gross profits and financial results. 

Sales
 of wireless
 handsets and the related commissions and residual income constitute
 approximately one-third of our total revenue. Consequently, changes in the
 wireless industry, such as the ones discussed below, could have a material
 adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Lack
 of growth in
 the overall wireless industry tends to have a corresponding effect on our
 wireless sales. Because growth in the wireless industry is often driven by
 the
 adoption rate of new wireless handset technologies, the absence of these new
 technologies, or the lack of consumer interest in adopting these new
 technologies, could lead to slower growth or a decline in wireless industry
 profitability, as well as in our overall profitability. 

Another
 change in
 the wireless industry that could materially and adversely affect our
 profitability is wireless industry consolidation. Consolidation in the wireless
 industry could lead to a concentration of competitive strength, particularly
 competition from wireless carriers retail stores, and could, therefore,
 adversely affect our business as competitive levels increase. 

We
 may not
 be able to maintain our historical gross margin levels. 

Historically,
 we
 have maintained gross margin levels ranging from 47 to 50 . We may not be
 able
 to maintain these margin levels in the future due to various factors, including
 increased higher sales of lower margin products such as personal electronics
 products and third-party branded products. If sales of these lower margin items
 continue to increase and replace sales of higher margin items, our gross margin
 and overall gross profit levels will be adversely affected. 

Our
 competition is both intense and varied, and our failure to effectively compete
 could adversely affect our financial results. 

In
 the retail consumer electronics marketplace, the level of competition is
 intense. We compete primarily with traditional consumer electronics retail
 stores and, to a lesser extent, with alternative channels of distribution such
 as e-commerce, telephone shopping services and mail order. We also compete
 with
 wireless carriers retail presence, as discussed above. Changes in the amount
 and degree of promotional intensity or merchandising strategy exerted by our
 current competitors and potential new competition could present us with
 difficulties in retaining existing customers, attracting new customers and
 maintaining our profit margins. 

In
 addition, some of our competitors may use strategies such as lower pricing,
 wider selection of products, larger store size, higher advertising intensity,
 improved store design, and more efficient sales methods. While we attempt to
 differentiate ourselves from our competitors by focusing on the electronics
 specialty retail market, our business model may not enable us to compete
 successfully against existing and future competitors. 

Adverse
 changes in national or regional U.S. economic conditions could negatively affect
 our financial results. 

Adverse
 economic
 changes could have a significant negative impact on U.S. consumer spending,
 particularly discretionary spending for consumer electronics products, which,
 in
 turn, could directly affect our overall sales. Consumer confidence, recessionary
 and inflationary trends, equity market levels, consumer credit availability,
 interest rates, consumers disposable income and spending levels, energy prices,
 job growth and unemployment rates may impact the volume of customer traffic
 and
 level of sales in our locations. Negative trends of any of these economic
 conditions, whether national or regional in nature, could adversely affect
 our
 financial results, including our net sales and profitability. 

Our
 inability to effectively manage our inventory levels, particularly excess or
 inadequate amounts of inventory, could adversely affect our financial
 results. 

We
 source inventory both domestically and internationally, and our inventory levels
 are subject to a number of factors beyond our control. These factors, including
 technology advancements, reduced consumer spending and consumer disinterest
 in
 our product offerings, could lead to excess inventory levels. Additionally,
 we
 may not accurately assess appropriate product life cycles or end-of-life
 products, leaving us with excess inventory. To reduce these inventory levels,
 we
 may be required to lower our prices, adversely impacting our margin levels
 and
 our financial results. 

Alternatively,
 we
 may have inadequate inventory levels for particular items, including popular
 selling merchandise, due to factors such as unavailability of products from
 our
 vendors, import delays, labor unrest, untimely deliveries or the disruption
 of
 international, national or regional transportation systems. The occurrence
 of
 any of these factors on our inventory supply could adversely impact our
 financial results. 

Our
 inability to attract, retain and grow an effective management team or changes
 in
 the cost or availability of a suitable workforce to manage and support our
 operating strategies could cause our operating results to suffer.

Our
 success depends
 in large part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a qualified
 management team and employees. Qualified individuals needed to fill necessary
 positions could be in short supply. The inability to recruit and retain such
 individuals could continue to result in high employee turnover at our stores
 and
 in our company overall, which could have a material adverse effect on our
 business and financial results. Additionally, competition for qualified
 employees requires us to continually assess our compensation structure.
 Competition for qualified employees has required, and in the future could
 require, us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of qualified
 employees, resulting in higher labor compensation expense. In addition, proposed
 changes in the federal minimum wage may adversely affect our compensation
 expense. 

Our
 inability to successfully identify and enter into relationships with developers
 of new technologies or the failure of these new technologies to be adopted
 by
 the market could impact our ability to increase or maintain our sales and
 profitability. Additionally, the absence of new services or products and product
 features in the merchandise categories we sell could adversely affect our sales
 and profitability. 

Our
 ability to
 maintain and increase revenues depends, to a large extent, on the periodic
 introduction and availability of new products and technologies. If we fail
 to
 identify these new products and technologies, or if we fail to enter into
 relationships with their developers prior to widespread distribution within
 the
 market, our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected. Furthermore,
 it
 is possible that these new products or technologies will never achieve
 widespread consumer acceptance, also adversely affecting our sales and
 profitability. Finally, the lack of innovative consumer electronics products,
 features or services that can be effectively featured in our store model could
 also impact our ability to increase or maintain our sales and
 profitability. 

Failure
 to
 enter into, maintain and renew profitable relationships with providers of
 third-party branded products could adversely affect our sales and gross
 margins. 

Our
 large selection
 of third-party branded products makes up a significant portion of our overall
 sales. If we are unable to create, maintain or renew our relationships with
 the
 suppliers of these products, our sales and our gross margins could be adversely
 impacted. 

The
 occurrence of severe weather events or natural disasters could significantly
 damage or destroy outlets or prohibit consumers from traveling to our retail
 locations, especially during the peak winter holiday shopping
 season. 

If
 severe weather or a catastrophic natural event, such as a hurricane or
 earthquake, occurs in a particular region and damages or destroys a significant
 number of our stores in that area, our overall sales would be reduced
 accordingly. In addition, if severe weather, such as heavy snowfall or extreme
 temperatures, discourages or restricts customers in a particular region from
 traveling to our stores, our sales would also be adversely affected. If severe
 weather occurs during the fourth quarter holiday season, the adverse impact
 to
 our sales and gross profit could be even greater than at other times during
 the
 year because we generate a significant portion of our sales and gross profit
 during this period. 

We
 have
 contingent lease obligations related to our discontinued retail operations
 that,
 if realized, could materially and adversely affect our financial results.

We
 have contingent liabilities related to retail leases of locations which were
 assigned to other businesses. The majority of these contingent liabilities
 relate to various lease obligations arising from leases assigned to CompUSA,
 Inc. as part of the sale of our Computer City, Inc. subsidiary to CompUSA in
 August 1998. In the event CompUSA or the other assignees, as applicable, are
 unable to fulfill these obligations, we would be responsible for rent due under
 the leases, which could have a material adverse affect on our financial
 results. 

Failure
 to
 comply with, or the additional implementation of, restrictions or regulations
 regarding the products and/or services we sell or changes in tax rules and
 regulations applicable to us, could adversely affect our business and our
 results of operations. 

We
 are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations including,
 but not limited to, the Fair Labor Standards Act and ERISA, each as amended,
 and
 regulations promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service, the United States
 Department of Labor, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and
 the
 Environmental Protection Agency. Failure to properly adhere to these and other
 applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of penalties
 or
 adverse legal judgments and could adversely affect our business and our results
 of operations. Similarly, the cost of complying with newly-implemented laws
 and
 regulations could adversely affect our business and our results of
 operations. 

Any
 potential tariffs imposed on products that we import from China, as well as
 any
 significant strengthening of China s currency against the U.S. dollar, could
 reduce our gross margins and our overall profitability. 

We
 purchase a significant portion of our inventory from manufacturers located
 in
 China. Changes in trade regulations (including tariffs on imports) or the
 continued strengthening of the Chinese currency against the U.S. dollar could
 increase the cost of items we purchase, which in turn could have a material
 adverse effect on our gross margins. 

Failure
 to
 protect the integrity and security of our customers information could expose us
 to litigation, as well as materially damage our standing with our
 customers. 

Increasing
 costs
 associated with information security, including increased investments in
 technology, the costs of compliance with consumer protection laws, and costs
 resulting from consumer fraud could cause our business and results of
 operations to suffer materially. Additionally, if a significant compromise
 in
 the security of our customer information, including personal identification
 data, were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation,
 business, operating results and financial condition, and could increase the
 costs we incur to protect against such security breaches. 

Any
 terrorist activities in the U.S., as well as the international war on terror,
 could adversely affect our results of operations. 

A
 terrorist attack or series of attacks on the United States could have a
 significant adverse impact on the United States economy. This downturn in the
 economy could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our results of
 operations. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and
 international responses to terrorist attacks, and other acts of war or hostility
 could cause greater uncertainty and cause the economy to suffer in ways that
 we
 currently cannot predict.

We
 lease, rather than own, virtually all of our retail facilities. Our stores
 are
 located in major shopping malls, stand-alone buildings and shopping centers
 owned by other entities. We lease one distribution center in the United States
 and five administrative offices and one manufacturing plant in China. We own
 the
 property on which the other five distribution centers and two manufacturing
 facilities are located within the United States. We sold and leased back the
 buildings and certain of the property at our corporate headquarters located
 in
 downtown Fort Worth, Texas. In
 connection with
 this transaction, we entered into a 20-year lease agreement, with four five-year
 options to renew.

 In
 2006 we closed
 505 RadioShack company-operated stores, net of new store openings and
 relocations. This
 decline
 resulted primarily from the implementation of our turnaround program, which
 included the closure of 481 company-operated stores, as well as our decision
 not
 to renew leases on other locations that failed to meet our financial return
 goals .
 See Turnaround Program Overview included in MD A below. In
 2005, we closed
 a total of 74 RadioShack company-operated stores, net of new store openings
 and
 relocations, due
 to our decision
 not to renew leases on locations that failed to meet our financial return
 goals. 

 (2) As
 of December 31,
 2006 ,
 SAM S
 CLUB had the
 unconditional right to assume the operation of up to 66 additional kiosk
 locations. They assumed operation of 23 kiosk locations during the first quarter
 of 2005 and 21 in the fourth quarter of 2005 that were previously operated
 by
 us.

 Dealer
 and other
 outlets included 9 company-operated stores and 14 dealer outlets in Canada
 at
 December 31, 2006. In 2005 and 2006, we closed 192 dealer outlets, net of new
 outlet openings or conversions to RadioShack company-operated stores.
 This
 decline was primarily due to the closure of smaller outlets that did not meet
 our financial return goals.

 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

 We
 are currently a party to various class action lawsuits alleging that we
 misclassified certain RadioShack store managers as exempt from overtime in
 violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or similar state laws, including
 a
 lawsuit styled Alphonse L. Perez, et al. v. RadioShack Corporation, filed on
 October 31, 2002, in the United States District Court for the Northern District
 of Illinois. We have reached a tentative settlement with counsel for the Perez
 plaintiffs and four other wage-hour lawsuits pending against us. This global
 settlement would result in a payment by us of approximately 8.8 million, in
 the
 aggregate, to resolve all five of the pending lawsuits. Of this amount, a charge
 of 8.5 million was recognized during the quarter ended June 30, 2006, with
 the
 balance recognized during the quarter ended September 30, 2006. The respective
 courts will need to approve the tentative settlement. We anticipate the
 settlement will ultimately be approved by each court. If, however, a final
 settlement is not approved, we nevertheless believe we have meritorious
 defenses, and in such event we would continue to vigorously defend these
 cases. 

We
 have various other pending claims, lawsuits, disputes with third parties,
 investigations and actions incidental to the operation of our business. Although
 occasional adverse settlements or resolutions may occur and negatively impact
 earnings in the period or year of settlement, it is our belief that their
 ultimate resolution will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
 condition or liquidity.

These
 publicly announced plans or programs consist of RadioShack s 250 million share
 repurchase program, which was announced on March 16, 2005, and has no expiration
 date. On August 5, 2005, we suspended purchases under the 250 million share
 repurchase program during the period in which a financial institution purchased
 shares pursuant to an overnight share repurchase program. As of February 16,
 2007, management had not determined if share repurchases under the 250 million
 program should be resumed.

 EBITDA,
 a non-GAAP
 financial measure, is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
 and amortization. The comparable financial measure to EBITDA under GAAP is
 net
 income. EBITDA is used by management to evaluate the operating performance
 of
 our business for comparable periods. EBITDA should not be used by investors
 or
 others as the sole basis for formulating investment decisions as it excludes
 a
 number of important items. We compensate for this limitation by using GAAP
 financial measures as well in managing our business. In the view of management,
 EBITDA is an important indicator of operating performance because EBITDA
 excludes the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the
 effects of interest and depreciation costs. 

The

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
 AND 

 RESULTS
 OF
 OPERATIONS MD A ). 

This
 MD A
 section discusses our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition,
 risk management practices, critical accounting policies, and estimates and
 certain factors that may affect our future results, including economic and
 industry-wide factors. Our MD A should be read in conjunction with our
 consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, included in this
 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A
 above. 

OVERVIEW 

 RadioShack
 is
 primarily a specialty retailer of consumer electronics products and services.
 We
 seek to differentiate ourselves from our various competitors by providing
 cost-effective solutions to meet the routine electronics needs and distinct
 electronics wants of our customers. This strategy allows us to take advantage
 of
 the unique opportunities provided by our extensive retail presence,
 knowledgeable sales staff, and relationships with reputable
 vendors. 

Overall,
 our
 day-to-day focus is concentrated in four major areas: 

Provide
 our
 customers a positive in-store
 experience 

Grow
 gross
 profit dollars by increasing the overall value of each
 ticket 

Reduce
 costs
 continually throughout the
 organization 

Allocate
 the
 dollars generated from operations appropriately, investing only in
 projects that have an adequate return or are operationally
 necessary 

TURNAROUND
 PROGRAM REVIEW 

 Due
 to negative
 trends that developed in our business during calendar year 2005, we announced
 a
 turnaround program on February 17, 2006, 
 that contained
 four key components: 

Update
 our
 inventory 

Focus
 on our
 top-performing RadioShack company-operated stores, while closing
 400 to
 700 RadioShack company-operated stores, and aggressively relocate
 other
 RadioShack company-operated stores 

Consolidate
 our distribution centers 

Reduce
 our
 overhead costs 

Through
 December
 31, 2006, we conducted a liquidation of certain inventory during the summer
 and
 fall of 2006 and replaced underperforming merchandise with new faster-moving
 merchandise. During the summer of 2006, we also focused on our top-performing
 stores and completed the closure of 481 underperforming stores, reducing the
 number of retail employees in connection with these closures. Additionally,
 we
 consolidated our distribution centers in the fall of 2006. Management has also
 reduced our cost structure, including our advertising spend rate and our
 workforce within our corporate headquarters. A number of other cost reductions
 have also been implemented. As of December 31, 2006, we considered our
 turnaround program to be substantially complete. 

See
 Financial
 Impact of Turnaround Program below for a discussion of the financial impact of
 our turnaround program. 

KEY
 INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR MANAGEMENT 

 We
 use several key financial performance metrics, including metrics related to
 net
 sales and operating revenues, gross profit and gross margin, and operating
 income. 

Net
 Sales
 and Operating Revenues Metrics 

As
 a retailer, we consider profitable growth in revenue to be one of the key
 indicators of our overall financial performance. We examine our revenue by
 using
 several key metrics, including overall change in net sales and operating
 revenues and in comparable store sales performance, as well as the related
 gross
 profit derived from these sales. 

The
 change in net
 sales and operating revenue, coupled with the review of gross profit dollars,
 provides us with an overall indication of the demand for our products and
 services. Comparable store sales include the sales of any domestic retail
 location where we have a physical presence, including RadioShack
 company-operated stores and kiosks, that has more than 12 full months of
 recorded sales. 

The
 table below
 summarizes these revenue metrics for the periods indicated:

Comparable

(5.6 

0.9 

3.2 

Consolidated
 net
 sales and operating revenues as well as comparable store sales declined in
 2006,
 due in part to a sales decrease within our RadioShack company-operated stores
 segment s wireless and modern home platforms. Additionally, these decreases were
 partially attributable to a change in the manner in which we recognize income
 associated with sales of prepaid wireless airtime. Beginning in 2006,
 principally as a result of changes in our agreements with wireless carriers,
 we
 no longer record the full value of airtime purchased by customers, but rather
 record only our markup on the sale as revenue. This change reduced our revenue
 by approximately 138.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as
 compared to the corresponding prior year period. This change had no impact
 on
 our gross profit or operating income. Consolidated net sales and operating
 revenues were also impacted by the 481 company-operated stores closed in
 connection with our turnaround plan. 

Gross
 Profit and Gross Margin Metrics 

We
 view gross profit dollars and gross margin as key metrics of our financial
 performance, as they indicate the extent to which we are able to manage our
 product costs and sales volume. 

The
 table below
 summarizes gross profit and gross margin for the periods indicated:

 kiosks segment are impairment charges of 18.6 million to goodwill, 10.7
 million to an intangible asset, and 1.8 million to property, plant and
 equipment for the year ended December 31, 2006. 

 (3) 
 The
 decline in the
 other category for the year ended December 31, 2006, was primarily driven by
 a
 decline in our service centers operating income. Additionally, this category
 includes charges of 1.8 million and 1.2 million for impairment of property,
 plant and equipment and for goodwill, respectively, for the year ended December
 31, 2006, which contributed to the decline. 

 (4) 
 Included
 in the
 unallocated category are overhead and corporate expenses that are not allocated
 to the separate reportable segments for management reporting purposes.
 Unallocated costs include corporate departmental expenses such as payroll and
 benefits, as well as advertising, insurance, distribution and information
 technology costs.

(1) In
 2006 we closed
 505 RadioShack company-operated stores, net of new store openings and
 relocations. This
 decline
 resulted primarily from the implementation of our turnaround program, which
 included the closure of 481 company-operated stores, as well as our decision
 not
 to renew leases on other locations that failed to meet our financial return
 goals .
 See Turnaround Program Overview included in MD A below. In
 2005, we closed
 a total of 74 RadioShack company-operated stores, net of new store openings
 and
 relocations, due
 to our decision
 not to renew leases on locations that failed to meet our financial return
 goals. 

 (2) 
 As
 of December 31,
 2006 ,
 SAM S
 CLUB had the
 unconditional right to assume the operation of up to 66 additional kiosk
 locations. They assumed operation of 23 kiosk locations during the first quarter
 of 2005 and 21 in the fourth quarter of 2005 that were previously operated
 by
 us. 

 (3) Dealer
 and other
 outlets included 9 company-operated stores and 14 dealer outlets in Canada
 at
 December 31, 2006. In 2005 and 2006, we closed 192 dealer outlets, net of new
 outlet openings or conversions to RadioShack company-operated stores.
 This
 decline was primarily due to the closure of smaller outlets that did not meet
 our financial return goals. 

RESULTS
 OF
 OPERATIONS 

NET
 SALES AND
 OPERATING REVENUES 

Sales
 decreased
 6.0 to 4,777.5 million in 2006 from 5,081.7 million in 2005. We also had
 a
 5.6 decrease in comparable store sales. These changes were primarily the result
 of a 58 decrease in our service platform sales due
 primarily to
 the manner in which we began recognizing sales of prepaid wireless airtime
 in
 2006 and
 a 5 decrease
 in our wireless platform sales. In
 addition, all
 platforms were affected by the decline in the number of RadioShack
 company-operated stores as a result of our turnaround program. 

Consolidated
 net
 sales and operating revenues for our two reportable segments and service centers
 and other sales are as follows:

All
 sales in the
 platforms shown above were impacted by the closure of the RadioShack
 company-operated stores related to our turnaround program. 

Sales
 in our
 wireless platform (includes wireless handsets and communication devices such
 as
 scanners, GPS units and two-way radios) decreased in dollars and as a percentage
 of net sales and operating revenues in 2006, compared to 2005. These decreases
 were primarily driven by a decline in unit sales of wireless handsets. Factors
 contributing to this sales decline included an unfavorable mix shift to prepaid
 handsets from postpaid, a sluggish wireless industry environment, a sharp unit
 sales decline in the northeastern United States, and fewer RadioShack stores.
 These decreases were partially offset by the introduction of various GPS
 products. 

Sales
 in our
 accessory platform (includes accessories for home entertainment products,
 wireless handsets, digital imaging products and computers) increased in dollars
 and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in 2006, compared to
 2005. These increases were primarily the result of higher sales of digital
 music
 accessories associated with higher sales of digital music players included
 in
 our personal electronics platform, in addition to higher Bluetooth wireless
 accessories and flash memory sales. These increases were partially offset by
 a
 decline in home entertainment accessory sales. 

Sales
 in our
 personal electronics platform (includes digital cameras, camcorders, toys,
 wellness products, digital music players and satellite radios) increased in
 both
 dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in 2006,
 compared to 2005. These sales increases were driven primarily by increased
 sales
 of digital music players, offset by decreases in most of the remaining personal
 electronics categories. 

Sales
 in our modern
 home platform (includes residential telephones, home audio and video
 end-products, direct-to-home DTH satellite systems, and computers) decreased
 in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in
 2006,
 compared to 2005. These decreases were primarily due to lower sales of
 telephones, home computers, and DVD players, which were partially offset by
 increased sales of flat panel televisions. 

Sales
 in our power
 platform (includes general and special purpose batteries and battery chargers)
 decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating
 revenues in 2006, compared to 2005. These sales decreases were due primarily
 to
 a decrease in sales of both general and special purpose batteries caused by
 factors such as reduced sales of products requiring batteries and customer
 tendencies to simply replace older cordless phones rather than replacing their
 batteries. 

Sales
 in our
 technical platform (includes wire and cable, connectivity products, components
 and tools, as well as hobby and robotic products) decreased in dollars, but
 increased slightly as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in 2006,
 compared to 2005. The dollar decrease was primarily the result of a decrease
 in
 sales of specialty tools. 

Sales
 in our
 service platform (includes prepaid wireless airtime, bill payment revenue and
 extended service plans) decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales
 and operating revenues in 2006, compared to 2005. These decreases were primarily
 attributable to a change in the manner in which we recognize income associated
 with sales of prepaid wireless airtime. Beginning in 2006, principally as a
 result of changes in our agreements with wireless carriers, we no longer record
 the full value of airtime purchased by customers, but rather record only our
 markup on the sale as revenue. This change reduced our total company-operated
 stores revenue by approximately 134.6 million for 2006, as compared to the
 corresponding prior year period, but had no impact on our gross profit or
 operating income. 

Other
 revenue
 (includes RadioShack company-operated store repair revenue and other revenue)
 decreased slightly in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and
 operating revenues. 

Kiosks 

Kiosk
 sales
 increased 77.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, when compared
 to
 the prior year period. This increase was primarily the result of an increase
 in
 the number of Sprint kiosks in late 2005 that operated for all of 2006. Kiosk
 sales consist primarily of wireless platform sales and related accessory
 platform sales. 

Other
 Sales 

Other
 sales include
 sales to our independent dealers, outside sales from our service centers, sales
 generated by our www.radioshack.com 
 Web site, sales in
 our nine now closed Canadian company-operated stores, sales to commercial
 customers, and outside sales of our global sourcing operations and manufacturing
 facilities. These sales were up 19.0 million for 2006, or an increase of 5.6 ,
 when compared to 2005. These sales increases were primarily due to an increase
 in sales to our network of independent dealers and an increase in Web site
 sales. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact of five
 service centers, which we sold or closed in 2006. 

GROSS
 PROFIT 

Consolidated
 gross
 profit for 2006 was 2,233.1 million or 46.7 of net sales and operating
 revenues, compared with 2,375.4 million or 46.7 of net sales and operating
 revenues in 2005, resulting in a 6.0 decrease in gross profit .
 The
 decrease in
 gross profit dollars was primarily the result of a decrease in net sales and
 operating revenues; the impact of inventory liquidation related to the store
 closures involved in the turnaround program; a
 mix change toward
 lower gross margin products, including higher relative sales of digital music
 players and lower margin accessories; and more aggressive promotional
 activity .
 The
 gross margin
 rate was positively affected by the change in the manner in which we began
 recognizing income associated with sales of prepaid wireless airtime in 2006,
 as
 discussed above. 

SELLING,
 GENERAL
 AND ADMINISTRATIVE SG A EXPENSE 

Our
 consolidated
 SG A expense increased slightly in dollars and increased as a percent of net
 sales and operating revenues to 39.8 for the year ended December 31, 2006,
 from
 37.4 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The
 dollar increase
 for 2006 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and commissions, plus
 rent
 expense; this increase was substantially offset by a decrease in advertising
 expense. However, headcount
 reductions from store closures, service center closures and corporate
 headquarters reductions helped lower compensation expense (excluding the
 severance charges) in the third and fourth quarters of 2006. We expect SG A
 to be lower in 2007 when compared to 2006, due to an ongoing scrutiny of costs,
 the impact of store closures and cost reductions commencing in the second half
 of 2006. 

The
 table below
 summarizes the breakdown of various components of our consolidated SG A
 expense and its related percentage of total net sales and operating
 revenues.

Payroll
 and
 commissions expense increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and
 operating revenues. These increases were primarily the result of pay plan
 changes for RadioShack company-operated stores initiated in early 2006,
 severance related to our turnaround program, utilization of more labor hours
 in
 our company-operated stores during the first half of the year, and increased
 headcount in our kiosk operations. We also began the required expensing of
 stock
 options as of January 1, 2006, which increased compensation expense by 12.0
 million, when compared to 2005. 

Rent
 expense
 increased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues.
 The rent increase was primarily driven by a full year of rental payments on
 our
 corporate campus, as well as the addition of kiosk locations, which was
 partially offset by store closures. 

Advertising
 expense
 decreased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues.
 This decrease was primarily due to a change in our media strategy, as we changed
 the mix of media used in our advertising program from television to more radio
 and newspaper usage, as well as reduced sponsorship programs. 

Professional
 fees
 increased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues.
 The increase relates to the defense costs for certain class action lawsuits,
 including 5.1 million of the 8.8 million discussed under Note
 12 -
 "Litigation" to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ,
 as well as the
 cost of consultants engaged in various projects. 

Other
 SG A
 expense includes lease buyouts associated with the turnaround program for the
 year ended December 31, 2006.

Due

 company-operated stores in 2006, we anticipate depreciation and amortization
 to
 be below the 2006 level. 

IMPAIRMENT
 OF
 LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND OTHER CHARGES 

In
 February 2006, as part of our turnaround program, our board of directors
 approved the closure of 400 to 700 RadioShack company-operated stores. During
 the first half of 2006, we identified the stores for closure and subsequently
 performed the impairment test. Based on the remaining estimated future cash
 flows related to these specific stores, it was determined that the net book
 value of some of the stores' long-lived assets to be held for use was not
 recoverable. For the stores with insufficient estimated cash flows, we wrote
 down the associated long-lived assets to their estimated fair value, resulting
 in a 9.2 million impairment loss related to our RadioShack company-operated
 store segment. By July 31, 2006, we had closed 481 specific stores under the
 turnaround program; there were no additional closures under this program for
 the
 remainder of the year. 

Also,
 we purchased
 certain assets from Wireless Retail, Inc. during the fourth quarter of 2004
 for
 59.6 million, which resulted in the recognition of 18.6 million of goodwill
 and a 32.1 million intangible asset related to a five-year agreement with
 SAM'S
 CLUB to operate wireless kiosks in approximately 540 SAM'S CLUB locations
 nationwide. These assets relate to our kiosk segment. As a result of continued
 company and wireless industry growth challenges, together with changes in our
 senior leadership team during the third quarter of 2006 that resulted in a
 refocus on allocation of capital and resources towards other areas of our
 business, we determined that our long-lived assets, including goodwill
 associated with our kiosk operations, were impaired. We performed impairment
 tests on both the long-lived assets associated with our SAM'S CLUB agreement,
 including the intangible asset relating to the five-year agreement, and the
 accompanying goodwill. 

With
 respect to the
 long-lived tangible and intangible assets, we compared their carrying values
 with their estimated fair values using a discounted cash flow model, which
 reflected our lowered expectations of wireless revenue growth and the ceased
 expansion of our kiosk business, and determined that the intangible asset
 relating to the five-year agreement was impaired. This assessment resulted
 in a
 10.7 million impairment charge to the intangible asset related to our kiosk
 segment. The remaining intangible balance will be amortized over the remaining
 life of the SAM'S CLUB agreement, which is scheduled to expire in September
 2009. The balance at December 31, 2006, was 7.8 million. 

With
 respect to the
 goodwill of 18.6 million, we estimated the fair value of the SAM'S CLUB
 reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model similar to that used in the
 long-lived asset impairment test. We compared it with the carrying value of
 the
 reporting unit and determined that the goodwill was impaired. As the carrying
 value of the reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, we then compared
 the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount
 of goodwill. This resulted in an 18.6 million impairment of goodwill, related
 to our kiosk segment. 

Additionally,
 based
 on historical and expected cash flows for company-operated stores and kiosks,
 we
 recorded an impairment charge of 4.6 million related to property and equipment
 and an impairment charge of 1.2 million related to goodwill. 

These
 impairment
 charges, aggregating 44.3 million, were recorded within impairment of
 long-lived assets and other charges in the accompanying 2006 Consolidated
 Statement of Income. 

NET
 INTEREST
 EXPENSE 

Consolidated
 interest expense, net of interest income, was 36.9 million for 2006 versus
 38.6 million for 2005, a decrease of 1.7 million or 4 . 

Interest
 expense
 decreased slightly to 44.3 million in 2006 from 44.5 million in 2005. This
 decrease in the interest expense during 2006 was attributable to lower average
 outstanding debt, which was partially offset by rising interest rates on our
 interest rate swap agreements. 

Interest
 income
 increased 25 to 7.4 million in 2006 from 5.9 million in 2005. These changes
 were due to a higher average investment balance for 2006, as well as increases
 in investment rates. 

We
 anticipate net interest expense for 2007 will be below the 2006 level, due
 to
 larger average cash balances when compared to the prior year. 

OTHER
 (LOSS)
 INCOME 

For
 the year ended
 December 31, 2006, we recognized a loss of 8.6 million in other (loss) income.
 This loss included 5.9 million relating to our derivative exposure to Sirius
 Satellite Radio Inc. Sirius warrants, which was a result of the required
 mark to market accounting treatment of these warrants. The additional 2.7
 million related to an other than temporary impairment of other investments.

During
 the first
 quarter of 2005, we sold all rights, title and interest to the Tandy name
 within Australia and New Zealand to an affiliate of Dick Smith Electronics,
 an
 Australia-based consumer electronics retailer. This transaction resulted in
 the
 recognition of 10.2 million in other income in 2005. 

INCOME
 TAX
 PROVISION 

Our
 provision for
 income taxes reflects an effective income tax rate of 34.1 for 2006 and 16.0 
 for 2005. The fluctuation in the effective tax rate during 2006 was due
 primarily to the tax benefit associated with inventory donations occurring
 in
 the quarter ended June 30, 2006. During the second quarter of 2006, we donated
 approximately 20 million in inventory to charitable organizations in a manner
 that provided us with a tax deduction in excess of the inventory cost. The
 entire tax benefit attributable to this charitable donation deduction is
 reflected in the effective tax rate for the second quarter. The lower effective
 tax rates in 2005 were principally due to a favorable non-cash income tax
 benefit of 56.5 million relating to the release of a tax contingency reserve
 upon the expiration of the associated statute of limitations. This reserve
 related to losses sustained in connection with our European operations, which
 were fully dissolved by 1995. The release of the reserve occurred in the third
 quarter of 2005 because the statute of limitations governing these issues
 expired on September 30, 2005. We anticipate the effective tax rate will
 increase in 2007, primarily as a result of not repeating the 2006 donation
 activity previously discussed. 

2005
 COMPARED WITH 2004 

RESULTS
 OF
 OPERATIONS 

NET
 SALES AND
 OPERATING REVENUES 

Sales
 increased
 5.0 to 5,081.7 million in 2005 from 4,841.2 million in 2004. We had a 0.9 
 increase in comparable store sales. These increases were primarily the result
 of
 a 7 increase in our wireless platform sales and a 14 increase in our personal
 electronics platform sales. A net addition of 178 kiosk locations contributed
 to
 our overall sales increase. Kiosks were the primary driver of the wireless
 platform sales increase. 

RadioShack
 Company-Operated Stores 

Sales
 in our
 wireless platform decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and
 operating revenues in 2005, compared to 2004. These decreases were primarily
 driven by our announced wireless carrier transition and a significant decline
 in
 the growth rate of industry gross subscriber additions. 

Sales
 in our
 accessory platform increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and
 operating revenues in 2005, compared to 2004. These
 increases
 were primarily the result of higher sales of iGo power adapters, digital music
 accessories and media storage, which were partially offset by a decline in
 home
 entertainment and wireless accessory sales. 

Sales
 in our
 personal electronics platform increased in both dollars and as a percentage
 of
 net sales and operating revenues in 2005, compared to 2004. These
 sales
 increases were driven primarily by increased sales of satellite radios
 (including income from Sirius warrants earned); digital music players; and
 digital imaging products . 

Sales
 in our modern
 home platform decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and
 operating revenues in 2005, compared to 2004. These
 decreases
 were primarily due to sales decreases in DTH satellite systems, cordless
 telephones and desktop computers, which were partially offset by increased
 portable DVD player, video projector, and home network product
 sales. 

Sales
 in our power
 platform decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and
 operating revenues in 2005, compared to 2004. The sales decrease was primarily
 due to a decrease
 in special
 purpose battery sales .

Sales
 in our
 service platform increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and
 operating revenues in 2005, compared to 2004. These
 increases
 were primarily due to an increase in sales of prepaid wireless
 airtime .

Sales
 in our
 technical platform increased slightly in dollars and remained the same as a
 percentage of net sales and operating revenues in 2005, compared to 2004. The
 dollar increase was primarily due to higher
 sales of
 tools and robotic kits .

Other
 revenue
 decreased slightly in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and
 operating revenues. 

Kiosks 

Kiosk
 sales
 increased 206.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, when compared
 to
 the prior year period. This increase was the result of an increased number
 of
 kiosk locations over 2004. 

Other
 Sales 

Other
 sales were up
 25.8 million for 2005, or an increase of 8.3 , when compared to 2004. This
 sales increase was primarily due to increased sales to dealers over 2004, in
 addition to e-commerce and service center sales increases. 

GROSS
 PROFIT 

Consolidated
 gross
 profit for 2005 was 2,375.4 million or 46.7 of net sales and operating
 revenues, compared with 2,434.5 million or 50.3 of net sales and operating
 revenues in 2004, resulting in a 2.4 decrease in gross profit and a 3.6
 percentage point decrease in our gross profit percentage. These decreases were
 partially the result of write-downs in the second half of 2005 as a result
 of
 our inventory obsolescence reviews, in which we identified a significant amount
 of slow-moving inventory to remove from our assortment. A
 mix change toward
 our lower gross margin kiosk channel also contributed to the overall decrease
 in
 our gross margin rate. Additionally, our merchandise mix among platforms shifted
 due to significant growth in the sale of digital music players and digital
 imaging products, as well as prepaid airtime refills, within the lower gross
 margin personal electronics platform and the service platform, respectively.

SELLING,
 GENERAL
 AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 

Our
 consolidated
 SG A expense increased 7.2 in dollars and increased as a percent of net
 sales and operating revenues to 37.4 for the year ended December 31, 2005,
 from
 36.7 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
 dollar increase
 for 2005 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and commissions expense,
 plus rent expense. 

Payroll
 and
 commissions expense increased in dollars and as a percentage of net
 sales and
 operating revenues .
 This dollar
 increase was due to the expansion of our kiosk business, as well as an increase
 in staffing in the RadioShack company-operated stores during the winter holiday
 selling season. 

Rent
 expense
 increased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues.
 This increase was due primarily to the full year effect of the acquisition
 of
 the SAM S CLUB kiosk business and the Sprint Nextel kiosk
 expansion. 

Advertising
 expense
 decreased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues.
 This decrease was primarily due to an increase in contributions from our
 vendors. Additionally, the decrease related to a change in creative strategy.

Insurance
 expense
 decreased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues
 as a result of our mid-year change to a larger health claim provider, which
 allowed us greater discounts. Our insurance expense relates to losses, claims
 and insurance premiums, which are partially offset by contributions from health
 insurance participants. 

Professional
 fees
 increased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues.
 These increases were primarily due to increases in information systems
 development, store operating procedure audits and legal fees. 

DEPRECIATION
 AND
 AMORTIZATION 

Consolidated
 depreciation and amortization expense increased 22.4 million to 123.8 million
 and increased to 2.4 of net sales and operating revenues, compared to 2.1 
 for
 2004. The
 increase in
 depreciation was primarily attributable to our
 new corporate
 headquarters, increased spending for our store remodel program, information
 system projects, and the amortization of intangibles related to our SAM S CLUB
 kiosk business. 

NET
 INTEREST
 EXPENSE 

Consolidated
 interest expense, net of interest income, was 38.6 million for 2005 versus
 18.2 million for 2004, an increase of 20.4 million or 112 . 

Interest
 expense
 increased approximately 50 to 44.5 million in 2005 from 29.6 million in
 2004.
 This increase primarily resulted from the elimination of capitalized interest
 expense due to the completion of the construction of our new corporate
 headquarters. Additionally, interest expense increased due to interest rate
 swap
 agreements and an increase in the average debt outstanding in 2005. 

Interest
 income
 decreased approximately 48 to 5.9 million in 2005 from 11.4 million in
 2004 ,
 despite an increase in investment rates. This was primarily the result of a
 lower
 average investment balance. 

OTHER
 INCOME 

During
 the first
 quarter of 2005, we sold all rights, title and interest to the Tandy name
 within Australia and New Zealand to an affiliate of Dick Smith Electronics,
 an
 Australia-based consumer electronics retailer. This transaction resulted in
 the
 recognition of 10.2 million in other income. 

During
 the year
 ended December 31, 2005, we received no payments and recorded no income under
 our tax sharing agreement with O Sullivan Industries Holdings, Inc.
 O Sullivan ), compared to 2.0 million received and recorded in 2004.

INCOME
 TAX
 PROVISION 

Our
 income tax
 provision reflects an effective income tax rate of 16.0 for 2005 and 37.8 
 for
 2004. The
 decrease in
 2005 was primarily due to a favorable non-cash income tax benefit of 56.5
 million related to the release of a tax contingency reserve. This reserve was
 related to losses sustained in connection with our European operations, which
 were fully dissolved by 1995. The release of the reserve occurred in the third
 quarter because the statute of limitations governing these issues expired on
 September 30, 2005. 

The
 American Jobs
 Creation Act of 2004 ("the Act") provided a temporary elective incentive to
 repatriate foreign earnings by providing a deduction equal to 85 of the
 dividends received, which reduced the effective federal income tax rate on
 these
 earnings from 35 to 5.25 . We
 repatriated
 49.4 million of foreign earnings during 2005. As we have not previously had
 any
 amounts reflected in our financial statements as earnings permanently invested
 outside the United States, a total tax benefit of 8.9 million was recognized
 in
 2005 related to the repatriation. 

RECENTLY
 ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In
 May 2005, the
 Financial
 Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
 Standards SFAS 
 No. 154,
 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections - A Replacement of APB Opinion No.
 20
 and FASB Statement No. 3 SFAS No. 154 ). SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective
 application to prior periods financial statements for a change in accounting
 principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific
 effects or the cumulative effect of the change. Additionally, retrospective
 application is not required when explicit transition requirements specific
 to
 newly adopted accounting principles exist. Retrospective application requires
 the cumulative effect of the change on periods prior to those presented to
 be
 reflected in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as of the beginning
 of the first period presented, and the offsetting adjustments to be recorded
 to
 opening retained earnings. SFAS No. 154 retains the guidance contained in APB
 Opinion No. 20 for reporting both the correction of an error in previously
 issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate. We adopted
 the
 provisions of SFAS No. 154, as applicable, at the beginning of fiscal year
 2006,
 and its adoption had no effect on our financial condition or results of
 operations. 

Effective
 January
 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123
 (revised 2004),
 Share-Based Payment SFAS No. 123R .
 SFAS No. 123R
 establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity
 exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. This statement focuses
 primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee
 services in share-based payment transactions. SFAS No. 123R requires that the
 fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the
 historical financial statements as services are performed. We adopted SFAS
 No.
 123R utilizing the modified prospective transition method, which requires that
 we recognize compensation expense for all new and unvested share-based payment
 awards from the January 1, 2006, effective date. As required by SFAS No. 123R,
 we recognized the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions,
 including shares issued under our stock option, stock deferral and stock
 purchase plans, in the financial statements. See Note
 2 - Summary
 of Significant Accounting Policies in our Notes to Consolidated Financial
 Statements for
 further
 discussion on the impact of this adoption, as well as the valuation methodology
 and assumptions utilized. 

In
 November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs" SFAS No. 151 ).
 This statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory
 Pricing," to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility
 expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material. SFAS No. 151 requires
 that these items be recognized as current period charges and requires allocation
 of fixed production overhead to the cost of conversion be based on the normal
 capacity of the production facilities. We adopted this statement effective
 January 1, 2006. The results of the adoption of this statement did not have
 a
 material impact on our financial condition or results of
 operations. 

In
 September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS
 No. 157"). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
 measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting
 principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This
 statement does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies
 to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
 measurements. The provisions of this statement are to be applied prospectively
 as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this statement is initially
 applied, with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative-effect
 adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The provisions of SFAS
 No. 157 are effective for the fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007;
 therefore, we anticipate adopting this standard as of January 1, 2008. We have
 not determined the effect, if any, the adoption of this statement will have
 on
 our financial condition or results of operations. 

In
 September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined
 Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - an amendment of FASB Statements
 No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" ("SFAS No. 158"). SFAS No. 158 requires employers
 to recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to
 accumulated other comprehensive income to report the funded status of defined
 benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. SFAS No. 158 requires
 prospective application; thus, the recognition and disclosure requirements
 are
 effective for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. Additionally, SFAS No.
 158 requires companies to measure plan assets and obligations at their year-end
 balance sheet date. This requirement is effective for our fiscal year ending
 December 31, 2008. See Note 22 - Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan for
 further discussion on the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158. 

In
 September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering
 the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
 Current Year Financial Statements ("SAB 108"). SAB 108 provides guidance on how
 prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying
 misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining
 whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated. SAB
 108 permits registrants to record the cumulative effect of initial adoption
 by
 recording the necessary "correcting" adjustments to the carrying values of
 assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting
 adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings only if material
 under the dual method. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or after
 November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 had no impact on our financial
 condition or results of operations. 

In
 July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for
 Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 FIN
 48 ). FIN 48 provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and
 measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
 FIN
 48 requires that we recognize in the financial statements the impact of a tax
 position if that position will more likely than not be sustained on audit,
 based
 on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
 derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
 periods, disclosures, and transition provisions. Any transition adjustment
 recognized on the date of adoption will be recorded as an adjustment to retained
 earnings as of the beginning of the adoption period. FIN 48 is effective for
 fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and we adopted FIN 48 as of
 January 1, 2007. Based on our current evaluation, we do not expect the adoption
 of this interpretation to have a material impact on our financial position
 or
 results of operations. 

In
 June 2006, the FASB s Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue
 No. 06-3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental
 Authorities Should be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus
 Net Presentation) EITF 06-3 ). EITF 06-3 requires disclosure of an entity s
 accounting policy regarding the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental
 authority that are directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between
 a
 seller and a customer, including sales, use, value added and some excise taxes.
 Our policy is to exclude all such taxes from revenue on a net reporting
 basis.

Cash
 Flow -
 Operating Activities 

Cash
 provided by
 operating activities in 2006 was 314.8 million, compared to 362.9 million
 and
 352.5 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash provided by net income
 plus
 non-cash adjustments to net income was 230.7 million in 2006 compared to 318.7
 million in 2005. The 2006 reduction was due to a decline in operating income
 in
 2006, compared to the prior year. Cash provided by working capital components
 was 84.1 million and 44.2 million for years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
 respectively. This increase in cash provided by working capital components,
 as
 compared to the prior year, was primarily the result of decreases in inventory,
 accounts receivable, and accounts payable, net of increases in accrued expenses
 and income taxes. 

Cash
 Flow -
 Investing Activities 

Cash
 used in
 investing activities was 79.3 million and 290.2 million in 2006 and 2004,
 respectively, while 39.3 million in cash was provided in 2005. We received
 220.4 million in net proceeds from the sale and leaseback of our corporate
 campus during the fourth quarter of 2005. Capital
 expenditures for these periods related primarily to retail stores and
 information systems projects. 
 Additionally, 2004
 included capital expenditures related to our new corporate campus. We anticipate
 that our capital expenditure requirements for 2007 will range from 60 million
 to 80 million. RadioShack company-operated store remodels and relocations
 and
 updated information systems will account for the majority of our anticipated
 2007 capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2006, we had 472.0 million in
 cash and cash equivalents. These cash and cash equivalents, along with cash
 generated from our net sales and operating revenues and, when necessary, from
 our credit facilities, are available to fund future capital expenditure
 needs. 

Cash
 Flow -
 Financing Activities 

Cash
 provided by
 financing activities was 12.5 million in 2006, compared to a cash usage of
 616.1 million and 259.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. We did not
 repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2006, while we used 625.8
 million to repurchase shares of our common stock in 2005 and 251.1 million
 in
 2004. The 2005 repurchases include our overnight share repurchase program
 OSR ). See Share Repurchases below for a discussion of share repurchase
 programs and employee stock programs, as well as the OSR. The 2005 and 2004
 stock repurchases were partially funded by 47.5 million and 85.8 million,
 respectively, received from the sale of treasury stock to employee benefit
 plans
 and from stock option exercises. The balance of capital to repurchase shares
 was
 obtained from cash generated from operations. 

Additionally,
 our
 net borrowings increased 34.2 million in 2006, compared to a decrease of 4.1
 million and 54.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Dividends paid in
 2006, 2005 and 2004 were 33.9 million, 33.7 million and 39.7 million,
 respectively. The decrease in dividends paid from 2004 to 2005, was affected
 by
 the 2005 share repurchases, resulting in fewer shares outstanding. 

Free
 Cash
 Flow 

Our
 free cash flow,
 defined as cash flows from operating activities less dividends paid and
 additions to property, plant and equipment, was 189.9 million in 2006, 158.5
 million in 2005 and 83.4 million in 2004. The consecutive increases in free
 cash flow over the last three years were the result of a decrease in cash used
 by working capital components, primarily inventory, as well as a decrease in
 capital expenditures relating to the construction of our new corporate
 campus . 

We
 believe free cash flow is a relevant indicator of our ability to repay maturing
 debt, change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that management
 believes will enhance shareholder value. The comparable financial measure to
 free cash flow under generally accepted accounting principles is cash flows
 from
 operating activities, which was 314.8 million in 2006, 362.9 million in 2005
 and 352.5 million in 2004. We do not intend the presentation of free cash
 flow,
 a non-GAAP financial measure, to be considered in isolation or as a substitute
 for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

The

 flow.

CAPITAL
 STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 

We
 consider our capital structure and financial condition to be sound. We had
 472.0 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2006, as a resource
 for our funding needs. Additionally, we have available to us 625 million of
 bank credit facilities. As of December 31, 2006, we had no borrowings under
 these credit facilities. For a discussion of the expected effect of our
 turnaround program on capital structure and financial condition, see Financial
 Impact of Turnaround Program below.

On
 February 23, 2006, Fitch changed its long-term rating outlook to negative.
 In
 addition, on February 22, 2006, Moody s placed our ratings under review for a
 possible downgrade. Both of these actions followed our announcement of calendar
 2005 earnings, our turnaround program, and other factors. Moody s concluded its
 review of our ratings on March 14, 2006, and reaffirmed our existing short-term
 rating of P-2, but lowered our long-term rating to Baa2 with a negative outlook.
 On April 21, 2006, Standard and Poor s S P changed our long-term rating
 to BBB- with a stable outlook and changed our short-term rating to A-3. On
 July
 24, 2006, S P lowered our outlook to negative after the release of our
 second quarter earnings on July 21, 2006. On August 22, 2006, Fitch changed
 our
 long-term rating to BB+ with a stable outlook and changed our short-term rating
 to B. Shortly after we released our results and filed our Form 10-Q for the
 period ended September 30, 2006, S P and Moody s reduced our ratings to
 their respective current ratings. Additionally, Fitch changed our outlook from
 neutral to its current negative level. Factors that could impact our future
 credit ratings include the effect of our turnaround program, free cash flow,
 cash levels, changes in our operating performance, the adoption of a more
 aggressive financial strategy, the economic environment, conditions in the
 retail and consumer electronics industries, our financial position and changes
 in our business strategy. If further downgrades occur, they will adversely
 impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs, access to debt capital
 markets, vendor financing terms and future new store occupancy
 costs. 

Our
 senior
 unsecured debt primarily consists of two issuances of 10-year long-term notes
 and an issuance of medium-term notes. 

Long-Term
 Notes: 
 We have a 300.0
 million debt shelf registration statement which became effective in August
 1997.
 In August 1997, we issued 150.0 million of 10-year unsecured long-term notes
 under this shelf registration. The interest rate on the notes is 6.95 per
 annum
 with interest payable on September 1 and March 1 of each year. These notes
 contain certain non-financial covenants and are due September 1, 2007.
 Currently, we anticipate paying these obligations from cash generated during
 the
 year and existing cash balances. 

On
 May 11, 2001, we issued 350.0 million of 10-year 7.375 notes in a private
 offering to initial purchasers who in turn offered the notes to qualified
 institutional buyers under SEC Rule 144A. The annual interest rate on the notes
 is 7.375 per annum with interest payable on November 15 and May 15 of each
 year. The notes contain certain non-financial covenants and mature on May 15,
 2011. In August 2001, under the terms of an exchange offering filed with the
 SEC, we exchanged substantially all of these notes for a similar amount of
 publicly registered notes. The exchange resulted in substantially all of the
 notes becoming registered with the SEC and did not result in additional debt
 being issued. 

During
 the third
 quarter of 2001, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with an
 underlying notional amount of 110.5 million and a maturity in September 2007.
 In June and August 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with
 underlying notional amounts of debt of 100.0 million and 50.0 million,
 respectively, and both with maturities in May 2011. These swaps effectively
 convert a portion of our long-term fixed rate debt to a variable rate. We
 entered into these agreements to balance our fixed versus floating rate debt
 portfolio to continue to take advantage of lower short-term interest rates.
 Under these agreements, we have contracted to pay a variable rate of LIBOR
 plus
 a markup and to receive a fixed rate of 6.95 for the swap entered into in
 2001
 and 7.375 for the swaps entered into in 2003. We have designated these
 agreements as fair value hedging instruments. We
 recorded an
 amount in other non-current liabilities, net, of 8.5 million
 and 7.6
 million (their fair value) at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, for
 the
 swap agreements and adjusted the fair value of the related debt by the same
 amount. Fair value was computed based on the market s current anticipation of
 quarterly LIBOR rate levels from the present until the swaps 
maturity. 

Medium-Term
 Notes: 
 We also issued, in
 various amounts and on various dates from December 1997 through September 1999,
 medium-term notes totaling 150.0 million under the shelf registration described
 above. At December 31, 2006, 5.0 million of these notes remained outstanding.
 The interest rate at December 31, 2006, for the outstanding 5.0 million in
 medium-term notes was 6.42 . These notes contain customary non-financial
 covenants and mature in January 2008. As of December 31, 2006, there was no
 availability under the debt shelf registration. 

Available
 Financing 

Credit
 Facilities: 
 At December 31,
 2006, we had an aggregate of 625 million borrowing capacity available under
 our
 existing credit facilities. These facilities consist of the
 following: 

Amount
 of
 Facility 

Expiration
 Date 

300
 million 

June
 2009 

325
 million 

May
 2011 

These
 credit
 facilities support commercial paper issuance, as well as provide us a source
 of
 liquidity if the commercial paper market is unavailable to us. As of December
 31, 2006, there were no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities,
 nor were these facilities utilized during 2006. Interest charges under these
 facilities are derived using a base LIBOR rate plus a margin which changes
 based
 on our credit ratings. Our bank syndicated credit facilities have customary
 terms and covenants, and we were in compliance with these covenants at December
 31, 2006. 

In
 June 2006, we replaced our existing 300 million five-year credit facility,
 which was to expire in June 2007, with a 325 million five-year credit agreement
 expiring May 2011. The new facility has a more favorable fixed charge coverage
 ratio and provides for the exclusion of cash turnaround expenses from the
 covenant calculation. We also amended the 300 million facility expiring in
 June
 2009 to include similar covenants and terminated our 130 million 364-day
 revolving credit facility. 

We
 believe that our present ability to borrow is adequate for our business needs.
 However, i f
 market conditions
 change, gross profit were to dramatically decline, or we could not control
 operating costs, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Additionally,
 if
 a scenario as described above occurred, it could cause the rating agencies
 to
 lower our credit ratings further, thereby increasing our borrowing costs, or
 even causing a further reduction in or elimination of our access to debt and/or
 equity markets.

Our

 capitalization ratio decreased in 2006 from 2005, due primarily to a 65.0
 million increase in stockholders equity. Long-term debt as a percentage of
 total capitalization decreased in 2006 due to 150 million of debt becoming
 current during 2006. 

Dividends 

We
 have paid common stock cash dividends for 20 consecutive years. On November
 6,
 2006, our Board of Directors declared an annual dividend of 0.25 per share.
 The
 dividend was paid on December 20, 2006, to shareholders of record on December
 1,
 2006. The dividend payment of 33.9 million was funded from cash on
 hand. 

Operating
 Leases 

We
 use operating leases, primarily for our retail locations, two distribution
 centers, and our corporate campus, to lower our capital requirements.

Share
 Repurchases 

On
 February 25, 2005, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program
 with no expiration date authorizing management to repurchase up to 250 million
 in open market purchases. We
 repurchased 4.7
 million shares of our common stock for 125.8 million in the year ended December
 31, 2005, under our approved repurchase programs (but excluding the OSR).
 The
 funding required for these repurchases came from net cash generated
 from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents. We also
 repurchased shares in the open market in 2005 to offset the sales of shares
 to
 our employee benefit plans. As of February 16, 2007, there was 209.9 million
 available under the 250 million share repurchase program. Management suspended
 purchases under the 250 million share repurchase program while our OSR was
 completed as described below. As of February 16, 2007, management had not
 resumed share repurchases under the 250 million program. 

On
 August 5, 2005, we entered into an agreement with a financial institution to
 purchase 20 million shares of our common stock from the financial institution
 under the OSR. The average share price upon completion of the transaction was
 24.15. We funded this payment from available cash on hand and short-term
 borrowings in the commercial paper market. 

Seasonal
 Inventory Buildup 

Typically,
 our
 annual cash requirements for pre-seasonal inventory buildup range between 200
 million and 400 million. The funding required for this buildup comes primarily
 from cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and operating revenues.
 We
 had 472.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2006, as
 a
 resource for our funding needs. Additionally, borrowings may be utilized to
 fund
 the inventory buildup as described in Available Financing above. 

Construction
 and Sale and Leaseback of Corporate Headquarters 

We
 began construction of our new corporate headquarters in 2003, which we partially
 occupied during the fourth quarter of 2004. Our total campus construction and
 land costs were 226.8 million; we completed construction in the first quarter
 of 2005. 

On
 December 20, 2005, we entered into a transaction in which we sold and leased
 back the buildings and certain of the property at our corporate headquarters,
 located in downtown Fort Worth, Texas. In
 connection with
 this transaction, we entered into a 20-year triple-net lease agreement (in
 which
 we pay all operating expenses), with four five-year options to
 renew. 
 We have retained ownership of other real estate adjacent to our corporate
 headquarters. This
 transaction
 allowed us to repay approximately 220 million of short-term borrowings in
 the
 commercial paper market issued in conjunction with the OSR and, subsequently,
 to
 reduce our credit facilities to 625 million.

We
 have contingent liabilities related to retail leases of locations that were
 assigned to other businesses. The majority of these contingent liabilities
 relate to various lease obligations arising from leases that were assigned
 to
 CompUSA,
 Inc.
 CompUSA 
 as part of the
 sale of our Computer City, Inc. subsidiary to CompUSA in August 1998. In the
 event CompUSA or the other assignees, as applicable, are unable to fulfill
 their
 obligations, we would be responsible for rent due under the leases. Our rent
 exposure from the remaining undiscounted lease commitments (assuming no
 projected sublease income) is approximately 92 million. However, we have no
 reason to believe that CompUSA or the other assignees will not fulfill their
 obligations under these leases or that we would be unable to sublet the
 properties; consequently, we do not believe there will be a material impact
 on
 our financial statements from any fulfillment of these
 contingencies. 

FINANCIAL
 IMPACT OF TURNAROUND PROGRAM 

As
 discussed previously, our turnaround program, as originally stated in February
 2006, contained four key components: 

Update
 our
 inventory 

Focus
 on our
 top-performing RadioShack company-operated stores, while closing
 400 to
 700 RadioShack company-operated stores and aggressively relocate
 other
 RadioShack company-operated stores 

Consolidate
 our distribution centers 

Reduce
 our
 overhead costs 

As
 of December 31, 2006, we considered our turnaround program substantially
 complete. 

Store
 Closures: As
 of December 31,
 2006, we had closed 481 stores as a result of our turnaround program. Our
 decision to close these stores was made on a store-by-store basis, and there
 was
 no geographic concentration of closings for these stores. 

For
 these closed
 stores, we recognized a charge in 2006 of 9.1 million for future lease
 obligations and negotiated buy-outs with landlords. A lease obligation reserve
 is not recognized until a store has been closed or when a buy-out agreement
 has
 been reached with the landlord. 

Regarding
 the 481
 stores we closed as a result of the turnaround program during the year ended
 December 31, 2006, we recorded an impairment charge of 9.2 million related
 to
 the long-lived assets associated with certain of these stores. It was determined
 that the net book value of several of the stores' long-lived assets was not
 recoverable based on the remaining estimated future cash flows related to these
 specific stores. We also recognized 2.1 million in accelerated depreciation
 associated with closed store assets for which the useful life had been changed
 due to the store closures. 

In
 connection with these store closures, we identified 601 retail employees whose
 positions were terminated by December 31, 2006. These employees were paid
 severance, and some earned retention bonuses if they remained employed to
 certain agreed-upon dates. The development of a reserve for these costs began
 on
 the date that the terms of severance benefits were established and communicated
 to the employees, and the reserve was recognized over the minimum retention
 period. As of December 31, 2006, 3.8 million has been recognized as retention
 and severance benefits for store employees, with 3.6 million in benefits paid
 to date. 

Additionally,
 as
 part of our store closure activities, we incurred 6.1 million in expenses
 in
 2006 primarily in connection with fees paid to outside liquidators and for
 close-out promotional activities for the 481 stores. 

Distribution
 Center Consolidations: We
 closed a
 distribution center located in Southaven, Mississippi, and sold a distribution
 center in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2006. During the year ended December
 31, 2006, we recognized a lease obligation charge in the amount of 2.0 million
 on the lease of the Southaven distribution center and a gain of 2.7 million
 on
 the sale of the Charleston distribution center. We also incurred a 0.5 million
 charge related to severance for approximately 100 employees. Additionally,
 there
 were 0.4 million in other expenses. 

Service
 Center Operations: We
 closed or sold
 five service center locations during the year ended December 31, 2006, resulting
 in the elimination of approximately 350 positions. We recognized a charge of
 1.2 million and 0.9 million related to lease obligations and severance,
 respectively. This severance obligation was paid as of December 31, 2006.
 Additionally, there were 0.1 million in other expenses. 

Overhead
 Cost Reductions: Management
 conducted a review of our cost structure to identify potential sources of cost
 reductions. In connection with this review, we made decisions to lower these
 costs, including reducing our advertising spend rate in connection with
 adjustments to our media mix. 

During
 the year
 ended December 31, 2006, we reduced our workforce by approximately 514
 positions, primarily within our corporate headquarters. We recorded charges
 for
 termination benefits and related costs of 11.9 million, of which 6.4 million
 had been paid as of December 31, 2006. 

Inventory
 Update: We
 have been
 replacing underperforming merchandise with new, faster-moving merchandise.
 We
 recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately 62 million during the fourth quarter
 of 2005, as a result of both our normal inventory review process and the
 inventory update aspect of our turnaround program.

All

 landlords; however, remaining lease obligations still exist at December 31,
 2006. There is uncertainty as to when, and at what cost, we will fully settle
 all remaining lease obligations. See the allocation of our turnaround charges
 within our segments in Note 27 - Segment Reporting. 

OFF-BALANCE
 SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

 Other
 than the
 operating leases described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing
 arrangements, transactions, or special purpose entities. 

INFLATION 

 With
 the exception
 of recent increases in energy costs, inflation has not significantly impacted
 us
 over the past three years. We do not expect inflation to have a significant
 impact on our operations in the foreseeable future, unless international events
 substantially affect the global economy. 

CRITICAL
 ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

 Our
 consolidated
 financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted
 accounting principles GAAP in the United States. The application of GAAP
 requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values
 of
 assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported
 amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and the related
 disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The use of estimates is
 pervasive throughout our financial statements and is affected by management
 judgment and uncertainties. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based
 on historical experience, current market trends and other factors that we
 believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time the consolidated financial
 statements are prepared. We continually evaluate the information used to make
 these estimates as our business and the economic environment change. Actual
 results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions
 or conditions. 

In
 the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe our significant
 accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial
 statements. The accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical
 are
 revenue recognition; inventory valuation under the cost method; estimation
 of
 reserves and valuation allowances specifically related to insurance, tax and
 legal contingencies; valuation of long-lived assets and intangibles, including
 goodwill; and stock-based compensation. 

We
 consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires
 difficult, subjective or complex judgments, and is material to the portrayal
 of
 our financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of
 operations. The selection, application and disclosure of our critical accounting
 policies and estimates have been reviewed by the Audit and Compliance Committee
 of our Board of Directors. 

Revenue
 Recognition: Our
 revenue is
 derived principally from the sale of private label and third-party branded
 products and services to consumers. Revenue is recognized, net of an estimate
 for customer refunds and product returns, when persuasive evidence of an
 arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the
 sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Certain
 products,
 such as wireless telephone handsets, require the customer to use the services
 of
 a third-party service provider. In most cases, the third-party service provider
 pays us a fee or commission for obtaining a new customer, as well as a monthly
 recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the service
 provider and the customer. Fee or commission revenue, net of a reserve for
 estimated service deactivations, is generally recognized at the time the
 customer is accepted as a subscriber of a third-party service provider, while
 the residual revenue is recognized on a monthly basis. 

Estimated
 product
 refunds and returns, service plan deactivations, residual revenue and commission
 revenue adjustments are based on historical information pertaining to these
 items. If actual results differ from these estimates due to various factors,
 the
 amount of revenue recorded could be materially affected. A 10 difference in
 our
 reserves for the estimates noted above would have affected net sales and
 operating revenues by approximately 5.4 million for the fiscal year ended
 December 31, 2006. 

Inventory
 Valuation: 
 Our inventory
 consists primarily of finished goods available for sale at our retail locations
 or within our distribution centers and is recorded at the lower of average
 cost
 or expected sales price (i.e., market value). The cost components recorded
 within inventory are the vendor invoice cost and certain allocated external
 and
 internal freight, distribution, warehousing and other costs required to
 transport the merchandise from the vendor to the point-of-sale. 

Typically,
 the
 market value of our inventory is higher than its aggregate cost. Determination
 of the market value may be very complex and, therefore, requires a high degree
 of judgment. In order for management to make the appropriate determination
 of
 market value, the following items are commonly considered: inventory turnover
 statistics, current selling prices, seasonality factors, consumer trends,
 competitive pricing, performance of similar products or accessories, planned
 promotional incentives, technological obsolescence, and estimated costs to
 sell
 or dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions. 

If
 the estimated market value is determined to be less than the recorded cost,
 a
 provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item.
 Differences between management estimates and actual performance and pricing
 of
 our merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from the amount
 recorded at the financial statement date and could also cause fluctuations
 in
 the amount of recorded cost of products sold. 

If
 our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate or changes in consumer
 demand affect certain products in an unforeseen manner, we may be exposed to
 material losses or gains in excess of our established valuation
 reserve. 

Estimation
 of Reserves and Valuation Allowances: 
 The amount of
 liability we record for claims related to insurance, tax and legal contingencies
 requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately
 be incurred. We use our past history and experience, as well as other specific
 circumstances surrounding these claims, in evaluating the amount of liability
 we
 should record. As additional information becomes available, we assess the
 potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates
 as
 appropriate. These revisions could materially impact our results of operations
 and financial position or liquidity. 

We
 are insured for certain losses related to workers' compensation, property and
 other liability claims, with deductibles up to 1.0 million per occurrence.
 This
 insurance coverage limits our exposure for any catastrophic claims that may
 arise above the deductible. We also have a self-insured health program
 administered by a third party covering the majority of our employees that
 participate in our health insurance programs. We estimate the amount of our
 reserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reporting
 period. This estimate is based on information provided by either an independent
 actuarial firm or third party. The information includes historical claims
 experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other factors we deem
 relevant. A 10 change in our insurance reserves at December 31, 2006, would
 have affected net income by approximately 6.3 million for the fiscal year
 ended
 December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, actual losses had not exceeded
 our
 expectations. Additionally, for claims that exceed our deductible amount, we
 record a gross liability and corresponding receivable representing expected
 recoveries, since we are not legally relieved of our obligation to the
 claimant. 

We
 are subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax
 authorities related to income tax, sales and use tax, personal property tax,
 and
 other forms of taxation. These audits examine our tax positions, timing of
 income and deductions, and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions.
 As part of our evaluation of these tax issues, we establish reserves in our
 consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable
 tax
 exposures. Effective January 1, 2007, we began recognizing uncertain income
 tax
 positions based on our assessment of whether the tax position was more likely
 than not to be sustained on audit, as set forth within FIN 48. Depending on
 the
 nature of the tax issue, we could be subject to audit over several years;
 therefore, our estimated reserve balances might exist for multiple years before
 an issue is resolved by the taxing authority. 

Additionally,
 we
 are involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with
 employment and other matters. A reserve has been established based on our best
 estimates of the potential liability in these matters. This estimate has been
 developed in consultation with in-house and outside counsel and is based upon
 a
 combination of litigation and settlement strategies. 

Although
 we believe
 that our tax and legal reserves are based on reasonable judgments and estimates,
 actual results could differ, which may expose us to material gains or losses
 in
 future periods. These actual results could materially affect our effective
 tax
 rate, earnings, deferred tax balances and cash flows in the period of
 resolution. 

Valuation
 of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles, Including Goodwill: 
 Long-lived assets,
 such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment when events or
 changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
 recoverable, such as historical operating losses or plans to dispose of or
 sell
 long-lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives.
 The
 carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted
 cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the
 asset. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment
 loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Fair
 value is determined by discounting expected future cash flows using our
 risk-free rate of interest. 

Impairment
 losses,
 if any, are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs. The carrying
 value of the asset is adjusted to the new carrying value, and any subsequent
 increases in fair value are not recorded. Additionally, if it is determined
 that
 the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased, the
 periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new carrying value of
 the
 asset. 

The
 impairment
 calculation requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash
 flows, strategic plans, useful lives and discount rates. If actual results
 are
 not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to
 additional impairment charges, which could be material to our results of
 operations. 

We
 have acquired goodwill and other separately identifiable intangibles related
 to
 business acquisitions that have occurred during prior years. The original
 valuation of these intangibles is typically based in part through a third-party
 appraisal and may include the use of estimates that we provide concerning future
 profitability, cash flows and other judgmental factors. We review our goodwill
 and intangible balances on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter, and
 whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of
 the
 goodwill or intangibles might exceed their current fair value. 

The
 determination
 of fair value is based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cash
 flow and other comparable market analyses. These valuation techniques require
 us
 to make estimates and assumptions regarding future profitability, industry
 factors, planned strategic initiatives, discount rates and other factors. If
 actual results or performance of certain business units are different from
 our
 estimates, we may be exposed to an impairment charge related to our goodwill
 or
 intangibles. The total value of our goodwill and intangibles at December 31,
 2006, was 10.4 million. 

Stock-Based
 Compensation :
 We have
 historically granted certain stock-based awards to employees and directors
 in
 the form of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted
 stock and deferred stock units. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting
 Policies and Note 15 - Stock-Based Incentive Plans for a more complete
 discussion of our stock-based compensation programs. 

At
 the date that an award is granted, we determine the fair value of the award
 and
 recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period, which
 typically is the period over which the awards vest. The restricted stock and
 deferred stock units are valued at the fair market value of our stock on the
 date of grant. The fair value of stock options with only service conditions
 is
 estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair value
 of
 stock options with service and market conditions is valued utilizing the Monte
 Carlo simulation model. The Black-Scholes-Merton and Monte Carlo simulation
 models require management to apply judgment and use highly subjective
 assumptions, including expected option life, expected volatility, and expected
 employee forfeiture rate. We use historical data and judgment to estimate the
 expected option life and the employee forfeiture rate, and use historical and
 implied volatility when estimating the stock price volatility. 

While
 the
 assumptions that we develop are based on our best expectations, they involve
 inherent uncertainties based on market conditions and employee behavior that
 are
 outside of our control. If actual results are not consistent with the
 assumptions used, the stock-based compensation expense reported in our financial
 statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the
 stock-based compensation. Additionally, if actual employee forfeitures
 significantly differ from our estimated forfeitures, we may have an adjustment
 to our financial statements in future periods. A 10 change in our stock-based
 compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006, would have affected
 our net income by approximately 1.4 million. 

Prior
 to calendar
 year 2006, we followed the guidance under Accounting
 Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
 Employees, and its related interpretations.

 December 31, 2006, our derivative instruments that materially increased our
 exposure to market risks for interest rates, foreign currency rates, commodity
 prices or other market price risks were primarily the interest rate swaps noted
 in our MD A and warrants we earned to acquire common stock of Sirius
 Satellite Radio Inc. Sirius ). We do not use derivatives for speculative
 purposes. 

Our
 exposure to
 interest rate risk results from changes in short-term interest rates. Interest
 rate risk exists with respect to our net investment position at December 31,
 2006, of 150 .7 
 million,
 consisting of fluctuating short-term investments of 411.2 million and offset
 by
 260.5 million of indebtedness which, because of our interest rate swaps,
 effectively bears interest at short-term floating rates. A hypothetical increase
 of 100 basis points in the interest rate applicable to this floating-rate net
 exposure would result in a decrease in annual net interest expense of 1.5
 million. This hypothesis assumes no change in the net principal
 balance. 

Our
 exposure to
 market risk, specifically the equity markets, relates to warrants we earned
 as
 of December 31, 2006 and 2005, to purchase 2 million and 4 million shares,
 respectively, of Sirius stock at an exercise price of 5.00 per share. We have
 recorded these as assets using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation method. Our
 maximum exposure is equal to the carrying value at December 31, 2006, of 1.4
 million. 

We
 also manage our portfolio of fixed rate exposures, compared to floating rate
 exposure to reduce our exposure, to interest rate changes. The fair value of
 our
 fixed rate long-term debt is sensitive to long-term interest rate changes.
 Interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the fair value
 of our debt due to differences between market interest rates and rates at the
 inception of the debt obligation. Based on a hypothetical immediate 100 basis
 point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value
 of our fixed rate long-term debt would decrease 12.9 million and increase
 of
 5.2 million, respectively. Based on a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point
 decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value of
 our
 fixed rate long-term debt would increase by 13.4 million and 43.2 million,
 respectively. Regarding the fair value of our fixed rate debt, changes in
 interest rates have no impact on our consolidated financial
 statements.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation
 of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
 have established a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are
 designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company, which
 is
 required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under
 the
 Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed,
 summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and
 forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management,
 including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a timely
 fashion. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
 our
 disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
 Exchange Act) was performed as of the end of the period covered by this annual
 report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
 participation of management, including our CEO and CFO. 

Based
 upon that
 evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that these disclosure controls and
 procedures were effective. 

Management s
 Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
 management is
 responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
 financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our
 management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the
 effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the
 framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the
 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
 our
 evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated
 Framework, our
 management
 concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
 as of
 December 31, 2006. Our management s assessment of the effectiveness of our
 internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, has been
 audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
 accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
 herein. 

Changes
 in
 Internal Controls 

There
 were no
 changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
 our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
 to materially affect, our internal control over financial
 reporting.

Report
 of
 Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the
 Board of
 Directors and Stockholders of RadioShack Corporation: 

We
 have 
 completed integrated audits of RadioShack
 Corporation s consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over
 financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, in accordance with the standards
 of
 the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions,
 based on our audits, are presented below. 

Consolidated
 financial statements 

In
 our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
 index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
 RadioShack Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December 31,
 2006
 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
 of
 the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in conformity 
 with accounting
 principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
 statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our
 responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
 based 
 on our audits. We
 conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of
 the
 Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
 require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
 whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
 of
 financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
 the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
 accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
 evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
 audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

As
 discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
 changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation in
 2006. 

Internal
 control
 over financial reporting 

Also,
 in our
 opinion, management s assessment, included in Management's Report on Internal
 Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
 maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
 31, 2006 based on criteria established in Internal
 Control - Integrated Framework 
 issued by the
 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is
 fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore,
 in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
 internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
 criteria established in Internal
 Control - Integrated Framework 
 issued by the
 COSO. The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
 control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
 of
 internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
 opinions on management s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
 Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
 conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
 with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
 States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
 reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
 reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control
 over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control
 over financial reporting, evaluating management s assessment, testing and
 evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
 performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances.
 We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
 company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
 provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
 and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over
 financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
 to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
 reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
 (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
 necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
 of
 the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
 and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
 regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
 or
 disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the
 financial statements. 

Because
 of its
 inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
 or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
 to
 future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
 because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
 policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

 RadioShack
 Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1967. We primarily engage in the
 retail sale of consumer electronics goods and services through our RadioShack
 store chain. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our various competitors
 by
 providing cost-effective solutions to meet the routine electronics needs and
 distinct electronics wants of our customers. Throughout
 this
 report, the terms our, we, us and RadioShack refer to RadioShack
 Corporation, including its subsidiaries. 

RADIOSHACK
 COMPANY-OPERATED STORES 

 At
 December 31, 2006, we operated 4,467 company-operated stores under the
 RadioShack brand, located throughout the United States, as well as in Puerto
 Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These stores are located in major shopping
 malls and strip centers, as well as individual storefronts. Each location
 carries a broad assortment of both private label and third-party branded
 consumer electronics products. Our product lines include wireless telephones
 and
 communication devices such as scanners and two-way radios; flat panel
 televisions, residential telephones, DVD players, computers and direct-to-home
 DTH satellite systems; home entertainment, wireless, imaging and computer
 accessories; general and special purpose batteries; wire, cable and connectivity
 products; and digital cameras, radio-controlled cars and other toys, satellite
 radios and memory players. We also provide consumers access to third-party
 services such as wireless telephone and DTH satellite activation, satellite
 radio service, prepaid wireless airtime and extended service plans.

KIOSKS 

 At
 December 31, 2006, we operated 772 kiosks located throughout the United States.
 These kiosks are primarily inside SAM S CLUB locations, as well as stand-alone
 Sprint Nextel kiosks in major shopping malls. These locations, which are not
 RadioShack-branded, offer primarily wireless handsets, their associated
 accessories, and DTH satellite systems. We also provide consumers access to
 third-party wireless telephone services. 

OTHER 

 In
 addition to the reportable segments discussed above, we have other sales
 channels and support operations, described in more detail below. 

Dealer
 Outlets: 
 At December 31,
 2006, we had a network of 1,587 RadioShack dealer outlets, including 36 located
 outside of North America and 14 in Canada. These outlets provide private label
 and third-party branded products and services to smaller communities. These
 independent dealers are often engaged in other retail operations and augment
 their businesses with our products and service offerings. Our dealer sales
 derived outside of the United States are not material. 

RadioShack.com: 
 Products and
 information are available through our commercial Web site www.radioshack.com .
 Online customers
 can purchase, return or exchange various products available through this Web
 site. Additionally, certain products ordered online may be picked up, exchanged
 or returned at neighborhood RadioShack locations. 

RadioShack
 Service Centers:
 We
 maintain a
 service and support network to service the consumer electronics and personal
 computer retail industry in the U.S. We are a vendor-authorized service provider
 for many top tier manufacturers, such as Hewlett-Packard, LG Electronics,
 Motorola, Nokia, RCA/Thomson, and Sony, among others. In addition, we perform
 repairs for third-party extended service plan providers. At December 31, 2006,
 we had seven RadioShack service centers in the U.S. and one in Puerto Rico
 that
 repair certain name-brand and private label products sold through our various
 sales channels. 

International
 Operations: At
 December 31,
 2006, we had 9 company-operated stores located in major shopping malls and
 strip
 centers and 14 dealer outlets in Canada. As of January 31, 2007, we had closed
 all of our locations in Canada. Additionally, as of December 31, 2006, there
 were 146 RadioShack-branded stores and 25 dealers in Mexico. These
 RadioShack-branded stores and dealer outlets are overseen by a joint venture
 in
 which we are a minority owner with Grupo Gigante, S.A. de C.V. Our
 revenues from
 foreign customers are not material, and we do not have a material amount of
 long-lived assets located outside of the United States. We do not consolidate
 the operations of the Mexican joint venture in our consolidated financial
 statements. 

Support
 Operations: 

 Our
 retail stores,
 along with our kiosks and dealer outlets, are supported by an established
 infrastructure. Below are the major components of this support
 structure. 

Distribution
 Centers -
 At December 31,
 2006, we had six distribution centers shipping over one million cartons each
 month, on average, to our retail stores and dealer outlets. One of these
 distribution centers also serves as a fulfillment center for our online
 customers. 

RadioShack
 Technology Services RSTS 
 - Our
 management
 information system architecture is composed of a distributed, online network
 of
 computers that links all stores, customer channels, delivery locations, service
 centers, credit providers, distribution facilities and our home office into
 a
 fully integrated system. Each store has its own server to support the
 point-of-sale POS system. The majority of our company-operated stores
 communicate through a broadband network, which provides efficient access to
 customer support data. This design also allows store management to track sales
 and inventory at the product or sales associate level. RSTS provides the
 majority of our programming and systems analysis needs. 

RadioShack
 Global Sourcing RSGS -
 RSGS serves our
 wide-ranging international import/export, sourcing, evaluation, logistics and
 quality control needs. RSGS s activities support our branded and private label
 business. 

RadioShack
 Customer Support -
 Using
 state-of-the-art telephone systems, Web self-help guides and data networks,
 RadioShack Customer Support responds to more than 1.3 million phone calls and
 e-mails annually. The responses include answers to customers unique requests
 for hard-to-find parts, batteries and accessories; customer service inquiries;
 and direct sales requests related to our retail stores. Additionally, in 2006,
 we outsourced calls regarding our service plans and direct sales requests
 related to our Web site. 

Consumer
 Electronics Manufacturing -
 We operate two
 manufacturing facilities in the United States and one overseas manufacturing
 operation in China. These three manufacturing facilities employed approximately
 1,600 employees as of December 31, 2006. We manufacture a variety of products,
 primarily sold through our retail outlets, including telephony, antennas, wire
 and cable products, and a variety of hard-to-find parts and accessories for
 consumer electronics products. 

NOTE
 2 -
 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

 Principles
 of Consolidation: 
 The Consolidated
 Financial Statements include our accounts and our majority-owned subsidiaries.
 Investments in 20 to 50 owned companies are accounted for using the equity
 method. Significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in
 consolidation. 

Segments : We
 consider
 RadioShack company-operated stores and kiosks to be our reportable segments
 based on the criteria of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."
 The accounting policies of the reportable operating segments are the same as
 those described in the remainder of this note. 

Reclassifications: 
 Certain amounts in
 the December 31, 2005 and 2004, financial statements have been reclassified
 to
 conform with the December 31, 2006, presentation. These reclassifications had
 no
 effect on net income or total stockholders equity as previously
 reported. 

Pervasiveness
 of Estimates: The
 preparation of
 financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
 requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
 of assets and liabilities, related revenues and expenses, and the disclosure
 of
 gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements and during
 the periods presented. Our 
 most significant
 estimates and assumptions include the determination of estimates for third-party
 service deactivations in connection with revenue recognition and receivables,
 inventory valuation, depreciable lives of property, plant and equipment,
 insurance reserves, intangible assets, contingency and litigation reserves,
 and
 stock-based compensation. Actual
 results
 could differ materially from those estimates. 

Revenue
 Recognition: Our
 revenue is
 derived principally from the sale of private label and third-party branded
 products and services to consumers. Revenue is recognized, net of an estimate
 for customer refunds and product returns, when persuasive evidence of an
 arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the
 sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Certain
 products,
 such as wireless telephone handsets, require the customer to use the services
 of
 a third-party service provider. In most cases, the third-party service provider
 pays us an upfront commission for obtaining a new customer, as well as a monthly
 recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the service
 provider and the customer. Our sale of an activated wireless telephone handset
 is the single event required to meet the delivery criterion for both the upfront
 commission and the residual revenue. Upfront commission revenue, net of
 estimated service deactivations, is recognized at the time an activated wireless
 telephone handset is sold to the customer at the point-of-sale. Based on our
 extensive history in selling activated wireless telephone handsets, we have
 been
 able to establish reliable deactivation estimates. Recurring residual income
 is
 recognized as earned under the terms of each contract with the service provider,
 which is typically as the service provider bills its customer, generally on
 a
 monthly basis. 

Cost
 of
 Products Sold: 
 Cost of products
 sold primarily includes the total cost of merchandise inventory sold; costs
 of
 services provided; in-bound freight expenses to our distribution centers;
 out-bound freight expenses to our retail outlets; physical inventory valuation
 adjustments and losses; customer shipping and handling charges; and certain
 vendor allowances (see Vendor Allowances below). 

Vendor
 Allowances: 
 We receive
 allowances from third-party service providers and product vendors through a
 variety of promotional programs and arrangements as a result of purchasing
 and
 promoting their products and services in the normal course of business. We
 consider vendor allowances received to be a reduction in the price of a vendor's
 products or services and record them as a component of inventory until the
 product is sold, at which point we record them as a component of cost of
 products sold unless the allowances represent reimbursement of specific,
 incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor's products
 and
 services. In this case we record them when earned as an offset to the associated
 expense incurred to promote the applicable products and/or
 services. 

Advertising
 Costs: Our
 advertising
 costs are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. We receive
 allowances from certain third-party service providers and product vendors that
 we record when earned as an offset to advertising expense incurred to promote
 the applicable products and/or services only if the allowances represent
 reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs (see our previous
 Vendor Allowances discussion). Advertising expense was 216.3 million, 263.1
 million and 271.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
 2004,
 respectively, net of vendor allowances of 34.7 million, 44.1 million and
 33.9
 million, respectively. 

Stock-Based
 Compensation: 
 In December 2004,
 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 123
 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment SFAS No. 123R ), which requires
 companies to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair
 value method and record this expense in their consolidated financial
 statements. In addition, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R requires
 additional accounting and disclosures related to income tax and cash flow
 effects resulting from stock-based compensation. 

We
 adopted SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, under the modified prospective
 application method. Under this method, we record stock-based compensation
 expense for all awards granted on or after the date of adoption and for the
 portion of previously granted awards that remained unvested at the date of
 adoption. Accordingly, prior period amounts have not been restated. Currently,
 our stock-based compensation relates to stock options, restricted stock awards,
 and other equity-based awards issued to our employees and directors. All of
 our
 equity awards, with the exception of our stock options, are measured at the
 fair
 value of our common stock on the grant date and recognized as compensation
 expense over the applicable vesting period. 

Prior
 to January 1,
 2006, we accounted for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value
 method. Accordingly, we recognized compensation expense for restricted stock
 and
 other equity awards over the service period, but did not recognize compensation
 expense for stock option awards, because the options were granted at market
 value on the date of grant. 

The
 following table
 details the effect of stock-based compensation on net income and net income
 per
 share for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively,
 illustrating the effect of applying the fair value recognition provisions of
 SFAS No. 123R for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.

The
 compensation
 cost that has been charged against income for stock-based compensation plans
 was
 20.2 million, 12.2 million and 20.7 million for the years ended December
 31,
 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized
 for
 these stock-based compensation plans was 6.4 million, 4.4 million and 7.9
 million for years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
 respectively. 

The
 fair value of
 the stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and
 2004, was estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, except
 for the fair market value of the two million performance options granted to
 our
 chief executive officer during the third quarter of 2006, which were valued
 utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Black-Scholes-Merton and Monte
 Carlo simulation models require the use of highly subjective assumptions,
 including expected option life, expected volatility, and expected employee
 termination rate. We use historical data and management judgment to estimate
 the
 option life and employee termination rate, and use historical and implied
 volatility when estimating the stock price volatility. 

The
 fair market
 value of the stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2006,
 2005, and 2004, respectively, was estimated using the following
 assumptions:

We
 periodically grant options to purchase RadioShack common stock to certain of
 our
 employees under various stock option plans at exercise prices equal to the
 fair
 market value of our common stock at the date of grant. Our current stock option
 grants have terms of seven years from the grant date. Previously, we granted
 options with ten year terms. Typically, the options vest ratably over three
 years from the date of grant. However, during the third quarter of 2006, we
 granted 4.2 million stock options to our chief executive officer and chief
 financial officer that primarily vest over four years from the date of grant
 (includes 2.0 million options which have a market condition that restricts
 the
 ability to exercise until certain stock price hurdles are achieved). Once
 employment is terminated, the option holder has 90 days in which to exercise
 all
 vested options; however, under certain circumstances, some retirees may have
 three years in which to exercise all vested options. The fair market value
 of
 each option is generally recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line
 basis between the grant date and the date at which the option becomes fully
 vested. As of December 31, 2006, unrecognized compensation expense related
 to
 the unvested portion of our stock options was 23.2 million, which is expected
 to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years.

The
 aggregate
 intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price
 of
 the underlying awards and the quoted price of our common stock for those awards
 that have an exercise price currently below the closing price. As of December
 31, 2006, we had options outstanding to purchase an aggregate of 4.1 million
 shares with an exercise price below the quoted price of our stock, resulting
 in
 an aggregate intrinsic value of 12.1 million. During the year ended December
 31, 2006 and 2005, the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under
 our
 stock option plans was 0.9 million and 6.2 million, respectively, determined
 as of the date of exercise. 

Income
 per
 Share: Basic
 income per
 share is computed based only on the weighted average number of common shares
 outstanding for each period presented. Diluted income per share reflects the
 potential dilution that would have occurred if securities or other contracts
 to
 issue common stock were exercised, converted, or resulted in the issuance of
 common stock that would have then shared in the earnings of the entity. The
 following table reconciles the numerator and denominator used in the basic
 and
 diluted earnings per share calculations.

Options
 to purchase
 17.1 million, 15.8 million and 10.9 million shares of common stock in 2006,
 2005
 and 2004, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted income
 per share because the option exercise price was greater than the average market
 price of the common stock during the year, and the effect of their inclusion
 would be antidilutive. 

Cash
 and
 Cash Equivalents: 
 Cash on hand in
 stores, deposits in banks and all highly liquid investments with an original
 or
 remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase are
 considered cash and cash equivalents. We carry our cash equivalents at cost,
 which approximates fair value because of the short maturity of the instruments.
 The weighted average interest rates were 5.3 and 4.1 at December 31, 2006
 and
 2005, respectively, for cash equivalents totaling 397.2 million and 161.5
 million, respectively. 

Accounts
 Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: 
 Concentrations of
 credit risk with respect to customer and dealer receivables are limited due
 to
 the large number of customers, dealers and their location in many different
 geographic areas of the country. However, we do have some concentration of
 credit risk from service providers in the wireless telephone industry, due
 to
 sales of their products and services. We establish an allowance for doubtful
 accounts based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers,
 historical trends and other information. Historically, such losses, in the
 aggregate, have not exceeded our expectations. Account balances are charged
 against the allowance when we believe it is probable that the receivable will
 not be recovered. 

Inventories: 
 Our inventories
 are stated at the lower of cost (principally based on average cost) or market
 value and are comprised primarily of finished goods. Included in the cost of
 the
 inventories are in-bound freight expenses to our distribution centers, out-bound
 freight expenses to our retail outlets, and other direct costs. If the
 calculated net realizable value of the inventory is determined to be less than
 the recorded cost, a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the
 inventory. 

Property,
 Plant and Equipment: 
 We state our
 property, plant and equipment at cost, less accumulated depreciation. For
 financial reporting purposes, depreciation is primarily calculated using the
 straight-line method over the estimated useful life. When we sell or retire
 depreciable assets, we remove the related cost and accumulated depreciation
 from
 our accounts, and we recognize gains and losses. Major additions and betterments
 are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs that do not materially improve or
 extend the lives of the respective assets are charged to operations as we incur
 these expenses. 

Capitalized
 Software Costs: We
 capitalize
 qualifying costs related to the acquisition or development of internal-use
 software. Capitalization of costs begins after the conceptual formulation stage
 has been completed. Capitalized costs are amortized over the estimated useful
 life of the software, which ranges between three and five years. Capitalized
 software costs at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, totaled 46.0 million,
 55.1
 million and 42.6 million, net of accumulated amortization of 98.7 million,
 79.2 million and 65.8 million, respectively. 

Impairment
 of Long-Lived Assets: We
 review
 long-lived assets (primarily property, plant and equipment) held and used or
 to
 be disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
 indicate that the net book value of the asset may not be recoverable.
 Recoverability is assessed based on estimated undiscounted cash flows from
 the
 useful asset, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. If the carrying amount of an asset is not
 recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the
 carrying amount exceeds fair value. 

Goodwill
 and Intangible Assets: 
 Goodwill
 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets
 acquired. At December 31, 2006, our goodwill balance totaled 2.6 million.
 Additionally, as of December 31, 2006, we had 7.8 million in intangible assets
 arising from the SAM S CLUB kiosk business acquisition. Pursuant
 to the
 provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and
 intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed
 annually during the fourth quarter for impairment (and in interim periods if
 certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and
 intangible assets may be impaired). We primarily estimate fair values utilizing
 valuation methods such as discounted cash flows. 

Fair
 Value
 of Financial Instruments: 
 The fair value of
 our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable
 approximate their recorded values. Derivative financial instruments are recorded
 at fair value. 

Income
 Taxes: Income
 taxes are
 accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred taxes are
 recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted
 statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the
 financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and
 liabilities. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized
 in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In addition, we
 recognize future tax benefits to the extent that such benefits are more likely
 than not to be realized. See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements below
 for a discussion of FASB Interpretation No. 48 and its anticipated effects
 on
 income taxes in future periods. 

Derivatives:
 We
 use our interest
 rate swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of our long-term fixed
 rate debt to a variable rate. Under these agreements, we pay a variable rate
 of
 LIBOR plus a markup and receive fixed rates ranging from 6.950 to 7.375 .
 We
 have designated these agreements as fair value hedging instruments. The
 accounting for
 changes in the fair value of an interest rate swap is dependent on the use
 of
 the swap. To the extent that a derivative is effective as a hedge of an exposure
 to future changes in fair value, the change in the derivative's fair value
 is
 recorded in earnings, as is the change in fair value of the item being hedged.
 To the extent that a swap is effective as a cash flow hedge of an exposure
 to
 future changes in cash flows, the change in fair value of the swap is deferred
 in accumulated other comprehensive income. Any portion we consider to be
 ineffective is immediately reported in our earnings. The differentials to be
 received or paid under interest rate swap contracts designated as hedges are
 recognized in income over the life of the contracts as adjustments to interest
 expense. Gains and losses on terminations of interest rate contracts designated
 as hedges are deferred and amortized into interest expense over the remaining
 life of the original contracts or until repayment of the hedged indebtedness.
 Through the use of interest rate swap agreements, our net interest expense
 increased by 1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, but
 decreased by 2.8 million and 8.7 million for the years ended December 31,
 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

Our
 exposure to
 market risk, specifically the equity markets, relates to warrants we earned
 as
 of December 31, 2006 and 2005 to purchase 2 million and 4 million shares,
 respectively, of Sirius stock at an exercise price of 5.00 per share. We have
 recorded these as assets using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation method. Our
 maximum exposure is equal to the carrying value at December 31, 2006, of 1.4
 million. 

We
 maintain strict internal controls over our hedging activities, which include
 policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and
 monitoring of all derivative financial instrument activities. We monitor our
 hedging positions and credit worthiness of our counter-parties and do not
 anticipate losses due to our counter-parties nonperformance. We do not hold or
 issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
 To
 qualify for hedge accounting, derivatives must meet defined correlation and
 effectiveness criteria, be designated as a hedge and result in cash flows and
 financial statement effects that substantially offset those of the position
 being hedged. 

Foreign
 Currency Translation: 
 The functional
 currency of substantially all operations outside the U.S. is the applicable
 local currency. Translation gains or losses related to net assets located
 outside the United States are included as a component of accumulated other
 comprehensive (loss) income and are classified in the stockholders equity
 section of the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Comprehensive
 Income: Comprehensive
 income is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise
 during a period, except for those changes resulting from investments by owners
 and distributions to owners. Comprehensive income is composed of net income,
 foreign currency translation adjustments, and amortization of gains and losses
 on an interest rate swap used as a cash flow hedge, which are all shown net
 of
 tax in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity and
 Comprehensive Income. 

Recently
 Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In
 May 2005,
 the
 Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial
 Accounting Standards SFAS 
 No. 154,
 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections - A Replacement of APB Opinion No.
 20
 and FASB Statement No. 3 SFAS No. 154 ). SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective
 application to prior periods financial statements for a change in accounting
 principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific
 effects or the cumulative effect of the change. Additionally, retrospective
 application is not required when explicit transition requirements specific
 to
 newly adopted accounting principles exist. Retrospective application requires
 the cumulative effect of the change on periods prior to those presented to
 be
 reflected in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as of the beginning
 of the first period presented, and the offsetting adjustments to be recorded
 to
 opening retained earnings. SFAS No. 154 retains the guidance contained in APB
 Opinion No. 20 for reporting both the correction of an error in previously
 issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate. We adopted
 the
 provisions of SFAS No. 154, as applicable, at the beginning of fiscal year
 2006,
 and its adoption had no effect on our financial condition or results of
 operations. 

Effective
 January
 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123
 (revised 2004),
 Share-Based Payment SFAS No. 123R .
 SFAS No. 123R
 establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity
 exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. This statement focuses
 primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee
 services in share-based payment transactions. SFAS No. 123R requires that the
 fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the
 historical financial statements as services are performed. We adopted SFAS
 No.
 123R utilizing the modified prospective transition method, which requires that
 we recognize compensation expense for all new and unvested share-based payment
 awards from the January 1, 2006, effective date. As required by SFAS No. 123R,
 we recognized the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions,
 including shares issued under our stock option, stock deferral and stock
 purchase plans, in the financial statements. 

In
 November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs" SFAS No. 151 ).
 This statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory
 Pricing," to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility
 expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material. SFAS No. 151 requires
 that these items be recognized as current period charges and requires allocation
 of fixed production overhead to the cost of conversion be based on the normal
 capacity of the production facilities. We adopted this statement effective
 January 1, 2006. The results of the adoption of this statement did not have
 a
 material impact on our financial condition or results of
 operations. 

In
 September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS
 No. 157"). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
 measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting
 principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This
 statement does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies
 to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
 measurements. The provisions of this statement are to be applied prospectively
 as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this statement is initially
 applied, with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative-effect
 adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The provisions of SFAS
 No. 157 are effective for the fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007;
 therefore, we anticipate adopting this standard as of January 1, 2008. We have
 not determined the effect, if any, the adoption of this statement will have
 on
 our financial condition or results of operations. 

In
 September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined
 Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - an amendment of FASB Statements
 No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" ("SFAS No. 158"). SFAS No. 158 requires employers
 to recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to
 accumulated other comprehensive income to report the funded status of defined
 benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. SFAS No. 158 requires
 prospective application; thus, the recognition and disclosure requirements
 are
 effective for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. Additionally, SFAS No.
 158 requires companies to measure plan assets and obligations at their year-end
 balance sheet date. This requirement is effective for our fiscal year ending
 December 31, 2008. See Note 22 - Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan for
 further discussion on the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158. 

In
 September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering
 the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
 Current Year Financial Statements ("SAB 108"). SAB 108 provides guidance on how
 prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying
 misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining
 whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated. SAB
 108 permits registrants to record the cumulative effect of initial adoption
 by
 recording the necessary "correcting" adjustments to the carrying values of
 assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting
 adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings only if material
 under the dual method. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or after
 November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 had no impact on our financial
 condition or results of operations. 

In
 July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for
 Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 FIN
 48 ). FIN 48 provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and
 measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
 FIN
 48 requires that we recognize in the financial statements the impact of a tax
 position if that position will more likely than not be sustained on audit,
 based
 on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
 derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
 periods, disclosures, and transition provisions. Any transition adjustment
 recognized on the date of adoption will be recorded as an adjustment to retained
 earnings as of the beginning of the adoption period. FIN 48 is effective for
 fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and we adopted FIN 48 as of
 January 1, 2007. Based on our current evaluation, we do not expect the adoption
 of this interpretation to have a material impact on our financial position
 or
 results of operations. 

In
 June 2006, the FASB s Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue
 No. 06-3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental
 Authorities Should be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus
 Net Presentation) EITF 06-3 ). EITF 06-3 requires disclosure of an entity s
 accounting policy regarding the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental
 authority that are directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between
 a
 seller and a customer, including sales, use, value added and some excise taxes.
 Our policy is to exclude all such taxes from revenue on a net reporting
 basis.

During
 the fourth
 quarter of fiscal year 2004, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain
 liabilities of Wireless Retail, Inc. WRI ). These assets included wireless
 kiosks and inventory located within SAM S CLUB retail locations. The acquisition
 was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as prescribed in
 SFAS
 No. 141, Business Combinations SFAS No. 141 ). In accordance with SFAS No.
 141, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
 assumed based on estimates of their respective fair values at the date of
 acquisition. Fair values were determined principally by independent valuations
 and supported by internal studies. The total purchase price of 59.6 million
 was
 allocated primarily to fixed assets, goodwill and a separately identifiable
 intangible asset, which is our contract with SAM S CLUB. The final purchase
 price allocation to goodwill and to intangibles was 18.6 million and 32.1
 million, respectively. 

The
 intangible
 asset associated with our contract with SAM S CLUB is being amortized over five
 years and the estimated amortization expense for years ending December 31,
 2007,
 2008, and 2009 is 2.9 million, 2.9 million, and 2.0 million,
 respectively. 

All
 financial
 impacts of the WRI purchase and adjustments of carrying values are recorded
 under the kiosk segment. 

As
 a result of continued company and wireless industry growth challenges, together
 with changes in our senior leadership team during the third quarter of 2006
 that
 resulted in a refocus on allocation of capital and resources towards other
 areas
 of our business, we determined that our long-lived assets, including goodwill
 associated with our kiosk operations, were impaired. We performed impairment
 tests on both the long-lived assets associated with our SAM'S CLUB agreement,
 including the intangible asset relating to the five year agreement, and the
 accompanying goodwill. 

With
 respect to the
 long-lived tangible and intangible assets, we compared their carrying values
 with their estimated fair values using a discounted cash flow model, which
 reflected our lowered expectations of wireless revenue growth and the ceased
 expansion of our kiosk business, and determined that the intangible asset
 relating to the five year agreement was impaired. This assessment resulted
 in a
 10.7 million impairment charge to the intangible asset related to our
 kiosk segment. The remaining intangible balance will be amortized over the
 remaining life of the SAM'S CLUB agreement, which is scheduled to expire in
 September 2009. The balance at December 31, 2006, was 7.8 million. 

With
 respect to the
 goodwill of 18.6 million, we estimated the fair value of the SAM'S CLUB
 reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model similar to that used in the
 long-lived asset impairment test. We compared it with the carrying value of
 the
 reporting unit and determined that the goodwill was impaired. As the carrying
 value of the reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, we then compared
 the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount
 of goodwill. This resulted in an 18.6 million impairment of goodwill related
 to
 our kiosk segment.

The

 our long-term debt of 506.0 million and 511.1 million at December 31, 2006
 and
 2005, respectively (including current portion, but excluding capital leases),
 was approximately 519.4 million and 534.8 million, respectively. The fair
 values were computed using interest rates which were in effect at the balance
 sheet dates for similar debt instruments. 

Our
 senior
 unsecured debt primarily consists of two issuances of 10-year long-term notes
 and an issuance of medium-term notes. 

Long-Term
 Notes: 
 We have a 300.0
 million debt shelf registration statement which became effective in August
 1997.
 In August 1997, we issued 150.0 million of 10-year unsecured long-term notes
 under this shelf registration. The interest rate on the notes is 6.95 per
 annum
 with interest payable on September 1 and March 1 of each year. These notes
 contain customary non-financial covenants and are due September 1,
 2007. 

On
 May 11, 2001, we issued 350.0 million of 10-year 7.375 notes in a private
 offering to initial purchasers who in turn offered the notes to qualified
 institutional buyers under SEC Rule 144A. The annual interest rate on the notes
 is 7.375 per annum with interest payable on November 15 and May 15 of each
 year. The notes contain certain non-financial covenants and mature on May 15,
 2011. In August 2001, under the terms of an exchange offering filed with the
 SEC, we exchanged substantially all of these notes for a similar amount of
 publicly registered notes. The exchange resulted in substantially all of the
 notes becoming registered with the SEC and did not result in additional debt
 being issued. 

During
 the third
 quarter of 2001, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with an
 underlying notional amount of 110.5 million and a maturity in September 2007.
 In June and August 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with
 underlying notional amounts of debt of 100.0 million and 50.0 million,
 respectively, and both with maturities in May 2011. These swaps effectively
 convert a portion of our long-term fixed rate debt to a variable rate. We
 entered into these agreements to balance our fixed versus floating rate debt
 portfolio to continue to take advantage of lower short-term interest rates.
 Under these agreements, we have contracted to pay a variable rate of LIBOR
 plus
 a markup and to receive a fixed rate of 6.95 for the swap entered into in
 2001
 and 7.375 for the swaps entered into in 2003. We have designated these
 agreements as fair value hedging instruments. We
 recorded an
 amount in other non-current liabilities, net, of 8.5 million and 7.6 million
 (their fair value) at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, for the swap
 agreements and adjusted the fair value of the related debt by the same amount.
 Fair value was computed based on the market s current anticipation of quarterly
 LIBOR rate levels from the present until the swaps maturity. 

Medium-Term
 Notes: 
 We also issued, in
 various amounts and on various dates from December 1997 through September 1999,
 medium-term notes totaling 150.0 million under the shelf registration described
 above. At December 31, 2006, 5.0 million of these notes remained outstanding.
 The interest rate at December 31, 2006, for the outstanding 5.0 million in
 medium-term notes was 6.42 . These notes contain customary non-financial
 covenants and mature in January 2008. As of December 31, 2006, there was no
 availability under this shelf registration.

Our
 short-term
 credit facilities, including revolving credit lines, are summarized in the
 accompanying short-term borrowing facilities table above. The method used
 to
 compute averages in the short-term borrowing facilities table is based on
 a
 daily weighted average computation that takes into consideration the time
 period
 such debt was outstanding, as well as the amount outstanding. Our financing,
 primarily short-term debt, if utilized, would consist primarily of borrowings
 under our credit facilities, which is described in more detail
 below. 

Credit
 Facilities: 
 At December 31,
 2006, we had an aggregate of 625 million borrowing capacity available under
 our
 existing credit facilities. These facilities consist of the
 following: 

Amount
 of
 Facility 

Expiration
 Date 

300
 million 

June
 2009 

325
 million 

May
 2011 

These
 credit
 facilities support commercial paper issuance, as well as provide us a source
 of
 liquidity if the commercial paper market is unavailable to us. As of December
 31, 2006, there were no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities,
 nor were these facilities utilized during 2006. Interest charges under these
 facilities are derived using a base LIBOR rate plus a margin which changes
 based
 on our credit ratings. Our bank syndicated credit facilities have customary
 terms and covenants, and we were in compliance with these covenants at December
 31, 2006. 

In
 June 2006, we replaced our existing 300 million five-year credit facility,
 which was to expire in June 2007, with a 325 million five-year credit agreement
 expiring May 2011. The new facility has a more favorable fixed charge coverage
 ratio and provides for the exclusion of cash turnaround expenses from the
 covenant calculation. We also amended the 300 million facility expiring in
 June
 2009 to include the similar covenants and terminated our 130 million 364-day
 revolving credit facility. 

NOTE

 CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE 

During
 the fourth
 quarter of 2005, we adopted FASB Interpretation FIN No. 47, Accounting for
 Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations" FIN 47 ), which is an interpretation
 of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" SFAS No. 143 ).
 This interpretation clarified terminology within SFAS No. 143 and requires
 an
 entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset
 retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be
 reasonably estimated. A conditional asset retirement obligation is a legal
 obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method
 of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within
 the control of the entity. We are often legally obligated to remove leasehold
 improvements and fixtures whenever we vacate a leased premise, although the
 date
 or method of settlement may not be known. We recognized a one-time after-tax,
 non-cash charge of 2.9 million, which is reflected in the Consolidated
 Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2005, as a cumulative
 effect of change in accounting principle. This charge represents the difference
 between the asset retirement obligation and capitalized asset retirement costs
 recognized in our December 31, 2005, Consolidated Balance Sheet.

We
 anticipate that we will generate sufficient pre-tax income in the future to
 realize the full benefit of U.S. deferred tax assets related to future
 deductible amounts. Accordingly, a valuation allowance was not required at
 December 31, 2006 or 2005. Our
 tax returns are
 subject to examination by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The
 Internal Revenue Service is currently in the process of concluding its
 examination of our federal income tax returns for the taxable years from 1998
 through 2001. Several states are also currently in the process of examining
 our
 state income tax returns. We record tax reserves based on our best estimate
 of
 current tax exposures in the relevant jurisdictions. Effective January 1, 2007,
 we began recognizing uncertain tax positions based on our assessment of whether
 the tax position was more likely than not to be sustained on audit, as set
 forth
 under FIN 48. While we believe that the reserves recorded in the consolidated
 financial statements accurately reflect our tax exposures, our actual tax
 liabilities may ultimately differ from those estimates if we prevail in matters
 for which accruals have been established, or if taxing authorities successfully
 challenge the tax treatment upon which our management has based its estimates.
 Accordingly, our effective tax rate for a particular period may materially
 change. 

During
 2005, we
 recognized a non-cash income tax benefit of 56.5 million resulting from the
 release of a tax contingency reserve. This reserve related to losses sustained
 in connection with our European operations, which were fully dissolved by 1995.
 The release of the reserve occurred in 2005 because the statute of limitations
 governing these issues expired on September 30, 2005. 

The
 American Jobs
 Creation Act of 2004 AJC Act was signed into law on October 22, 2004, and
 provided a one-time elective incentive to repatriate foreign earnings by
 providing an 85 dividends received deduction, reducing the effective federal
 income tax rate on such earnings from 35 to 5.25 . We repatriated 49.4 million
 of foreign earnings during 2005. As we had not previously reflected any amounts
 in our financial statements as earnings permanently invested outside the United
 States, a total tax benefit of 8.9 million was recognized in 2005 related
 to
 the repatriation. 

NOTE

 LITIGATION 

 We
 are currently a party to various class action lawsuits alleging that we
 misclassified certain RadioShack store managers as exempt from overtime in
 violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or similar state laws, including
 a
 lawsuit styled Alphonse L. Perez, et al. v. RadioShack Corporation, filed on
 October 31, 2002, in the United States District Court for the Northern District
 of Illinois. We have reached a tentative settlement with counsel for the Perez
 plaintiffs and four other wage-hour lawsuits pending against us. This global
 settlement would result in a payment by us of approximately 8.8 million, in
 the
 aggregate, to resolve all five of the pending lawsuits. Of this amount, a charge
 of 8.5 million was recognized during the quarter ended June 30, 2006, with
 the
 balance recognized during the quarter ended September 30, 2006. The respective
 courts will need to approve the tentative settlement. We anticipate the
 settlement will ultimately be approved by each court. If, however, a final
 settlement is not approved, we nevertheless believe we have meritorious
 defenses, and in such event we would continue to vigorously defend these
 cases. 

We
 have various other pending claims, lawsuits, disputes with third parties,
 investigations and actions incidental to the operation of our business. Although
 occasional adverse settlements or resolutions may occur and negatively impact
 earnings in the period or year of settlement, it is our belief that their
 ultimate resolution will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
 condition or liquidity.

 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 

 Lease
 Commitments: We
 lease rather
 than own most of our facilities. Our lease agreements expire at various dates
 through January 2026. Some of these leases are subject to renewal options and
 provide for the payment of taxes, insurance and maintenance. Our retail
 locations comprise the largest portion of our leased facilities. These locations
 are primarily in major shopping malls and shopping centers owned by other
 companies. Some leases are based on a minimum rental plus a percentage of the
 store's sales in excess of a stipulated base figure (contingent rent). Certain
 leases contain escalation clauses. We also lease distribution centers and our
 corporate campus described as in Note 14 - "Sale and Leaseback
 Transaction." Additionally, we lease automobiles and information
 systems equipment. 

Future
 minimum rent
 commitments at December 31, 2006, under non-cancelable operating leases (net
 of
 immaterial amounts of sublease rent income), as well as the minimum lease
 payments required by the campus lease over the initial 20-year lease term,
 are
 included in the following table.

From
 time to time,
 we enter into store operating leases that provide for free or reduced rental
 periods, usually during the finish-out of our retail locations before the store
 opens for business. These periods are commonly referred to as rent holidays 
and average 60 days. Prior to January 2005, we did not recognize straight-line
 rent expense during the pre-opening rent holiday period but rather began
 recording rent expense from the day the store opened. Beginning January 1,
 2005,
 we began including the rent holiday period in our straight-line rent
 calculation. This change did not have a material impact on our results of
 operations or financial position. 

Contingent
 Liabilities: We
 have contingent
 liabilities related to retail leases of locations that were assigned to other
 businesses. The majority of these contingent liabilities relate to various
 lease
 obligations arising from leases that were assigned to CompUSA as part of the
 sale of our Computer City, Inc. subsidiary to CompUSA, in August 1998. In the
 event CompUSA or the other assignees, as applicable, are unable to fulfill
 these
 obligations, we would be responsible for rent due under the leases. Our rent
 exposure from the remaining undiscounted lease commitments (assuming no
 projected sublease income) is approximately 92 million. However, we have no
 reason to believe that CompUSA or the other assignees will not fulfill their
 obligations under these leases or that we would be unable to sublet the
 properties; consequently, we do not believe there will be a material impact
 on
 our consolidated financial statements as a result of the eventual resolution
 of
 these lease obligations. 

Purchase
 Obligations: 
 We have purchase
 obligations of 254.1 million at December 31, 2006, which include our product
 commitments, marketing agreements and freight commitments. Of this amount,
 235.4 million relates to 2007. 

NOTE
 14 -
 SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTION 

 In
 December 2005, we entered into a sale and leaseback transaction of our corporate
 headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas. Under the terms of the arrangement, we sold
 our corporate campus, including the underlying land, for 220.4 million in
 net
 proceeds and will lease it back for a period of 20 years. This transaction
 qualified for sale-leaseback accounting; therefore, the asset was removed from
 the balance sheet and the lease has been accounted for as an operating lease.
 The gain of 4.0 million realized on this transaction has been deferred and
 will
 be amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the
 lease. 

The
 operating lease
 is structured as a triple-net lease, under which we are responsible for the
 insurance, taxes and maintenance on the property. During the 20 year initial
 lease term, the lease agreement requires an annual increase of 1.25 in base
 rent. The average annual rent expense will be recognized on a straight-line
 basis over the term of the lease. At the expiration of the initial lease term,
 the lease contains four 5-year renewal options, which may be exercised at our
 sole discretion. 

NOTE
 15 -
 STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS 

 We
 have implemented several plans to award employees stock-based compensation,
 which are described below. Under the Incentive Stock Plans ISPs described
 below, the exercise price of options must be equal to or greater than the fair
 market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant. The 1997,
 1999
 and 2001 ISPs each terminate after ten years; no option or award may be granted
 under the ISPs after the ISP termination date. The Management Development and
 Compensation Committee MD C of our Board of Directors specifies the
 terms for grants of options under these ISPs; terms of these options may not
 exceed ten years. Grants of options generally vest over three years and grants
 typically have a term of seven or ten years. However, during the third quarter
 of 2006, we granted 1.7 million options under these ISPs to our chief executive
 officer and chief financial officer which vest over four years from the date
 of
 grant with a term of seven years. Option agreements issued under the ISPs
 generally provide that, in the event of a change in control, all options become
 immediately and fully exercisable. Repricing or exchanging options for lower
 priced options is not permitted under the ISPs without shareholder
 approval. 

In
 addition to the ISPs described below, we granted 2.5 million non-plan options
 to
 our chief executive officer on July 6, 2006, as part of an inducement grant
 related to the terms of his employment. These options vest over four years
 from
 the date of grant with a term of seven years. A market condition is attached
 to
 2.0 million of these non-plan options that restricts exercise until certain
 stock price hurdles are achieved. This grant was in addition to the 1.5 million
 options granted to the chief executive officer on this day under the 1997,
 1999
 and 2001 ISPs. 

In
 2004 the stockholders approved the RadioShack 2004 Deferred Stock Unit Plan
 for
 Non-Employee Directors Deferred Plan ). The Deferred Plan replaced the
 one-time and annual stock option grants to non-employee directors Directors as specified in the 1997, 1999 and 2001 ISPs. New
 Directors
 receive a one-time grant of 5,000 deferred stock units Units on the date
 they attend their first Board meeting. The Deferred Plan also specifies that
 each Director who has served one year or more as of June 1 of any year will
 automatically be granted 3,500 Units on the first business day of June of each
 year in which he or she serves as a Director. Under
 the Deferred
 Plan, one-third of the Units vest annually over three years from the date of
 grant. Vesting may be accelerated under certain circumstances. At termination
 of
 service, death, disability or change in control of RadioShack, Directors will
 receive shares of common stock equal to the number of vested Units. Directors
 may receive these shares in a lump sum or they may defer receipt of these shares
 in equal installments over a period of up to ten years. There were 107,672
 Units
 outstanding and 876,632 Units available for grant at December 31,
 2006. 

A
 brief description of each of our stock plans follows: 

1993
 Incentive Stock Plan 1993 ISP ): The
 1993 ISP
 permitted the grant of up to 12.0 million shares in the form of incentive stock
 options ISOs ), non-qualified stock options (options which are not ISOs)
 NQs and restricted stock. There were no shares available on December 31,
 2006, for grants under the 1993 ISP. The 1993 ISP expired March 28, 2003, and
 no
 further grants may be made under this plan. 

1994
 Stock
 Incentive Plan 1994 SIP ): 
 As part of our
 purchase of RadioShack Installation Services AmeriLink in 1999, we assumed
 the existing AmeriLink 1994 Stock Incentive Plan and certain related agreements
 and agreed to convert AmeriLink s stock options to stock options to purchase our
 stock, subject to an agreed upon exchange ratio and conversion price. Thus,
 the
 AmeriLink 1994 SIP was assumed and adopted by us in 1999. All options in the
 1994 SIP were fully vested on the date of transition and management has
 determined that no further grants will be made under this plan; there were
 no
 shares available for grant at December 31, 2006, under the 1994 SIP. There
 were
 also certain restricted stock agreements that were assumed by us at the time
 of
 acquisition. On September 10, 2003, we sold AmeriLink. The 1994 SIP expired
 on
 December 31, 2004, and no further grants may be made under this
 plan. 

1997
 Incentive
 Stock Plan 1997 ISP ): 
 The 1997 ISP
 permits the grant of up to 11.0 million shares in the form of ISOs, NQs and
 restricted stock. The 1997 ISP provides that the maximum number of shares of
 our
 common stock that an eligible employee may receive in any calendar year with
 respect to options may not exceed 1.0 million shares. There were 1,300,971
 shares available on December 31, 2006, for grants under the 1997 ISP. The 1997
 ISP will expire on February 27, 2007. 

1999
 Incentive Stock Plan 1999 ISP ): The
 1999 ISP
 permits the grant of up to 9.5 million shares in the form of NQs. Grants of
 restricted stock, performance awards and options intended to qualify as ISO s
 under the Internal Revenue Code are not authorized under the 1999 ISP. The
 1999
 ISP provides that the maximum number of shares of our common stock that an
 eligible employee may receive in any calendar year with respect to options
 may
 not exceed 1.0 million shares. There were 1,231,264 shares available on December
 31, 2006, for grants under the 1999 ISP. 

2001
 Incentive Stock Plan 2001 ISP ): The
 2001 ISP
 permits the grant of up to 9.2 million shares in the form of ISOs and NQs.
 The
 2001 ISP provides that the maximum number of shares of our common stock that
 an
 eligible employee may receive in any calendar year with respect to options
 may
 not exceed 0.5 million shares. There were 5,074,277 shares available on December
 31, 2006, for grants under the 2001 ISP.

 As
 of December 31, 2006, 71,369 shares of restricted stock were outstanding.
 Compensation expense related to restricted shares is recognized ratably over
 the
 requisite service period. This expense totaled 0.2 million
 and 0.7
 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. There
 was
 no expense for the year ended December 31, 2004. 

NOTE

 DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS 

 The
 Executive
 Deferred Compensation Plan EDCP and the Executive Deferred Stock Plan
 EDSP became effective on April 1, 1998. These plans permit employees who are
 corporate or division officers to defer up to 80 of their base salary and/or
 bonuses. Certain executive officers may defer up to 100 of their base salary
 and/or bonuses. In addition, officers are permitted to defer under the EDSP
 delivery of any restricted stock or stock acquired under an NQ exercise that
 would otherwise vest. Cash deferrals under the EDCP may be made in mutual funds.
 We match 12 of salary and bonus deferrals in the form of our common stock
 under
 the EDCP and EDSP. Under the EDSP, participants receive only our common stock.
 Under the EDSP we match an additional 25 of salary and bonus deferrals if
 the
 deferral period exceeds five years and the deferrals are invested in our common
 stock. 

We
 contributed 0.6 million, 0.7 million and 0.9 million in total to the combined
 EDCP and EDSP for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
 respectively. These expenses were included in SG A. Employee deferrals and
 employer contributions to the EDCP and EDSP were discontinued effective January
 1, 2007, and any unvested Company matching contributions remaining as of
 December 31, 2006, were immediately vested. All account balances, including
 Company matching contributions, under these plans will be distributed in the
 first half of 2007. Accruals related to these plans are recorded as a current
 liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaling 27.8 million at December
 31, 2006, and will be eliminated upon distribution during the first half of
 2007. 

NOTE
 17 -
 TERMINATION PROTECTION PLANS 

 On
 May 18, 2006, our Board of Directors approved amendments to RadioShack s
 Termination Protection Plan (Level I) (the Level I Plan ). The Level I Plan
 applies to our officers (other than officers that are parties to a Termination
 Protection Agreement with RadioShack). The amendments to the Level I Plan
 include a modification that requires us to pay a comparable benefit amount
 equal
 to a specified percentage of a participant s base salary rather than requiring
 us to provide certain named employee benefits for one year. The Board of
 Directors also approved the adoption of an Officers Severance Program, a
 uniform severance program to apply to officers in the event of non-cause
 terminations. 

Our
 Board of
 Directors also approved the termination of the Termination Protection Plan
 (Level II) (the Level II Plan ). The Level II Plan provided for defined
 termination benefits to be paid to certain of our eligible, non-officer
 employees who have been terminated, without cause, in connection with a change
 in control of RadioShack. In lieu of the Level II Plan, the Board of Directors
 approved a severance program for eligible, non-officer employees who are
 terminated under certain circumstances. 

There
 have been no
 payments under the Level I Plan or Level II Plan for the years
 shown.

 RADIOSHACK
 INVESTMENT PLAN 

 On
 April 30, 2004, we amended our employee stock purchase plan and renamed it
 the
 RadioShack Investment Plan (the Investment Plan ). Only employees participating
 in the former plan as of April 29, 2004, could participate in the Investment
 Plan. New employees were not eligible to participate in the Investment Plan.
 Effective June 30, 2006, the Investment Plan was suspended and distributions
 of
 all shares held by the Investment Plan took place in August 2006. As of December
 31, 2006, the Investment Plan did not hold any assets nor have any employee
 participants. Our 
 contributions to
 the Investment Plan amounted to 5.6 million, 10.9 million and 13.6 million
 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

NOTE

 RADIOSHACK 401(k) PLAN 

 The
 RadioShack
 401(k) Plan 401(k) Plan ), a defined contribution plan, was amended on July 1,
 2006, and, as amended, allows a participant to defer, via payroll deductions,
 from 1 to 75 of their annual compensation, limited to certain annual maximums
 set by the Internal Revenue Code. The amended 401(k) Plan also presently
 provides that our contribution 
 to each
 participant s account maintained under the 401(k) Plan be an amount equal to
 100 of the participant s contributions up to 4 of their annual compensation.
 This percentage contribution made by us is discretionary and may change in
 the
 future. 
 Our contributions
 go directly to the 401(k) Plan and are made in cash and invested in an age
 appropriate retirement fund for each participant; however, participants may
 immediately reinvest our contribution into other investment alternatives
 provided by the 401(k) Plan.

 REPURCHASE PROGRAM 

 On
 February 25, 2005, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program
 with no expiration date authorizing management to repurchase up to 250 million
 in open market purchases. We
 repurchased 4.7
 million shares of our common stock for 125.8 million for the year ended
 December 31, 2005, under our approved repurchase programs, but excluding the
 overnight share repurchase program OSR. The
 funding
 required for these repurchases came from net cash generated from operating
 activities and cash and cash equivalents. W e
 also repurchased
 shares in the open market in 2005 to offset the sales of shares to our employee
 benefit plans. As of December 31, 2006 ,
 there was 209.9
 million available under the 250 million share repurchase program. Management
 suspended purchases under the 250 million share repurchase program, while
 we
 completed the OSR described below. As of December 31, 2006, management had
 not
 resumed share repurchases under the 250 million program. 

On
 August 5, 2005, we entered into an agreement with a financial institution to
 purchase 20 million shares of our common stock from the financial institution
 under the OSR. The average share price upon completion of the transaction was
 24.15. We funded this payment from available cash on hand and short-term
 borrowings in the commercial paper market. 

NOTE
 21 -
 PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS 

 In
 July 1999, we amended and restated a stockholder rights plan which declared
 a
 dividend of one right for each outstanding share of our common stock. The rights
 plan, as amended and restated, was scheduled to expire on July 26, 2009;
 however, as discussed below, the rights plan was amended to terminate the plan
 effective January 31, 2006. The rights were represented by our common stock
 certificates. If the rights became exercisable, they would have entitled each
 holder to purchase 1/10,000th of a share of our Series A Junior Participating
 Preferred Stock for an exercise price of 250 (subject to adjustment). The
 rights would have become exercisable and traded separately from the common
 stock
 only upon the date of public announcement that a person, entity or group
 ("Person") had acquired 15 or more of our outstanding common stock without
 the
 consent or approval of the disinterested directors ("Acquiring Person") or
 ten
 days after the commencement or public announcement of a tender or exchange
 offer
 which would have resulted in any Person becoming an Acquiring Person. In the
 event that any Person became an Acquiring Person, the rights would have been
 exercisable for 60 days thereafter for our common stock with a market value
 (as
 determined under the rights plan) equal to twice the exercise price. In the
 event that, after any Person became an Acquiring Person, we engaged in certain
 mergers, consolidations, or sales of assets representing 50 or more of our
 assets or earning power with an Acquiring Person (or Persons acting on behalf
 of
 or in concert with an Acquiring Person) or in which all holders of common stock
 are not treated alike, the rights would have been exercisable for common stock
 of the acquiring or surviving company with a market value (as determined under
 the rights plan) equal to twice the exercise price. The rights would not have
 been exercisable by any Acquiring Person. The rights were redeemable at a price
 of 0.01 per right prior to any Person becoming an Acquiring Person or, under
 certain circumstances, after a Person became an Acquiring Person. 

On
 January 13, 2006, the rights plan was amended to provide that the plan would
 terminate effective January 31, 2006. As a result of this amendment, the rights
 are no longer outstanding and were not exercisable after January 31,
 2006. 

NOTE

 SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN 

Prior
 to January 1,
 2006, several officers of the Company were participants in RadioShack s Salary
 Continuation Plan SCP or its Deferred Compensation Plan DCP and, together
 with the SCP, the Plans ), which provided a defined benefit to be paid out over
 a ten-year period upon retirement between the ages of 55 and 70. Participation
 in the Plans and the benefit payments were based solely on the MD C s
 discretion and approval, and the benefit payments did not bear any relationship
 to a participant s present compensation, final compensation or years of service.
 We accrued benefit payments earned based on the provisions set forth by the
 MD C for each individual person. Based on the method by which the Plans were
 administered and because there was not a specific plan governing the benefit
 payment calculation, the accounting and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 87,
 Employers Accounting for Pensions, were not previously required.

The
 Company adopted
 an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP effective January 1,
 2006, for selected officers of the Company. Upon retirement at age 55 years
 or
 older, participants in the SERP are eligible to receive, for ten years, an
 annual amount equal to a percentage of the average of their five highest
 consecutive years of compensation (base salary and bonus), to be paid in 120
 monthly installments. The amount of the percentage increases by 2 for each
 year of participation in the SERP, up to a maximum of 50 . 

To
 be a participant in the SERP, officers who were participants in the SCP or
 DCP
 had to withdraw from the applicable plan and would then only receive benefits
 under the SERP. These benefits are calculated under the SERP using
 a formula that calculates the benefit under each plan (SERP,
 SCP or DCP) and pays the participant the highest dollar benefit. 

If
 a SERP participant terminates employment due to retirement or disability between
 the ages of 55 and 70, the participant is entitled to his or her normal vested
 SERP benefit, paid in 120 equal monthly payments. 

Based
 on the
 effective date of the SERP of January 1, 2006, fiscal year 2006 was the initial
 year in which an actuarial valuation was performed. The projected benefit
 obligation at the beginning of the year represents the actuarial valuation
 that
 was performed as of January 1, 2006, based on the information and assumptions
 developed at that time. Participants in the SERP as of January 1, 2006, were
 given credit for prior service as an officer. Therefore, this service credit
 generated prior service costs that are not required to be immediately
 recognized, but that are amortized for purposes of the net periodic benefit
 cost
 calculation over the estimated average remaining service period for active
 employee participants. 

We
 use the last day of the calendar year as a measurement date for determining
 SERP
 obligations. The following table sets forth the SERP s change in projected
 benefit obligation for the plan for 2006:

As
 a result of corporate and field cost reductions, several officers were
 terminated in the latter part of 2006, resulting in 2.3 million in
 curtailments. Additionally, the long-term portion of the accrued benefit cost
 of
 29.4 million is included in other non-current liabilities, and the short-term
 portion of 5.0 million is included in accrued expenses and other current
 liabilities in the 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

The
 projected
 benefit obligation PBO and accumulated benefit obligation for the plan at
 December 31, 2006, were 34.4 million and 33.5 million, respectively.

The
 components of
 net periodic benefit cost were as follows:

We
 base our discount rate on the rates of return available on high-quality bonds
 with maturities approximating the expected period over which the pension
 benefits will be paid. The rate of compensation increase is based on historical
 and expected increases. 

As
 the SERP is an unfunded plan, benefit payments are made from the general assets

In

 recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated
 other comprehensive loss to report the funded status of defined benefit pension
 and other postretirement benefit plans. SFAS No. 158 was effective as of
 December 31, 2006. See Note 2 - "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"

 TURNAROUND PROGRAM 

 On
 February 17, 2006, as a result of unfavorable profitability experienced within
 our RadioShack company-operated stores during 2005, we announced the
 commencement of a turnaround program. The turnaround program was developed
 to
 identify opportunities to rationalize our cost structure and increase average
 unit volume and profitable square footage in our RadioShack company-operated
 stores. The original terms of the turnaround program consisted of the closing
 of
 400-700 company-operated stores, consolidating certain of our distribution
 centers, streamlining our overhead infrastructure, and updating our merchandise
 inventory. 

The
 actual charges
 for initiatives under the turnaround program were recorded in the period in
 which we committed to formalized restructuring plans or executed the specific
 actions contemplated by the program and all criteria for restructuring charge
 recognition under the applicable accounting guidance had been met. Charges
 incurred as part of the turnaround program are recorded in cost of products
 sold; selling, general and administrative expense; and depreciation and
 amortization with the exception of the asset impairment charges, which are
 disclosed in a separate caption within our Consolidated Statements of
 Income. 

Store
 Closures: As
 of December 31,
 2006, we had closed 481 stores as a result of our turnaround program. Our
 decision to close these stores was made on a store-by-store basis, and there
 was
 no geographic concentration of closings for these stores. 

For
 these closed
 stores, we recognized a charge in 2006 of 9.1 million to SG A for future
 lease obligations and negotiated buy-outs with landlords. A lease obligation
 reserve is not recognized until a store has been closed or when a buy-out
 agreement has been reached with the landlord. 

Regarding
 the 481
 stores we closed as a result of the turnaround program during the year ended
 December 31, 2006, we recorded an impairment charge of 9.2 million related
 to
 the long-lived assets associated with certain of these stores. It was determined
 that the net book value of several of the stores' long-lived assets was not
 recoverable based on the remaining estimated future cash flows related to these
 specific stores. We also recognized 2.1 million in accelerated depreciation
 associated with closed store assets for which the useful lives had been changed
 due to the store closures. 

In
 connection with these store closures, we identified 601 retail employees whose
 positions were terminated by December 31, 2006. These employees were paid
 severance, and some earned retention bonuses if they remained employed to
 certain agreed-upon dates. The development of a reserve for these costs began
 on
 the date that the terms of severance benefits were established and communicated
 to the employees, and the reserve was recognized over the minimum retention
 period. As of December 31, 2006, 3.8 million has been recognized in SG A as
 retention and severance benefits for store employees, with 3.6 million in
 benefits paid to date. 

Additionally,
 as
 part of our store closure activities, we incurred and recognized in SG A
 6.1 million in expenses in 2006 primarily in connection with fees paid to
 outside liquidators and for close-out promotional activities for the 481
 stores. 

Distribution
 Center Consolidations: We
 closed a
 distribution center located in Southaven, Mississippi, and sold a distribution
 center in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2006. During the year ended December
 31, 2006, we recognized a lease obligation charge in SG A in the amount
 of 2.0 million on the sale of the Southaven distribution center and a gain
 of
 2.7 million on the sale of the Charleston distribution center. We also incurred
 a 0.5 million charge related to severance for approximately 100 employees.
 Additionally, there were 0.4 million in other expenses. 

Service
 Center Operations: We
 closed or sold
 five service center locations during the year ended December 31, 2006, resulting
 in the elimination of approximately 350 positions. We recognized a charge to
 SG A of 1.2 million and 0.9 million related to lease obligations and
 severance, respectively. This severance obligation was paid as of December
 31,
 2006. Additionally, there were 0.1 million in other expenses. 

Overhead
 Cost Reductions: Management
 conducted a review of our cost structure to identify potential sources of cost
 reductions. In connection with this review, we made decisions to lower these
 costs, including reducing our advertising spend rate in connection with
 adjustments to our media mix. 

During
 the year
 ended December 31, 2006, we reduced our workforce by approximately 514
 positions, primarily within our corporate headquarters. We recorded charges
 to
 SG A for termination benefits and related costs of 11.9 million, of which
 6.4 million had been paid as of December 31, 2006. 

Inventory
 Update: We
 have been
 replacing underperforming merchandise with new, faster-moving merchandise.
 We
 recorded a pre-tax charge to cost of products sold of approximately 62 million
 during the fourth quarter of 2005, as a result of both our normal inventory
 review process and the inventory update aspect of our turnaround
 program.

 following table

All

 landlords; however, remaining lease obligations still exist at December 31,
 2006. There is uncertainty as to when, and at what cost, we will fully settle
 all remaining lease obligations. See the allocation of our turnaround charges
 within our segments in Note 27 - Segment Reporting.

 During
 the fourth quarter of 2005, we recognized a non-cash year-end inventory
 obsolescence charge of 62.0 million, as a result of both our normal inventory
 review process and the inventory update aspect of our turnaround program.

(2) 
 During
 the third quarter of 2005, we recognized a non-cash income tax benefit of 56.5
 million as a result of the release of a tax contingency reserve (see Note 11).
 We also recognized a total tax benefit of 8.9 million in 2005 related to 49.4
 million of repatriated foreign earnings as a result of the AJC Act of which
 2.9
 million and 6.0 million related to the third and fourth quarters of 2005,
 respectively. 

 (3) 
 FIN
 No. 47 became effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005;
 therefore, we adopted this interpretation during the fourth quarter of 2005.
 As
 a result, we recognized a one-time after-tax, non-cash charge of 2.9 million,
 which is reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
 as
 permitted by FIN 47 (see Note 8). 

The
 sum of the
 quarterly income (loss) per share amounts may not total to each full year amount
 because these computations are made independently for each quarter and for
 the
 full year and take into account the weighted average number of common stock
 equivalent shares outstanding for each period, including the effect of dilutive
 securities for that period. 

NOTE
 27 - SEGMENT
 REPORTING 

 We
 have two reportable segments, RadioShack company-operated stores (excluding
 Canadian company-operated stores) and kiosks. RadioShack consists solely of
 our
 4,467 company-operated retail stores, all operating under the RadioShack brand
 name. Kiosks consist of our network of 772 kiosks, primarily located in major
 shopping malls and SAM S CLUB locations. Both of our reportable segments engage
 in the sale of consumer electronic products; however, our kiosks primarily
 offer
 wireless products and associated accessories. These reportable segments are
 managed separately due to our kiosks narrow product offerings, and performance
 relative to size. 

We
 evaluate the performance of each reportable segment based on operating income,
 which is defined as sales less cost of products sold and certain direct
 operating expenses, including labor and occupancy costs. Asset balances by
 reportable segment have not been included in the segment table below, as these
 are managed on a company-wide level and are not allocated to each segment for
 management reporting purposes. 

The
 table below
 shows our 2006 turnaround program costs and impairments allocated by reportable
 segments.

11. AMENDMENT
 AND
 TERMINATION. 

(a) Amendment
 of
 Program .
 The Program may
 be amended by the Board at any time with or without prior notice; provided,
 however, that any amendment of the Program during the thirty six (36)-month
 period immediately following the Effective Date which is less favorable to
 a
 Participant shall not be effective as to such Participant unless the Participant

 of
 Program .

(c) No
 Adverse
 Affect .
 If the Program is
 amended, terminated, or suspended in accordance with Section 11(a) or
 11(b) above, such action shall not adversely affect the benefits under the

 termination or suspension) is entitled. 

6 

(d) Code
 Section 409A .
 It is intended
 that this Program and the Committee s exercise of authority or discretion
 hereunder shall comply with the provisions of Code Section 409A and the
 treasury regulations relating thereto so as not to subject a Participant
 to the
 payment of interest and tax penalty which may be imposed under Code
 Section 409A. In furtherance of this interest, to the extent that any
 regulations or other guidance issued under Code Section 409A after the
 Effective Date would result in a Participant being subject to payment of
 interest and tax penalty under Code Section 409A, the Committee may amend
 this Program, including with respect to the timing of payment of benefits,
 in
 order to avoid the application of Code Section 409A. 

12. MISCELLANEOUS. 

(a) Offset .
 Severance
 Benefits shall be reduced by any severance or similar payment or benefit
 made or
 provided by the Company or any Subsidiary to the Participant pursuant to
 (i) any severance plan, program, policy or similar arrangement of the
 Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (including without limitation the
 CIC
 Agreement), (ii) any employment agreement between the Company or any
 Subsidiary and the Participant, and (iii) any federal, state, local,
 foreign or other applicable statute, law (common or otherwise), rule, regulation
 or ordinance. For avoidance of doubt, (A) any payment or benefit which is
 a
 Vested Benefit shall not be considered a severance or similar payment or
 benefit
 under this Section 12(a), and (B) the Program is not intended to, and shall
 not, result in any duplication of payments or benefits to any Participant.

(b) No
 Right, Title,
 or Interest in Company Assets .
 Participants
 shall have no right, title, or interest whatsoever in or to any assets of
 the
 Company or its Subsidiaries or any investments that the Company or its
 Subsidiaries may make to aid it in meeting its obligations under the Program.
 Nothing contained in the Program, and no action taken pursuant to its
 provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or
 a
 fiduciary relationship between the Company or its Subsidiaries and any
 Participant, Beneficiary, legal representative or any other person. To the
 extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company
 or
 a Subsidiary under the Program, such right shall be no greater than the right
 of
 an unsecured general creditor of the Company or the subject Subsidiary. Subject
 to this Section 12(b), all payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from
 the general funds of the Company or its Subsidiaries and no special or separate
 fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure
 payment of such amounts. 

(c) No
 Right to
 Continued Employment .
 The Participant s
 rights, if any, to continue to serve the Company or a Subsidiary as an
 employee
 shall not be enlarged or otherwise affected by his/her designation as a
 Participant under the Program, and the Company or the applicable Subsidiary
 reserves the right to terminate the employment of any employee at any time.
 The
 adoption of the Program shall not be deemed to give any employee, or any
 other
 individual any right to be selected as a Participant or to continued employment
 with the Company or any Subsidiary. 

7 

(d) Other
 Rights .
 The Program shall

 by
 applicable federal law (including, without limitation, ERISA).

 If any term or
 condition of the Program shall be invalid or unenforceable to any extent
 or in
 any application, then the remainder of the Program, with the exception of
 such
 invalid or unenforceable provision (but only to the extent that such term
 or
 condition cannot be appropriately reformed or modified), shall not be affected
 thereby and shall continue in effect and application to its fullest extent.

 illness or accident or because he or she is a minor, any benefit due the
 Participant may be paid to the Participant s spouse or to any other person
 deemed by the Committee to have incurred expense for such Participant (including
 a duly appointed guardian, committee or other legal representative), and
 any
 such payment shall be a complete discharge of the Company s or the subject
 Subsidiary s obligations hereunder. 

(h) Transferability
 of Rights .
 The Company and
 its Subsidiaries shall have the unrestricted right to transfer its obligations
 under the Program with respect to one or more Participants to any person,

 transfer or assign a benefit, or any rights granted hereunder, by a Participant
 or the spouse of a Participant shall, in the sole discretion of the Committee
 (after consideration of such facts as it deems pertinent), be grounds for
 terminating any rights of the Participant or Beneficiary to any portion of
 the
 Program benefits not previously paid.

 payment to a Participant under the Program is not paid within thirty

 as published in The Wall Street Journal, Midwest Edition. 

(j) No
 Obligation to
 Mitigate Damages .
 The Participants
 shall not be obligated to seek other employment in mitigation of amounts
 payable
 or arrangements made under the provisions of the Program and the obtaining
 of
 any such other employment shall in no event effect any reduction of the
 Company s or its Subsidiaries obligations under the Program.

 under the Program shall be brought in the federal court for Tarrant County,
 Texas.

 payments or benefits under the Program until (i) such Terminated
 Participant executes a confidentiality, nonsolicitation and general release
 agreement (the Agreement containing, among other items, a general release of
