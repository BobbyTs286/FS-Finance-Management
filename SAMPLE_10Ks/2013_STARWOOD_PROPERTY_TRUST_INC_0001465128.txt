 This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements, including without limitation,
statements concerning our operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are developed by combining currently available information with our beliefs and assumptions and are generally identified by the words
"believe," "expect," "anticipate" and other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements do not guarantee future performance, which may be materially different from that expressed in, or implied
by, any such statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates. 

 These
forward-looking statements are based largely on our current beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future performance taking into account all information currently available
to us. These beliefs, assumptions and expectations can change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to us or within our control, and which could materially affect
actual results, performance or achievements. Factors that may cause actual results to vary from our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited
to: 

factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those set forth under the captions
"Risk Factors" and "Business"; 
 defaults by borrowers in paying debt service on outstanding items; 
 impairment in the value of real estate property securing our loans; 
 availability of mortgage origination and acquisition opportunities acceptable to us; 
 the Company's ability to complete its pending acquisition of LNR Property LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("LNR"), as described below and the performance of LNR subsequent to the acquisition; 
 the Company's ability to integrate LNR into its business and achieve the benefits that the Company anticipates from its
acquisition of LNR; 
 potential mismatches in the timing of asset repayments and the maturity of the associated financing agreements; 
 national and local economic and business conditions; 
 general and local commercial real estate property conditions; 
 changes in federal government policies; 
 changes in federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations; 
 increased competition from entities engaged in mortgage lending; 
 changes in interest rates; 
 changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the respective currencies for the Company's non-U.S.
dollar denominated investments; and 
 the availability of and costs associated with sources of liquidity. 

In
light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurances that the results referred to in the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K will in fact occur. Except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, we undertake no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any such obligation to, update or
revise any forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events, changes to future results over time or otherwise.

PART I 

Item 1. Business. 

The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information included elsewhere
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. This description contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual
results could differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements due to the factors set forth in "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to "we," "our," "us," or the "Company," refer to Starwood Property Trust, Inc. All amounts are in
thousands (000's) except share and per share data. 

 General 

 Starwood Property Trust, Inc. is a Maryland corporation that commenced operations on August 17, 2009, upon the completion
of our initial public offering. We are focused on originating, investing in, financing and managing commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate debt investments, commercial
mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS"), and other commercial real estate-related debt investments. We collectively refer to commercial mortgage loans, other commercial real estate debt investments, CMBS,
and other commercial real estate-related debt investments as our target assets. We also invest in residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") and residential REO and non-performing loans, and may
invest in commercial properties subject to net leases. As market conditions change over time, we may adjust our strategy to take advantage of changes in interest rates and credit spreads as well as
economic and credit conditions. Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted total returns to our investors over the long term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through
capital appreciation. In order to achieve these objectives, we focus on asset selection and the relative value of various sectors within the debt market to construct a diversified investment portfolio
designed to produce attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We employ leverage, to the extent available, to fund the acquisition of our target assets, increase
potential returns to our stockholders and meet our return objectives. Leverage can either be direct by utilizing private third-party financing, or indirect through originating, acquiring, or retaining
subordinated mortgages, B-Notes, subordinated loan participations or mezzanine loans. Under our current repurchase agreements and bank credit facility, our total leverage may not exceed
75 , excluding the impact of bona-fide loan sales that must be accounted for as financings and consolidating any variable interest entities pursuant to accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our various subsidiaries. 

 We
are externally managed and advised by SPT Management, LLC (our "Manager") pursuant to the terms of a management agreement. Our Manager is controlled by Barry Sternlicht, our
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our Manager is an affiliate of Starwood Capital Group, a privately-held private equity firm founded and controlled by Mr. Sternlicht. Since its
inception in 1991, Starwood Capital Group (including Starwood Capital-named affiliates controlled by Mr. Sternlicht) has sponsored numerous opportunistic funds, including dedicated debt funds,
dedicated hotel funds and standalone and co-investment partnerships. 

 On
January 23, 2013, we entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement with LNR Property, LLC ("LNR"), Aozora Investments LLC, CBR I LLC, iStar Marlin LLC, Opps
VIIb LProp, L.P., and VNO LNR Holdco LLC, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all the outstanding equity interests of LNR. LNR is a diversified real estate investment,
management, finance and development company whose principal line of business is serving as a special servicer for CMBS transactions. The acquisition of LNR has not been completed, and accordingly this
Annual Report on Form 10-K and the consolidated financial statements included herein do not reflect the results of LNR's business. 

 We
have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2009. We generally
will not be subject 

 1 

Table of Contents 

 to
U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we meet certain asset, income, and stock ownership tests to qualify as a REIT, and annually distribute all of our taxable income
to stockholders. We also operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). 

 Our
corporate headquarters office is located at 591 West Putnam Avenue, Greenwich, Connecticut, and our telephone number is (203) 422-8100. 

 Investment Strategy 

 We seek to attain attractive risk adjusted returns for our investors over the long term by sourcing and managing a diversified
portfolio of target assets, financed in a manner that is designed to deliver attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. Our investment strategy focuses on a few
fundamental themes: 

origination and acquisition of real estate debt assets with an implied basis sufficiently low to weather significant
declines in asset values; 
 focus on real estate markets and assets classes with strong supply and demand fundamentals and/or barriers to entry; 
 structuring and financing each transaction in a manner that reflects the risk of the underlying asset's cash flow stream
and credit risk profile, and efficiently manages and maintains the transaction's interest rate and currency exposures at levels consistent with management's risk objectives; 
 seeking situations where our size, scale, speed, and sophistication allow us to position ourselves as a
"one-stop" lending solution for real estate owner/operators; 
 utilizing the skills, expertise, and contacts developed by our M over the past twenty plus years as one of the premier
global real estate investment managers to correctly anticipate trends and identify attractive risk adjusted investment opportunities in U.S. and European real estate debt capital markets; and 
 utilizing the skills, expertise, and infrastructure we anticipate acquiring through our recently announced planned
acquisition of LNR (see detail provided below), a market leading diversified real estate investment management and loan servicing company, to expand and diversify our presence in various segments of
real estate lending and debt securities, including: 

origination of small and medium sized loan transactions 10 to 50mm) for both investment and
securitization/gain-on-sale; 
 investment in commercial mortgage backed securities; and 
 special servicing of commercial real estate loans in commercial real estate securitization transactions. 

In
order to capitalize on the changing sets of investment opportunities that may be present in the various points of an economic cycle, we may expand or refocus our investment strategy
by emphasizing investments in different parts of the capital structure and different sectors of real estate. Our investment strategy may be amended from time to time, if recommended by our Manager and
approved by our board of directors, without the approval of our stockholders. In addition to our Manager making direct investments on our behalf, we may enter into joint venture, management or other
agreements with persons that have special expertise or sourcing capabilities. 

 On
January 23, 2013, we entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement with LNR, Aozora Investments LLC, CBR I LLC, iStar Marlin LLC, Opps
VIIb LProp, L.P., and VNO LNR Holdco LLC, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all the outstanding equity interests of LNR. LNR is a diversified real estate investment,
management, finance and development company whose principal line of business is serving as a special servicer for CMBS transactions. Under the terms of the transaction, we will acquire the following
LNR business segments for a total cash purchase price of

Table of Contents 

 843 million.
The remainder of the LNR businesses, totaling approximately 206 million, will be acquired by an investment fund controlled by an affiliate of our
Manager: 

U.S. Special Servicer A U.S. special servicer of commercial loans with approximately 133.6 billion in
loans under management and real estate owned as of December 31, 2012; 
 U.S. Investment Securities Portfolio a portfolio of whole loans, CMBS and collateralized debt obligation
("CDO") investments; 
 Archetype Mortgage Capital a commercial real estate conduit loan origination platform; 
 Archetype Financial Institution Services an acquirer, manager, and servicer of portfolios of small balance
commercial loans;

servicer in Europe, and a non-controlling interest in LNR European Investment Fund, a European CRE debt fund; and 
 Auction.com 50 percent of LNR's interest in a real estate exchange selling residential and commercial
real estate via auction. 

Financing Strategy 

 Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our exemption from registering under the
1940 Act, we may finance the acquisition of our target assets, to the extent available to us, through the following methods: 

sources of private financing, including long and short-term repurchase agreements and warehouse and bank
credit facilities; 
 loan sales, syndications, and/or securitizations; and 
 public offerings of our equity and/or debt securities. 

We
may also utilize other sources of financing to the extent available to us. 

 Our Target Assets 

 We invest in target assets secured primarily by U.S. collateral. We focus primarily on originating or opportunistically acquiring
commercial mortgage whole loans, B-notes, mezzanine loans, preferred equity and mortgage-backed securities. We may invest in performing and non-performing mortgage loans and
other real estate-related
loans and debt investments. We may acquire target assets through portfolio or other acquisitions. Our Manager targets markets where it has a view on the expected cyclical recovery as well as expertise
in the real estate collateral underlying the assets being acquired. Our target assets include the following types of loans and other investments with respect to commercial real
estate: 

whole mortgage loans: loans secured by a first mortgage
lien on a commercial property that provide long-term mortgage financing to commercial property developers or owners generally having maturity dates ranging from three to ten years; 
 bridge loans: whole mortgage loans secured by a first
mortgage lien on a commercial property that provide interim or bridge financing to borrowers seeking short-term capital typically for the acquisition of real estate; 
 B-Notes: typically a privately negotiated
loan that is secured by a first mortgage on a single large commercial property or group of related properties and subordinated to an A Note secured by the same first mortgage on the same property or
group; 
 mezzanine loans: loans made to commercial property owners
that are secured by pledges of the borrower's ownership interests in the property and/or the property owner, subordinate to whole mortgage loans secured by first or second mortgage liens on the
property and senior to the borrower's equity in the property;

federally chartered corporation guarantees payments of principal and interest on the securities.

 Our
investment process includes sourcing and screening of investment opportunities, assessing investment suitability, conducting interest rate and prepayment analysis,
evaluating cash flow and collateral performance, reviewing legal structure and servicer and originator information and investment structuring, as appropriate, to seek an attractive return commensurate
with the risk we are bearing. Upon identification of an investment opportunity, the investment will be screened and monitored by us to determine its impact on maintaining our REIT qualification and
our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. We will seek to make investments in sectors where we have strong core competencies and believe market risk and expected performance can be
reasonably quantified. 

 We
evaluate each one of our investment opportunities based on its expected risk-adjusted return relative to the returns available from other, comparable investments. In
addition, we evaluate new opportunities based on their relative expected returns compared to comparable positions held in our portfolio. The terms of any leverage available to us for use in funding an
investment purchase are also taken into consideration, as are any risks posed by illiquidity or correlations with other securities in the portfolio. We also develop a macro outlook with respect to
each target asset class by examining factors in the broader economy such as gross domestic product, interest rates, unemployment rates and availability of credit, among other things. We also analyze
fundamental trends in the relevant target asset class sector to adjust/maintain our outlook for that particular target asset class. 

Loans 

 Our primary focus has been to build a portfolio of commercial mortgage and mezzanine loans at attractive risk adjusted returns by
focusing on the underlying real estate fundamentals and credit analysis of the borrowers. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we originated 22 loans and acquired 4 loans, as summarized
below (amounts in thousands):

We
continually monitor borrower performance and complete a detailed, loan-by-loan formal credit review on a quarterly basis. The results of this review are
incorporated into our quarterly assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. As of December 31, 2012, none of our loans was delinquent. 

 Mortgage-Backed Securities 

 During the year ended December 31, 2012, we invested 372.3 million in various CMBS. As of March 31, 2012, we had
a debt investment secured by substantially all of a worldwide operator of hotels, resorts and timeshare properties this investment was comprised of 115.1 million of loans and
 387.6 million in securities. On April 16, 2012 the remaining 115.1 million of loans were converted to securities. The 421.8 million floating rate CMBS pay a spread of
2.3 over the index, which is the one month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). In the event of full extension, the spread over the index will increase from the current 2.3 to 3.8 . As of
December 31, 2012, the weighted-average coupon of all CMBS is 4.3 . The 97.8 million fixed rate CMBS pay a coupon of 11.6 . 

During
the year ended December 31, 2012, we invested 96.8 million in RMBS, net of sales and principal payments received. As of December 31, 2012, we held 78 RMBS
positions.

Summary of Interest Characteristics 

 As described in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and
Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk," we utilize certain interest rate risk management techniques, including both asset/liability matching and
certain other hedging transactions, in order to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. 

As
of December 31, 2012, 30.1 of our investments were comprised of fixed rate loans and securities with a weighted-average coupon of 9.4 and weighted-average life of
3.9 years, whereas 64.8 of our investments were comprised of variable rate loans and securities with a LIBOR based index with a weighted-average spread of 4.8 and weighted-average life of
4.1 years and 5.1 of our investments represented other investments. 

 As
of December 31, 2011, 46.1 of our investments were comprised of fixed rate loans and securities with a weighted-average coupon of 8.9 and weighted-average life of
4.4 years, whereas 52.4 of our investments were comprised of variable rate loans and securities with a LIBOR based index with a weighted-average spread of 3.52 and weighted-average life of
3.1 years and 1.5 of our investments represented other investments. 

 Summary of Maturities 

 As of December 31, 2012, our loan and CMBS portfolios had a weighted-average maturity of 3.75 years, based on
management's judgment of extension options being exercised. The table below shows the carrying value expected to mature annually over the next ten years for our investments in loans and CMBS (amounts

 Regulation 

 Our operations are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by state and federal governmental authorities and may
be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things: (1) regulate credit granting activities;
(2) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; (3) require disclosures to customers; (4) govern secured transactions; and (5) set collection,
foreclosure, repossession and claims handling procedures and other trade practices. Although most states do not regulate commercial finance, certain states impose limitations on interest rates and
other charges and on certain collection practices and creditor remedies, and require licensing of lenders and financiers and adequate disclosure of certain contract terms. We are also required to
comply with certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans. We intend to conduct our business so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are
required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. 

 In
the judgment of management, existing statutes and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our business. In the wake of the recent financial crisis, legislators in the
U.S. and in other countries have said that greater regulation of financial services firms is needed, particularly in areas such as risk management, leverage and disclosure. While we expect that new
regulations in these areas will be adopted in the future, it is not possible at this time to forecast the exact nature of any future legislation, regulations, judicial decisions, orders or
interpretations, nor their impact upon our future business, financial condition or results of operations or prospects. 

Competition 

 We are engaged in a competitive business. In our investment activities, we compete for opportunities with numerous public and private
investment vehicles, including financial institutions, specialty finance companies, mortgage banks, pension funds, opportunity funds, hedge funds, insurance companies, REITs and other institutional
investors, as well as individuals. Many competitors are significantly larger than us, have well established operating histories and may have greater access to capital, more resources and other
advantages over us. These competitors may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments or to compromise underwriting standards and, as a result, our origination volume and profit margins
could be adversely affected. 

 The Manager 

 We are externally managed and advised by our Manager and benefit from the personnel, relationships and experience of our Manager's
executive team and other personnel of Starwood Capital Group. Pursuant to the terms of a management agreement between our Manager and us, our Manager provides us with our management team and
appropriate support personnel. Pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between our Manager and Starwood Capital Group Management, LLC, our Manager has access to the personnel and resources
of Starwood Capital Group necessary for the implementation and execution of our business strategy. 

Our
Manager is an affiliate of Starwood Capital Group, a privately-held private equity firm founded and controlled by Mr. Sternlicht. Starwood Capital Group has
invested in most major classes of real estate, directly and indirectly, through operating companies, portfolios of properties and single assets, including multifamily, office, retail, hotel,
residential entitled land and communities, senior housing, mixed-use and golf courses. Starwood Capital Group invests at different levels of the capital structure, including equity,
preferred equity, mezzanine debt and senior debt, depending on the asset risk profile and return expectation. 

Our
Manager draws upon the experience and expertise of Starwood Capital Group's team of professionals and support personnel operating in eleven cities across six countries. Our Manager
also

Table of Contents 

 benefits
from Starwood Capital Group's dedicated asset management group operating in offices located in the U.S. and abroad. We also benefit from Starwood Capital Group's portfolio management, finance
and administration functions, which address legal, compliance, investor relations and operational matters, asset valuation, risk management and information technologies in connection with the
performance of our Manager's duties. 

 Taxation of the Company 

 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for federal income tax
purposes. We generally must distribute
annually at least 90 of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order for federal corporate income tax not to apply to our earnings that we
distribute. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100 of our taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed
taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified
under federal tax laws. Our qualification as a REIT also depends on our ability to meet various other requirements imposed by the Code, which relate to organizational structure, diversity of stock
ownership and certain restrictions with regard to owned assets and categories of income. If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on
our taxable income that is currently distributed to stockholders. 

 Even
if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain federal excise taxes and state and local taxes on our income and property. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year,
we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and will not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years.
REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements under the Code. 

 We
formed several taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS") since 2010 to reduce the impact of the prohibited transaction tax and to avoid penalty for the holding of assets not qualifying as
real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests. Any income associated with a TRS is fully taxable because a TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes as a domestic C corporation based
upon its net income. 

 See
Item 1A "Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT" for additional tax status information. 

 Leverage Policies 

 We employ leverage, to the extent available, to fund the acquisition of our target assets, increase potential returns to our
stockholders and meet our return objectives. Although we are not required to maintain any particular minimum leverage ratio, the amount of leverage we deploy for particular investments in our target
assets depends upon our Manager's assessment of a variety of factors, which may include the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio, the potential for
losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities, including hedges, the availability and cost of financing the assets, our opinion of the
creditworthiness of our financing counterparties, the health of the U.S. economy and commercial and residential mortgage markets, our outlook for the level, slope, and volatility of interest rates,
the credit quality of our assets, the collateral underlying our assets, and our outlook for asset spreads relative to the LIBOR curve. Under our current repurchase agreements and bank credit facility,
our total leverage may not exceed 75 , excluding the impact of bona-fide loan
sales that must be accounted for as financings and consolidating any variable interest entities pursuant to GAAP. As of December 31, 2012, our ratio of total debt to loans and MBS investments
was 34.6 .

 Investment Guidelines 

 Our board of directors has adopted the following investment guidelines: 

our investments will be in our target assets unless otherwise approved by the board of directors; 
 no investment shall be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes; 
 no investment shall be made that would cause us or any of our subsidiaries to be required to be registered as an
investment company under the 1940 Act; 
 not more than 25 of our equity will be invested in any individual asset without the consent of a majority of our
independent directors; and 
 any investment of up to 25 million requires the approval of our Chief Executive Officer; any investment from
 25 million to 75 million requires the approval of our Manager's Investment Committee; any investment from 75 million to 150 million requires the approval of the

These
investment guidelines may be changed from time to time by our board of directors without the approval of our stockholders. In addition, both our Manager and our board of directors
must approve any change in our investment guidelines that would modify or expand the types of assets in which we invest.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Risks Related to Our Relationship with Our Manager 

 We are dependent on Starwood Capital Group, including our Manager, and their key personnel, who provide services to us through the management agreement, and we may not find
a suitable replacement for our Manager and Starwood Capital Group if the management agreement is terminated, or for these key personnel if they leave Starwood Capital Group or otherwise become
unavailable to us. 

 We have no separate facilities and are completely reliant on our Manager. Our Manager has significant discretion as to the
implementation of our investment and operating policies and strategies. Accordingly, we believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts, experience, diligence, skill and
network of business contacts of the officers and key personnel of our Manager. The officers and key personnel of our manager evaluate, negotiate, close and monitor our investments; therefore, our
success depends on their continued service. The departure of any of the officers or key personnel of our Manager could have a material adverse effect on our performance. 

 We
offer no assurance that our Manager will remain our investment manager or that we will continue to have access to our Manager's officers and key personnel. The initial term of our
management agreement with our Manager, and the initial term of the investment advisory agreement between our Manager and Starwood Capital Group Management, LLC expired on August 17,
2012, with automatic one-year renewals thereafter. If the management agreement and the investment advisory agreement are terminated and no suitable replacement is found to manage us, we
may not be able to execute our business plan. 

 There are various conflicts of interest in our relationship with Starwood Capital Group, including our Manager, which could result in decisions that are not in the best
interests of our stockholders. 

 We are subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with Starwood Capital Group, including our Manager.
Specifically, Mr. Sternlicht, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jeffrey G. Dishner, one of our directors, and certain of our executive officers are executives of Starwood Capital Group.
Our Manager and executive officers may have conflicts between their duties to us and their duties to, and interests in, Starwood Capital Group and its other investment funds. Currently, Starwood
Global Opportunity Fund VIII, Starwood Global Opportunity Fund IX and Starwood Capital Hospitality Fund II Global, (collectively, the "Starwood Private Real Estate Funds"), collectively have the right
to invest 25 of the equity capital proposed to be invested by any investment vehicle managed by an entity controlled by Starwood Capital Group in debt interests relating to real estate. Our
co-investment rights are subject to, among other things, (i) the determination by our Manager that the proposed investment is suitable for us, and (ii) our manager's sole
discretion as to whether or not to exclude from our investment portfolio at any time any "medium-term loan to own" investment, which our Manager considers to be mortgage loans or other
real estate-related loan or debt investments where the proposed originator or acquirer of any such investment has the intent and/or expectation of foreclosing on, or otherwise acquiring the real
property securing the loan or investment at any time between 18 and 48 months of its origination or acquisition of the loan or investment. In addition, in the case of opportunities to invest in
a portfolio of
assets including both equity and debt real estate related investments, we would not have the co-investment rights described above if our Manager determines that less than 50 of the
aggregate anticipated investment returns from the portfolio is expected to come from our target assets. Since we are subject to the judgment of our Manager in the application of our
co-investment rights, we may not always be allocated 75 of each co-investment opportunity in our target asset classes. Our independent directors periodically review our
Manager's and Starwood Capital Group's compliance with the co-investment provisions described above, but they do not approve each co-investment by the Starwood Private Real
Estate Funds and us unless the amount of capital we invest in the proposed co-investment otherwise requires the review and 

 13 

Table of Contents 

 approval
of our independent directors pursuant to our investment guidelines. Pursuant to the exclusivity provisions of the Starwood Private Real Estate Funds, our investment strategy may not include
either (i) equity interests in real estate or (ii) "near-term loan to own" investments, in each case (of both (i) and (ii)) if such investments are expected, at the
time such investment is made, to produce an internal rate of return (IRR) in excess of 14 . Therefore, our board of directors does not have the flexibility to expand our investment strategy to include
equity interests in real estate or "near-term loan to own" investments with such an IRR expectation. Our Manager, Starwood Capital Group and their respective affiliates may sponsor or
manage a U.S. publicly traded investment vehicle that invests generally in real estate assets but not primarily in our target assets, or a potential competing vehicle. Our Manager and Starwood Capital
Group have also agreed that for so long as the management agreement is in effect and our Manager and Starwood Capital Group are under common control, no entity controlled by Starwood Capital Group
will sponsor or manage a potential competing vehicle or private or foreign competing vehicle, unless Starwood Capital Group adopts a policy that either (i) provides for the fair and equitable
allocation of investment opportunities among all such vehicles and us, or (ii) provides us the right to co-invest with such vehicles, in each case subject to the suitability of each
investment opportunity for the particular vehicle and us and each such vehicle's and our availability of cash for investment. To the extent that we have co-investment rights with these
vehicles in the future, there can be no assurance that these future rights will entitle us to a similar percentage allocation as we currently have with respect to the Starwood Private Real Estate
Funds. To the extent that our manager and Starwood Capital Group adopt an investment allocation policy in the future, we may nonetheless compete with these vehicles for investment opportunities
sourced by our Manager and Starwood Capital Group. As a result, we may either not be presented with the opportunity or may have to compete with these vehicles to acquire these investments. Some or all
of our executive officers, the members of the investment committee of our Manager and other key personnel of our Manager would likely be responsible for selecting investments for these vehicles and
they may choose to allocate favorable investments to one or more of these vehicles instead of to us. 

 Our
board of directors has adopted a policy with respect to any proposed investments by the covered persons in any of our target asset classes. This policy provides that any proposed
investment by a covered person for his or her own account in any of our target asset classes will be permitted if the capital required for the investment does not exceed the personal investment limit.
To the extent that a proposed investment exceeds the personal investment limit, we expect that our board of directors will
only permit the covered person to make the investment (i) upon the approval of the disinterested directors, or (ii) if the proposed investment otherwise complies with terms of any other
related party transaction policy our board of directors has adopted. Subject to compliance with all applicable laws, these individuals may make investments for their own account in our target assets
which may present certain conflicts of interest not addressed by our current policies. 

We
pay our Manager substantial base management fees regardless of the performance of our portfolio. Our Manager's entitlement to a base management fee, which is not based upon
performance metrics or goals, might reduce its incentive to devote its time and effort to seeking investments that provide attractive risk-adjusted returns for our portfolio. This in turn
could hurt both our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the market price of our common stock. 

 We
do not have any employees except for Andrew Sossen, our Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, and Perry Stewart Ward, our
Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, who Starwood Capital Group has seconded to us exclusively. Mr. Sossen and Mr. Ward are also employees of other entities affiliated with our Manager
and, as a result, are subject to potential conflicts of interest in service as our employees and as an employees of such entities.

 The management agreement with our Manager was not negotiated on an arm's-length basis and may not be as favorable to us as if it had been negotiated with an unaffiliated
third party and may be costly and difficult to terminate. 

 Certain of our executive officers and three of our seven directors are executives of Starwood Capital Group. Our management agreement
with our Manager was negotiated between related parties and its terms, including fees payable, may not be as favorable to us as if it had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. 

Termination
of the management agreement with our Manager without cause is difficult and costly. Our independent directors will review our Manager's performance and the management fees
annually and the management agreement may be terminated annually upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors based upon: (i) our Manager's
unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to us, or (ii) a determination that the management fees payable to our Manager are not fair, subject to our Manager's right to prevent
termination based on unfair fees by accepting a reduction of management fees agreed to by at least two-thirds of our independent directors. Our Manager will be provided 180 days
prior notice of any such a
termination. Additionally, upon such a termination, the management agreement provides that we will pay our manager a termination fee equal to three times the sum of the average annual base management
fee and incentive fee received by our Manager during the prior 24-month period before such termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter. These
provisions may increase the cost to us of terminating the management agreement and adversely affect our ability to terminate our Manager without cause. 

 The
initial term of our management agreement with our Manager, and the initial term of the investment advisory agreement between our Manager and Starwood Capital Group Management, LLC
expired on August 17, 2012, with automatic one-year renewals thereafter; provided, however, that our Manager may terminate the management agreement annually upon 180 days prior notice.
If the management agreement is terminated and no suitable replacement is found to manage us, we may not be able to execute our business plan. 

 Pursuant
to the management agreement, our Manager does not assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder and is not responsible for any action of our
board of directors in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations. Our Manager maintains a contractual as opposed to a fiduciary relationship with us. Under the terms of the
management agreement, our Manager, its officers, members, personnel, any person controlling or controlled by our Manager and any person providing sub-advisory services to our Manager will
not be liable to us, any subsidiary of ours, our directors, our stockholders or any subsidiary's stockholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the
management agreement, except because of acts constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of their duties under the management agreement. In addition, we have
agreed to indemnify our Manager, its officers, stockholders, members, managers, directors, personnel, any person controlling or controlled by our Manager and any person providing
sub-advisory services to our manager with respect to all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims arising from acts or omissions of our Manager not constituting
bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of duties, performed in good faith in accordance with and pursuant to the management agreement. 

The incentive fee payable to our Manager under the management agreement is payable quarterly and is based on our core earnings and therefore, may cause our manager to select
investments in more risky assets to increase its incentive compensation. 

 Our Manager is entitled to receive incentive compensation based upon our achievement of targeted levels of core earnings. In evaluating
investments and other management strategies, the 

 15 

Table of Contents 

 opportunity
to earn incentive compensation based on core earnings may lead our manager to place undue emphasis on the maximization of core earnings at the expense of other criteria, such as
preservation of capital, in order to achieve higher incentive compensation. Investments with higher yield potential are generally riskier or more speculative. This could result in increased risk to
the value of our investment portfolio. 

 Core
earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as GAAP net income (loss) excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, the incentive fee, depreciation and amortization
of real estate (to the extent that we own properties), any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income for the period, regardless of whether such items are
included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income. The amount will be adjusted to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash
charges after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of our independent directors. 

 Our conflicts of interest policy may not adequately address all of the conflicts of interest that may arise with respect to our investment activities and also may limit the
allocation of investments to us. 

 In order to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest with our Manager, Starwood Capital Group or any of the Starwood
parties, we have adopted a conflicts of interest policy to specifically address some of the conflicts relating to our investment opportunities. Although under this policy the approval of a majority of
our independent directors is required to approve (i) any purchase of our assets by any of the Starwood parties and (ii) any purchase by us of any assets of any of the Starwood parties,
there is no assurance that this policy will be adequate to address all of the conflicts that may arise or will address such conflicts in a manner that results in the allocation of a particular
investment opportunity to us or is otherwise favorable to us. In addition, the Starwood Private Real Estate Funds currently, and additional competing vehicles may in the future, participate in some of
our investments, possibly at a more senior level in the capital structure of the underlying borrower and related real estate than our investment. Our interests in such investments may also conflict
with the interests of these funds in the event of a default or restructuring of the investment. Participating investments will not be the result of arm's length negotiations and will involve potential
conflicts between our interests and those of the other participating funds in obtaining favorable terms. Since certain of our executives are also executives of Starwood Capital Group, the same
personnel may determine the price and terms for the investments for both us and these funds and there can be no assurance that any procedural protections, such as obtaining market prices or other
reliable indicators of fair value, will prevent the consideration we pay for these investments from exceeding their fair value or ensure that we receive terms for a particular investment opportunity
that are as favorable as those available from an independent third party. 

 Our board of directors has approved very broad investment guidelines for our Manager and does not approve each investment and financing decision made by our Manager unless
required by our investment guidelines. 

 Our Manager is authorized to follow very broad investment guidelines. Our board of directors will periodically review our investment
guidelines and our investment portfolio but will not, and will not be required to, review all of our proposed investments, except if the investment requires us to commit either at least
 150 million of capital or 25 of our equity in any individual asset. In addition, in conducting periodic reviews, our board of directors may rely primarily on information provided to them by
our Manager. Furthermore, our Manager may use complex strategies, and transactions entered into by our Manager may be costly, difficult or impossible to unwind by the time they are reviewed by our
board of directors. Our Manager has great latitude within the broad parameters of our investment guidelines in determining the types and amounts of target assets it decides are attractive investments
for us, which could result in investment returns that are substantially below expectations or that result in losses, which would materially and adversely affect our business operations and results.
Further, 

 16

 decisions
made and investments and financing arrangements entered into by our Manager may not fully reflect the best interests of our stockholders. 

 Risks Related to Our Company 

 Our board of directors may change any of our investment strategy or guidelines, financing strategy or leverage policies without stockholder consent. 

 Our board of directors may change any of our investment strategy or guidelines, financing strategy or leverage policies with respect to
investments, acquisitions, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and distributions at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in an investment portfolio with a
different risk profile. A change in our investment strategy may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, default risk and real estate market
fluctuations. These changes could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 

 We are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our
common stock and our ability to pay dividends. 

 Our business is highly dependent on communications and information systems of Starwood Capital Group. Any failure or interruption of
Starwood Capital Group's systems could cause delays or other problems, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our common stock
and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. 

 Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the real estate industry and our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

 The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 disrupted the U.S. financial markets, including the real estate capital markets, and
negatively impacted the U.S. economy in general. Any future terrorist attacks, the anticipation of any such attacks, the consequences of any military or other response by the U.S. and its allies, and
other armed conflicts could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy. The economic impact of these
events could also adversely affect the credit quality of some of our loans and investments and the properties underlying our interests. 

 We
may suffer losses as a result of the adverse impact of any future attacks and these losses may adversely impact our performance and may cause the market value of our common stock to
decline or be more volatile. A prolonged economic slowdown, a recession or declining real estate values could impair the performance of our investments and harm our financial condition and results of
operations, increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. We cannot predict the severity of the effect that
potential future terrorist attacks would have on us. Losses resulting from these types of events may not be fully insurable. 

 In
addition, the events of September 11, 2011 created significant uncertainty regarding the ability of real estate owners of high profile assets to obtain insurance coverage
protecting against terrorist attacks at commercially reasonable rates, if at all. With the enactment of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the "TRIA") and the subsequent enactment of the
Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, which extended the TRIA through the end of 2014, insurers must make terrorism insurance available under their property and casualty
insurance policies, but this legislation does not regulate the pricing of such insurance. The absence of affordable insurance coverage may adversely affect the general real estate lending market,
lending volume and the market's overall
liquidity and may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us and the pace at which we are able to make investments. If the properties underlying our interests are unable to 

 17 

Table of Contents 

 obtain
affordable insurance coverage, the value of our interests could decline, and in the event of an uninsured loss, we could lose all or a portion of our investment. 

 We have not established a minimum distribution payment level and no assurance can be given that we will be able to make distributions to our stockholders in the future at
current levels or at all. 

 We are generally required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income each year for us to qualify as a REIT
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, which requirement we currently intend to satisfy through quarterly distributions of all or substantially all of our REIT taxable
income in such year, subject to certain adjustments. We have not established a minimum distribution payment level, and our ability to pay distributions may be adversely affected by a number of
factors, including the risk factors contained in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. Although we have made, and anticipate continuing to make,
quarterly distributions to our stockholders, our board of directors has the sole discretion to determine the timing, form and amount of any future distributions to our stockholders, and such
determination will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, debt covenants, maintenance of our REIT qualification and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to
time. We believe that a change in any one of the following factors could adversely affect our results of operations and impair our ability to continue to pay distributions to our
stockholders: 

the profitability of the investment of the net proceeds from our equity offerings; 
 our ability to make profitable investments; 
 margin calls or other expenses that reduce our cash flow; 
 defaults in our asset portfolio or decreases in the value of our portfolio;
and 
 the fact that anticipated operating expense levels may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates. 

As
a result, no assurance can be given that we will be able to continue to make distributions to our stockholders in the future or that the level of any future distributions we do make
to our stockholders will achieve a market yield or increase or even be maintained over time, any of which could materially and adversely affect us. 

 In
addition, distributions that we make to our stockholders are generally taxable to our stockholders as ordinary income. However, a portion of our distributions may be designated by us
as long-term capital gains to the extent that they are attributable to capital gain income recognized by us or may constitute a return of capital to the extent that they exceed our earnings and
profits as determined for tax purposes. A return of capital is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder's investment in our common stock. 

 Risks Related to Sources of Financing 

 Our access to sources of financing may be limited and thus our ability to maximize our returns may be adversely affected. 

 Our financing sources currently include our credit agreement and our master repurchase agreements, which may include additional
borrowings in the form of bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities, structured financing arrangements, public and private
equity and debt issuances and derivative instruments, in addition to transaction or asset specific funding arrangements. 

 18 

Table of Contents 

 Our
access to additional sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors, over which we have little or no control, including: 

general market conditions; 
 the market's view of the quality of our assets; 
 the market's perception of our growth potential; 
 our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and 
 the market price of the shares of our common stock. 

The
current dislocation and weakness in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect one or more private lenders and could cause one or more of our private lenders to be
unwilling or unable to provide us with financing or to increase the costs of that financing. In addition, if regulatory capital requirements imposed on our private lenders change, they may be required
to limit, or increase the cost of, financing they provide to us. In general, this could potentially increase our financing costs and reduce our liquidity or require us to sell assets at an inopportune
time or price. 

 To
the extent structured financing arrangements are unavailable, we may have to rely more heavily on additional equity issuances, which may be dilutive to our stockholders, or on less
efficient forms of debt
financing that require a larger portion of our cash flow from operations, thereby reducing funds available for our operations, future business opportunities, cash distributions to our stockholders and
other purposes. We cannot assure you that we will have access to such equity or debt capital on favorable terms (including, without limitation, cost and term) at the desired times, or at all, which
may cause us to curtail our asset acquisition activities and/or dispose of assets, which could negatively affect our results of operations. 

 We may incur significant debt, which will subject us to increased risk of loss and may reduce cash available for distributions to our stockholders. 

Our outstanding indebtedness currently includes our credit agreement, our repurchase agreements, and our convertible notes. Subject to
market conditions and availability, we may incur additional debt through bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities and
structured financing arrangements, public and private debt issuances (refer to Note 16 of the 2012 consolidated financial statements for disclosure of our debt offering subsequent to
December 31, 2012) and derivative instruments, in addition to transaction or asset specific funding arrangements. The percentage of leverage we employ will vary depending on our available
capital, our ability to obtain and access financing arrangements with lenders and the lenders' and rating agencies' estimate of the stability of our investment portfolio's cash flow. Our governing
documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur. We may significantly increase the amount of leverage we utilize at any time without approval of our board of directors. However,
under our current repurchase agreements and bank credit facility, our total leverage may not exceed 75 of total assets (as defined therein), as adjusted to remove the impact of bona-fide
loan sales that are accounted for as financings and the consolidation of variable interest entities pursuant to GAAP. In addition, we may leverage individual assets at substantially higher levels.
Incurring substantial debt could subject us to many risks that, if realized, would materially and adversely affect us, including the risk that: 

our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal of and interest on the debt or we
may fail to comply with all of the other covenants contained in the debt, which is likely to result in (i) acceleration of such debt (and any other debt containing a cross-default or
cross-acceleration provision) that we may be unable to repay from internal funds or to refinance on favorable terms, or at all, (ii) our inability to borrow unused amounts 
 
 19 

Table of Contents 

under
our financing arrangements, even if we are current in payments on borrowings under those arrangements and/or (iii) the loss of some or all of our assets to foreclosure or sale; 

our debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions with no assurance that investment
yields will increase with higher financing costs; 
 we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby
reducing funds available for operations, future business opportunities, stockholder distributions or other purposes; and 
 we may not be able to refinance debt that matures prior to the investment it was used to finance on favorable terms, or at
all. 

We are subject to margin calls from our lenders under our financing facilities. 

 Subject to certain conditions, our credit facility lenders retain the sole discretion over the market value of loans and/or securities
that serve as collateral for the borrowings under our financing facilities for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to such lenders. 

 Interest rate fluctuations could significantly decrease our results of operations and cash flows and the market value of our investments. 

 Our primary interest rate exposures relate to the following: 

changes in interest rates may affect the yield on our investments and the financing cost of our debt, as well as the
performance of our interest rate swaps that we utilize for hedging purposes, which could result in operating losses for us should interest expense exceed interest income; 
 declines in interest rates may reduce the yield on existing floating rate assets and/or the yield on prospective
investments; 
 changes in the level of interest rates may affect our ability to source investments; 
 increases in the level of interest rates may negatively impact the value of our investments and our ability to realize
gains from the disposition of assets; 
 increases in the level of interest rates may increase the credit risk of our assets by negatively impacting the ability of
our borrowers to pay debt service on our floating rate loan assets, refinance our assets upon maturity, and can negatively impact the value of the real estate collateral supporting our investments
through the impact increases in interest rates can have on property valuation capitalization rates; and 
 changes in interest rates and/or the differential between U.S. dollar interest rates and those of non-dollar
currencies in which we invest can adversely affect the value of our non-dollar assets and/or associated currency hedging transactions. 

Any warehouse facilities that we obtain may limit our ability to acquire assets, and we may incur losses if the collateral is liquidated. 

 We may utilize, if available, warehouse facilities pursuant to which we would accumulate mortgage loans in anticipation of a
securitization financing, which assets would be pledged as collateral for such facilities until the securitization transaction is consummated. In order to borrow funds to acquire assets under any
future warehouse facilities, we expect that our lenders thereunder would have the right to review the potential assets for which we are seeking financing. We may be unable to obtain the consent of a
lender to acquire assets that we believe would be beneficial to us and we may be unable to obtain alternate financing for such assets. In addition, no assurance can be given that a securitization
structure 

 20 

Table of Contents 

 would
be consummated with respect to the assets being warehoused. If the securitization is not consummated, the lender could liquidate the warehoused collateral and we would then have to pay any
amount by which the original purchase price of the collateral assets exceeds its sale price, subject to negotiated caps, if any, on our exposure. In addition, regardless of whether the securitization
is consummated, if any of the warehoused collateral is sold before the consummation, we would have to bear any resulting loss on the sale. Currently, we have no warehouse facilities in place, and no
assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain one or more warehouse facilities on favorable terms, or at all. 

 The utilization of any of our repurchase facilities is subject to the pre-approval of the lender. 

 We utilize repurchase agreements to finance the purchase of certain investments. In order to borrow funds under a repurchase agreement,
the lender has the right to review the potential assets for which we are seeking financing and approve such asset in its sole discretion. Accordingly, we may be unable to obtain the consent of a
lender to finance an investment and alternate sources of financing for such asset may not exist. 

 A failure to comply with restrictive covenants in our repurchase agreements and financing facilities would have a material adverse effect on us, and any future financings
may require us to provide additional collateral or pay down debt. 

 We are subject to various restrictive covenants contained in our existing financing arrangements and may become subject to additional
covenants in connection with future financings. Our credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional debt or liens, make certain investments or acquisitions, merge,
consolidate or transfer or dispose of substantially all assets or otherwise dispose of property and assets, pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments, change the nature of our business,
and enter into transactions with affiliates. The credit agreement, as well as our master repurchase agreements, each requires us to maintain compliance with various financial covenants, including a
minimum tangible net worth and cash liquidity, and specified financial ratios, such as total debt to total assets and EBITDA to fixed charges. These covenants may limit our flexibility to pursue
certain investments or incur additional debt. If we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants, we would be in default under these agreements, and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding
amounts due and payable, terminate their commitments, require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their interests against existing collateral. We may also be subject to cross-default and
acceleration rights and, with respect to collateralized debt, the posting of additional collateral and foreclosure rights upon default. Further, this could also make it difficult for us to satisfy the
distribution requirements necessary to maintain our status as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

 These
types of financing arrangements also involve the risk that the market value of the loans pledged or sold by us to the repurchase agreement counterparty or provider of the bank
credit facility may decline in value, in which case the lender may require us to provide additional collateral or to repay all or a portion of the funds advanced. We may not have the funds available
to repay our debt at that time, which would likely result in defaults unless we are able to raise the funds from alternative sources, which we may not be able to achieve on favorable terms or at all.
Posting additional collateral would reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to leverage our assets. If we cannot meet these requirements, the lender could accelerate our indebtedness, increase the
interest rate on advanced funds and terminate our ability to borrow funds from them, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to implement our business plan. In
addition, in the event that the lender files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, our loans may become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, thus depriving us, at least temporarily, of the
benefit of these assets. Such an event could restrict our access to bank credit facilities and increase our cost of capital. 

 21 

Table of Contents 

 If one or more of our manager's executive officers are no longer employed by our Manager, financial institutions providing any financing arrangements we may have may not
provide future financing to us, which could materially and adversely affect us. 

 If financial institutions with whom we seek to finance our investments require that one or more of our Manager's executives continue to
serve in such capacity and if one or more of our Manager's executives are no longer employed by our Manager, it may constitute an event of default and the financial institution providing the
arrangement may have acceleration rights with respect to outstanding borrowings and termination rights with respect to our ability to finance our future investments with that institution. If we are
unable to obtain financing for our accelerated borrowings and for our future investments under such circumstances, we could be materially and adversely affected. 

 We directly or indirectly utilize non-recourse securitizations, and such structures expose us to risks that could result in losses to us. 

 We utilize non-recourse securitizations of our investments in mortgage loans to the extent consistent with the maintenance
of our REIT qualification and exemption from the Investment Company Act, in order to generate cash for funding new investments and/or to leverage existing assets. In most instances, this involves us
transferring our loans to a special purpose securitization entity in exchange for cash. In some sale transactions, we also retain a subordinated interest in the loans sold. The securitization of our
portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because the subordinated interest we retain in the loans sold would be subordinate to the senior interest in
the loans sold, and we would, therefore, absorb all of the losses sustained with respect to a loan sold before the owners of the senior interest experience any losses. Moreover, we cannot be assured
that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future, or be able to do so at favorable rates. The inability to consummate securitizations of our portfolio to finance our investments
on a long-term basis could require us to seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing or to liquidate assets at an inopportune time or price, which could adversely affect our
performance and our ability to grow our business. 

 Risks Related to Hedging 

 We enter into hedging transactions that could expose us to contingent liabilities in the future. 

 Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, part of our investment strategy involves entering into hedging transactions that
require us to fund cash payments in certain circumstances (such as the early termination of the hedging instrument caused by an event of default or other early termination event, or the decision by a
counterparty to request margin securities it is contractually owed under the terms of the hedging instrument). The amount due would be equal to the unrealized loss of the open swap positions with the
respective counterparty and could also include other fees and charges. These economic losses will be reflected in our results of operations, and our ability to fund these obligations will depend on
the liquidity of our assets and access to capital at the time, and the need to fund these obligations could adversely impact our financial condition. 

 Hedging may adversely affect our earnings, which could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 

 Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we pursue various hedging strategies to seek to reduce our exposure to adverse
changes in interest rates. Our hedging activity varies in scope based on the level and volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, the type of assets held and other changing 

 22 

Table of Contents 

 market
conditions. Hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because, among other things: 

interest rate, currency and/or credit hedging can be expensive and may result in us receiving less interest
income; 
 available interest rate hedges may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought; 
 due to a credit loss, prepayment or asset sale, the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related asset
or liability; 
 the amount of income that a REIT may earn from hedging transactions (other than hedging transactions that satisfy certain
requirements of the Code or that are done through a TRS) to offset losses is limited by U.S. federal tax provisions governing REITs; 
 the credit quality of the hedging counterparty owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it
impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction; and 
 the hedging counterparty owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay. 

In
addition, we may fail to recalculate, readjust and execute hedges in an efficient manner. 

Any
hedging activity in which we engage may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Therefore, while we may enter into such transactions seeking to
reduce risks, unanticipated changes in interest rates, credit spreads or currencies may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In
addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions or liabilities being hedged may vary
materially. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio positions or liabilities being hedged. Any such
imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. 

 Hedging instruments often are not traded on regulated exchanges, guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house, or regulated by any U.S. or foreign governmental
authorities and involve risks and costs that could result in material losses. 

 The cost of using hedging instruments increases as the period covered by the instrument increases and during periods of rising and
volatile interest rates. In addition, some hedging instruments involve risk because they often are not traded on regulated exchanges, guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house, or regulated by
any U.S. or foreign governmental authorities. Consequently, in many cases, there are no requirements with respect to record keeping, financial responsibility or segregation of customer funds and
positions. Furthermore, the enforceability of agreements underlying hedging transactions may depend on compliance with applicable securities, commodity and other regulatory requirements and, depending
on the identity of the counterparty, applicable international requirements. The business failure of a hedging counterparty with whom we enter into a hedging transaction that is not cleared on a
regulated centralized clearing house will most likely result in its default. Default by a party with whom we enter into a hedging transaction may result in the loss of unrealized profits and force us
to cover our commitments, if any, at the then current market price. Although generally we will seek to reserve the right to terminate our hedging positions, it may not always be possible to dispose of
or close out a hedging position without the consent of the hedging counterparty and we may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order to cover our risk. We cannot assure you that a
liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold, and we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration, which could result in significant losses.

We may fail to qualify for, or choose not to elect, hedge accounting treatment. 

 We record derivative and hedging transactions in accordance with GAAP. Under these standards, we may fail to qualify for, or choose not
to elect, hedge accounting treatment for a number of reasons, including if we use instruments that do not meet the definition of a derivative (such as short sales), we fail to satisfy hedge
documentation and hedge effectiveness assessment requirements or our instruments are not highly effective. If we fail to qualify for, or chose not to elect, hedge accounting treatment, our operating
results may be volatile because changes in the fair value of the derivatives that we enter into may not be offset by a change in the fair value of the related hedged transaction or item. 

 We enter into derivative contracts that could expose us to contingent liabilities in the future. 

 Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we enter into derivative contracts that could require us to fund cash payments in
the future under certain circumstances e.g. , the early termination of the derivative agreement caused by an event of default or other early termination
event, or the decision by a counterparty to request margin securities it is contractually owed under the terms of the derivative contract). The amount due would be equal to the unrealized loss of the
open swap positions with the respective counterparty and could also include other fees and charges. These economic losses may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. 

 Risks Related to Our Investments 

 We may not be able to identify assets that meet our investment objective. 

 We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify additional assets that meet our investment objective, that we will be successful
in consummating any investment opportunities we identify or that one or more investments we may make will yield attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our inability to do any of the foregoing
likely would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 

 The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business. 

 The lack of liquidity of our investments in real estate loans and investments other than certain of our investments in mortgage-backed
securities, or MBS, may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need or desire arises. Many of the securities we purchase are not registered under the relevant securities laws,
resulting in a prohibition against their transfer, sale, pledge or their disposition except in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements of, or otherwise in accordance with,
those laws. In addition, certain investments such as B-Notes, mezzanine loans and bridge and other loans are also particularly illiquid investments due to their short life, their potential
unsuitability for securitization and the greater difficulty of recovery in the event of a borrower's default. As a result, many of our current investments are, and our future investments will be,
illiquid and if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments. Further,
we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a business entity to the extent that we or our manager has or could be attributed with material, non-public
information regarding such business entity. As a result, our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be relatively limited, which could adversely
affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

 Our investments may be concentrated and are subject to risk of default. 

 While we seek to diversify our portfolio of investments, we are not required to observe specific diversification criteria, except as
may be set forth in the investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors. Therefore, our investments in our target assets may at times be concentrated in certain property types that are subject
to higher risk of foreclosure, or secured by properties concentrated in a limited number of geographic locations. To the extent that our portfolio is concentrated in any one 

 24 

Table of Contents 

 region
or type of asset, downturns relating generally to such region or type of asset may result in defaults on a number of our investments within a short time period, which may reduce our net income
and the value of our common stock and accordingly reduce our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. 

 Difficult conditions in the mortgage, commercial and residential real estate markets may cause us to experience market losses related to our holdings, and we do not expect
these conditions to improve in the near future. 

 Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the real estate markets, the financial markets and the economy
generally. Continuing concerns about the declining real estate market, as well as inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues and the availability and cost of credit, have contributed to increased
volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and markets going forward. The mortgage market has been severely affected by changes in the lending landscape and there is no assurance that
these conditions have stabilized or that they will not worsen. The disruption in the mortgage market has an impact on new demand for homes, which will compress the home ownership rates and weigh
heavily on future home price performance. There is a strong correlation between home price growth rates and mortgage loan delinquencies. The further deterioration of the real estate market may cause
us to experience losses related to our assets and to sell assets at a loss. Declines in the market values of our investments may adversely affect our results of operations and credit availability,
which may reduce earnings and, in turn, cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 

Construction loans involve an increased risk of loss. 

 We invest in construction loans. If we fail to fund our entire commitment on a construction loan or if a borrower otherwise fails to
complete the construction of a project, there could be adverse consequences associated with the loan, including: a loss of the value of the property securing the loan, especially if the borrower is
unable to raise funds to complete it from other sources; a borrower claim against us for failure to perform under the loan documents; increased costs to the borrower that the borrower is unable to
pay; a bankruptcy filing by the borrower; and abandonment by the borrower of the collateral for the loan. 

 We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to acquire desirable investments in our target assets and could
also affect the pricing of these securities. 

 We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to
acquire our target assets at attractive prices. In acquiring our target assets, we compete with a variety of institutional investors, including other REITs, commercial and investment banks, specialty
finance companies, public and private funds (including other funds managed by Starwood Capital Group), commercial finance and insurance companies and other financial institutions. Many of our
competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Several other REITs have recently raised significant amounts of
capital, and may have investment objectives that overlap with ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to
funding sources that may not be available to us, such as funding from the U.S. government, if we are not eligible to participate in programs established by the U.S. government. Many of our competitors
are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT tax compliance or maintenance of an exemption from the Investment Company Act. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher
risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, competition for investments in
our target assets may lead to the price of such assets increasing, which may further limit our ability to generate desired returns. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face 

 25 

Table of Contents 

 will
not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, desirable investments in our target assets may be limited
in the future and we may not be able to continue to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, as we can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and make
investments that are consistent with our investment objectives. 

 The commercial mortgage loans we acquire and the mortgage loans underlying our CMBS investments are subject to the ability of the commercial property owner to generate net
income from operating the property as well as the risks of delinquency and foreclosure. 

 Commercial mortgage loans are secured by multifamily or commercial property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure,
and risks of loss that may be greater than similar risks associated with loans made on the security of single-family residential property. The ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by an
income-producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent
income or assets of the borrower. If the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Net operating income of an income-producing property
can be adversely affected by, among other things, 

tenant mix; 
 success of tenant businesses; 
 property management decisions; 
 property location, condition and design; 
 competition from comparable types of properties; 
 changes in laws that increase operating expenses or limit rents that may be charged; 
 changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and/or specific industry segments, including the credit and
securitization markets; 
 declines in regional or local real estate values; 
 declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates; 
 increases in interest rates, real estate tax rates and other operating expenses; 
 costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions; 
 the potential for uninsured or underinsured property losses; 
 changes in governmental laws and regulations, including fiscal policies, zoning ordinances and environmental legislation
and the related costs of compliance; and 
 acts of God, terrorist attacks, social unrest and civil disturbances. 

In
the event of any default under a mortgage loan held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and
the principal and accrued interest of the mortgage loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations and limit amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
In the event of the bankruptcy of a mortgage loan borrower, the mortgage loan to such borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of
bankruptcy (as determined by the bankruptcy court), and the lien securing the mortgage loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or
debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law. Foreclosure of a mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process, which could have a
substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed mortgage loan.

Table of Contents 

 Our investments in CMBS are generally subject to losses. 

 Our investments in CMBS are subject to losses. In general, losses on a mortgaged property securing a mortgage loan included in a
securitization will be borne first by the equity holder of the property, then by a cash reserve fund or letter of credit, if any, then by the holder of a mezzanine loan or B-Note, if any,
then by the "first loss" subordinated security holder (generally, the "B-Piece" buyer) and then by the holder of a higher-rated security. In the event of default and the exhaustion of any
equity support, reserve fund, letter of credit, mezzanine loans or B-Notes, and any classes of securities junior to those in which we invest, we will not be able to recover all of our
investment in the securities we purchase. In addition, if the underlying mortgage portfolio has been overvalued by the originator, or if the values subsequently decline and, as a result, less
collateral is available to satisfy interest and principal payments due on the related MBS, there would be an increased risk of loss. The prices of lower credit quality securities are generally less
sensitive to interest rate changes than more highly rated investments, but more sensitive to adverse economic downturns or individual issuer developments. 

 If our Manager overestimates the yields or incorrectly prices the risks of our investments, we may experience losses. 

 Our Manager values our potential investments based on yields and risks, taking into account estimated future losses on the mortgage
loans and the underlying collateral included in the securitization's pools, and the estimated impact of these losses on expected future cash flows and returns. Our Manager's loss estimates may not
prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates. In the event that our Manager underestimates the asset level losses relative to the price we pay for a particular investment, we may
experience losses with respect to such investment. 

 Real estate valuation is inherently subjective and uncertain 

 The valuation of real estate and therefore the valuation of any underlying security relating to loans made by us is inherently
subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each property, its location, the expected future rental revenues from that particular property and the valuation methodology adopted.
In addition, where we invest in construction loans, initial valuations will assume completion of the project. As a result, the valuations of the real estate assets
against which we will make loans are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions and methodologies that may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of
volatility, low transaction flow or restricted debt availability in the commercial or residential real estate markets. 

 Our investments in corporate bank debt and debt securities of commercial real estate operating or finance companies are subject to the specific risks relating to the
particular company and to the general risks of investing in real estate-related loans and securities, which may result in significant losses. 

 We invest in corporate bank debt and may invest in debt securities of commercial real estate operating or finance companies. These
investments involve special risks relating to the particular company, including its financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, business and prospects. In particular, the debt securities
are often non-collateralized and may also be subordinated to its other obligations. We also invest in debt securities of companies that are not rated or are rated
non-investment grade by one or more rating agencies. Investments that are not rated or are rated non-investment grade have a higher risk of default than investment grade rated
assets and therefore may result in losses to us. We have not adopted any limit on such investments. 

These
investments also subject us to the risks inherent with real estate-related investments, including: 

risks of delinquency and foreclosure, and risks of loss in the event thereof; 
 the dependence upon the successful operation of, and net income from, real property; 
 
 27 

Table of Contents 

risks generally incident to interests in real property; and 
 risks specific to the type and use of a particular property. 

These
risks may adversely affect the value of our investments in commercial real estate operating and finance companies and the ability of the issuers thereof to make principal and
interest payments in a timely manner, or at all, and could result in significant losses. 

 Investments in non-conforming and non-investment grade rated loans or securities involve increased risk of loss. 

 Many of our investments do not conform to conventional loan standards applied by traditional lenders and either are not rated or rated
as non-investment grade by the rating agencies. The non-investment grade ratings for these assets typically result from the overall leverage of the loans, the lack of a strong
operating history for the properties underlying the loans, the borrowers' credit history, the properties' underlying cash flow or other factors. As a result, these investments have a higher risk of
default and loss than investment grade rated assets. Any loss we incur may be significant and may reduce distributions to our stockholders and adversely affect the market value of our common stock.
There are no limits on the percentage of unrated or non-investment grade rated assets we may hold in our investment portfolio. 

 Any credit ratings assigned to our investments are subject to ongoing evaluations and revisions and we cannot assure you that those ratings will not be downgraded. 

 Some of our investments are rated by Moody's Investors Service, Fitch Ratings, Standard Poor's, DBRS, Inc. or
Realpoint LLC. Any credit ratings on our investments are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that any such ratings will not be changed or withdrawn
by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. If rating agencies assign a lower-than-expected rating or reduce or withdraw, or indicate that they
may reduce or withdraw, their ratings of our investments in the future, the value of these investments could significantly decline, which would adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio
and could result in losses upon disposition or the failure of borrowers to satisfy their debt service obligations to us. 

 The B-Notes that we acquire may be subject to additional risks related to the privately negotiated structure and terms of the transaction, which may result in
losses to us. 

 We may invest in B-Notes. B-Notes are mortgage loans typically (i) secured by a first mortgage on a
single large commercial property or group of related properties and (ii) subordinated to an A-Note secured by the same first mortgage on the same collateral. As a result, if a
borrower defaults, there may not be sufficient funds remaining for B-Note holders after payment to the A-Note holders. However, because each transaction is privately
negotiated, B-Notes can vary in their structural characteristics and risks. For example, the rights of holders of B-Notes to control the process following a borrower default
may vary from transaction to transaction. Further, B-Notes typically are secured by a single property and so reflect the risks associated with significant concentration. Significant losses
related to our B-Notes would result in operating losses for us and may limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 

 Our mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties. 

 We invest in mezzanine loans, which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans
secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property.
These types of assets involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may 

 28 

Table of Contents 

 become
unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender. In the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse
to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. If a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event
of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. As a result, we may not recover some or all of our initial expenditure. In addition, mezzanine loans may have
higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. Significant losses related
to our mezzanine loans would result in operating losses for us and may limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 

 Bridge loans involve a greater risk of loss than traditional investment-grade mortgage loans with fully insured borrowers. 

 We may acquire bridge loans secured by first lien mortgages on a property to borrowers who are typically seeking short-term
capital to be used in an acquisition, construction or rehabilitation of a property, or other short-term liquidity needs. The typical borrower under a bridge loan has usually identified an
undervalued asset that has been under-managed and/or is located in a recovering market. If the market in which the asset is located fails to recover according to the borrower's projections, or if the
borrower fails to improve the quality of the asset's management and/or the value of the asset, the borrower may not receive a sufficient return on the asset to satisfy the bridge loan, and we bear the
risk that we may not recover some or all of our initial expenditure. 

 In
addition, borrowers usually use the proceeds of a conventional mortgage to repay a bridge loan. Bridge loans therefore are subject to risks of a borrower's inability to obtain
permanent financing to repay the bridge loan. Bridge loans are also subject to risks of borrower defaults, bankruptcies, fraud, losses and special hazard losses that are not covered by standard hazard
insurance. In the event of any default under bridge loans held by us, we bear the risk of loss of principal and non-payment of interest and fees to the extent of any deficiency between the
value of the mortgage collateral and the principal amount and unpaid interest of the bridge loan. To the extent we suffer such losses with respect to our bridge loans, the value of our company and the
price of our shares of common stock may be adversely affected. 

 We purchase securities backed by subprime or alternative documentation residential mortgage loans, which are subject to increased risks. 

We own non-agency RMBS backed by collateral pools of mortgage loans that have been originated using underwriting standards
that are less restrictive than those used in underwriting "prime mortgage loans." These lower standards include mortgage loans made to borrowers having imperfect or impaired credit histories, mortgage
loans where the amount of the loan at origination is 80 or more of the value of the mortgage property, mortgage loans made to borrowers with low credit scores, mortgage loans made to borrowers who
have other debt that represents a large portion of their income and mortgage loans made to borrowers whose income is not required to be disclosed or verified. Due to economic conditions, including
increased interest rates and lower home prices, as well as aggressive lending practices, subprime mortgage loans have in recent periods experienced increased rates of delinquency, foreclosure,
bankruptcy and loss, and they are likely to continue to experience delinquency, foreclosure, bankruptcy and loss rates that are higher, and that may be substantially higher, than those experienced by
mortgage loans underwritten in a more traditional manner. Thus, because of the higher delinquency rates and losses associated with subprime mortgage loans and alternative documentation, or Alt A,
mortgage loans, the performance of non-agency RMBS backed by subprime mortgage loans and Alt A mortgage loans that we may acquire could be correspondingly adversely affected, which could
adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and business. 

 29 

Table of Contents 

 The residential mortgage loans that we acquire, and that underlie the RMBS we acquire, are subject to risks particular to investments secured by mortgage loans on
residential real estate property. These risks are heightened because we purchase non-performing loans. 

 Residential mortgage loans are secured by single family residential property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure
and risks of loss. The ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by a residential property typically is dependent upon the income or assets of the borrower. A number of factors may impair
borrowers' abilities to repay their loans, including: 

changes in the borrower's income or assets; 
 acts of God, which may result in uninsured losses; 
 acts of war or terrorism, including the consequences of events; 
 adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions; 
 changes in governmental laws and regulations, including fiscal policies, zoning ordinances and environmental legislation
and the related costs of compliance; 
 costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions; and 
 the potential for uninsured or under-insured property losses. 

In
the event of any default under a mortgage loan held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and
the price we paid for the loan and any accrued interest of the mortgage loan plus advances made, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations. In the event of the
bankruptcy of a mortgage loan borrower, the mortgage loan to such borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy (as
determined by the bankruptcy court), and the lien securing the mortgage loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the
extent the lien is unenforceable under state law. Additionally, foreclosure on a mortgage loan could subject us to greater concentration of the risks of the residential real estate markets and risks
related to the ownership and management of real property. 

 We
may acquire non-agency RMBS, which are backed by residential real estate property but, in contrast to agency RMBS, their principal and interest are not guaranteed by
federally chartered entities such as the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and, in the case of the Government National Mortgage
Association, the U.S. government. Our investments in RMBS are subject to the risks of defaults, foreclosure timeline extension, fraud, home price depreciation and unfavorable modification of loan
principal amount, interest rate and amortization of principal, accompanying the underlying residential mortgage loans. To the extent that assets underlying our investments are concentrated
geographically, by property type or in certain other respects, we may be subject to certain of the foregoing risks to a greater extent. In the event of defaults on the residential mortgage loans that
underlie our investments in agency RMBS and the exhaustion of any underlying or any additional credit support, we may not realize our anticipated return on our investments and we may incur a loss on
these investments. 

 Our inability to promptly foreclose upon defaulted mortgage loans could increase our cost of doing business and/or diminish our expected return on investments. 

Our ability to promptly foreclose upon defaulted mortgage loans and liquidate the underlying real property plays a critical role in our
valuation of the assets in which we invest and our expected return on those investments. There are a variety of factors that may inhibit our ability to foreclose upon a mortgage loan and liquidate the
real property within the time frames we model as part of our valuation process. These factors include, without limitation: federal, state or local legislative action or initiatives designed to provide
homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential mortgage loan foreclosures and 

 30 

Table of Contents 

 that
serve to delay the foreclosure process; Home Affordable Modification Program and other programs that require specific procedures to be followed to explore the refinancing of a mortgage loan prior
to the commencement of a foreclosure proceeding; and continued declines in real estate values and sustained high levels of unemployment that increase the number of foreclosures and place additional
pressure on the already overburdened judicial and administrative systems. 

Prepayment rates may adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio. 

 The value of our investment portfolio is affected by prepayment rates on our mortgage assets. In many cases, borrowers are not
prohibited from making prepayments on their mortgage loans. Prepayment rates are influenced by changes in interest rates and a variety of economic, geographic and other factors beyond our control,
including, without limitation, housing and financial markets and relative interest rates on fixed rate mortgage loans, and adjustable rate mortgage loans, or ARMs, and consequently prepayment rates
cannot be predicted. 

 We
generally receive payments from principal payments that are made on our mortgage assets, including residential mortgage loans underlying the agency RMBS or the non-agency
RMBS that we acquire. When borrowers prepay their residential mortgage loans faster than expected, it results in prepayments that are faster than expected on the RMBS. Faster than expected prepayments
could adversely affect our profitability and our ability to recoup our cost of certain investments purchased at a premium over par value, including in the following
ways: 

We may purchase RMBS that have a higher interest rate than the market interest rate at the time. In exchange for this
higher interest rate, we may pay a premium over the par value to acquire our mortgage asset. In accordance with GAAP, we may amortize this premium over the estimated term of our mortgage asset. If our
mortgage asset is prepaid in whole or in part prior to its maturity date, however, we may be required to expense the premium that was prepaid at the time of the prepayment. 
 Prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise, making it unlikely
that we would be able to reinvest the proceeds of any prepayment in mortgage assets of similar quality and terms (including yield). If we are unable to invest in similar mortgage assets, we would be
adversely affected. 

While
we seek to minimize prepayment risk to the extent practical, in selecting investments we must balance prepayment risk against other risks and the potential returns of each
investment. No strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment risk. 

 Interest rate mismatches between our agency RMBS backed by ARMs and our borrowings used to fund our purchases of these assets may reduce our net interest income and
cause us to suffer a loss during periods of rising interest rates. 

 To the extent that we invest in agency RMBS backed by ARMs, we may finance these investments with borrowings that have interest rates
that adjust more frequently than the interest rate indices and repricing terms of agency RMBS backed by ARMs. Accordingly, if short-term interest rates increase, our borrowing costs
may increase faster than the interest rates on agency RMBS backed by ARMs adjust. As a result, in a period of rising interest rates, we could experience a decrease in net income or a net loss.
In most cases, the interest rate indices and repricing terms of agency RMBS backed by ARMs and our borrowings will not be identical, thereby potentially creating an interest rate mismatch
between our investments and our borrowings. While the historical spread between relevant short-term interest rate indices has been relatively stable, there have been periods when the
spread between these indices was volatile. During periods of changing interest rates, these interest rate index mismatches could reduce our net income or produce a net loss, and adversely affect our
ability to make distributions and the market price of our common stock. 

 31 

Table of Contents 

 In
addition, agency RMBS backed by ARMs are typically subject to lifetime interest rate caps which limit the amount an interest rate can increase through the maturity of the
agency RMBS. However, our borrowings under repurchase agreements typically are not subject to similar restrictions. Accordingly, in a period of rapidly increasing interest rates, the interest rates
paid on our borrowings could increase without limitation while caps could limit the interest rates on these types of agency RMBS. This problem is magnified for agency RMBS backed by ARMs that
are not fully indexed. Further, some agency RMBS backed by ARMs may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in a portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal
outstanding. As a result, we may receive less cash income on these types of agency RMBS than we need to pay interest on our related borrowings. These factors could reduce our net interest income and
cause us to suffer a loss during periods of rising interest rates. 

 Risks of cost overruns and noncompletion of renovation of the properties underlying rehabilitation loans may result in significant losses. 

The renovation, refurbishment or expansion by a borrower under a mortgaged property involves risks of cost overruns and noncompletion.
Estimates of the costs of improvements to bring an acquired property up to standards established for the market position intended for that property may prove inaccurate. Other risks may include
rehabilitation costs exceeding original estimates, possibly making a project uneconomical, environmental risks and rehabilitation and subsequent leasing of the property not being completed on
schedule. If such renovation is not completed in a timely manner, or if it costs more than expected, the borrower may experience a prolonged impairment of net operating income and may not be able to
make payments on our investment, which could result in significant losses. 

 Interest rate fluctuations could reduce our ability to generate income on our investments and may cause losses. 

 Changes in interest rates affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our
interest-earning investments and the interest expense we incur in financing these investments. Changes in the level of interest rates also may affect our ability to originate and acquire assets, the
value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the disposition of assets. Changes in interest rates may also affect borrower default rates. In a period of rising interest rates, our
interest expense could increase, while the interest we earn on our fixed-rate debt investments would not change, adversely affecting our profitability. Our operating results depend in
large part on differences between the income from our assets, net of credit losses, and our financing costs. We anticipate that for any period during which our assets are not match-funded, the income
from such assets will respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of our borrowings. Consequently, changes in interest rates may significantly influence our net income. Increases
in these rates tend to decrease our net income and the market value of our fixed rate assets. Interest rate fluctuations resulting in our interest expense exceeding interest income would result in
operating losses for us. 

 We may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets. 

 A decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an "other-than-temporary" impairment
against such assets under GAAP if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a
period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets. If such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the
amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Such impairment
charges reflect
non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our 

 32 

Table of Contents 

 future
losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. 

 Some of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value and, as a result, there is uncertainty as to the value of these investments. 

 Some of our portfolio investments are in the form of positions or securities that are not publicly traded. The fair value of securities
and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. We value these investments quarterly at fair value, as determined in accordance with GAAP, which include
consideration of unobservable inputs. Because such valuations are subjective, the fair value of certain of our assets may fluctuate over short periods of time and our determinations of fair value may
differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. The value of our common stock could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding
the fair value of these investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal. 

 Liability relating to environmental matters may impact the value of properties that we may acquire upon foreclosure of the properties underlying our investments. 

 To the extent we foreclose on properties with respect to which we have extended mortgage loans, we may be subject to environmental
liabilities arising from such foreclosed properties. Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal of certain
hazardous substances released on its property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous
substances. 

 The
presence of hazardous substances may adversely affect an owner's ability to sell real estate or borrow using real estate as collateral. To the extent that an owner of a property
underlying one of our debt investments becomes liable for removal costs, the ability of the owner to make payments to us may be reduced, which in turn may adversely affect the value of the relevant
mortgage asset held by us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 

If
we foreclose on any properties underlying our investments, the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property and we may incur
substantial remediation costs, thus harming our financial condition. The discovery of material environmental liabilities attached to such properties could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

 We may invest in triple net leases. Negative market conditions or adverse events affecting tenants, or the industries in which they operate, could have an adverse impact on
any triple net lease in which we invest. 

 We may enter into triple net leases. If we enter into triple net leases, cash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to
lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms. If we enter into triple net leases, we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such
as: 

lack of demand in areas where our properties are located; 
 inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants; 
 oversupply of space and changes in market rental rates; 
 our tenants' creditworthiness and ability to pay rent, which may be affected by their operations, the current economic
situation and competition within their industries from other operators; 
 defaults by and bankruptcies of tenants, failure of tenants to pay rent on a timely basis, or failure of tenants to comply
with their contractual obligations; and 
 economic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located. 

At
any time, any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition. As a result, a tenant may delay lease
commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or
failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant's lease and material losses to us. 

 If
tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent or sell the properties. Furthermore, leases that are renewed, and some new leases for properties that are
re-leased, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, tenant improvements or lease
transaction costs. Negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value, which could result in impairments. Any of these events could adversely affect
cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance
and maintenance, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties. In a weakened financial condition, tenants may not be able to pay these costs of
ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them. 

 Further,
the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant's lease or leases. In addition, a bankruptcy court might authorize the
tenant to terminate its leases with us. If that happens, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would be substantially
less than the
remaining rent we are owed under the leases. In addition, any claim we have for unpaid past rent, if any, may not be paid in full. As a result, tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations. 

 Past or future actions of the U.S. government for the purpose of reforming and/or stabilizing the financial markets may adversely affect our business. 

 In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the U.S. government, through the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury, the SEC, the Federal
Housing Administration, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking various actions to 

 34 

Table of Contents 

 address
the financial crisis. Many aspects of these actions are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us and,
more generally, the financial services and mortgage industries. Additionally, we cannot predict whether there will be additional proposed laws or reforms that would affect us, whether or when such
changes may be adopted, how such changes may be interpreted and enforced or how such changes may affect us. However, the costs of complying with any additional laws or regulations could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

 Investments outside the U.S. that are denominated in foreign currencies subject us to foreign currency risks, which may adversely affect our distributions and our REIT
status. 

 Our investments outside the U.S. denominated in foreign currencies subject us to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in
exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in exchange rates of any such foreign currency to U.S. dollars may affect our income and distributions and may also
affect the book value of our assets and the amount of stockholders' equity. 

 Changes
in foreign currency exchange rates used to value a REIT's foreign assets may be considered changes in the value of the REIT's assets. These changes may adversely affect our
status as a REIT. Further, bank accounts in foreign currency which are not considered cash or cash equivalents may adversely affect our status as a REIT. 

The ongoing Eurozone crisis may have an adverse effect on investments in Europe and the break up of the Eurozone, or the exit of any member state, would create uncertainty
and could affect our investments directly. 

 A portion of our investments consists of target assets secured by European collateral. The ongoing situation relating to the sovereign
debt of several countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal, together with the risk of contagion to other, more financially stable countries, has exacerbated the difficult global
financial situation. The situation has also raised a number of uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Monetary Union. Any further deterioration in the global or
Eurozone economy could have a significant adverse effect on our activities and the value of our European collateral. 

 In
addition, if we hold any assets that are denominated in Euros (including loans secured on such assets), such as assets in continental Europe, further deterioration in the Eurozone
economy could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment in such assets and amplify the currency risks faced by us. 

 If
any country were to leave the Eurozone, or if the Eurozone were to break up entirely, the treatment of debt obligations previously denominated in Euros is uncertain. A number of
issues would be raised, such as whether obligations which are expressed to be payable in Euros would be re-denominated into a new currency. The answer to this and other questions is
uncertain and would depend on the way in which the break-up occurred and also on the nature of the transaction: the law governing it; which courts have jurisdiction in relation to it; the
place of payment; and the place of incorporation of the payor. If we held any investments in Euros at the time of any Eurozone exits or break-up, this uncertainty and potential
re-denomination could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments and the income from them.

 We have not previously invested in residential REO and our property management costs, capital expenditures, financing charges, property taxes and other fees and expenses
could exceed our rental income from any such investments. 

 Our board of directors has approved the expansion of our investment guidelines to include residential REO. Sales of pools of single to
four family residential properties is a relatively recent occurrence and the process for bidding on these assets is not yet well established. Our Manager will seek to perform extensive due diligence
on these assets prior to purchase, but market and competitive forces may make it difficult to do so. In addition, the preparation of detailed cost and revenue projections prior to acquiring these
assets will require us to make a number of estimates and assumptions, including assumptions about occupancy levels, capital expenditures, costs associated with carrying and operating our portfolio,
tenant defaults, trends in rental rates and other factors. Our assumptions may prove, in hindsight, to be incorrect. 

Our
ability to generate positive cash flows from operations from residential REO will also be influenced by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, without
limitation, the following: 

overall conditions in the single to four family housing and rental markets,
including: 
 macroeconomic shifts in demand for residential rental properties; 
 inability to lease or re-lease properties to tenants timely and on attractive terms or at all; 
 failure of tenants to pay rent when due or otherwise perform their lease obligations; 
 unanticipated repairs, capital expenditures or other costs; 
 uninsured damages; and 
 increases in property taxes and insurance costs; 
 pace of residential foreclosures; 
 level of competition for suitable target assets; 
 terms and conditions of purchase contracts; 
 availability of new government programs to reduce foreclosure rates or facilitate a recovery in the housing markets; 
 the impact of any "lease to own" or similar programs that we may employ with regard to residential REO; 
 changes in laws that increase operating expenses or limit rents that may be charged; 
 limitations imposed upon us by government-related or other sellers on our ability to sell residential REO during a certain
time period; 
 the short-term nature of most residential leases and the costs and potential delays in re-leasing; 
 the amount and cost of debt financing we employ to leverage our returns; 
 the geographic mix of our assets; and 
 the cost, quality and condition of assets we are able to purchase. 
 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 The lack of liquidity of our residential REO investments may adversely affect our long-term profitability on such investments and increases the risk that we
could suffer losses on such investments if our rental strategy does not generate sufficient cash flows to sustain our portfolio until market conditions improve. 

 If we find it necessary to liquidate residential REO assets for any reason prior to a significant improvement in the residential
market, we may experience losses upon the sale of these investments. The illiquidity of residential REO assets means that our ability to vary our asset base in response to changes in economic and
other conditions may be severely constrained, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In the event prices of residential assets increase, there may be a limited
number of potential purchasers of portfolios of such assets which may reduce our efficiency and profits upon sales. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell properties for the prices or on
the terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We cannot predict the length of time needed to find willing purchasers and to
close the sale of properties. If we are unable to sell properties when we determine to do so, or if we are prohibited from doing so, it could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and
results of operations from such investments. 

 We may rely on local, third-party service providers in connection with REO investments. 

 In connection with any REO investments, we may rely on local, third-party vendors and services providers for certain services for our
properties. For example, we may rely on third-party house improvement professionals, leasing agents and property management companies. We do not have exclusive or long-term contractual
relationships with any of these third-parties. Our cash flows from REO properties may be adversely affected if third-party vendors and service providers with whom we do business fail to provide
quality services. 

 Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure 

 Certain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control. 

 Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or the MGCL, may have the effect of deterring a third party from making a
proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change in control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the
then-prevailing market price of our common stock. We are subject to the "business combination" provisions of the MGCL that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations
(including a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities) between us and an "interested
stockholder" (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of our then outstanding voting capital stock or an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the
two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of our then outstanding voting capital stock) or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most
recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between us and an interested stockholder generally must be
recommended by our board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of at least (i) 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of our voting capital stock and
(ii) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting capital stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose
affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder. These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if our common stockholders
receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares.
These provisions of the MGCL do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by a board of directors prior to the time that the 

 37 

Table of Contents 

 interested
stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Pursuant to the statute, our board of directors has by resolution exempted business combinations between us and any other person, provided
that such business combination is first approved by our board of directors (including a majority of our directors who are not affiliates or associates of such person). 

 The
"control share" provisions of the MGCL provide that "control shares" of a Maryland corporation (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the
stockholder (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a "control share
acquisition" (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of "control shares") have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote
of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding votes entitled to be cast by the acquirer of control shares, our officers and our personnel who are
also our directors. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of our stock. There can be no assurance that
this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future. 

The
"unsolicited takeover" provisions of the MGCL permit our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to
implement takeover defenses, some of which (for example, a classified board) we do not yet have. These provisions may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal
for us or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us under the circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of shares of common stock with the opportunity to realize a
premium over the then current market price. 

 Our authorized but unissued shares of common and preferred stock may prevent a change in control. 

Our charter authorizes us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common or preferred stock. In addition, our board of
directors may, without stockholder approval, amend our charter to increase the aggregate number of our shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to
issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. As a result, our board of
directors may establish a series of shares of common or preferred stock that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our shares of common
stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. 

 Maintenance of our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act imposes significant limits on our operations. 

 We intend to conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Because we are a holding company that conducts our businesses primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries, the securities issued by these subsidiaries that are
excepted from the definition of "investment company" under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities we own, may not
have a combined value in excess of 40 of the value of our adjusted total assets on an unconsolidated basis. This requirement limits the types of businesses in which we may engage through our
subsidiaries. In addition, the assets we and our subsidiaries may acquire are limited by the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the rules and regulations promulgated under the Investment
Company Act, which may adversely affect our performance. 

 If
the value of securities issued by our subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of "investment company" by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act,
together with any 

 38 

Table of Contents 

 other
investment securities we own, exceeds 40 of our adjusted total assets on an unconsolidated basis, or if one or more of such subsidiaries fail to maintain an exception or exemption from the
Investment Company Act, we could, among other things, be required either (i) to substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an
investment company or (ii) to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, either of which could have an adverse effect on us and the market price of our securities. If
we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability
to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification
and industry concentration, and other matters. 

 The
SEC recently solicited public comment on a wide range of issues relating to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, including the nature of the assets that qualify
for purposes of the exemption and whether mortgage REITs should be regulated in a manner similar to investment companies. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the
Investment Company Act status of REITs, including the Division of Investment Management of the SEC providing more specific or different guidance regarding these exemptions, will not change in a manner
that adversely affects our operations. If we or our subsidiaries fail to maintain an exception of exemption from the Investment Company Act, we could, among other things, be required to
(i) change the manner
in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company, (ii) effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time when, we would not otherwise
choose to do so, or (iii) register as an investment company (which, among other things, would require us to comply with the leverage constraints applicable to investment companies), any of
which could negatively affect the value of our common stock, the sustainability of our business model, and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, which could, in turn, materially and
adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock. 

 Rapid changes in the values of our other real estate-related investments may make it more difficult for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT or exemption from the
Investment Company Act. 

 If the market value or income potential of real estate-related investments declines as a result of increased interest rates, prepayment
rates or other factors, we may need to increase our real estate investments and income and/or liquidate our non-qualifying assets in order to maintain our REIT qualification or exemption
from the Investment Company Act. If the decline in real estate asset values and/or income occurs quickly, this may be especially difficult to accomplish. This difficulty may be exacerbated by the
illiquid nature of any non-qualifying assets that we may own. We may have to make investment decisions that we otherwise would not make absent the REIT and Investment Company Act
considerations. 

 Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in
your best interests. 

 Under Maryland law generally, a director's actions will be upheld if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he
or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. In 

 39 

Table of Contents 

 addition,
our charter limits the liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting
from: 

actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services;
or 
 active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was established by a final judgment as being material to
the cause of action adjudicated. 

Our
charter authorizes us to indemnify our directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. Our bylaws require us to
indemnify each director or officer, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of his or
her service to us. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our
directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent the current provisions in our charter and bylaws or that might exist with other companies. 

 Our charter contains provisions that make removal of our directors difficult, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to effect changes to our management. 

 Our charter provides that a director may only be removed for cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of two-thirds of
the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors. Vacancies may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if less than a quorum. These requirements make it more
difficult to change our management by removing and replacing directors and may prevent a change in control of our company that is in the best interests of our stockholders. 

 Ownership limitations may restrict change of control or business combination opportunities in which our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares. 

 In order for us to qualify as a REIT, no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly,
by five or fewer individuals during the last half of any calendar year. "Individuals" for this purpose include natural persons, private foundations, some employee benefit plans and trusts, and some
charitable trusts. To preserve our REIT qualification, our charter generally prohibits any person from directly or indirectly owning more than 9.8 in value or in number of shares, whichever is more
restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our capital stock or more than 9.8 in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our common stock. This
ownership limitation could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of our common stock might receive a
premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price or which holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests. 

 Risks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT 

 If we do not qualify as a REIT or fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will be subject to tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability, which
would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 

 We intend to continue to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We have not
requested nor obtained a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, as to our REIT qualification. Our qualification as a REIT depends on our satisfaction of certain asset, income,
organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair
values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT income and quarterly 

 40 

Table of Contents 

 asset
requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. Moreover, the proper classification of an instrument as debt or
equity for federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the REIT qualification requirements as described below. Accordingly, there can be
no assurance that the IRS will not contend that our interests in subsidiaries or in securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the REIT requirements. 

 If
we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular
corporate rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income. Any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the
amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code
provisions, we also would be
disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT. 

 Dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends. 

 The maximum tax rate applicable to income from "qualified dividends" payable to domestic stockholders that are individuals, trusts and
estates is currently 20 . Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. Although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends
payable by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be
relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our common
stock. 

 REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to continue to execute our business plan. 

We generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital
gain, in order for federal corporate income tax not to apply to earnings that we distribute. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100 of our taxable
income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to
our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under federal tax laws. We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the REIT requirements
of the Code. 

 From
time to time, we may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes prepared in accordance with GAAP, or differences in timing between the
recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash may occur. For example, we may be required to accrue income from mortgage loans, MBS, and other types of debt securities or interests in
debt securities before we receive any payments of interest or principal on such assets. We may also acquire distressed debt investments that are subsequently modified by agreement with the borrower.
If the amendments to the outstanding debt are "significant modifications" under the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us at a gain in a
debt-for-debt exchange with the borrower, with gain recognized by us to the extent that the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our cost of purchasing it prior to
modification. 

 We
may also be required under the terms of indebtedness that we incur to use cash received from interest payments to make principal payments on that indebtedness, with the effect of
recognizing income but not having a corresponding amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 

 41 

Table of Contents 

 As
a result, we may find it difficult or impossible to meet distribution requirements from our ordinary operations in certain circumstances. In particular, where we experience
differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash, the requirement to distribute a substantial portion of our taxable income could cause us to:
(i) sell assets in adverse market conditions, (ii) borrow on unfavorable terms, (iii) distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital
expenditures or repayment of debt or (iv) make a taxable distribution of our shares, as part of a distribution in which stockholders may elect to receive shares (subject to a limit measured as
a percentage of the total distribution), in order to comply with REIT requirements. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may
hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. 

 We may choose to pay dividends in our own stock possibly requiring our stockholders to pay taxes in excess of the cash dividends they receive. 

 Although we have no current intention to do so, we may in the future distribute taxable dividends payable either in cash or shares of
our stock at the election of each stockholder, but subject to a limitation on the amount of cash that may be distributed. Taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the
full amount of the dividend, whether received as cash or shares of our common stock, as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. As a result, stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. 

 The stock ownership limit imposed by the Code for REITs and our charter may restrict our business combination opportunities. 

 In order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock may be
owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year following our first year. Our
charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our board of
directors to take the actions that are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. Unless exempted by our board of directors, no person may own more than 9.8 of the aggregate
value of our outstanding capital stock. Our board may grant an exemption in its sole discretion, subject to such conditions, representations and undertakings as it may determine. The ownership limits
imposed by the tax law are based upon direct or indirect ownership by "individuals," but only during the last half of a tax year. The ownership limits contained in our charter key off of the ownership
at any time by any "person," which term includes entities. These ownership limitations in our charter are common in REIT charters and are intended to provide added assurance of compliance with the tax
law requirements, and to minimize administrative burdens. However, these ownership limits might also delay or prevent a transaction or a change in our control that might involve a premium price for
our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. 

 Even if we remain qualified as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. 

 Even if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and
assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, and state or local income, property and transfer taxes, such as mortgage
recording taxes. In addition, in order to continue to meet the REIT qualification requirements, prevent the recognition of certain types of non-cash income, or to avert the imposition of a
100 tax that applies to certain gains derived by a REIT from dealer property or inventory, we may hold some of our assets through our TRS or other subsidiary corporations that will 

 42 

Table of Contents 

 be
subject to corporate-level income tax at regular rates. In addition, if we lend money to a TRS, the TRS may be unable to deduct all or a portion of the interest paid to us, which could result in an
even higher corporate-level tax liability. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 

 Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities. 

 To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy ongoing tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our
income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts that we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. We may be required to make distributions to stockholders at
disadvantageous times or when we do not
have funds readily available for distribution, and may be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source-of-income or
asset-diversification requirements for qualifying as a REIT. In addition, in certain cases, the modification of a debt instrument could result in the conversion of the instrument from a qualifying
real estate asset to a wholly or partially non-qualifying asset that must be contributed to a TRS or disposed of in order for us to maintain our REIT status. Compliance with the
source-of-income requirements may also limit our ability to acquire debt instruments at a discount from their face amount. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may
hinder our ability to make and, in certain cases, to maintain ownership of, certain attractive investments. 

 Complying with REIT requirements may force us to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. 

 To qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of
cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of MBS. The remainder of our investment in securities (other than
government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the
outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5 of the value of our assets (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the
securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25 of the value of our total securities can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of
any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification
and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio otherwise attractive investments. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and
amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. 

 The failure of assets subject to repurchase agreements to qualify as real estate assets could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. 

 We have entered into financing arrangements that are structured as sale and repurchase agreements pursuant to which we would nominally
sell certain of our assets to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase these assets at a later date in exchange for a purchase price. Economically, these agreements are
financings which are secured by the assets sold pursuant thereto. We believe that we would be treated for REIT asset and income test purposes as the owner of the assets that are the subject of any
such sale and repurchase agreement notwithstanding that such agreement may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement. It is possible, however, that
the IRS could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement, in which case we could fail to qualify as a REIT.

 We may be required to report taxable income for certain investments in excess of the economic income we ultimately realize from them. 

 We may acquire debt instruments in the secondary market for less than their face amount. The discount at which such debt instruments
are acquired may reflect doubts about their ultimate collectability rather than current market interest rates. The amount of such discount will nevertheless generally be treated as "market discount"
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accrued market discount is reported as income when, and to the extent that, any payment of principal of the debt instrument is made. Payments on residential
mortgage loans are ordinarily made monthly, and consequently accrued market discount may have to be included in income each month as if the debt instrument were assured of ultimately being collected
in full. If we collect less on the debt instrument than our purchase price plus the market discount we had previously reported as income, we may not be able to benefit from any offsetting loss
deductions. In addition, we may acquire distressed debt investments that are subsequently modified by agreement with the borrower. If the amendments to the outstanding debt are "significant
modifications" under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us at a gain in a debt-for-debt exchange with the
borrower. In that event, we may be required to recognize taxable gain to the extent the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our adjusted tax basis in the unmodified debt, even if the value
of the debt or the payment expectations have not changed. 

 Moreover,
some of the MBS that we acquire may have been issued with original issue discount. We will be required to report such original issue discount based on a constant yield method
and will be taxed based on the assumption that all future projected payments due on such MBS will be made. If such MBS turns out not to be fully collectible, an offsetting loss deduction will become
available only in the later year that uncollectibility is provable. 

 Finally,
in the event that any debt instruments or MBS acquired by us are delinquent as to mandatory principal and interest payments, or in the event payments with respect to a
particular debt instrument are not made when due, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income as it accrues, despite doubt as to its ultimate
collectability. Similarly, we may be required to accrue interest income with respect to subordinate MBS at its stated rate regardless of whether corresponding cash payments are received or are
ultimately collectible. In each case, while we would in general ultimately have an offsetting loss deduction available to us when such interest was determined to be uncollectible, the utility of that
deduction could depend on our having taxable income in that later year or thereafter.

 The "taxable mortgage pool" rules may increase the taxes that we or our stockholders may incur, and may limit the manner in which we effect future securitizations. 

 Securitizations could result in the creation of taxable mortgage pools for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, so long as we own
100 of the equity interests in a taxable mortgage pool, we generally would not be adversely affected by the characterization of the securitization as a taxable mortgage pool. Certain categories of
stockholders, however, such as foreign stockholders eligible for treaty or other benefits, stockholders with net operating losses, and certain tax-exempt stockholders that are subject to
unrelated business income tax, could be subject to increased taxes on a portion of their dividend income from us that is attributable to the taxable mortgage pool. In addition, to the extent that our
stock is owned by tax-exempt "disqualified organizations," such as certain government-related entities and charitable remainder trusts that are not subject to tax on unrelated business
income, we may incur a corporate level tax on a portion of our income from the taxable mortgage pool. In that case, we may reduce the amount of our distributions to any disqualified organization whose
stock ownership gave rise to the tax. Moreover, we would be precluded from selling equity interests in these securitizations to outside investors, or selling any debt securities issued in connection
with these securitizations that might be considered to be equity interests for tax purposes. These limitations may prevent us from using certain techniques to maximize our returns from securitization
transactions. 

 The tax on prohibited transactions will limit our ability to engage in transactions, including certain methods of securitizing mortgage loans, which would be treated as
sales for federal income tax purposes. 

 A REIT's net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other
dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, but including mortgage loans, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. We might be subject to this tax if we
were to dispose of or securitize loans in a manner that was treated as a sale of the loans for federal income tax purposes. Therefore, in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we may choose
not to engage in certain sales of loans at the REIT level, and may limit the structures we utilize for our securitization transactions, even though the sales or structures might otherwise be
beneficial to us. 

 Our investments in construction loans will require us to make estimates about the fair value of land improvements that may be challenged by the IRS. 

We may invest in construction loans, the interest from which will be qualifying income for purposes of the REIT income tests, provided
that the loan value of the real property securing the construction loan is equal to or greater than the highest outstanding principal amount of the construction loan during any taxable year. For
purposes of construction loans, the loan value of the real property is the fair value of the land plus the reasonably estimated cost of the improvements or developments (other than personal property)
that will secure the loan and that are to be constructed from the proceeds of the loan. There can be no assurance that the IRS would not challenge our estimate of the loan value of the real property. 

The failure of a mezzanine loan to qualify as a real estate asset could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. 

 We invest in mezzanine loans, for which the IRS has provided a safe harbor but not rules of substantive law. Pursuant to the safe
harbor, if a mezzanine loan meets certain requirements, it will be treated by the IRS as a real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and interest derived from the mezzanine loan will be
treated as qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the REIT 75 income test. We may acquire mezzanine loans that do not meet all of the requirements of this safe harbor. In the event we own a
mezzanine loan that does not meet the safe harbor, the IRS could 

 45 

Table of Contents 

 challenge
such loan's treatment as a real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests and, if such a challenge were sustained, we could fail to qualify as a REIT. 

 Liquidation of assets may jeopardize our REIT qualification. 

 To qualify as a REIT, we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income. If we are compelled to liquidate
our investments to repay obligations to our lenders, we may be unable to comply with these requirements, ultimately jeopardizing our qualification as a REIT, or we may be subject to a 100 tax on any
resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as dealer property or inventory. 

 Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. 

 The REIT provisions of the Code substantially limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. Any income from a hedging transaction we
enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets does not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the 75 or
95 gross income tests. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for
purposes of both of the gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we intend to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a domestic TRS. This could
increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRS would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to
bear. In addition, losses in our TRS will generally not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income in the TRS. 

Qualifying as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Code. 

 Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited judicial and
administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. Our qualification as a REIT will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset,
income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. In addition, our ability to satisfy the
requirements to qualify as a REIT depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an
entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

 Risks Related to LNR's Business and the Company's Pending Acquisition of LNR 

 The acquisition of LNR, and particularly its special servicing business, potentially exposes us to risks that we do not face in our current business. 

 LNR derives a substantial portion of its cash flows from the special servicing of pools of commercial mortgage loans. As special
servicer, LNR typically receives fees based upon the outstanding balance of the loans which are being specially serviced by LNR. We anticipate that the balance of loans in special servicing where LNR
acts as special servicer will decline significantly over the next several years and that LNR's servicing fees will likewise decline materially. The special servicing industry is highly competitive,
and LNR's inability to compete successfully with other firms to maintain its existing servicing portfolio and obtain future servicing opportunities could have a material and adverse impact on LNR's
future cash flows and results of operations, which, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations if the special servicing portfolio declines more than we projected in our underwriting of
the acquisition. Because the right to appoint the special servicer for securitized mortgage loans generally resides with the holder of the "controlling class" position in the relevant trust and may 

 46 

Table of Contents 

 migrate
to holders of different classes of securities as additional losses are realized, LNR's ability to maintain its existing servicing rights and obtain future servicing opportunities may require,
in many cases, the acquisition of additional CMBS securities. Accordingly, LNR's ability to compete effectively may depend, in part, on the availability of additional debt or equity capital to fund
these purchases. Additionally, LNR's existing servicing portfolio is subject to "run off," meaning that mortgage loans serviced by it may be prepaid prior to maturity, refinanced with a mortgage not
serviced by LNR or liquidated through foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or other liquidation processes or repaid through standard amortization of principal, resulting in
lower servicing fees and/or lower returns on the subordinated securities owned by LNR. Improving economic conditions and property prices, and declines in interest rates and greater availability of
mortgage financing, can reduce the incidence of assets going into special servicing and reduce LNR's revenues
from special servicing, including as a result of lower fees under new arrangements. The fair value of LNR's servicing rights may decrease under the foregoing circumstances, resulting in losses to us. 

LNR's
conduit operations are subject to volatile market conditions and significant competition. In addition, the conduit business may suffer losses as a result of ineffective or
inadequate hedges and credit issues. 

 LNR's
businesses outside of the United States subject it to currency risks. Most of LNR Europe's investments and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. LNR
generally does not hedge currency risk. As a result, unfavorable changes in exchange rates could result in losses independent of the performance of the underlying business. 

 Upon the consummation of the LNR acquisition, the Company will be operating a special servicer business which has certain unique risks. 

In connection with the servicing of specially serviced mortgage loans, a special servicer may, at the direction of the directing
certificateholder, generally take actions with respect to the specially serviced mortgage loans that could adversely affect the holders of some or all of the more senior classes of CMBS. We may hold
subordinated CMBS and we may or may not be the directing holder in any CMBS transaction in which LNR also acts as special servicer. We may have conflicts of interest in exercising LNR's rights as
holder of subordinated classes of CMBS and in owning the entity that also acts as the special servicer for such transactions. It is possible that LNR, acting as the directing certificateholder for a
CMBS transaction, may direct special servicer actions that conflict with the interests of certain other classes of the CMBS issued in that transaction. The special servicer is not permitted to take
actions that are prohibited by law or that violate the servicing standard or the terms of the applicable CMBS documentation or the applicable mortgage loan documentation and LNR is subject to the risk
of claims asserted by mortgage loan borrowers and the holders of other classes of CMBS that it has violated applicable law or, if applicable, the servicing standard and its other obligations under
such CMBS documentation or mortgage loan documentation as a result of actions it may take. 

 We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the LNR acquisition or such benefits may take longer to realize than expected. 

 The success of the LNR acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from successfully
integrating LNR's business with ours. The combination of two independent companies is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we will be required to devote significant
management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of LNR. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, could preclude us
from realizing all of the potential benefits we expect to
realize with respect to the acquisition. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating successfully our operations and LNR's operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of
the transaction could cause an 

 47 

Table of Contents 

 interruption
of, or a loss of momentum in, our business and could seriously harm our results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the two companies may result in material
unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of business relationships and diversion of management's attention, and may cause our stock price to decline. 

In
addition, even if our operations and LNR's are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition within the anticipated time frame, or at all. 

 LNR's business is subject to an evolving regulatory environment that may affect certain aspects of its current business. 

 The pools of commercial loans in which LNR acquires subordinated securities and for which it acts as special servicer are structures
commonly referred to as securitizations. As a result of the dislocation of the credit markets, the securitization industry has crafted and continues to craft proposed changes to securitization
practices, including proposed new standard representations and warranties, underwriting guidelines and disclosure guidelines. In addition, the securitization industry is becoming far more regulated.
For example, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("the Dodd-Frank Act") various federal agencies are in the process of promulgating
regulations with respect to various issues that affect securitizations, including (1) a requirement under the Dodd-Frank Act that issuers in securitizations retain 5 of the risk
associated with the securities, (2) requirements for additional disclosure, (3) requirements for additional review and reporting and (4) a possible requirement that a portion of
potential profit that would be realized on the securitization must be deposited in a reserve account and used as additional credit support for the related commercial mortgage backed securities until
the loans are repaid. The regulations ultimately adopted will take effect over the next few years, with the risk-retention regulations primarily taking effect in 2013. Certain proposed
regulations, if adopted, could alter the structure of securitizations in the future and could pose additional risks to our participation in future securitizations or could reduce or eliminate the
economic incentives of participating in future securitizations. 

 If financing for the acquisition of LNR becomes unavailable, we may be forced to liquidate other assets to pay for the acquisition or may be unable to close the acquisition. 

 We intend to finance a portion of the purchase price for the LNR acquisition with equity or debt financing. In connection with entering
into the purchase agreement, we entered into a debt commitment letter with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Credit Suisse AG and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. providing for a senior
secured bridge facility in an aggregate amount of up to 300 million. There are a number of conditions in the debt commitment letter that must be satisfied or waived in order for closing of the
debt financing to occur, and there is a risk these conditions will not be satisfied. In the event that the financing contemplated by the debt commitment letter or other suitable equity or debt
financing is not available to us, we may be required to obtain alternative financing on terms that are less favorable to us than those in the debt commitment letter. If other financing becomes
necessary and we are unable to secure such other financing on acceptable terms, we may be forced to liquidate other assets in order to pay the purchase price of the acquisition, which could have an
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, or we may be unable to close the acquisition at all.

 Failure to complete the acquisition of LNR could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results. 

If the acquisition of LNR is not completed, we may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks and consequences,
including the following: 

following the execution of the purchase agreement, we paid a 50 million deposit and, if the closing has not
occurred by April 1, 2013, we will be required to pay an additional 25 million deposit and an interest charge will accrue on the amount of the purchase price that we pay for the
acquisition. To the extent the transaction is not completed due to an uncured breach of the purchase agreement by us, we will not recover any deposits or interest paid with respect to the transaction; 
 we will be required to pay certain costs relating to the acquisition, whether or not the acquisition is completed, such as
legal, accounting and financial advisor fees; and 
 matters relating to the acquisition may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management team,
which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us. 

In
addition, if the acquisition is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our employees. We also could be subject in some circumstances
to stockholder or other litigation relating to the failure to complete the acquisition, as well as proceedings by the sellers to seek specific performance of our obligations under the purchase
agreement or to recover damages for any breach by us of the purchase agreement. 

 We anticipate that we will acquire "taxable mortgage pools" in the acquisition of LNR, which may increase the taxes that we or our stockholders incur. 

 We anticipate that we will acquire the equity interests in certain taxable mortgage pools in the acquisition of LNR. Certain categories
of stockholders, such as foreign stockholders eligible for treaty or other benefits, stockholders with net operating losses, and certain tax-exempt stockholders that are subject to unrelated business
income tax, could be subject to increased taxes on a portion of their dividend income from us that is attributable to such taxable mortgage pools. In addition, to the extent that our stock is owned by
tax-exempt "disqualified organizations," such as certain government-related entities and charitable remainder trusts that are not subject to tax on unrelated business income, we may incur a corporate
level tax on a portion of our income from such taxable mortgage pools. In that case, we may reduce the amount of our distributions to any disqualified organization whose stock ownership gave rise to
the tax. 

 We anticipate that many of the assets that we acquire in the acquisition of LNR will be acquired by, or will be ownership interests in, entities subject to entity level or
foreign taxes, which cannot be passed through to, or used by, our stockholders to reduce taxes they owe. 

 We anticipate that most of the assets that we acquire in the acquisition of LNR will be held through a taxable REIT subsidiary, or a
TRS, which will be subject to entity level taxes on income that it earns. We anticipate such taxes to materially increase the taxes paid by our TRSs. In addition, we anticipate that certain of the
assets that we acquire in the acquisition of LNR will include entities organized or assets located in foreign jurisdictions. Taxes that we or such entities
pay in foreign jurisdictions may not be passed through to, or used by, our stockholders as a foreign tax credit or otherwise. 

 49 

Table of Contents 

 We may bear the costs of certain pre-closing taxes. 

 The acquisition of LNR will involve the purchase of the LNR companies, a significant portion of which were historically
C corporations for federal income tax purposes, some of which are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. While the sellers of LNR have generally agreed to pay (or indemnify us)
for any pre-closing tax liabilities, such indemnity obligations are generally limited to the amount of the purchase price for LNR and, in certain situations, limited to certain maximum amounts with
respect to certain LNR entities, as agreed upon by the sellers and us. Furthermore, because any such pre-existing tax liabilities may not be assessed by the federal or state taxing authorities, or may
not be settled with such taxing authorities, prior to the release of the escrowed funds to the sellers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce payment or indemnification by the
sellers of or with respect to any such pre-closing tax liabilities. While the sponsors of the sellers are providing a limited guarantee on certain pre-closing tax liabilities, such guarantee is
limited to certain specified entities and certain specified amounts, as agreed to between us, the sellers and such sponsors. Accordingly, such LNR companies may become liable for pre-closing taxes,
which pre-closing taxes may, in the event of an inability to enforce the indemnity or in the event of a tax liability in excess of the agreed upon caps on such liabilities, be borne by us. 

 Our financial statement presentation will change materially as a result of our acquisition of LNR as we will consolidate the assets and liabilities of CMBS pools in which
LNR owns the controlling class of subordinated securities and is considered the "primary beneficiary." 

 Upon our acquisition of LNR, we will be required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of certain CMBS pools in which LNR owns the
controlling class of subordinated securities into our financial statements, even though the value of the subordinated securities may represent a small interest relative to the size of the pool. Under
GAAP, companies are required to consolidate variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which they are determined to be the primary beneficiary. A VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary,
which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents, has a potentially significant interest in the entity and controls the entity's significant decisions. As a result of the
foregoing, our financial statements may be more complex and more difficult to understand than if we did not consolidate the CMBS pools. 

 Recent dislocations, illiquidity and volatility in the market for commercial real estate as well as the broader financial markets have and may continue to adversely affect
the performance and value of commercial mortgage loans, the demand for CMBS and the value of CMBS investments. 

 In recent years, the real estate and securitization markets, as well as global financial markets and the economy generally, have
experienced significant dislocations, illiquidity and volatility. While the United States economy may technically be out of the recession, any recovery could be fragile and may not be sustainable for
any specific period of time. In particular, the pace of progress, or the lack of progress, of federal deficit reduction talks in the United States may cause continued volatility. Furthermore, many
state and local governments in the United States are experiencing, and are expected to continue to experience, severe budgetary constraints. Recently enacted financial reform legislation in the United
States could also adversely affect the availability of credit for commercial real estate. Further, the global financial markets have recently experienced increased volatility due to uncertainty
surrounding the level and sustainability of the sovereign debt of various countries. We cannot assure you that dislocations in the commercial mortgage loan market will not continue to occur or become
more severe. 

 The
downturn in the general economy has affected the financial strength of many commercial, multi-family and other tenants and has resulted in increased rent delinquencies and decreased
occupancy. Any continued downturn may lead to decreased occupancy, decreased rents or other 

 50 

Table of Contents 

 declines
in income from, or the value of, commercial, multi-family and manufactured housing community real estate. 

 Declining
commercial real estate values caused by the economic downturn, coupled with diminished availability of leverage and/or refinancing opportunities for commercial mortgage loans
and the tightening by commercial real estate lenders of underwriting standards, have prevented many commercial borrowers from refinancing their mortgages, which has resulted in increased delinquencies
and defaults on commercial, multi-family and other mortgage loans. Declines in commercial real estate values have also resulted in reduced borrower equity, further hindering borrowers' ability to
refinance in an environment of increasingly restrictive lending standards and giving them less incentive to cure delinquencies and avoid foreclosure. The lack of refinancing opportunities has impacted
and is expected to continue to impact, in particular, mortgage loans that do not fully amortize and on which there is a substantial balloon payment due at maturity, because borrowers generally expect
to refinance these types of loans on or prior to their maturity date. There is a substantial amount of U.S. mortgage loans with balloon payment obligations in excess of their respective current
property values that are maturing over the coming three years. Finally, declining commercial real estate values and the associated increases in loan-to-value ratios result in
lower recoveries on foreclosure and an increase in losses above those that would have been realized had commercial
property values remained the same or continued to increase. Continuing defaults, delinquencies and losses will further decrease property values, thereby resulting in additional defaults by commercial
mortgage borrowers, further credit constraints and further declines in property values. 

 In
addition to credit factors directly affecting CMBS, the continuing fallout from a downturn in the RMBS market and markets for other asset-backed and structured products has also
affected the CMBS market by contributing to a decline in the market value and liquidity of securitized investments such as CMBS, even if such CMBS are performing as expected. All of these factors may
impact the demand for CMBS and the value of CMBS investments, especially subordinated classes of CMBS. 

 LNR's business includes investment in subordinated CMBS. The risks of investment in CMBS are magnified in LNR's case, where the principal payments received by the CMBS trust
are made in priority to the higher rated securities. 

 CMBS are subject to the various risks which relate to the pool of underlying commercial mortgage loans and any other assets in which
the CMBS represents an interest. In addition, CMBS are subject to additional risks arising from the geographic, property type and other types of concentrations in the pool of underlying commercial
mortgage loans which magnify the risks associated with a particular geographic region, property type or other loan characteristic. In the event of defaults on the mortgages in the CMBS trusts, LNR
will bear a risk of loss on its related CMBS to the extent of deficiencies between the value of the collateral and the principal, accrued interest and unpaid fees and expenses on the mortgage loans,
which may be offset to some extent by the special servicing fees received by LNR on those mortgage loans. The yield to maturity on the CMBS will depend largely upon the price paid for the CMBS, which
are generally sold at a discount at issuance and trade at even steeper discounts in the secondary markets. Further, the yield to maturity on CMBS will depend, in significant part, upon the rate and
timing of principal payments on the underlying mortgage loans, including both voluntary prepayments, if permitted, and involuntary prepayments, such as prepayments resulting from casualty or
condemnation, defaults and liquidations or repurchases upon breaches of representations and warranties or document defects. Any changes in the weighted average lives of CMBS may adversely affect yield
on the CMBS. Prepayments resulting in a shortening of weighted average lives of CMBS may be made at a time of low interest rates when we may be unable to reinvest the resulting payment of principal on
the CMBS at a rate comparable to that being earned on the CMBS, while delays and extensions resulting in a lengthening of those weighted average lives may occur at a time of high interest rates when
we may have been able to reinvest scheduled principal payments at higher rates.

Table of Contents 

 The
exercise of remedies and successful realization of liquidation proceeds relating to commercial mortgage loans underlying CMBS may be highly dependent on the performance of LNR as
special
servicer. LNR attempts to underwrite investments on a "loss-adjusted" basis, which projects a certain level of performance. However, there can be no assurance that this underwriting will
accurately predict the timing or magnitude of such losses. To the extent that this underwriting has incorrectly anticipated the timing or magnitude of losses, our business may be adversely affected.
Some of the mortgage loans underlying the CMBS are already in default and additional loans may default in the future. In the case of such defaults, cash flows of CMBS investments held by LNR may be
adversely affected as any reduction in the mortgage payments or principal losses on liquidation of any mortgage loan may be applied to the class of CMBS securities relating to such defaulted loans
that LNR holds. 

 The market value of CMBS could fluctuate materially as a result of various risks that are out of our control and may result in significant losses. 

The market value of CMBS investments could fluctuate materially over time as the result of changes in mortgage spreads, treasury bond
interest rates, capital market supply and demand factors, and many other factors that affect high-yield fixed income products. These factors are out of our control and could impair LNR's
ability to obtain short-term financing on the CMBS. CMBS investments, especially subordinated classes of CMBS, may have no, or only a limited, trading market. The financial markets in the
past have experienced and could in the future experience a period of volatility and reduced liquidity which may reoccur or continue and reduce the market value of CMBS. Some or all of the CMBS,
especially subordinated classes of CMBS, may be subject to restrictions on transfer and may be considered illiquid.

 We
intend to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock and distribution equivalents to holders of restricted stock units which are settled in shares of common
stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of its REIT
taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than
100 of its net taxable income. We generally intend over time to pay quarterly distributions in an amount equal to our taxable income.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

 Overview 

 Starwood Property Trust, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "we" or the "Company") is a Maryland corporation that commenced
operations on August 17, 2009 ("Inception") upon the completion of its initial public offering ("IPO"). We are focused on originating, investing in, financing and managing commercial mortgage
loans and other commercial real estate debt investments, commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS"), and other commercial real estate-related debt investments. We collectively refer to commercial
mortgage loans, other commercial real estate debt investments, CMBS, and other commercial real estate-related debt investments as our target assets. We also invest in residential mortgage-backed
securities ("RMBS") and residential REO, and may invest in distressed or non-performing loans, commercial properties subject to net leases and residential mortgage loans. As market
conditions change over time, we may adjust our strategy to take advantage of changes in interest rates and credit spreads as well as economic and credit conditions. 

 Our
objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted global returns to our investors over the long term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital
appreciation. We employ leverage, to the extent available, to fund the acquisition of our target assets and to increase potential returns to our stockholders. In order to achieve these objectives, we
are focusing on asset selection and the relative value of various sectors within the debt market to construct a diversified investment portfolio designed to produce attractive returns across a variety
of market conditions and economic cycles. We are organized as a holding company that conducts its business primarily through its various subsidiaries. 

 Since
the closing of our initial public offering in August 2009, we have focused primarily on opportunities that exist in the U.S. commercial mortgage loan, commercial real estate debt,
CMBS and RMBS markets, and residential REO. As market conditions change over time, we may adjust our strategy to take advantage of changes in interest rates and credit spreads as well as economic and
credit conditions. We believe that the diversification of our portfolio of assets, our expertise among the target asset classes, and the flexibility of our strategy will position us to generate
attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders in a variety of assets and market conditions. 

 On
January 23, 2013, we entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement with LNR, Aozora Investments LLC, CBR I LLC, iStar Marlin LLC, Opps
VIIb LProp, L.P., and VNO LNR Holdco LLC, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire all the outstanding equity interests of LNR. LNR is a diversified real estate investment,
management, finance and development company whose principal line of business is serving as a special servicer for CMBS transactions. The acquisition of LNR has not yet closed, and accordingly this
Annual Report on Form 10-K and the consolidated financial statements included herein do not reflect the results of LNR's business. 

 We
have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2009. We also operate our business in a
manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. 

 Recent Developments 

 Three months ended March 31, 2012 

Sold 50 of our Euro-denominated loan to a strategic partner, which resulted in proceeds of
 28.8 million and a realized loss of 2.1 million. However, the transactions were earnings neutral after considering the realized gains on currency hedges of 2.1 million that
were terminated in connection with the sale. 
 Acquired 95.4 million of GBP-denominated B-Notes secured by four resorts in the United
Kingdom. The newly issued B-Notes are part of an overall corporate refinancing in which we had a 143.9 million pre-existing GBP-denominated investment. The
pre-existing investment was 
 
 56 

Table of Contents 

originally
purchased at a discount and, due to the early prepayment; we recognized additional income of approximately 12.2 million during the first quarter of 2012, which is considered to be a
non-recurring event. 

Acquired 222.8 million of CMBS at a discounted price of 206.4 million, where the obligors are certain
special purpose entities that were formed to hold substantially all of the assets of a worldwide operator of hotels, resorts and timeshare properties. The acquisition was financed using a new
 155.4 million facility provided by the seller. 
 Originated a 40.0 million mezzanine loan secured by a 10-property portfolio of
full-service and extended-stay hotels located in eight different states. 
 Our subsidiary extended the maturity date of its 100 million master repurchase and securities contract with an
affiliate of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC used to finance the acquisition and ownership of RMBS, from March 16, 2012 to March 15, 2013. Advances under the facility accrue interest
at a per annum interest rate equal to the sum of (i) 30-day LIBOR plus (ii) a margin of 2.10 . We have guaranteed the obligations of our subsidiary under the facility. The
facility and related guarantee contain various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us that are similar in nature to covenants contained in our other financing agreements. 
 Acquired a 125.0 million participation in a senior loan secured by all the material assets of a worldwide operator
of hotels, resorts and timeshare properties for a discounted purchase price of approximately 115.7 million. The acquisition was financed with an 81.0 million increase in a financing
facility previously provided by the seller. 
 We, through certain of our subsidiaries, entered into a new 125.0 million financing facility with an affiliate of
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., to finance commercial mortgage loans and senior interests in commercial mortgage loans originated or acquired by us and including loans and interests intended to
be included in commercial mortgage loan securitizations as well as those not intended to be securitized. Advances under the facility accrue interest at a per annum interest rate equal to the sum of
(i) 30-day LIBOR plus (ii) a margin of between 1.75 and 3.75 depending on (A) asset type, (B) the amount advanced and (C) the debt yield and
loan-to-value ratios of the purchased mortgage loan. The facility has an initial maturity date of March 29, 2014, subject to three one-year extension
options, which may be exercised by us upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. We have guaranteed the obligations of our subsidiaries under the facility up to a maximum liability of 25 of the
then-currently outstanding repurchase price of assets financed there under. The facility and related guarantee contain various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us that are
similar in nature to covenants contained in our other financing agreements. 
 On February 29, 2012, our board of directors declared a dividend of 0.44 per share for the first quarter of 2012,
which was payable on April 13, 2012 to shareholders of record on March 30, 2012. 
 Funded a 59.0 million mortgage loan secured by an office campus located in Northern California. The terms of the
loan provide for up to 4.0 million of future advances upon the satisfaction of specified conditions. 
 Sold the remainder of our held-for-sale first mortgage loans targeted for securitization. As of
December 31, 2011, our net equity investment in these six loans was 36.5 million and the loans had a carrying value of 128.6 million. We realized an aggregate profit of
approximately 1.0 million on the held-for-sale loans and associated interest rate hedges.

 Three months ended June 30, 2012 

Acquired 75.6 million of CMBS at a discounted price of 70.7 million, where the obligors are certain
special purpose entities that were formed to hold substantially all of the assets of a worldwide operator of hotels, resorts and timeshare properties. The acquisition was partially financed using a
 49.3 million increase in a financing facility previously provided by the seller. 
 Sold 20,000,000 shares of common stock at a net price of 19.88 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of
 397.7 million. On April 30, 2012, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase 3,000,000 additional shares of common stock at 19.88 per share, resulting in additional gross
proceeds of 59.6 million. 
 Originated a 73.0 million junior mezzanine loan, of which 45.0 million was initially funded,
collateralized by a portfolio of six office buildings located in Rosslyn, Virginia. The loan provides for up to 28.0 million in future funding for projected capital improvements and leasing
costs. Our junior mezzanine loan was co-originated with a 125.0 million first mortgage loan and a 40.0 million senior mezzanine loan, which were separately funded by third
party lenders at closing. 
 Originated a 170.0 million first mortgage loan on two Class B office buildings located in the SoHo district
of Midtown Manhattan. Collectively known as One SoHo Square, the two properties located at 161 Avenue of the Americas and 233 Spring Street comprise over 600,000 square feet of office and retail
space, which is currently 96 occupied. The first mortgage loan had an initial funding of 135.0 million, with 35.0 million available for future advances to pay for tenant improvements,
leasing commissions and redevelopment costs. 
 Originated an 11.6 million first mortgage loan collateralized by a collection of office, retail and parking
properties in downtown San Diego, California. 
 On May 8, 2012, our board of directors declared a dividend of 0.44 per share for the second quarter of 2012, which
was payable on July 13, 2012 to common stockholders of record as of June 30, 2012. 
 On May 24 and June 28, 2012 we acquired 226 and 26 residential real estate owned ("REO") properties from a
major bank at a cost of 24.5 million and 2.8 million, respectively. Most of the properties were vacant at acquisition, and we are actively preparing the properties to be either rented
or sold, as applicable. From the date of acquisition through June 30, 2012, we incurred approximately 0.3 million in costs of getting the properties ready for their intended use, and
such costs were added to our investment basis. 
 Originated a 30.0 million mezzanine loan collateralized by an office building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
 During the second quarter 2012 we acquired 173.0 million of RMBS (face value) at a 65.2 million discount. 

Three months ended September 30, 2012: 

On July 3, 2012, we entered into a Purchase and Repurchase Agreement and Securities Contract ("Onewest Repurchase
Agreement") with Onewest Bank, FSB ("Onewest"). At closing, we transferred loan investments to Onewest in exchange for a 78.3 million advance. Borrowings under the Onewest Repurchase Agreement
accrue interest at a pricing rate of one-month LIBOR plus a margin of 3.0 . The initial maturity date of the facility is July 3, 2015 with two one-year extension
options, subject to certain conditions.

Table of Contents 

On July 6, 2012, we originated a 51.5 million first mortgage collateralized by three hotels located in
North Carolina, New Jersey, and Virginia. The initial term for the loan is two years, with three one-year extension options. 
 On July 20, 2012, we purchased a 50 undivided participation interest (the "Le Meridien Participation Interest") in
a EUR-denominated mezzanine loan for 68.4 million ("Le M ridien Loan") from an independent third party. The borrower is Starman Luxembourg Holdings
S. R.L. ("Holdings"), an entity that indirectly owns and operates a portfolio of hotels in France and Germany. Holdings is owned 50 by an independent third party and 50 by several
private investment funds that were previously sponsored by Starwood Capital Group Global I, L.L.C., an affiliate of our Manager. The Le M ridien Loan has an initial term of two years
with an option to extend for an additional year, subject to certain conditions, an interest rate of 12.5 , an upfront fee of 2.0 and a prepayment fee of 1.0 . We acquired the Le Meridien
Participation Interest from an independent third party and own the Le Meridien Participation Interest subject to a participation agreement between us and the independent third party (the "Le Meridien
Participation Agreement"). The Le Meridien Participation Agreement provides for the payment to us, on a pro rata basis with an independent third party, of customary payments in respect of the Le
Meridien Participation Interest and affords us customary voting, approval and consent rights. 
 On August 3, 2012, Starwood Property Mortgage Sub-10, LLC ("SPM Sub-10") and
Starwood Property Mortgage Sub-10A ("SPM Sub 10-A"), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, jointly entered into a 250.0 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit
Facility arranged by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith Incorporated ("MLPFS"). Lender participants in the facility include Bank of America, Citibank, Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank
Trust Company Americas, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, and Stifel Bank Trust. The facility matures 364 days from closing, and may be extended from time to time, provided the aggregate tenure
shall not exceed four years. Outstanding borrowings under the facility will be priced at LIBOR + 325 bps, with an unused fee of 30 to 35 bps per annum depending upon the usage of the
facility. The facility will be used primarily to finance our purchase or origination of commercial mortgage loans for the time period between transaction closing and the time in which a financing of
the loan can be closed with one of our existing secured warehouse facilities or the loan is sold/syndicated in whole or in part. The term of financing provided under the facility for any individual
loan is limited in most instances to the lesser of six months or the maturity of the facility. The facility will be secured by each loan for which financing has been provided as well at least
 500,000,000 in market value of additional preapproved unencumbered senior, subordinate, and mezzanine loan assets. The facility is full recourse to us. 
 On August 2, 2012, our board of directors declared a dividend of 0.44 per share for the third quarter of 2012,
which was payable on October 15, 2012 to common stockholders of record on September 28, 2012. 
 On August 17, 2012, we originated a 46.0 million first mortgage collateralized by a 315-room
Hilton hotel in Rockville, Maryland. The term of the loan is three years, with two one-year extension options. 
 On August 21, 2012, we acquired a 250.0 million participation in a mezzanine loan that is secured primarily
by indirect equity interests in subsidiaries that own substantially all of the assets of a worldwide operator of hotels, resorts, and timeshare properties. We acquired this investment at a discounted
price of 233.75 million, with 158.75 million being financed by the seller. The maturity date of the mezzanine loan is November 12, 2012, with three one-year
extensions remaining, subject to a 0.5 fee for the second and third remaining extensions. Coincident with this purchase, we sold 165 million in face value of the securitized first

mortgage
loan component of the same financing transaction, which resulted in a gain of 8.2 million. This sale was undertaken to manage our overall credit exposure to the borrower. 

On September 18, 2012, we originated a 61.0 million first mortgage collateralized by two
Class B+/A- office buildings located in Glendale, California. The term of the loan is three years, with two one-year extension options. 

Three months ended December 31, 2012: 

On October 3, 2012, we sold the 94.5 million A-Note component of a 135.0 million first
mortgage loan on two Class B office buildings located in the SoHo district of Midtown Manhattan. We retained the 40.5 million B-Note. We originated the first mortgage loan
during the second quarter of 2012. 
 On October 10, 2012, we completed an underwritten public offering of 18,400,000 shares of our common stock at a
price of 22.74 for total estimated gross proceeds of approximately 418.4 million. In addition, on October 10, 2012 we granted 875,000 restricted stock units with a fair value of
approximately 19.9 million at the grant date to our Manager under the Manager Equity Plan. This award will vest ratably in quarterly installments over a three-year period beginning
on December 31, 2012, subject to the Manager's continued service as our manager. 
 On October 9, 2012, we purchased a 25.0 million participation in a mezzanine loan secured by 517 owned and
ground leased hotel properties comprising approximately 59,423 keys. 
 On October 16, 2012, through a newly-formed venture with Starwood Distressed Opportunity Fund IX ("Fund IX"), an
affiliate of our Manager, we co-originated a 475 million first mortgage and mezzanine financing for the acquisition and redevelopment of a 10-story retail building
located at 701 Seventh Avenue in the Times Square area of Manhattan. Of the total loan amount, 375 million was funded at closing, 281.2 million of which was funded by us and
 93.8 million that was funded by Fund IX. In addition, 100 million will be funded upon reaching certain milestones during the transformation of the property. On October 22, 2012,
the venture sold a 25 percent participation in both the first mortgage and mezzanine loan to Vornado Realty Trust ("Vornado"). Upon settling this sale, the Company, Starwood Distressed
Opportunity Fund IX, and Vornado had funded 210.9 million, 70.3 million and 93.8 million, respectively, and each party will fund their pro rata share of any future fundings.
Following the sale to Vornado, the Starwood entities retained the controlling position in both the first mortgage and mezzanine loans. 
 On October 26, 2012, we originated a 126 million first mortgage secured by a 25 story Class A office
tower located at 100 Montgomery Street, San Francisco, CA. The loan has an initial funding of 115.5 million with a future funding obligation of 10.5 million for tenant improvements and
leasing commissions. The loan bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus 3.95 , subject to a 0.25 LIBOR floor. The loan has a three-year term with two one-year
extensions, subject to certain conditions. 
 On November 5, 2012, we purchased the senior participation in a whole loan secured by an office building located in
Washington DC for 45.6 million. The loan has a three-year term with two one-year extensions.

Business Objectives and Outlook 

 Our objective is to provide attractive risk adjusted returns to our investors over the long-term, primarily through
dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve this objective by originating and acquiring target assets to create a diversified investment portfolio that is financed in
a manner that is designed to deliver attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We are focused on our three core competencies: transaction access, asset analysis and
selection, and identification of attractive relative values within the real estate debt and equity markets. 

In
the initial 18 months following our initial public offering in August 2009, we capitalized on the dislocation in the credit markets and depressed levels of available capital by
acquiring real estate debt assets from distressed sellers at historically high risk-adjusted returns, and to a lesser extent by originating new loans in a marketplace with lower levels of
competition. As the real estate and capital markets have recovered over the past two years, we have evolved from a company focused on opportunistic acquisitions to that of a full-service
commercial real estate finance platform that is primarily focused on the origination of real estate debt investments across the capital structure, in both the U.S. and Europe. With the STWD brand,
market presence, and lending/asset management platform that we have developed, along with the capabilities, business lines, and additional infrastructure that will be provided through consummation of
our pending acquisition of LNR, we intend to focus primarily on the following opportunities: 

1) Expand
our investment activities in subordinate CMBS and revenues from special servicing through our LNR acquisition; 
 
 61 

Table of Contents 

2) Expand
our presence in the medium-sized commercial real estate lending market (loans in the 10 million to 40 million range) by leveraging
LNR's sourcing and credit underwriting capabilities. This will significantly expand our overall footprint in the commercial real estate debt markets;
 3) Continue
to expand our market presence as a leading provider of acquisition, refinance, development and expansion capital to large real estate projects
(greater than 75 million) in infill locations, and other attractive market niches where our size and scale give us an advantage to provide a "one-stop" lending solution for real
estate developers, owners and operators;
 4) Continue
to expand our opportunistic acquisition of residential real estate and non-performing residential loans, with the objective of providing
attractive risk- adjusted returns from net rental operating income, short-term gains from select loan and property sales, and long-term asset appreciation;
and
 5) Continue
to expand our capabilities in syndication and securitization, which serve as a source of attractively priced, matched-term financing. 

There
can be no assurance that the recovery will continue or that we will be able to find appropriate investment opportunities. 

 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 

 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that all of the
decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made, based upon information available to us at that time. In accordance with SEC guidance, the
following discussion describes the accounting policies that apply to our operations that we believe to be most critical to an investor's understanding of our financial results and condition and
require complex management judgment and the use of estimates. This summary should be read in conjunction with a more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements in this report. 

 Classification and Impairment Evaluation of Investment Securities 

Our MBS investments consist primarily of commercial real estate debt instruments, CMBS, and RMBS that we classify as
available-for-sale. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at their fair value, with changes in fair value recorded through
accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity, rather than through earnings. We do not hold any of our investment securities for trading purposes. 

 When
the estimated fair value of a security is less than amortized cost, we consider whether there is an other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") in the value of
the security. An impairment is deemed an OTTI if (i) we intend to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our
cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover our cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security or believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security
before recovering our cost basis. If the impairment is deemed to be an OTTI, the resulting accounting treatment depends on the factors causing the OTTI. If the OTTI has resulted from (i) our
intention to sell the security or (ii) our judgment that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis, an impairment loss is
recognized in current earnings equal to the difference between our amortized cost basis and fair value. Whereas, if the OTTI has resulted from our conclusion that we will not recover our cost basis
even if we do not intend to sell the security or believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell 

 62 

Table of Contents 

 the
security before recovering our cost basis, the credit loss portion of the impairment is recorded in current earnings and the portion of the loss related to other factors, such as changes in
interest rates, continues to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Determining whether there is an OTTI may require management to exercise significant judgment and make significant
assumptions, including, but not limited to, estimated cash flows, estimated prepayments, loss assumptions, and assumptions regarding changes in interest rates. As a result, actual impairment losses
could differ from reported amounts. Such judgments and assumptions are based upon a number of factors, including (i) credit of the issuer or the borrower, (ii) credit rating of the
security, (iii) key terms of the security, (iv) performance of the loan or underlying loans, including debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios,
(v) the value of the collateral for the loan or underlying loans, (vi) the effect of local, industry, and broader economic factors, and (vii) the historical and anticipated trends
in defaults and loss severities for similar securities. 

 Loan Impairment 

 We evaluate each loan classified as held-for-investment for impairment at least quarterly. Impairment occurs
when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is considered to be impaired, we record an allowance to reduce
the carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate or the fair value of the collateral, if repayment is expected
solely from the collateral. 

 Our
loans are typically collateralized by real estate. As a result, we regularly evaluate the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value
of the underlying collateral property as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower/sponsor on a loan by loan basis. Specifically, a property's operating results and any cash
reserves are analyzed and used to assess (i) whether cash from operations are sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future, (ii) the ability of the
borrower to refinance the loan, and/or (iii) the property's liquidation value. The Company also evaluates the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower's competency
in managing and operating the properties. In addition, the Company considers the overall economic environment, real estate sector, and geographic sub-market in which the borrower operates.
Such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and finance personnel, who utilize various data sources, including (i) periodic financial data such as property
occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, the borrower's exit plan, and capitalization and discount rates, (ii) site inspections, and (iii) current credit spreads and
discussions with market participants. 

 Significant
judgment is required when evaluating loans for impairment, therefore, actual results over time could be materially different. 

 Valuation of Financial Instruments 

 GAAP establishes a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the observability of inputs utilized in measuring financial instruments
at fair values. GAAP establishes market based or observable inputs as the preferred source of values, followed by valuation models using management assumptions in the absence of market inputs. The
three levels of the hierarchy under GAAP are described below: 

Level I Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

63 

Table of Contents 

Level II Prices are determined using other significant observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other
market participants would use in pricing a security. These may include quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk and others. 

 Level III Prices are determined using significant unobservable inputs. In situations where quoted prices or observable
inputs are unavailable (for example, when there is little or no market activity for an investment at the end of the period) unobservable inputs may be used. 

Unobservable
inputs reflect our own assumptions about the factors that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, and would be based on the best information
available. 

 Any
changes to the valuation methodology are be reviewed by management to ensure the changes are appropriate. The methods we use may produce a fair value calculation that may not be
indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we anticipate that our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the
use of different methodologies, or assumptions, to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. We use inputs
that are current as of the measurement date, which may include periods of market dislocation, during which price transparency may be reduced. 

 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 

 As required by GAAP, the Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair
value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the
hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset,
liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of
a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in
the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the
hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge
certain of our risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we do not elect to apply hedge accounting. The designation of derivative contracts as hedges, the measurement of their
effectiveness, and the estimate of the fair value of the contracts all may involve significant judgments by our management, and changes to those judgments could significantly impact our reported
results of operations. 

 Income Taxes 

 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for federal income tax purposes. We generally must distribute annually at least
90 of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order for federal corporate income tax not to apply to our earnings that we distribute. To the extent
that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100 of our taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. Our
qualification as a REIT also depends on our ability to meet various other requirements imposed by the Code, which relate to organizational structure, diversity of stock ownership and certain
restrictions with regard to owned assets and categories of income. Many of the REIT requirements are highly technical and complex, and if we fail to qualify as a REIT we would be subject to United
States federal corporate income tax on our taxable income. 

 64 

Table of Contents 

 The
Company formed several TRSs since 2010 to reduce the impact of the prohibited transaction tax and to avoid penalty for the holding of assets not qualifying as real estate assets for
purposes of the REIT asset tests. Any income associated with a TRS is fully taxable because a TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes as a domestic C corporation based upon its taxable
income. 

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

 In December 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance which will enhance disclosures required by U.S. GAAP by requiring improved
information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (1) offset or (2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement,
irrespective of whether they are offset. This information will enable users of an entity's financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity's
financial position, including the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff
associated with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments. An entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and
interim periods within those annual periods. An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. We are in the process of
evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statement disclosures. 

 Results of Operations 

 Net income attributable to Starwood Property Trust, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2012 was approximately
 201.2 million or 1.76 per weighted-average share of basic common stock 1.76 diluted), compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 when net income was 119.4 million or 1.38
per weighted-average share of basic common stock 1.38 diluted). For the year ended December 31, 2012, net interest margin increased 83.7 million from the prior year, resulting from
increases in interest income of 102.0 million and interest expense of 18.3 million. The increase in net interest margin is primarily due to increased investment activity. From
December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012, the carrying value of our investments in loans increased a net 552.8 million, other investments increased a net 177.6 million and
MBS securities increased by 520.9 million. The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the five new financing facilities entered into since December 31, 2011, with a
resulting increase in the total secured financing balance outstanding of 202.3 million. As of December 31, 2012, we expect our target portfolio of investments to generate a
weighted-average levered return of between 11.7 and 12.2 (annually compounded). The weighted-average cost of the secured financings was 3.6 , including the impact of interest rate hedges. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2012, non-investment expenses increased by 22.4 million from the prior year. The year over year increases were primarily due to
increases in the base management fee of 9.1 million, management incentive fee of 6.7 million, acquisition and investment pursuit costs of 1.7 million and general and
administrative costs of 2.7 million. The increase in the base management fee was primarily due to our supplemental equity raises in April 2012 and October 2012 with net proceeds of
 873.3 million. In connection with the October 2012 supplemental equity raise, our Manager was granted an additional 875,000 restricted stock units, resulting in higher stock compensation
expense in the subsequent periods. The increase in acquisition and investment pursuit costs and general and administrative expenses are primarily attributed to the Company's increased size, as well as
the volume of transactions and the increase in professional fees such as legal, audit and consulting, resulting from the growing investment portfolio. 

 For
the year ended December 31, 2012, we had realized gains from the sale of investments of 25.5 million, of which 17.3 million related to the sale of MBS
securities and other investments and 8.2 million related to the sale of loans. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we had realized gains from the sale of investments of
 21.0 million, of which 10.7 million related to the sale of MBS and other investments and 10.3 million related to the sale of loans. In 2012, we sold nine loans and in 2011,
sold seven loans into two separate securitization vehicles, and sold two loans in private sale, 

 65 

Table of Contents 

 respectively.
We have historically used the securitization markets as a source of advantageously priced, non-recourse, matched term financing for many of the fixed rate first mortgage
loans we originate. Our business model is to originate the whole loan and either securitize or sell a senior portion of the loan, leaving us with a higher yielding subordinated loan component. Refer
to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for more information on loan securitization and sale activities. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we had net
losses on currency hedges of 15.2 million and unrealized foreign currency remeasurement gain of 6.5 million, compared to net gains on currency hedges of 4.5 million and
unrealized foreign currency remeasurement loss of 6.5 million from the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we had net gains on interest rate hedges of 1.0 million.
The losses on interest rate hedges stem from declines in the value of our held-for-sale conduit loans and related derivatives that resulted from the extreme disruption
experienced by the CMBS market since late June 2011 and have suspended our conduit platform as a result. As of December 31, 2012, we sold all remaining loans originated on the conduit platform.
OTTI charges related to our RMBS securities were 4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and other income was 3.6 million. 

The
diluted per share amounts of our interest margin and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows (amounts in thousands except per share

 The
overall increase in net interest margin for over the three year period is due to the more complete deployment of our capital during each year. Acquisition and investment pursuit
costs per diluted share have increased during the three periods due to the increased size/volume of transactions being pursued. General and administrative expenses per diluted share have not increased
over the three year period as a result of our efforts to control costs. 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet our cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and
maintain our assets and operations, make new investments where appropriate, make distributions to our stockholders, and other general business needs. We use cash to purchase or originate investments,
repay principal and interest on our borrowings, make distributions to our stockholders and fund our operations. We closely monitor our liquidity position and believe that we have sufficient liquidity
to and access to liquidity to meet our financial obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our primary sources of liquidity are as follows: 

 Cash Generated from Operating the Business, Including Repayments 

 Cash from operations is generally comprised of interest income from our investments, net of any associated financing expense, principal
repayments from our investments, net of
associated financing repayments, proceeds from the sale of investments, and changes in working capital balances. 

 Cash and Cash Equivalents 

 As of December 31, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of 177.7 million. 

 Cash Flows 

For the year ended December 31, 2012 

Cash and cash equivalents increased by 63.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase resulted from
cash used in investing activities of 1.2 billion, offset by cash provided from operating activities of 265.6 million and cash provided from financing activities of
 986.7 million. 

 Net
cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 totaled 1.2 billion and related primarily to the acquisition and origination of new loans
held-for-investment of 1.8 billion, new MBS of 626.3 million, acquisition and improvement of real estate of 172.3 million, other investments of
 14.8 million, offset by proceeds received from the sale of MBS of 261.3 million, principal repayments on loans and MBS of 55.2 million and 89.1 million, respectively,
loan maturities of 615.2 million, proceeds from the sale of loans held for investment of 344.4 million, and proceeds from the sale of other investments of 8.3 million. 

 Net
cash provided from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 of approximately 265.6 million, includes 132.0 million in proceeds from the sale
of loans held for sale. The net income for the period was approximately 203.7 million. The adjustments for non-cash charges, including stock-based compensation, accretion of
deferred loan fees and discounts, amortization of deferred financing costs, accretion of net discount on MBS and premium from collateralized debt
obligations decreased cash by 54.2 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities increased cash flows from operating activities by approximately 5.6 million. This amount
is comprised of a 6.5 million decrease in cash attributable to related party payable, and an increase of nearly 12.2 million from accrued interest receivable, other assets, accounts
payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities. The net change in unrealized losses on loans held-for-sale at fair value of 5.8 million and unrealized losses on
currency hedges of 17.5 million was offset by a net unrealized gain on interest hedges of 10.2 million and unrealized foreign currency remeasurement gains of 6.6 million.
Additionally, we recognized realized gains of 16.5 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities.

 Potential Liquidation of Certain RMBS and CMBS Positions 

 We regularly make certain investments in RMBS. We have restricted these RMBS investments to an amount that at all times is no greater
than 10 of our total assets. Expected durations are generally 5 years or less and we have engaged a third party manager who specializes in RMBS to assist us in 

 68 

Table of Contents 

 managing
this portfolio. As of December 31, 2012, our investments in RMBS and CMBS are classified as available-for-sale and had a fair value of 333.2 million and
 529.4 million, respectively. 

 Borrowings under Various Financing Arrangements 

 We utilize a variety of financing arrangements to finance certain assets. We generally utilize three types of financing
arrangements: 

1) Repurchase Agreements: Repurchase agreements effectively allow us to borrow against loans and
securities that we own. Under these agreements, we sell our loans and securities to a counterparty and agree to repurchase the same loans and securities from the counterparty at a price equal to the
original sales price plus an interest factor. The counterparty retains the sole discretion over both whether to purchase the loan and security from us and, subject to certain conditions, the market
value of such loan or security for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the counterparty. Generally, if the lender determines (subject to certain conditions) that the
market value of the collateral in a repurchase transaction has decreased by more than a defined minimum amount, we would be required to repay any amounts borrowed in excess of the product of
(i) the revised market value multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we receive the principal and interest on the related loans and
securities and pay interest to the counterparty. As of December 31, 2012, we have various repurchase agreements, with details referenced in the table provided below.
 2) Bank Credit Facilities: We use bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving
facilities) to finance our assets. These financings may be collateralized or non-collateralized and may involve one or more lenders. Credit facilities typically have maturities ranging
from two to five years and may accrue interest at either fixed or floating rates. The initial term of our bank facility, as stated in the table below, is subject to further extension based upon the
satisfaction of certain conditions at or prior to the time of such extension. Bank of America retains the sole discretion, subject to certain conditions, over the market value of such note for
purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the Bank of America.
 3) Loan Sales/Syndications/Securitizations: We seek non-recourse long-term
financing from loan sales, syndications and/or securitizations of our investments in mortgage loans. The sales/syndications/securitizations generally involve a senior portion of our loan, but may
involve the entire loan. Loan sales and syndications generally involve the sale of a senior note component or participation interest to a third party lender. Securitization generally involves
transferring notes to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which then issues one or more classes of non-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes are
secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the transfer of assets to the issuing entity, we receive cash proceeds from the sale of non-recourse notes.
Sales/syndications/securitizations of our portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because the retained subordinate interest in any particular overall
loan would be subordinate to the loan components sold and we would, therefore, absorb all losses sustained with respect to the overall loan before the owners of the senior notes experience any losses
with respect to the loan in question. 

On
February 15, 2013, we issued 600.0 million of 4.55 Convertible Senior Notes due 2018. The notes were sold to the underwriters at a discount of 2.05 , resulting in net
proceeds to us of 587.7 million.

(1) We
expect to extend the Third Wells Repurchase Agreement, which is scheduled to mature in March 2013. This represents 163.1 million of the projected
required repayments of financing in the first quarter of 2013.
 (2) We
expect to extend the Second Wells Repurchase Agreement, which is scheduled to mature in August 2013. We have two one-year extension options,
subject to certain conditions. This represents 347.0 million of the projected required repayments of financing in third quarter 2013. 

Other Potential Sources of Financing 

 In the future, we may also use other sources of financing to fund the acquisition of our target assets, including other secured as well
as unsecured forms of borrowing. We may also seek to raise further equity capital or issue debt securities in order to fund our future investments. 

 Leverage Policies 

 We employ leverage, to the extent available, to fund the acquisition of our target assets, increase potential returns to our
stockholders, or provide temporary liquidity. Leverage can be either direct by utilizing private third party financing, or indirect through originating, acquiring, or retaining subordinated mortgages,
B-notes, subordinated loan participations or mezzanine loans. Although the type of leverage we deploy is dependent on the underlying asset that is being financed, we intend, when possible,
to utilize leverage whose maturity is equal to or greater than the maturity of the underlying asset and minimize to the greatest extent possible exposure to the company of credit losses associated
with any individual asset. In addition, we intend to mitigate the impact of potential future interest rate increases on our borrowings through utilization of hedging instruments, primarily interest
rate swap agreements. 

 The
amount of leverage we deploy for particular investments in our target assets depends upon our Manager's assessment of a variety of factors, which may include the anticipated
liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities,
including hedges, the availability and cost of financing the assets, our opinion of the creditworthiness of our financing counterparties, the health of the U.S. economy and commercial and residential
mortgage markets, our outlook for the level, slope, and volatility of interest rates, the credit quality of our assets, the collateral underlying our assets, and our outlook for asset spreads relative
to the LIBOR curve. Under our current repurchase agreements and bank credit facility, our total leverage may not exceed 75 of total assets (as defined), as adjusted to remove the impact of
bona-fide loan sales that are accounted for as financings and the

borrowings with variable interest rates, we used the rates in effect as of December 31, 2012 to determine the future interest payment
obligations. Included in the less than 1 year category is 510.1 million in financing related to the Second Wells Repurchase Agreement and the Third Wells Repurchase Agreement which are
expected to be refinanced or extended. 

The
table above does not include amounts due under our management agreement or derivative agreements as those contracts do not have fixed and determinable payments. In addition, the
table above does not give effect to the subsequent events described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in this report. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

 As of December 31, 2012, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as
entities often referred to as structured investment vehicles, or special purpose or variable interest entities, established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other
contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, as of December 31, 2012, we had not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intent to provide
additional funding to any such entities. 

 Dividends 

 We intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally
requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular
corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100 of its net taxable income. We intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders in an amount
approximating our net taxable income, if and to the extent authorized by our board of directors. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first
meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt. If our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to
make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. 

Our
board of directors declared a dividend of 0.44 per share of common stock for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 on February 29, 2012. The dividend was paid on
April 13, 2012 to common stockholders of record as of March 30, 2012. The board also declared a dividend of 0.44 per share of common stock for the quarter ended June 30, 2012.
The dividend was paid on July 13, 2012 to

paid on October 15, 2012 to common stockholders of record as of September 28, 2012. On November 6, 2012, the board declared a dividend of 0.44 per share and on
December 13th declared an additional extraordinary dividend of 0.10 per share of common stock for the quarter ended December 31, 2012. The dividend was paid on January 15, 2013
to common stockholders of record as of December 31, 2012.

As
the Company's aggregate distributions exceeded its earnings and profits, the January 2013 distribution declared in the fourth quarter of 2012 and payable to shareholders of record as
of December 31, 2012 will be treated as a 2013 distribution for federal tax purposes. 

 On
February 27, 2013, our board of directors declared a dividend of 0.44 per share for the first quarter of 2013, which is payable on April 15, 2013 to common stockholders
of record as of March 29, 2013. 

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

 Core Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate Core Earnings as GAAP net income (loss) excluding
non-cash equity compensation expense, the incentive fee due under our management agreement, depreciation and amortization of real estate (to the extent that we own properties), any
unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net
income. The amount is adjusted to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash charges as determined by our Manager and approved by a majority
of our independent directors. 

 We
believe that Core Earnings provides an additional measure of our core operating performance by eliminating the impact of certain non-cash expenses and facilitating a
comparison of our financial results to those of other comparable REITs with fewer or no non-cash charges and comparison of our own operating results from period to period. Our management
uses Core Earnings in this way, and also uses Core Earnings to compute the incentive fee due under our management agreement. The Company believes that its investors also use Core Earnings or a
comparable supplemental performance measure to evaluate and compare the performance of the Company and its peers, and as such, the Company believes that the disclosure of Core Earnings is useful to
(and expected by) its investors. 

 75 

Table of Contents 

 However,
the Company cautions that Core Earnings does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net
income (determined in accordance with GAAP), or an indication of our cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds
available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, our methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other REITs
to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to the Core Earnings reported by other REITs. 

 Our
Core Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and, 2010 were approximately 228.3, 146.6 million and 67.2 million respectively, or 1.99, 1.70,
and 1.34 per weighted-average share, diluted and per weighted-average share, basic. The table below provides a reconciliation of net income to Core Earnings for these periods:

Effective
for the first quarter 2012, we have slightly modified the definition of Core Earnings to allow for management to make adjustments, subject in each case to the approval of a
majority of the independent directors, to Core Earnings that should be made in non-standard situations if and when they arise in order for us to calculate such earnings in a manner
consistent with the objective of the measure. During the first quarter 2012, we had such a situation. In February 2012, our GBP-denominated loan prepaid. At the time the loan was
originally closed, we had hedged our exposure to fluctuations in the GBP/USD exchange rate through a series of foreign exchange forward contracts. Under these derivative contracts, we sold GBP to our
counterparty in exchange for USD (at a fixed exchange rate) on scheduled dates and at specified notional amounts that corresponded to the dates on which we expected to receive
GBP-denominated interest and principal payments on our loan investment. As a result of the loan being prepaid in February 2012, the foreign exchange forward 

 76 

Table of Contents 

 contracts
were no longer necessary hedges. At that time, the hedge contracts were in a loss position to us of approximately 10 million. In the process of negotiating the termination of the
contracts, management was able to lock-in the amount of the loss by entering into new derivative contracts with a separate counterparty that had the same maturity dates and notional
amounts, but wherein we would sell USD in exchange for GBP (offsetting positions). We executed this structure as opposed to liquidating the original contracts as it was more cost effective. However,
because the original contracts remained in place, the loss had not been "realized" as that term is defined in GAAP. As a result, while we had effectively locked-in the loss, it would not
have been deducted in Core Earnings as previously defined. Therefore, we modified the definition of Core Earnings to allow for adjustments in non-standard situations such as this, provided
that we obtain the approval for any such adjustments from the majority of our independent directors. Adjustments subsequent to the first quarter 2012 are being made such that the appropriate amount of
Core Earnings is reported as these offsetting contracts mature. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

 We seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our assets, interest rates, liquidity, prepayment speeds and market value
while, at the same time, seeking to provide an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns through ownership of our capital stock. While we do not seek to avoid
risk completely, we believe the risk can be quantified from historical experience and seek to actively manage that risk, to earn sufficient
compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake. 

 Credit Risk 

 We are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our investments. While we do not expect to encounter significant
credit risk in our Agency RMBS assets, we have exposure to credit risk on the mortgage assets and underlying mortgage loans in our non-Agency RMBS and CMBS portfolios as well as other
assets. Our Manager seeks to manage credit risk by performing deep credit fundamental analysis of potential assets. Credit risk is also addressed through our Manager's on-going
surveillance, and investments are monitored for variance from expected prepayments, defaults, severities, losses and cash flow on a monthly basis. 

 Our
investment guidelines do not limit the amount of our equity that may be invested in any type of our target assets; however, not more than 25 of our equity may be invested in any
individual asset, without the consent of a majority of our independent directors. Our investment decisions depend on prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response to opportunities
available in different interest rate, economic and credit environments. As a result, we cannot predict the percentage of our equity that will be invested in any of our target assets at any given time. 

 As
of December 31, 2012, 20.4 of the CMBS securities are rated BB+. The remaining 79.6 are securities where the obligors are certain special purpose entities that were formed to
hold substantially all of the assets of a worldwide operator of hotels, resorts and timeshare properties; the securities are not rated but the loan-to-value ratio was estimated
to be in the range of 39 44 at December 31, 2012.

Interest Rate Risk 

 Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and
political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our investments and the related financing obligations. In general, we
finance the acquisition and/or origination of our target assets through financings in the form of warehouse facilities, bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities),
securitizations and repurchase agreements. We mitigate interest rate risk through 

 78 

Table of Contents 

 utilization
of hedging instruments, primarily interest rate swap agreements. Interest rate swap agreements are utilized to hedge against future interest rate increases on our borrowings and potential
adverse changes in the value of certain assets that result from interest rate changes. 

 Interest Rate Effect on Net Interest Margin 

 Our operating results depend in large part on differences between the income earned on our investments and our cost of borrowing and
hedging activities. The cost of our borrowings is generally based on prevailing market interest rates. During a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs generally may increase
(1) while the yields earned on our leveraged fixed-rate mortgage assets remain static and (2) at a faster pace than the yields earned on our leveraged floating rate mortgage
assets, which could result in a decline in our net interest margin. The severity of any such decline would depend on our asset/liability composition at the time as well as the magnitude and duration
of the interest rate increase. Further, an increase in short-term interest rates could also have a negative impact on the market value of our target assets. If any of these events was to
occur, we could experience a decrease in net income or incur a net loss during these periods, which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Hedging techniques are partly based
on assumed levels of prepayments of our investments. If prepayments are slower or faster than assumed, the life of the investment would be longer or shorter, which would reduce the effectiveness of
any hedging strategies we may use and may cause losses on such transactions. 

 Interest Rate Mismatch Risk 

 We have funded a portion of our acquisition of mortgage loans and MBS with borrowings that are based on LIBOR, while the interest rates
on these assets may be indexed to LIBOR or another index rate, such as the one-year Constant Maturity Treasury ("CMT") index, the Monthly Treasury Average ("MTA") index or the
11th District Cost of Funds Index ("COFI"). Accordingly, any increase in LIBOR relative to one-year CMT rates, MTA or COFI may result in an increase in our borrowing costs that may
not be matched by a corresponding increase in the interest earnings on these assets. Any such interest rate index mismatch could adversely affect our profitability, which may negatively impact
distributions to our stockholders. To mitigate interest rate mismatches, we may utilize the hedging strategies discussed above. 

 Our
analysis of risks is based on our Manager's experience, estimates, models and assumptions. These analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate
sensitivity. Actual economic conditions or implementation of decisions by the Manager may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the
projected results. 

 Prepayment Risk 

 Prepayment risk is the risk that principal will be repaid at a different rate than anticipated, causing the return on certain
investments to be less than expected. As we receive prepayments of principal on our assets, any premiums paid on such assets are amortized against interest income. In general, an increase in
prepayment rates accelerates the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the interest income earned on the assets. Conversely, discounts on such assets are accreted into interest income.
In general, an increase in prepayment rates accelerates the accretion of purchase discounts, thereby increasing the interest income earned on the assets. 

 Extension Risk 

 Our Manager computes the projected weighted-average life of our assets based on assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers
will prepay the mortgages or extend. If prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment or extension options are exercised, the life of the 

 79 

Table of Contents 

 fixed-rate
assets could extend beyond the term of the secured debt agreements. This could have a negative impact on our results of operations. In some situations, we may be forced to sell
assets to maintain adequate liquidity, which could cause us to incur losses. 

 Fair Value Risk 

 The estimated fair value of our investments fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, in a
rising interest rate environment, the estimated fair value of the fixed-rate investments would be expected to decrease; conversely, in a decreasing interest rate environment, the estimated
fair value of the fixed-rate investments would be expected to increase. As market volatility increases or liquidity decreases, the fair value of our assets may be adversely impacted. If we
are unable to readily obtain independent pricing to validate our estimated fair value of the securities in our portfolio, the fair value gains or losses recorded and/or disclosed may be adversely
affected. 

 Foreign Currency Risk 

 We intend to hedge our currency exposures in a prudent manner. However, our currency hedging strategies may not eliminate all of our
currency risk due to, among other things, uncertainties in the timing and/or amount of payments received on the related investments, and/or unequal, inaccurate, or unavailability of hedges to
perfectly offset changes in future exchange rates. Additionally, we may be required under certain circumstances to collateralize our currency hedges for the benefit of the hedge counterparty, which
could adversely affect our liquidity. 

 During
2010, we entered into a series of forward contracts whereby we agreed to sell an amount of GBP for an agreed-upon amount of USD at various dates through October 2013.
These forward contracts were executed to fix the USD amount of GBP denominated cash flows we expect to receive from our GBP-denominated loan. During the first quarter of 2012, the
GBP-denominated loan was prepaid. As a result of the loan being prepaid in February 2012, the foreign exchange forward contracts were no longer necessary hedges. At that time, the hedge
contracts were in a loss position to us of approximately 10.0 million. In the process of negotiating the termination of the contracts, management was able to lock-in the amount of
the loss by entering into new derivative contracts with a separate counterparty that had the same maturity dates and notional amounts, but wherein we would sell USD in exchange for GBP (offsetting
positions). We executed this structure as opposed to liquidating the original contracts as it was more cost effective. As
of December 31, 2012, the GBP hedging strategies above resulted in 4 foreign exchange forward sales contracts with a total notional value of 106.8 million and 4 such foreign exchange
forward purchase contracts with a total notional value of 106.8 million (using the December 31, 2012 spot rate of 1.6255). 

 As
of December 31, 2012, we had a 108.3 million GBP-denominated CMBS investment (using the December 31, 2012 spot rate of 1.6255). During the first
three months of 2012, we entered into a series of forward contracts whereby we agreed to sell an amount of GBP for an agreed-upon amount of USD at various dates through March 2016. These
forward contracts were executed to fix the USD amount of GBP-denominated cash flows we expect to receive from our GBP-denominated CMBS investment. As of December 31,
2012, the GBP hedging strategies above resulted in 7 foreign exchange forward sales contracts with a total notional value of 137.2 million (using the December 31, 2012 spot rate of
1.6255). 

 As
of December 31, 2012, we had a 48.4 million GBP-denominated loan investment (using the December 31, 2012 spot rate of 1.6255). Our historical cost
related to this investment was at a spot rate of approximately 1.613. During 2012, we entered into a series of forward contracts whereby we agree to sell an amount of GBP for an
agreed-upon amount of USD at various dates through January 2016. These forward contracts were executed to fix the USD amount of GBP-denominated cash flows

 expected
to be received by the Company related to the Company's GBP-denominated loan. As of December 31, 2012, we had 12 such foreign exchange forward sales contracts with a total
notional value of 67.0 million (using December 31, 2012 spot rate of 1.6255). 

 As
of December 31, 2012, we had a 29.5 million of EUR-denominated loan investment (using the December 31, 2012 spot rate of 1.3193). Our historical cost
related to this investment was at a spot rate of approximately 1.426. During 2012, we entered into a series of forward contracts whereby we agreed to sell an amount of EUR for an agreed upon amount of
USD at various dates through January 2014. These forward contracts were executed to economically fix the USD amount of EUR-denominated cash flows expected to be received by us related to
our mezzanine loan in Germany. As of December 31, 2012, we had 7 such foreign exchange forward contracts with a total notional value of 35.7 million (using the December 31, 2012
spot rate of 1.3193). 

 As
of December 31, 2012, we had a 73.0 million EUR-denominated loan investment (using the December 31, 2012 spot rate of 1.3193). Our historical cost
related to this investment was at a spot rate of approximately 1.222. During 2012, we entered into a series of forward contracts whereby we agree to sell an amount of EUR for an agreed upon amount of
USD at various dates through June 2014. These forward contracts were executed to economically fix the USD amount of
EUR-denominated cash flows expected to be received by us related to our loan in Luxembourg. As of December 31, 2012, we had 5 such foreign exchange spot rate contracts with a total
notional value of 86.0 million (using the December 31, 2012 spot rate of 1.3193). 

 Real Estate 

 Commercial and residential mortgage assets are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including,
but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions; changes or continued
weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes. In addition, decreases in property values
reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loans, which could also cause us to suffer losses. 

 Inflation Risk 

 Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors
influence our performance significantly more than inflation does. Changes in interest rates may correlate with inflation rates and/or changes in inflation rates. Our financial statements are prepared
in accordance with GAAP and our distributions are determined by our board of directors consistent with our obligation to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable income on an
annual basis in order to maintain our REIT qualification; in each case, our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair value without considering inflation. 

 Risk Management 

To the extent consistent with maintaining our REIT qualification, we seek to manage risk exposure to protect our portfolio of financial
assets against the effects of major interest rate changes. We generally seek to manage this risk by: 

attempting to structure our financing agreements to have a range of different maturities, terms, amortizations and
interest rate adjustment periods; 
 
 81

using hedging instruments, primarily interest rate swap agreements but also financial futures, options, interest rate cap
agreements, floors and forward sales to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of our investment portfolio and our borrowings; and 
 using loan sales, syndications, and securitization financing to better match the maturity of our financing with the
duration of our assets. 

The
following table summarizes the net loan investment income for a 12 month period and the change in fair value of our investments and indebtedness assuming an increase or

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

 To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
Starwood Property Trust, Inc. 
Greenwich, CT 

 We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Starwood Property Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 8. We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and the financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements and financial statement schedules and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. 

 We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

 A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Table of Contents 

 In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Starwood Property Trust, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Starwood Property Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements As of December 31, 2012 

1. Business and Organization 

Starwood Property Trust, Inc. ("the Trust" together with its subsidiaries, "we" or the "Company") is a Maryland corporation that commenced operations on August 17, 2009
("Inception") upon the completion of its initial public offering ("IPO"). We are focused on originating, investing in, financing and managing commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate
debt investments, commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS"), and other commercial real estate-related debt investments. We collectively refer to commercial mortgage loans, other commercial real
estate debt investments, CMBS, and other commercial real estate-related debt investments as our target assets. We also invest in residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") and residential real
estate owned ("REO"), and may invest in distressed or non-performing loans, commercial properties subject to net leases and residential mortgage loans. As market conditions change over
time, we may adjust our strategy to take advantage of changes in interest rates and credit spreads as well as economic and credit conditions. 

 We
are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). As such, we will
generally not be
subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on that portion of our net income that is distributed to stockholders if we distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our stockholders by prescribed
dates and comply with various other requirements. 

 We
are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our various wholly-owned subsidiaries. We are externally managed and advised by SPT
Management, LLC (our "Manager") pursuant to the terms of a management agreement. Our Manager is controlled by Barry Sternlicht, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our Manager is an
affiliate of Starwood Capital Group, a privately-held private equity firm founded and controlled by Mr. Sternlicht. 

 As
of December 31, 2012, investments with collateral in the hospitality, office, and retail property sectors represented 45.3 , 17.6 , and 15.7 of our investment portfolio,
respectively. Such allocations could materially change in the future. 

 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

 Basis of Accounting and Principles of Consolidation 

 The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our consolidated subsidiaries. Intercompany
amounts have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant and subjective
estimate that we make is projecting the cash flows to be received on our investments, which has a significant impact on the amounts of interest income, credit losses (if any), and fair values that we
record and/or disclose. In addition, the fair value of financial instruments that are estimated using a discounted cash flows method are significantly impacted by the rates at which we estimate market
participants would discount the expected cash flows. 

 A
non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined as "the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a
parent". Non-controlling interests are

 presented
as a separate component of equity in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the presentation of net income attributes earnings to controlling and non-controlling
interests. 

 Segment Reporting 

 We are focused on originating and acquiring real estate related investments and currently operate in one reportable segment. 

 Cash and Cash Equivalents 

 Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and short-term investments. Short-term investments are
comprised of highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in multiple financial institutions and at times these
balances exceed federally insurable limits. 

 Debt Securities 

 GAAP requires that at the time of purchase, we designate debt securities as held-to-maturity,
available-for-sale, or trading depending on our investment strategy and ability to hold such securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are
stated at cost plus any premiums or discounts, which are amortized or accreted through the consolidated statements of operations using the effective interest method. Securities we (i) do not
hold for the purpose of selling in the near-term, or (ii) may dispose of prior to maturity, are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair
value in the accompanying financial statements. Unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) in stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, our CMBS and RMBS securities were classified as available-for-sale. The classification of each
investment involves management's judgment, which is subject to change. 

 When
the estimated fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost, we consider whether there is an other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") in the value
of the security. An impairment is deemed an OTTI if (i) we intend to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering
our cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security even if we do not intend to sell the security or believe it is more likely than not that we
will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost basis. If the impairment is deemed to be an OTTI, the resulting accounting treatment depends on the factors causing the OTTI. If the
OTTI has resulted from (i) our intention to sell the security, or (ii) our judgment that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our
cost basis, an impairment loss is recognized in current earnings equal to the entire difference between our amortized cost basis and fair value. Whereas, if the OTTI has resulted from our conclusion
that we will not recover our cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security or believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering our cost
basis, only the credit loss portion of the impairment is recorded in current earnings, and the portion of the loss related to other factors, such as changes in interest rates, continues to be
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Following the recognition of an OTTI through earnings, a new cost basis is established for the security. Determining whether there is an
OTTI may require us to exercise significant judgment and make significant assumptions, including, but not limited to, estimated cash flows, estimated prepayments, loss assumptions, and assumptions
regarding changes

 in
interest rates. As a result, actual OTTI losses could differ from reported amounts. Such judgments and assumptions are based upon a number of factors, including (i) credit of the issuer or
the underlying borrowers, (ii) credit rating of the security, (iii) key terms of the security, (iv) performance of the
underlying loans, including debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios, (v) the value of the collateral for the underlying loans, (vi) the effect of local,
industry, and broader economic factors, and (vii) the historical and anticipated trends in defaults and loss severities for similar securities. 

Loans Held for Investment 

 Loans that are held for investment are carried at cost, net of unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees, and
origination and acquisition costs as applicable, unless the loans are deemed impaired. We evaluate each loan classified as held for investment for impairment at least quarterly. Impairment occurs when
it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If a loan is considered to be impaired, we record an allowance to reduce the
carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate or the fair value of the collateral, if repayment is expected solely
from the collateral. 

 Our
loans are typically collateralized by real estate. As a result, we regularly evaluate the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value
of the underlying collateral property, as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower. Specifically, a property's operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to
assess (i) whether cash from operations are sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future, (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan,
and/or (iii) the property's liquidation value. We also evaluate the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower's competency in managing and operating the properties.
In addition, we consider the overall economic environment, real estate sector, and geographic sub-market in which the borrower operates. Such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed
by asset management and finance personnel, who utilize various data sources, including (i) periodic financial data such as property occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses,
the borrower's exit plan, and capitalization and discount rates, (ii) site inspections, and (iii) current credit spreads and discussions with market participants. 

 Loans Held for Sale 

 Loans that we intend to sell or liquidate in the short-term are classified as held-for-sale and are
carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, unless we have elected to record the loans at fair value at the time they were acquired under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
ASC 825, Financial Instruments . Refer to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding loans
held-for-sale. 

 Residential Real Estate 

 We account for real estate at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate rental real estate over periods up to 30 years. Real estate in development is related to the
development of property (including land) and assets that have not yet been placed in service for our intended use. Depreciation for furniture and fixtures commences once it is placed in service and
depreciation for

 buildings
and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use. We depreciate furniture and fixtures over periods up to 5 years. We depreciate lease hold improvements
over the greater of 15 year or the remaining depreciable life of the asset it improved. Land is not depreciated. 

U.S. Treasury Securities Sold Short 

 In February 2011, in order to hedge the impact of interest rate increases on the fair value of our RMBS portfolio, we took short
positions on U.S. Treasury securities with durations similar to those expected within our RMBS portfolio. To execute our hedging strategy, we sold to a third party 112.7 million in U.S.
Treasury securities that were simultaneously borrowed from our prime broker. The entire cash sale proceeds from the third party were then immediately deposited with our prime broker as collateral for
the U.S. Treasury securities borrowing. On March 31, 2011, we purchased from a third party the same series of U.S. Treasury securities that had been borrowed. The securities were then
immediately delivered to the prime broker in repayment of the securities borrowing, thereby settling the short position. We realized a gain from this strategy of approximately 122 thousand,
which is comprised of the 194 thousand favorable movement in the prices of U.S. Treasury securities (from our short position), offset by 72 thousand of interest that accrued on the
securities during the term of the borrowing and transaction costs. For the year ended December 31, 2012 we had no short positions on U.S. Treasury securities. 

 Revenue Recognition 

 Interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount and contractual terms of our loans and securities. Discounts or
premiums associated with the purchase of loans and investment securities are amortized or accreted into interest income as a yield adjustment on the effective interest method, based on expected cash
flows through the expected maturity date of the investment. On at least a quarterly basis, we review and, if appropriate, make adjustments to our cash flow projections. We have historically collected,
and expect to continue to collect, all contractual amounts due on our loans and CMBS, and non-credit deteriorated RMBS. As a result, we do not adjust the projected cash flows to reflect anticipated
credit losses for these types of investments. Conversely, the majority of our RMBS have been purchased at a discount to par value, and we did not expect to collect all amounts contractually due at the
time we acquired the securities. Accordingly, we expect that a portion of the purchase discount will not be recognized as interest income, and is instead viewed as a non-accretable yield. The amount
considered as non-accretable yield may change over time based on the actual performance of these securities, their underlying collateral, actual and projected cash flow from such collateral, economic
conditions and other factors. If the performance of a credit deteriorated security is more favorable than forecasted, we will generally accrete more credit discount into interest income than initially
or previously expected. These adjustments are made prospectively beginning in the period subsequent to the determination that a favorable change in performance is projected. Conversely, if the
performance of a credit deteriorated security is less favorable than forecasted, an other-than-temporary impairment may be taken, and the amount of discount accreted into income will generally be less
than previously expected. 

 For
loans that we have not elected to record at fair value under FASB ASC 825, origination fees and direct loan origination costs are also recognized in interest income over the
loan term as a yield

 adjustment
using the effective interest method. When we elect to record a loan at fair value, origination fees and direct loan costs are recorded directly in income and are not deferred. 

Upon
the sale of loans or securities, the excess (or deficiency) of net proceeds over the net carrying value of such loans or securities is recognized as a realized gain (or loss). 

 Rental
income attributable to residential leases is recorded when due from tenants, which approximates the amount that would result from straight-lining rents over the lease term. The
initial term of our residential leases is generally one year, with renewals upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis. 

 Investments in Unconsolidated Entities 

 We own non-controlling equity interests in various privately-held partnerships and limited liability companies.
We use the cost method to account for investments when we (i) own five percent or less of and (ii) do not have significant influence over the underlying investees. We use the equity
method to account for all other non-controlling interests in partnerships and limited liability companies. Cost method investments are initially recorded at cost and income is generally
recorded when distributions are received. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of income or loss, as well as contributions made or
distributions received. 

 Investments
in unconsolidated entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment
loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available
information at the time the analyses are prepared. 

 We
also own publicly-traded equity securities of certain companies in the real estate industry. For publicly-traded companies where we have virtually no influence over the activities of
these companies and minimal ownership percentages the investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value in the balance sheet, with unrealized gains
and losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). For publicly-traded securities where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over underlying
investees, we have elected the fair value reporting option and assets are reported at fair value on the balance sheet with unrealized gains and losses reported in earnings. Dividends on our
available-for-sale equity securities are recorded in the statement of operations on the record date. 

 Securitization/Sale and Financing Arrangements 

 We periodically sell our financial assets, such as commercial mortgage loans, CMBS and other assets. In connection with these
transactions, we may retain or acquire senior or subordinated interests in the related assets. Gains and losses on such transactions are recognized using the guidance in ASC
860- Transfers and Servicing , which is based on a financial components approach that focuses on control. Under this approach, after a
transfer of financial assets that meets the criteria for treatment as a sale legal isolation, ability of transferee to pledge or exchange the transferred assets without constraint, and
transferred control an entity recognizes the financial assets it retains and any liabilities it has incurred, derecognizes the
financial assets it has sold, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished. We determine the gain or loss on sale of mortgage loans by allocating the carrying value of the underlying

 mortgage
between securities or loans sold and the interests retained based on their fair values, as applicable. The gain or loss on sale is the difference between the cash proceeds from the sale and
the amount allocated to the securities or loans sold. 

 Acquisition and Investment Pursuit Costs 

 Net costs incurred in connection with acquiring investments, as well as in pursuing unsuccessful investment acquisitions and loan
originations, are charged to current earnings and not deferred. 

 Foreign Currency Transactions 

 Our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using foreign currency exchange rates at
the end of the reporting period. Income and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for each reporting period. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the
U.S. dollar was the functional currency of all investments denominated in foreign currencies. The effects of translating the assets and any liabilities of our foreign investments are included in
unrealized foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss) in the statements of operations. 

 Concentration of Credit Risk 

 Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash investments, CMBS, RMBS,
loan investments and interest receivable. We may place cash investments in excess of insured amounts with high quality financial
institutions. We perform an ongoing analysis of credit risk concentrations in its investment portfolio by evaluating exposure to various counterparties markets, underlying property types, contract
terms, tenant mix and other credit metrics. 

 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 

 GAAP provides the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities with the intent to provide users of financial
statements with an enhanced understanding of (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how the entity accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items, and
(c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Further, we must provide qualitative disclosures that
explain our objectives and strategies for using derivatives, as well as quantitative disclosures about the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about
credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative instruments. 

 We
record all derivatives in the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have
elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and have satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting under GAAP. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the
exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated
and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides
for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value

Starwood Property Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 of
the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We regularly enter
into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risks, even though the transactions may not qualify for, or we may not elect to pursue, hedge accounting. In such
cases, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in earnings. 

 Deferred Financing Costs 

 Costs incurred in connection with obtaining secured financing arrangements are capitalized and amortized over the respective loan terms
of the respective facilities as a component of interest expense. As of December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, we had approximately 7.8 million, 5.0 million, and 4.1 million,
respectively, of capitalized financing costs, net of amortization. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, approximately 5.7 million, 3.8 million, and
 0.6 million, respectively, of amortization was included in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 

 Earnings Per Share 

 We calculate basic earnings per share by dividing net income attributable to the Company for the period by the weighted-average of
shares of common stock outstanding for that period after consideration of the earnings allocated to our restricted stock and restricted stock units, which are participating securities as defined in
GAAP. Diluted earnings per share takes into effect any dilutive instruments, such as restricted stock and restricted stock units, except when doing so would be anti-dilutive. 

 Share-based Payments 

 We recognize the cost of share-based compensation and payment transactions using the same expense category as would be charged for
payments in cash. The fair value of the restricted stock or restricted stock units granted is recorded to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the award, with an
offsetting increase in stockholders' equity. For grants to employees and directors, the fair value is determined based upon the stock price on the grant date. For non-employee grants, the
fair value is based on the stock price when the shares vest, which requires the amount to be adjusted in each subsequent reporting period based on the fair value of the award at the end of the
reporting period until the award has vested. 

 Income Taxes 

 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT and intend to comply with the Code with respect thereto. Accordingly, we will not be subject to
federal income tax as long as certain asset, income, dividend distribution and stock ownership tests are met. Many of these requirements are technical and complex and if we fail to meet these
requirements we may be subject to federal, state, and local income tax and penalties. A REIT's net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 penalty tax. We have seven taxable REIT
subsidiaries ("the TRSs") where certain investments may be made and activities conducted that (i) may have otherwise been subject to the prohibited transactions tax and (ii) may not be
favorably treated for purposes of complying with the various requirements for REIT qualification. The income, if any, within the TRSs is subject to federal and state income taxes as a domestic C

 corporation
based upon the TRSs' net income. During 2012, we recorded a provision for income taxes of 1.0 million related to the activities in our TRSs. These provisions were determined using
a Federal income tax rate of 34 and state income tax rate of 7.5 . During 2011, we recorded a provision for income taxes of 0.8 million related to the activities in our TRSs. These provisions
were determined using a Federal income tax rate of 34 and state income tax rate of 7.5 . During 2010, we recorded a provision for income taxes of 0.4 million related to the activities in our
TRSs, based on a Federal income tax rate of 33 and state income tax rate of 7.5 . 

Underwriting Commissions and Offering Costs 

 Underwriting and offering costs related to our equity offering activities, which consist primarily of our equity offerings in April and
early October 2012 as well as our at-the-market offering program (refer to disclosure in Note 10), aggregated 2.0 million for 2012, totaled approximately
 1.1 million in connection with our supplemental equity offering in May 2011, and approximately 19.0 million in connection with the supplemental equity offering in December 2010.
Underwriting and offering costs are reflected as a reduction in additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Statements of Equity. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

 In December 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance which will enhance disclosures required by U.S. GAAP by requiring improved
information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (1) offset or (2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement,
irrespective of whether they are offset. This information will enable users of an entity's financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity's
financial position, including the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments. The company will be required to apply the
amendments beginning on January 1, 2013. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statement disclosures. 

 3. Debt Securities 

We classified all CMBS and RMBS investments as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. The CMBS and RMBS classified as
available-for-sale are reported at fair value in the balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. The tables below
summarize various attributes of our investments in mortgage backed securities ("MBS") available-for-sale as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 (amounts in

During
the year ended December 31, 2012, we sold a CMBS position with aggregate gross proceeds of 173.3 million 74.6 million after repaying related financing),
which generated gains of approximately 8.3 million. 

 During
the year ended December 31, 2011, we sold various CMBS positions with aggregate gross proceeds of 211.6 million 74.0 million after repaying related
financing), which generated gains of approximately 10.0 million. Additionally, 27.1 million of our CMBS portfolio matured and was paid off during the year ended December 31,
2011. 

 During
the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold various MBS positions with aggregate gross proceeds of 41.7 million, which generated gains of approximately
 2.1 million. 

 Within
the hospitality sector, as of December 31, 2012 we had an aggregate investment of 421.2 million in senior debt secured by substantially all of the assets of a
worldwide operator of hotels, resorts and timeshare properties. As of March 31, 2012, the debt investment was comprised of 115.1 million in loans and 387.6 million in
securities. On April 16, 2012 the remaining 115.1 million of loans were converted to securities. On August 23, 2012 we sold 165.0 million of these CMBS resulting in a
gain of 8.2 million. As of December 31, 2012, the aggregate face value of 421.8 million represented 5.8 of the total face value of this operator's senior debt outstanding, and
the aggregate carrying value of our investment represented 9.7 of our total assets. 

 In
June 2011, we exercised a pre-existing right to convert one of our loans into a CMBS in order to maximize the investment's liquidity. As a result, we reclassified the
loan, which had a carrying

 amount
of 176.6 million, from loans held for investment to MBS, available-for-sale, and recognized an unrealized gain in connection with this reclassification of
 7.9 million. 

 Through
the first two quarters of 2010, a portion of our CMBS portfolio was designated as held-to-maturity. However, during the third quarter of 2010 our
investment strategy with respect to these securities changed, and we no longer intended to hold them to maturity. As a result, we reclassified the securities to
available-for-sale and recorded an unrealized gain in connection with this reclassification of approximately 10.3 million. 

As
of December 31, 2012, 79.6 of the CMBS are variable rate and pay interest at LIBOR plus a weighted-average spread of 2.30 . As of December 31, 2011, 100 of the CMBS
were variable rate and paid interest at LIBOR plus a weighted-average spread of 1.75 . 

 Subject
to certain limitations on durations, we have allocated an amount to invest in RMBS that cannot exceed 10 of our total assets. We have engaged a third party manager who
specializes in RMBS to execute the trading of RMBS. The cost of this service was 1.9 million, 0.7 million, and 0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2012,
December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively, and which has been recorded as an offset to interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of
December 31, 2012, approximately 281.2 million, or 84.4 , of the RMBS are variable rate and pay interest at LIBOR plus a weighted-average spread of 0.38 . As of December 31,
2011, approximately 154.7 million, or 93.8 , of the RMBS were variable rate and pay interest at LIBOR plus a weighted-average spread of 0.43 . We purchased all of the RMBS at a discount, a
portion of which will be accreted into income over the expected remaining life of the security. The majority of the income from this strategy is earned from the accretion of these discounts.

As
of December 31, 2012 there were seven securities with unrealized losses. After evaluating each security we determined that the impairments on 3 of these
securities, totaling 1.6 million, were other-than-temporary. Credit losses represented 1.6 million of this total, which we calculated by comparing
(i) the estimated future cash flows of each security discounted at the yield determined as of the initial acquisition date or, if since revised, as of the last date previously revised, to
(ii) our amortized cost basis. As of September 30, 2012, the last measurement date for these securities, other than temporary impairments totaled 2.8 million, bring the total
other than temporary impairments for the year ended December 31, 2012, (as reported in the statement of operations) to 4.4 million. We further determined that none of the four remaining
securities were other-than-temporarily impaired.

 We
considered a number of factors in reaching this conclusion, including that we did not intend to sell any individual security, it was not considered more likely than not that we would be forced to
sell any individual security prior to recovering our amortized cost, and there were no material credit events that would have caused us to otherwise conclude that we would not recover our cost.

As
of December 31, 2011 there were 42 securities with unrealized losses. After evaluating each security we determined that the impairments on 25 of these
securities, all of which are non-agency and whose impairments totaled 4.7 million, were other-than-temporary. Credit losses represented 3.4 million
of this total, which we calculated by comparing (i) the estimated future cash flows of each security discounted at the yield determined as of the initial acquisition date or, if since revised,
as of the last date previously revised, to (ii) our amortized cost basis. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our aggregate MBS credit losses (as reported in the statement of
operations) were 6.0 million. We further determined that none of the 17 remaining securities were other-than-temporarily impaired. We considered a number of factors in
reaching this conclusion, including that we did not intend to sell any individual security, it was not considered more likely than not that we would be forced to sell any individual security prior to
recovering our amortized cost, and there were no material
credit events that would have caused us to otherwise conclude that we would not recover our cost. Significant judgment is required is used in projecting cash flows for our non-agency RMBS.
As a result, actual income and/or impairments could be materially different from what is currently projected and/or reported.

 As
described in Note 2, we evaluate each of our loans for impairment at least quarterly. Our loans are typically collateralized by real estate. As a result, we regularly evaluate
the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property, as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower.
Specifically, a property's operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess (i) whether cash flow from operations is sufficient to cover the debt service requirements
currently and into the future, (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan at maturity, and/or (iii) the property's liquidation value. We also evaluate the financial
wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower's competency in managing and operating the properties. In addition, we consider the overall economic environment, real estate sector, and
geographic sub-market in which the borrower operates. Such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and finance personnel who utilize various data sources,
including (i) periodic financial data such as property operating statements, occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, the borrower's exit plan, and capitalization and
discount rates, (ii) site inspections, and (iii) current credit spreads and discussions with market participants. 

 Our
evaluation process as described above produces an internal risk rating between 1 and 5, which is a weighted-average of the numerical ratings in the following categories:
(i) sponsor capability and financial condition, (ii) loan and collateral performance relative to underwriting, (iii) quality and stability of collateral cash flows, and
(iv) loan structure. We utilize the overall risk ratings as a concise means to monitor any credit migration on a loan as well as on the whole portfolio. While the overall risk rating is
generally not the sole factor we use in determining whether a loan is impaired, a loan with a higher overall risk rating would tend to have more adverse indicators of impairment, and therefore would
be more likely to experience a credit loss. 

The
rating categories generally include the characteristics described below, but these are utilized as guidelines and therefore not every loan will have all of the characteristics
described in each category: 

Rating 
 
 Characteristics 

1 
 
 Sponsor capability and
financial condition Sponsor is highly rated or investment grade or, if private, the equivalent thereof with significant management experience. 

Loan collateral and
performance relative to underwriting The collateral has surpassed underwritten expectations. 

Quality and stability of
collateral cash flows Occupancy is stabilized, the property has had a history of consistently high occupancy, and the property has a diverse and high quality tenant mix. 

Loan
structure Loan-to-collateral value ratio ("LTV") does not exceed 65 . The loan has structural features that enhance the credit profile. 

2 
 
 Sponsor capability and
financial condition Strong sponsorship with experienced management team and a responsibly leveraged portfolio.

Rating 
 
 Characteristics 

Loan collateral and
performance relative to underwriting Collateral performance equals or exceeds underwritten expectations and covenants and performance criteria are being met or exceeded. 

Quality and stability of
collateral cash flows Occupancy is stabilized with a diverse tenant mix. 

Loan structure LTV does
not exceed 70 and unique property risks are mitigated by structural features. 

3 
 
 Sponsor capability and
financial condition Sponsor has historically met its credit obligations, routinely pays off loans at maturity, and has a capable management team. 

Loan collateral and
performance relative to underwriting Property performance is consistent with underwritten expectations. 

Quality and stability of
collateral cash flows Occupancy is stabilized, near stabilized, or is on track with underwriting. 

Loan structure LTV does
not exceed 80 . 

4 
 
 Sponsor capability and
financial condition Sponsor credit history includes missed payments, past due payment, and maturity extensions. Management team is capable but thin. 

Loan collateral and
performance relative to underwriting Property performance lags behind underwritten expectations. Performance criteria and loan covenants have required occasional waivers. A sale of the property may be necessary in order for the borrower to pay
off the loan at maturity. 

Quality and stability of
collateral cash flows Occupancy is not stabilized and the property has a large amount of rollover. 

Loan structure LTV is
80 to 90 . 

5 
 
 Sponsor capability and
financial condition Credit history includes defaults, deeds-in-lieu, foreclosures, and/or bankruptcies. 

Loan collateral and
performance relative to underwriting Property performance is significantly worse than underwritten expectations. The loan is not in compliance with loan covenants and performance criteria and may be in default. Sale proceeds would not be
sufficient to pay off the loan at maturity. 

Quality and stability of
collateral cash flows The property has material vacancy and significant rollover of remaining tenants. 

Loan structure LTV
exceeds 90 .

considered whether any loans shared specific characteristics with other loans such that it was probable, as a group, such loans had incurred an impairment loss as of December 31, 2012 as a
result of their common characteristics. After completing this analysis, we recorded an allowance for loan losses equal to (i) 1.5 of the aggregate carrying amount of loans rated as a "4," plus
(ii) 5 of the aggregate carrying amount of loans rated as a "5." These groups accounted for 3.7 and 4.5 of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

 During 2012, we began to purchase single family residential homes and non-performing residential loans. At acquisition, a
significant portion of the properties were either vacant or had occupants that were not subject to a lease and/or were not paying rent to the previous owner. Upon acquisition, we began actively
preparing the properties to be either rented or sold, as applicable. From the date of acquisition through December 31, 2012, we incurred approximately 5.4 million in costs of preparing
these properties for their intended use, and such costs were added to our investment basis.

Investment in marketable securities 

 In December 2012, we acquired 9,140,000 ordinary shares in Starwood European Real Estate Finance Limited ("SEREF"), a debt fund that is
externally managed by an affiliate of our Manager and is listed on the London Stock Exchange, for approximately 14.7 million. As a result, we own approximately 4 of SEREF. We have elected to
report this investment at fair value because the shares are listed on an exchange, which allows us to determine the fair value using a quoted price from an active market, and also due to potential in
lags in reporting resulting from differences in the respective regulatory requirements. We have not received any distributions from SEREF, and the fair value of the investment remeasured into USD was
 15.2 million at December 31, 2012. 

 As
of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, we had an aggregate cost basis of 5.7 million and 13.8 million invested in the publicly traded equity
securities of certain REITs that were classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). As of
December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the aggregate fair value of such securities was 6.5 million and 11.3 million, respectively, resulting in a net unrealized gain of
 850 thousand and a net unrealized loss of 2.5 million, respectively. The aggregate fair value of marketable securities including the SEREF investment, totaled 21.7 million at
December 31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012 we recognized dividend income related to these investments of 0.8 million that is included as a component of other income
in the consolidated statement of operations and we sold securities with an aggregate cost basis of 8.1 million resulting in a realized gain of 0.2 million. For the year ended
December 31, 2011, we purchased securities with an aggregate cost basis of 9.3 million. 

 Investments in LLC 

 In June 2011, we acquired a non-controlling 49 interest in a privately-held limited liability company ("LLC")
for 25.5 million, which is accounted for under the equity method. In December 2011 we sold 20 of this investment for an amount that approximated our carrying amount. The LLC owns a mezzanine
loan participation, and our share of earnings for the years ended December 31, 2012

 and
December 31, 2011 was 2.1 million and 1.1 million, which is included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31,
2012 and December 31, 2011, the cost basis was 24.3 million and 25.1 million, respectively. 

Prior
to 2011, we had committed 9.7 million to acquire at least a 5 interest in a privately-held limited liability company formed to acquire assets of a commercial
real estate debt management and servicing business primarily for the opportunity to participate in debt opportunities arising from the venture's special servicing business (the "Participation Right").
As of December 31, 2012, we had funded 8.0 million of our commitment. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 we recognized a gain of
 1.7 million and 1.1 million, respectively, related to this investment, which is included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations and the cost basis was
 8.0 million and 8.0 million, respectively. 

 6. Secured Financing Agreements 

On March 31, 2010, Starwood Property Mortgage Sub-1, L.L.C. ("SPM Sub-1"), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Master Repurchase and
Securities Contract (the "Wells Repurchase Agreement") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo"). The Wells Repurchase Agreement is secured by approximately 75.9 million of
the diversified loan portfolio purchased from Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America on February 26, 2010 ("the TIAA Portfolio"). Advances under the Wells Repurchase Agreement
accrue interest at a per annum pricing rate equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR plus the pricing margin of 3.0 . If an event of default (as such term is defined in the Wells Repurchase
Agreement) occurs and is continuing, amounts borrowed may become due and payable and interest accrues at the default rate, which is equal to the pricing rate plus 4.0 . The maturity date of the Wells
Repurchase Agreement is May 31, 2013. The Wells Repurchase Agreement allowed for advances through May 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2012, 49.2 million was outstanding under
the Wells Repurchase Agreement and the carrying value of the pledged collateral was 75.9 million. The Company
guarantees certain of the obligations of SPM Sub-1 under the Wells Repurchase Agreement up to maximum liability of 25 of the then currently outstanding repurchase price of all purchased
assets. 

 On
August 6, 2010, Starwood Property Mortgage Sub-2, L.L.C. ("SPM Sub-2"), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a second Master Repurchase
and Securities Contract with Wells Fargo, which second repurchase facility was amended and restated by SPM Sub-2 and Starwood Property Mortgage Sub-2-A, L.L.C.
("SPM Sub-2-A"), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, on February 28, 2011, pursuant to an Amended and Restated Master Repurchase and Securities Contract (the "Second
Wells Repurchase Agreement"). The Second Wells Repurchase Agreement was amended on May 24, 2011 and November 3, 2011 ("Amendment No. 2"), and is being used by SPM
Sub-2 and SPM Sub-2-A to finance the acquisition or origination of commercial mortgage loans (and participations therein) and mezzanine loans. In connection with
Amendment No. 2, available borrowings under the facility increased by 200 million to 550 million. Advances under the Second Wells Repurchase Agreement accrue interest at a per
annum pricing rate equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR plus a margin of between 1.75 and 6.0 depending on the type of asset being financed. If an event of default (as such term is
defined in the Second Wells Repurchase Agreement) occurs and is continuing, amounts borrowed may become due and payable immediately and interest accrues at the default rate, which is equal to the
pricing rate plus 4.0 . The initial maturity date of the Second Wells Repurchase Agreement is August 5, 2013, subject to two one-year extension options, each

which may be exercised by us upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee. The Company guarantees certain of the obligations of SPM Sub-2 and SPM
Sub-2-A under the Second Wells Repurchase Agreement up to a maximum liability of either 25 or 100 of the then-currently outstanding repurchase price of purchased
assets, depending upon the type of asset being financed. As of December 31, 2012, 347.8 million was outstanding under the Second Wells Repurchase Agreement and the carrying value of the
pledged collateral was 692.8 million. 

 On
December 2, 2010, Starwood Property Mortgage Sub-3, L.L.C. ("SPM Sub-3"), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Master Repurchase
Agreement with Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company, which repurchase facility was amended and restated by SPM Sub-3 and Starwood Property Mortgage Sub-3-A, L.L.C. ("SPM
Sub-3-A"), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, on February 28, 2011, pursuant to an Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement (the "Goldman Repurchase
Agreement"). The Goldman Repurchase Agreement will be used to finance the acquisition or origination by SPM Sub-3 and SPM Sub-3-A of commercial mortgage loans that
are eligible for CMBS securitization. The Goldman Repurchase Agreement provides for asset purchases of up to 150 million. The Company guarantees certain of the obligations of SPM
Sub-3 and SPM
Sub-3-A under the Goldman Repurchase Agreement up to a maximum liability of 25 of the then-currently outstanding repurchase price of all purchased loans. Advances
under the Goldman Repurchase Agreement accrue interest at a per annum pricing rate equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR plus a margin of between 1.95 and 2.25 depending on the
loan-to-value ratio of the purchased mortgage loan. If an event of default (as such term is defined in the Goldman Repurchase Agreement) occurs and is continuing, amounts
borrowed may become due and payable immediately and interest accrues at the default rate, which is equal to the pricing rate plus 2.0 . The facility expired as scheduled in December 2012. 

 On
March 18, 2011, Starwood Property Mortgage, L.L.C. ("SPM"), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a third Master Repurchase and Securities Contract with Wells
Fargo ("the Third Wells Repurchase Agreement"). The Third Wells Repurchase Agreement is being used by SPM to finance the acquisition and ownership of RMBS and provides for asset purchases up to
 175 million. Advances under the Third Wells Repurchase Agreement generally accrue interest at a per annum pricing rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus a margin of 2.10 . If an event
of default (as such term is defined in the Third Wells Repurchase Agreement) occurs and is continuing, amounts borrowed may become due and payable immediately and interest accrues at the default rate,
which is equal to the pricing rate plus 4.0 . The facility was scheduled to terminate on March 16, 2012. We extended the facility for an additional year and the new facility termination date is
March 16, 2013. The Company has guaranteed certain of the obligations of SPM under the Third Wells Repurchase Agreement. As of December 31, 2012, 163.1 million was outstanding
and the carrying value of the pledged collateral was 294.0 million. 

 On
December 30, 2011, Starwood Property Mortgage Sub-5, L.L.C. ("SPM Sub-5") and Starwood Property Mortgage Sub-5-A, L.L.C. ("SPM
Sub-5-A"), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into a fourth Master Repurchase and Securities Contract with Wells Fargo (the "Fourth Wells Repurchase Agreement").
The Fourth Wells Repurchase Agreement provides for advances up to 189.9 million and is secured by a loan portfolio of 21 separate commercial mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2012,
advances under the Fourth Wells Repurchase Agreement accrued interest at one-month LIBOR plus a pricing margin of 2.75 . The availability of additional advances, as well as the pricing
margin on all outstanding borrowings at any given time, is determined by the current

cash flows and fair values of the underlying collateral, both in relation to the existing collateral loan receivable balances outstanding, and all as approved by Wells Fargo. The overall
term of the Fourth Wells Repurchase Agreement is three years, with two one-year conditional extensions. As of December 31, 2012, SPM Sub-5-A had borrowed
 181.2 million under this facility and the carrying value of the pledged collateral was 243.0 million. At closing, we paid a 0.50 commitment fee based upon the total committed
proceeds. If the overall facility is extended beginning in December 2014, we would pay a 0.25 extension fee for each year. The Company guarantees 60 of the currently outstanding repurchase price for
all purchased assets;
however, the Company guarantees 100 of the outstanding balance of any individual repurchase transaction involving a collateral property with operating cash flows that at any time is less than 15 of
the related collateral loan receivable balance. 

 On
March 6, 2012, Starwood Property Mortgage Sub-7, LLC ("SPM Sub-7"), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Master Repurchase
Agreement with Goldman Sachs International (the "Second Goldman Repurchase Agreement"). At closing, we borrowed 155.4 million under the Second Goldman Repurchase Agreement to finance the
acquisition of 222.8 million in senior debt securities that are expected to mature on November 15, 2015. The senior debt securities were issued by certain special purpose entities that
were formed to hold substantially all of the assets of a worldwide operator of hotels, resorts and timeshare properties. Advances under the Second Goldman Repurchase Agreement accrue interest at a per
annum rate of one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 2.90 . The maturity date of the Second Goldman Repurchase Agreement is August 15, 2015. The carrying value of the collateral senior
debt securities was 213.9 million and the amount outstanding under the facility was 149.4 million at December 31, 2012. 

 On
March 26, 2012, Starwood Property Mortgage Sub-6, LLC ("SPM Sub-6") and Starwood Property Mortgage Sub-6-A ("SPM
Sub-6-A"), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement with Citibank, N.A. (the "Citi Repurchase Agreement). The Citi Repurchase
Agreement provides for asset purchases of up to 125.0 million to finance commercial mortgage loans and senior interests in commercial mortgage loans originated or acquired by us and including
loans and interests intended to be included in commercial mortgage loan securitizations as well as those not intended to be securitized. Advances under the Citi Repurchase Agreement accrue interest at
a per annum interest rate equal to the sum of (i) 30-day LIBOR plus (ii) a margin of between 1.75 and 3.75 depending on (A) asset type, (B) the amount
advanced and (C) the debt yield and loan-to-value ratios of the purchased mortgage loan, provided that the aggregate weighted average interest rate shall not at any time
be less than the sum of one-month LIBOR plus 2.25 . The facility has an initial maturity date of March 29, 2014, subject to three one-year extension options, which may
be exercised by us upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. We have guaranteed the obligations of our subsidiaries under the facility up to a maximum liability of 25 of the
then-currently outstanding repurchase price of assets financed. As of December 31, 2012, SPM Sub-6-A had borrowed 49.0 million under this facility
and the carrying value of the pledged collateral was 71.4 million. 

 Under
the Wells Repurchase Agreement, the Second Wells Repurchase Agreement, the Goldman Repurchase Agreement, the Third Wells Repurchase Agreement, the Fourth Wells Repurchase
Agreement, the Second Goldman Repurchase Agreement, and the Citi Repurchase Agreement, the counterparty retains the sole discretion over both whether to purchase the loan or security from us and,
subject to certain conditions, the market value of such loan or security for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the counterparty.

On
December 3, 2010, SPT Real Estate Sub II, LLC ("SPT II"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a term loan credit agreement (the "BAML Credit Agreement") with Bank
of America, N.A. ("Bank of America") as administrative agent and as lender, and us and certain of our subsidiaries as guarantors. The BAML Credit Agreement, amended and restated on March 9,
2012 ("Amended BAML Credit Agreement"), provides for loans of up to 141.6 million as of December 31, 2012. The initial draw under the BAML Credit Agreement in December 2010 was used, in
part, to finance the acquisition of a 205.0 million participation (the "Participation") in a senior secured loan due November 15, 2015 from Bank of America. The Participation was
converted into a security in June 2011 and is due from certain special purpose entities that were formed to hold substantially all of the assets of a worldwide operator of hotels, resorts and
timeshare properties. In connection with the March 9, 2012 amendment, we borrowed an additional 81.0 million to partially finance the 125.0 million acquisition of additional
participation interest in the senior secured loan. 

 Advances
under the Amended BAML Credit Agreement accrue interest at a per annum rate based on LIBOR or a base rate, at the election of SPT II. The margin can vary between 2.35 and 2.50 
over LIBOR, and between 1.35 and 1.50 over base rate, based on the performance of the underlying hospitality collateral. The initial maturity date of the Amended BAML Credit Agreement is
November 30, 2014, subject to a 12 month extension option, exercisable by SPT II upon satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Amended BAML Credit Agreement. Bank of America
retains the sole discretion, subject to certain conditions, over the market value of collateral assets for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to Bank of America. As of
December 31, 2012, 141.6 million was outstanding under the BAML Credit Agreement. The carrying value of the CMBS pledged as collateral under the Credit agreement was
 207.3 million as of December 31, 2012. If an event of default (as such term is defined in the Amended BAML Credit Agreement) occurs and is continuing, amounts borrowed may become due
and payable immediately and interest would accrue at an additional 2 per annum over the applicable rate. 

 On
July 3, 2012, Starwood Property Mortgage Sub-9, L.L.C. ("SPM Sub-9") and Starwood Property Mortgage Sub-9-A, L.L.C. ("SPM
Sub-9-A"), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into a Purchase and Repurchase Agreement and Securities Contract ("OneWest Repurchase Agreement") with OneWest Bank,
FSB ("OneWest"). At closing, SPM Sub-9 transferred loan investments to OneWest in exchange for a 78.3 million advance. Borrowings under the OneWest Repurchase Agreement accrue
interest at a pricing rate of one-month LIBOR plus a margin of 3.0 . If an event of default (as such term is defined in the OneWest Repurchase Agreement) occurs and is continuing, amounts
borrowed may become due and payable immediately and interest accrues at the default rate, which is equal to the pricing rate plus 5.0 . The initial maturity date of the facility is July 3, 2015
with two one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. As of December 31, 2012, 65.6 million was outstanding under the OneWest Bank Repurchase Agreement and the
carrying value of the pledged collateral was 94.8 million. 

 On
August 3, 2012, Starwood Property Mortgage Sub-10, LLC ("SPM Sub-10") and Starwood Property Mortgage Sub-10A ("SPM Sub

 under
the facility will be priced at LIBOR + 325 bps, with an unused fee of 30 to 35 bps per annum depending upon the usage of the facility. The facility will be used primarily to
finance our purchase or origination of commercial mortgage loans for the time period between transaction closing and the time in which a financing of the loan can be closed with one of our existing
secured warehouse facilities or the loan is sold/syndicated in whole or in part. The term of financing provided under the facility for any individual loan is limited in most instances to the lesser of
six months or the maturity of the facility. The facility will be secured by each loan for which financing has been provided as well as a no less than 500.0 million in market value of
additional preapproved unencumbered senior, subordinate, and mezzanine loan assets. The facility is full recourse to us. As of December 31, 2012, there were no borrowings under the Borrowing
Base and the carrying value of the pledged collateral but not drawn upon is 697.4 million. 

On
August 17, 2012, Starwood Property Trust, Inc. ("SPT"), entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement with Goldman Sachs Lending Partners, LLC (the "Third Goldman
Repurchase Agreement"). At closing, we borrowed 158.8 million under the Third Goldman Repurchase Agreement to finance the acquisition of 250.0 million participation interest in a
mezzanine note that is expected to mature on November 15, 2015. The mezzanine note was issued by certain special purpose entities that were formed to hold substantially all of the assets of a
worldwide operator of hotels, resorts and timeshare properties. Advances under the Third Goldman Repurchase Agreement accrue interest at a per annum rate of one-month LIBOR plus a spread
of 3.70 . The maturity date of the Third Goldman Repurchase Agreement is September 15, 2015. The carrying value of the mezzanine note was 236.6 million and the amount outstanding under
the facility was 158.8 million at December 31, 2012. 

 The
following table sets forth our five-year principal repayments schedule for the secured financings, assuming no defaults or expected extensions and excluding the loan

 As of December 31, 2012 

 7. Loan Securitization/Sale Activities 

During 2010, the Company participated in a commercial mortgage securitization which generated non-recourse match funded financing with an effective cost of funds of
approximately 3.5 . The Company separated five mortgage loans with an aggregate face value of 178 million into senior and junior loans. It contributed the five senior loans, or A Notes (the
"Contributed Loans"), with a face value of approximately 84 million to the securitization trust and received approximately 92 million in proceeds, while retaining 94 million of
junior interests. The Contributed Loans are secured by office, retail and industrial properties and have remaining maturities between four and seven years. 

 Each
of the five Contributed Loans was either originated or acquired by the Company as part of a first mortgage loan. In connection with the securitization, two of the first mortgage
loans were each split by the Company into an A Note and a B Note and three of the first mortgage loans had each been previously split into A Notes, B Notes and C Notes. 

The
secured financing liability relates to two of the Contributed Loans that we securitized but did not qualify for sale treatment under GAAP. As of December 31, 2012, the balance
of the loans pledged to the securitization trust was 50.3 million and the related liability of the securitization trust was 52.3 million. As of December 31, 2011, the balance of
the loans pledged to the securitization trust was 50.3 million and the related liability of the securitization trust was 53.2 million. 

 During
the first quarter of 2011, we contributed three loans to a securitization trust for approximately 56 million in gross proceeds. Control of the loans was surrendered in the
loan transfer and it was therefore treated as a sale under GAAP, resulting in a gain of 1.9 million. We effectively realized a net gain of 1.8 million on this transaction after
considering the realized losses on the interest rate hedges of 0.1 million that was terminated in connection with the sale. 

 During
the second quarter of 2011, we sold a loan to an independent third party for gross proceeds of 78.4 million. Control of the loan was surrendered in the transaction and it
was therefore treated as sale under GAAP, resulting in a gain of 3.4 million. We effectively realized a net gain of 2.9 million on this transaction after considering the realized loss
on the interest rate hedge of 0.5 million that was terminated in connection with the sale. 

During
the third quarter of 2011, we sold loans with a carrying value of 154.4 million into a securitization resulting in proceeds, net of financing repayments, of
 69.7 million. Control of the loans was surrendered in the loan transfer and it was therefore treated as a sale under GAAP, resulting in a realized gain of 5.1 million. However, we
effectively broke even on this transaction after considering the realized gains on the credit hedges of 2.2 million and realized losses on the interest rate hedges of 7.4 million that
were terminated in connection with the sale. 

During
the fourth quarter of 2011, we sold a loan with a carrying value of 42.5 million at par. Control of the loan was surrendered in the loan transfer and it was therefore
treated as a sale under GAAP, resulting in no realized gain or loss. 

 During
the first quarter of 2012, we sold six loans with a carrying value of 122.7 million to an independent third party resulting in proceeds, net of financing repayments, of
 40.6 million. Control of the loans was surrendered in the loan transfer and it was therefore treated as a sale under GAAP, resulting in a realized gain of 9.4 million. The net economic
gain of this transaction, including a realized loss of 8.4 million on the termination of the corresponding interest rate hedge, was 1.0 million. Additionally, we sold 50 of our Euro
denominated loan to a strategic partner resulting in proceeds of 28.8 million and a realized loss of 2.1 million; however, this transaction was earnings

 neutral
after considering the realized gains on the related currency hedges of 2.1 million that were terminated in connection with the sale. We have no continuing involvement in the loans. 

 During
the third quarter of 2012, we sold the 36.1 million A-Note of a 51.5 million first mortgage loan that we had closed in July 2012, and retained the
 15.4 million B-Note. The loan is collateralized by a portfolio of three hotels. The cash proceeds received from the sale approximated our carrying value in the A-Note.
We retained the 15.4 million B-Note. The A-Note and B-Note bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus 3.5 and 11.83 , respectively. The buyer has an
option to require us to repurchase the A-Note unless and until a default condition is cured with respect to one of the collateral properties, at which time the guarantee would terminate.
In exchange for providing this guarantee, we receive 0.5 of the interest otherwise due to the buyer under the A-Note unless and until the guarantee terminates. The buyer has not exercised
its
option to date. While we fully expect the default condition will be cured as it was caused by a short-term construction project at the property that has since been completed, our
participation in the interest accruing under the A-Note represents an element of continuing involvement that requires us to account for the sale as a secured borrowing. The carrying amount
of the A-Note and secured borrowing were 35.6 million at December 31, 2012, and are classified in loans transferred as secured borrowings and loan transfer secured
borrowings, respectively. 

 During
the fourth quarter of 2012, we sold five loans with an aggregate carrying value of 314.5 million to independent third parties in five separate transactions resulting in
proceeds of 315.7 million. Control of the loans was surrendered in the loan transfers and they were therefore treated as sales under GAAP. 

 8. Derivatives and Hedging Activity 

 Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives 

 We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. We principally manage our exposures
to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. We manage economic risks, including interest rate, foreign exchange, liquidity, and credit risk
primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, we enter into derivative financial instruments to manage
exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates, credit spreads, and
foreign exchange rates. Our derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the known or
expected cash receipts and known or expected cash payments principally related to our investments, anticipated level of loan sales, and borrowings. 

Cash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Interest Payments 

 Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate
movements. To accomplish this objective, we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the
receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.

 As of December 31, 2012 

 8. Derivatives and Hedging Activity (Continued) 

In
connection with our repurchase agreements, we have entered into nine interest rate swaps that have been designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate risk associated with
forecasted variable interest payments. As of December 31, 2012, the aggregate notional amount of our interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted variable interest payments
totaled 254.8 million. Under these agreements, we will pay fixed monthly coupons at fixed rates ranging from 0.557 to 2.228 of the notional amount to the counterparty and receive floating
rate LIBOR. Our interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk have maturities ranging from February 2013 to May 2021. 

The
effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is
subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized
directly in earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded no hedge ineffectiveness in earnings. During the years ended December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010,
we recorded 45 thousand and 46 thousand, respectively as hedge ineffectiveness in earnings, which is included in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 

Amounts
reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the associated
variable-rate debt. Over the next twelve months, we estimate that an additional 1.5 million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense. We are hedging our exposure to
the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a maximum period of 102 months. 

 Non-designated Hedges 

 Derivatives not designated as hedges are derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting under GAAP or for which we have
not elected to designate as hedges. We do not use these derivatives for speculative purposes but instead they are used to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rates, interest rate changes, and
certain credit spreads. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in net (losses) gains on interest rate, currency or credit hedges in the
consolidated statements of operations. 

 During
2010, we entered into a series of forward contracts whereby we agree to sell an amount of GBP for agreed upon amounts of USD at various dates through October 2013. These forward
contracts were executed to economically fix the USD amounts of GBP-denominated cash flows expected to be received by us related to a GBP-denominated loan investment. 

During
2011, we entered into a series of forward contracts whereby we agreed to sell an amount of EUR for an agreed upon amount of USD at various dates through June of 2014. These
forward contracts were executed to economically fix the USD amount of EUR-denominated cash flows expected to be received by us related to a mezzanine loan investment in Germany. During
2012, we terminated a portion of our contracts to sell EUR. The purpose of the terminations was to reduce the amount of EUR we were to sell at future dates as a result of the refinancing of our
EUR-denominated loan investment. 

During
2012, we entered into positions to buy GBP for an agreed upon amount of USD at various dates through October 2013 to fix the future value of our losses on pre-existing
GBP forward positions.

 We
also entered into a new series of forward contracts whereby we agreed to sell GBP for an agreed upon amount of USD at various dates through March 2016. We also entered into a series of forward
contracts whereby we agreed to sell an amount of EUR for an agreed upon amount of USD at various dates through January of 2014. These forward contracts were executed to economically fix the USD amount
of EUR-denominated cash flows expected to be received by us related to a second EUR denominated mezzanine loan. During the three months ended December 31, 2012, we entered into a
series of forward contracts whereby we agree to sell an amount of GBP for agreed upon amounts of USD at various dates through January 2016. These forward contracts were executed to
economically fix the USD amounts of GBP-denominated cash flows expected to be received by us related to a GBP-denominated loan investment. 

 As
of December, 2012, we had 24 foreign exchange forward derivatives to sell GBP with a total notional amount of GBP 200.4 million, 4 foreign exchange forward derivatives to buy
GBP with a total notional amount of GBP 65.7 million and 12 foreign exchange forward derivatives to sell EUR with a total notional of EUR 92.2 million. 

During
2011, we entered into several interest rate swaps that were not designated as hedges. Under these agreements, we pay fixed coupons at fixed rates ranging from 0.716 to 2.505 of
the notional amount to the counterparty and receive floating rate LIBOR. These interest rate swaps are used to limit the price exposure of certain assets due to changes in benchmark
USD-LIBOR swap rates from which the pricing of these assets is derived. As of December 31, 2012, the aggregate notional amount of these interest rate swaps totaled
 165.0 million. Changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps are recorded directly in earnings. 

 In
connection with our acquisition of a loan portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2011, we entered into nine interest rate swaps whereby we receive fixed coupons ranging from 2.86 to
5.75 of the notional amount and pay floating rate LIBOR. We acquired these swaps at a cost of 7.5 million. The premium paid reflects the fact that these swaps had above market rates which we
receive. These swaps effectively convert certain floating rate loans we acquired to fixed rate loans. As of December 31, 2012, the aggregate notional amount of these swaps totaled
 76.1 million. Changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps are recorded directly in earnings. 

 During
2011, we entered into a series of derivatives that are intended to hedge against increases in market credit spreads of CMBS. Such movements would have a negative impact on the
proceeds we expect to receive from contributing loans into commercial mortgage loan securitizations. The aggregate notional amount of the derivative was 25.0 million and it matured in December
2011. Under the terms of the contract, a market credit spread index was defined at the contract's inception by reference to a portfolio of specific independent CMBS. To the extent the referenced
credit spread index increases, our counterparty pays us. To the extent the referenced credit spread index decreases, we pay our counterparty. We pay/receive approximately every 30 days based
upon the movement in the referenced index during such period. As of December 31, 2011, all contracts had matured and we realized net gains of 2.4 million. There were no credit hedges in

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 

 We have entered into agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain provisions where if we were to default on
any of our indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, we may also be declared in default on our derivative obligations. We also have
certain agreements that contain provisions where if our ratio of principal amount of indebtedness to total assets at any time exceeds 75 , then we could be declared in default of our derivative
obligations. 

 As
of December 31, 2012, for those counterparties where of our derivatives are in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for
nonperformance risk related to these agreements, the fair value was 25.3 million. As of December 31, 2012, we had received posted collateral of 3.3 million related to the
agreements in an asset postion. If we had breached any of these provisions at December 31, 2012, we could have been required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination
liability value of 25.3 million. 

 9. Related-Party Transactions 

We entered into a management agreement with our Manager upon closing of our initial public offering ("IPO"), which provides for an initial term of three years with automatic
one-year extensions thereafter unless terminated as described below. Under the management agreement, our Manager, subject to the oversight of our board of directors, is required to manage
our day-to-day activities, for which our Manager receives a base management fee and is eligible for an incentive fee and stock awards. Our Manager is also entitled to charge us
for certain expenses incurred on our behalf, as described below. 

Base Management Fee. The base management fee is 1.5 of our stockholders' equity per annum and calculated and payable quarterly in
arrears in cash.
For purposes of calculating the management fee, our stockholders' equity means: (a) the sum of (1) the net proceeds from all issuances of our equity securities since inception (allocated
on a pro rata daily basis for such issuances during the fiscal quarter of any such issuance), plus (2) our retained earnings at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter (without
taking into account any non-cash equity compensation expense incurred in current or prior periods), less (b) any amount that we pay to repurchase our common stock since

 inception.
It also excludes (1) any unrealized gains and losses and other non-cash items that have impacted stockholders' equity as reported in our financial statements prepared in
accordance with GAAP, and (2) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP, and certain non-cash items not otherwise described above, in each case after discussions
between our Manager and our independent directors and approval by a majority of our independent directors. As a result, our stockholders' equity, for purposes of calculating the management fee, could
be greater or less than the amount of stockholders' equity shown in our consolidated financial statements. 

For
the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, approximately 33.3 million, 24.2 million and 14.1 million, respectively, was incurred for base
management fees, of which 0 and 6.7 million was payable as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. 

 Incentive Fee. From August 17, 2009 (the effective date of the Management Agreement), our Manager is entitled to be paid the
incentive fee
described below with respect to each calendar quarter (or part thereof that the management agreement is in effect) if (1) our Core Earnings for the previous 12-month period (or part
thereof that the management agreement is in effect) exceeds an 8 threshold, and (2) our Core Earnings for the 12 most recently completed calendar quarters (or part thereof that the management
agreement is in effect) is greater than zero. 

 The
incentive fee will be an amount, not less than zero, equal to the difference between (1) the product of (x) 20 and (y) the difference between (i) our
Core Earnings (as defined below) for the previous 12-month period (or part thereof that the management agreement is in effect), and (ii) the product of (A) the
weighted-average of the issue price per share of our common stock of all of our public offerings multiplied by the weighted-average number of all shares of common stock outstanding (including any
restricted stock units, any restricted shares of common stock and other shares of common stock underlying awards granted under our equity incentive plans) in such previous 12-month period
(or part thereof that the management agreement is in effect), and (B) 8 , and (2) the sum of any incentive fee paid to our Manager with respect to the first three
calendar quarters of such previous 12-month period (or part thereof that the management agreement is in effect). One half of each quarterly installment of the incentive fee is payable in
shares of our common stock so long as the ownership of such additional number of shares by our Manager would not violate the 9.8 stock ownership limit set forth in our articles of incorporation,
after giving effect to any waiver from such limit that our board of directors may grant in the future. The remainder of the incentive fee is payable in cash. The number of shares to be issued to our
Manager is equal to the dollar amount of the portion of the quarterly installment of the incentive fee payable in shares divided by the average of the closing prices of our common stock on the New
York Stock Exchange for the five trading days prior to the date on which such quarterly installment is paid. 

 Core
Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate Core Earnings as GAAP net income (loss) excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, the incentive
fee, depreciation and amortization of real estate (to the extent that we own properties), any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income for the period,
regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income (loss), or in net income. The amount is adjusted to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and
certain other non-cash charges as determined by our Manager and approved by a majority of our independent directors.

 For
the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, approximately 7.9 million, 1.2 million, and 1.2 million, respectively, was incurred for the
incentive fee, of which 0.7 million and 0 was payable as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. 

Expense Reimbursement. We are required to reimburse our Manager for operating expenses incurred by our Manager on our behalf. In
addition, pursuant
to the terms of the management agreement, we are required to reimburse our Manager for the cost of legal, tax, consulting, auditing and other similar services rendered for us by our Manager's
personnel provided that such costs are no greater than those that would be payable if the services were provided by an independent third party. The expense reimbursement is not subject to any dollar
limitations but is subject to review by our independent directors. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, approximately 5.8 million, 4.0 million and
 1.6 million was incurred, respectively, for executive compensation and other reimbursable expenses of which approximately 1.1 million and 1.7 million was payable as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, see disclosure in Note 10 regarding a contingent reimbursement to our Manager in connection with our IPO that was extinguished
during 2011. 

 Termination Fee. After the initial three-year term, we can terminate the management agreement without cause, as defined in the
management
agreement, with an affirmative two-thirds vote by our independent directors and 180 days written notice to our Manager. Upon termination without cause, our Manager is due a
termination fee equal to three times the sum of the average annual base management fee and incentive fee earned by our Manager over the preceding eight calendar quarters. No termination fee is payable
if our Manager is terminated for cause, as defined in the management agreement, which can be done at any time with 30 days written notice from our board of directors. 

 Loan Investments 

 In April 2011, we purchased a 35 million pari passu participation interest (the
"Mammoth Participation Interest") in a 75 million subordinate loan (the "Mammoth Loan") from an independent third party and a syndicate of financial institutions and other entities acting as
subordinate lenders to Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, LLC ("Mammoth"). Mammoth is a single-purpose, bankruptcy remote entity that is owned and controlled by Starwood Global Opportunity Fund
VII-A, L.P., Starwood Global Opportunity Fund VII-B, L.P., Starwood U.S. Opportunity Fund VII-D, L.P. and Starwood U.S. Opportunity Fund
VII-D-2, L.P. (collectively, the "Sponsors"). Each of the Sponsors is indirectly wholly-owned by Starwood Capital Group Global I, L.L.C., and an affiliate of our Chief
Executive Officer. The Mammoth Loan was approved by our independent directors in accordance with our related party transaction policy. The Mammoth Loan has a term of up to six years and an interest
rate of 14.0 through April 2014 and 13.25 thereafter. We acquired the Mammoth Participation Interest in the Mammoth Loan from an independent third party and own such Mammoth Participation Interest
subject to a participation agreement between us and the independent third party (the "Mammoth Participation Agreement"). The Mammoth Participation Agreement provides for the payment to us, on a pro
rata basis with an independent third party, of customary payments in respect of the Mammoth Participation Interest and affords us customary voting, approval and consent rights so long as no event of
default is continuing under the Mammoth Loan. 

 On
July 20, 2012, we purchased a 50 undivided participation interest (the "Le Meridien Participation Interest") in a EUR-denominated mezzanine loan for
 68.4 million ("Le M ridien Loan")

 from
an independent third party. The borrower is Starman Luxembourg Holdings S. R.L. ("Holdings"), an entity that indirectly owns and operates a portfolio of hotels in France and
Germany. Holdings is owned 50 by an independent third party and 50 by several private investment funds previously
sponsored by Starwood Capital Group Global I, L.L.C., an affiliate of our Manager. The Le M ridien Loan has an initial term of two years with an option to extend for an additional year,
subject to certain conditions, an interest rate of 12.5 , an upfront fee of 2.0 and a prepayment fee of 1.0 . We acquired the Le Meridien Participation Interest from an independent third party and
own the Le Meridien Participation Interest subject to a participation agreement between us and the independent third party (the "Le Meridien Participation Agreement"). The Le Meridien Participation
Agreement provides for the payment to us, on a pro rata basis with an independent third party, of customary payments in respect of our Le Meridien Participation Interest and affords us customary
voting, approval and consent rights. 

 On
October 16, 2012, through a newly-formed venture with Starwood Distressed Opportunity Fund IX ("Fund IX"), an affiliate of our Manager, we co-originated a
 475.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine financing for the acquisition and redevelopment of a 10-story retail building located at 701 Seventh Avenue in the Times Square area of
Manhattan. Of the total loan amount, 375.0 million was funded at closing, 281.2 million of which was funded by the Company and 93.8 million was funded by Fund IX. The remaining
 100.0 million will be funded upon reaching certain milestones during the transformation of the property. On October 22, 2012, the venture sold a 25 percent participation in both
the first mortgage and mezzanine loan to Vornado Realty Trust ("Vornado"). Upon settling this sale, the Company, Fund IX, and Vornado had funded 210.9 million, 70.3 million and
 93.8 million, respectively, and each party will fund their pro rata share of any future fundings. Following the sale to Vornado, the Starwood entities retained the controlling position in both
the first mortgage and mezzanine loans. Fund IX's interest is recorded under non-controlling interest on the consolidated balance sheet. 

 On
December 14, 2012, we acquired 9,140,000 ordinary shares in SEREF, a debt fund that is externally managed by an affiliate of our Manager and is listed on the London Stock
Exchange, for approximately 14.7 million. As a result, we own approximately 4 of SEREF. Refer to Note 5 for additional details. 

 On
December 22, 2012, we co-originated a junior mezzanine loan with SEREF, which is secured primarily by the ownership interest in entities that own a portfolio of
three luxury hotels located in London, England. The total loan amount was GBP 98 million, of which we and SEREF own a 50 pari passu interest.
The loan bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus a margin of 11.65 . The loan matures in January 2018. 

 10. Stockholders' Equity 

The Company's authorized capital stock consists of 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 0.01 par value per share, and 500,000,000 shares of common stock, 0.01 par value per share. 

 On
August 17, 2009, we sold 47,575,000 shares of our common stock (including 1,000,000 shares sold to an entity controlled by Starwood Capital Group pursuant to a simultaneous
private placement) in our IPO at an offering price of 20 per share.

10. Stockholders' Equity (Continued) 

 In
December 2010, we completed a follow-on offering of 23,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of 19.73 per share. 

 In
May 2011, we completed another follow-on offering of 22,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of 21.67 per share. 

 In
April 2012, we completed another follow-on offering of 23,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of 19.88 per share. 

 In
June 2012, we entered into an ATM Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith Incorporated, (the "Agent"), relating to our shares of common
stock. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 250 million from time to time through the
agent, as our sales Agent. Sales of the shares, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to
prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. 

 In
October 2012, we completed another follow-on offering of 18,400,000 shares of our common stock at a price of 22.74 per share. 

 At
the time of our IPO in 2009, the underwriters for the IPO agreed to defer and condition the receipt of a portion of their underwriting fees on our future achievement of certain
minimum investment returns. Similarly, at the time of the IPO our Manager agreed to pay to the underwriters a separate portion of the underwriting fees on our behalf, with our reimbursement of our
Manager of those amounts conditioned upon our achievement of the same investment returns. In the absence of the achievement of such investment returns, we would not pay the underwriters the deferred
portion of the underwriting fees nor would our Manager be reimbursed for the portion of the underwriting fees that it paid on our behalf. Specifically, pursuant to the IPO underwriting agreement among
the underwriters, our Manager and us, we were required to pay to the underwriters 18.1 million of underwriting fees if during any full four calendar quarter period during the 24 full calendar
quarters after the consummation of the IPO our Core Earnings for any such four-quarter period exceeded the product of (x) the weighted-average of the issue price per share of all
public offerings of our common stock, multiplied by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding (including any restricted stock units, any restricted shares of common stock and any other shares
of common stock underlying awards granted under our equity incentive plans) in such four-quarter period and (y) 8 . Additionally, because at the time of our IPO our Manager paid
 9.1 million of underwriting fees on our behalf, pursuant to our management agreement with our Manager, we agreed to reimburse our Manager for such payments to the extent the same 8 
performance threshold was exceeded. For the four calendar quarter periods ended March 31, 2011 we exceeded the threshold and therefore paid 27.2 million related to these contingent
arrangements during the second quarter of 2011. Prior to 2012, we had recorded a deferred liability and an offsetting reduction to additional paid-in-capital for the full
 27.2 million based upon actual and forecasted operating results at the time. Refer to Note 9 for disclosure of the expenses incurred for the year ended December 31, 2012. 

 In
August 2011, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to 100.0 million of our outstanding common stock over a one-year period. Purchases made pursuant
to the program are to be made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time as permitted by federal securities laws and other legal requirements. The timing,
manner, price and amount of any

 repurchases
are determined by us and are subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any
time. Through December 31, 2011, we purchased 625,850 shares of common stock on the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately 10.6 million, resulting in a weighted-average share
cost of 17.00. 

 The
Company's board of directors declared a dividend of 0.44 per share of common stock for the quarter ended March 31, 2012. The dividend was paid on April 13, 2012 to
common stockholders of record as of March 30, 2012. The board also declared a dividend of 0.44 per share of common stock for the quarter ended June 30, 2012. The dividend was paid on
July 13, 2012 to common stockholders of record as of June 29, 2012. The board further declared a dividend of 0.44 per share of common stock for the quarter ended September 30,
2012. The dividend was paid on October 15, 2012 to common stockholders of record as of September 28, 2012. On November 6, 2012, the board declared a quarterly dividend of 0.44
per share of common stock as well as declaring a special dividend of 0.10 per share of common stock on December 13th for the quarter ended December 31, 2012. The dividend was paid on
January 15, 2013 to common stockholders of record as of December 31, 2012. 

 Equity Incentive Plans 

 We have reserved an aggregate of 3,112,500 shares of common stock for issuance under the Starwood Property Trust, Inc. Equity
Plan and Starwood Property Trust, Inc. Manager Equity Plan and an additional 100,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Starwood Property Trust, Inc. Non-Executive
Director Stock Plan. The Equity Plan and Manager Equity Plan provide for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and other equity-based
awards. The Non-Executive Director Stock Plan provide for the issuance of restricted stock, restricted stock units and other equity-based awards. To date, we have only granted restricted stock and
restricted stock units. The holders of awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units are entitled to receive dividends or "distribution equivalents," which will be payable at such time
dividends are paid on our outstanding shares of common stock. 

 We
granted each of our four independent directors 2,200 shares of restricted stock concurrently with our IPO, with a total fair value of approximately 175,000. The grants vest ratably
in three annual installments on each of the first, second, and third anniversaries of the grant date, respectively, subject to the director's continued service. Effective August 19, 2010, we
granted each of our four independent directors an additional 1,000 shares of restricted stock, with a total fair value of approximately 75,000. The grants vested in one annual installment on the
first anniversary of the grant. Effective August 19, 2011, we granted each of our four independent directors an additional 2,877 shares of restricted stock, with a total fair value of
approximately 200,000. The grant will vest in one annual installment on the first anniversary of the grant, subject to the director's continued service. Effective August 19, 2012, we granted
each of our four independent directors an additional 2,201 shares of restricted stock, with a
total fair value of approximately 200,000. The grant will vest in one annual installment on the first anniversary of the grant, subject to the director's continued service. For the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, approximately 242 thousand, 179 thousand, and 86 thousand were included in general and administrative expense, respectively, related
to the grants.

In August 2009, we granted 1,037,500 restricted stock units with a fair value of approximately 20.8 million at the grant date to our Manager under the Manager Equity Plan. The
grants vest ratably in quarterly installments over three years beginning on October 1, 2009, with 86,458 shares vesting each quarter, respectively. In connection with the supplemental equity

as of December 31, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 31 2010, respectively. 

Since
distributions were greater than earnings during the years ended December 31, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the diluted
earnings per share calculation would result in anti-dilution and therefore diluted EPS has been computed in the same manner as basic earnings per share. 

 13. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

GAAP establishes a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the observability of inputs utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair values. GAAP establishes market-based or
observable inputs as the preferred source of values, followed by valuation models using management assumptions in the absence of market inputs. The three levels of the hierarchy are described below: 

Level I Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

 Level II Prices are determined using other significant observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other
market participants would use in pricing a security. These may include quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk and others. 

Level III Prices are determined using significant unobservable inputs. In situations where quoted prices or observable
inputs are unavailable (for example, when there is little or no market activity for an investment) unobservable inputs may be used. Unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about the factors
that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, and would be based on the best information available.

 13. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued) 

Financial Instruments and Fair Value Valuation Process. 

 Our Asset Management Group ("AMG") is responsible for the Company's fair value valuation policies, processes and procedures. Asset
management reports to the Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), who has final authority over the valuation of the Company's financial instruments. AMG implements valuation control processes to validate the
fair value of the Company's financial instruments measured at fair value including those derived from pricing models. These control processes are designed to assure that the values used for financial
reporting are based on observable inputs wherever possible. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is
appropriate and consistently applied and the assumptions are reasonable. 

 Pricing Verification AMG uses recently executed transactions, other observable market data such as exchange data, broker/dealer quotes, third-party
pricing vendors and aggregation services for validating the fair values of financial instruments generated using valuation models. Pricing data provided by approved external sources is evaluated using
a number of approaches; for example, by corroborating the external sources' prices to executed trades, analyzing the methodology and assumptions used by the external source to generate a price and/or
by evaluating how active the third-party pricing source (or originating sources used by the third-party pricing source) is in the market. 

 Unobservable Inputs Where inputs are not observable, AMG reviews the appropriateness of the proposed valuation methodology to ensure it is consistent
with how a market participant would arrive at the unobservable input. The valuation methodologies utilized in the absence of observable inputs may include extrapolation techniques and the use of
comparable observable inputs. 

 We
determine the fair value of our financial instruments as follows: 

 Available-for-sale debt securities 

 Available-for-sale debt securities valued utilizing observable and unobservable market inputs. The observable
market inputs for RMBS include recent transactions, broker quotes and vendor prices ("market data"). However, given the implied price dispersion amongst the market data, the fair value determination
for RMBS has also significantly utilized unobservable inputs in discounted cash flow models including prepayments, default and severity estimates based on the recent performance of the collateral, the
underlying collateral characteristics, industry trends, as well as expectations of macro-economic events (e.g. housing price curves, interest rate curves, etc.). At each measurement date, we
consider both the observable and unobservable valuation inputs in the determination of fair value. However, given the significance of the unobservable inputs these securities have been classified
within Level III. 

 The
observable market inputs for CMBS include market data. Due to an increase in the observable, relevant market activity for the CMBS investment position that we owned as of
January 1, 2012, we transferred this investment from Level III to Level II in the first quarter of 2012. 

 Available-for-sale equity securities 

The available-for-sale equity securities are publicly registered and traded in the United States and their
prices are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. These securities have been classified within Level I.

 As of December 31, 2012 

 13. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued) 

 Derivatives 

 The valuation of derivative contracts are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis
on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including
interest rate curves, spot and market forward points. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments
and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate
curves. The fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on interest differentials between the currencies being traded, spot and market forward points. 

We
incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value
measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as
collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. 

 Although
we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level II of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments
associated with our derivatives utilize Level III inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of
December 31, 2012, we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit
valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in
Level II of the fair value hierarchy. 

 Loans 

 We estimate the fair values of our loans by discounting their expected cash flows at a rate we estimate would be demanded by the market
participants that are most likely to
buy our loans. The expected cash flows used are generally the same as those used to calculate our level yield income in the financial statements. 

Any
changes to the valuation methodology will be reviewed by our management to ensure the changes are appropriate. The methods used may produce a fair value calculation that is not
indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we anticipate that our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the
use of different methodologies, or assumptions, to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. We use inputs
that are current as of the measurement date, which may fall within periods of market dislocation, during which price transparency may be reduced.

During
the year ended December 31, 2011, we originated various loans that we intend to sell in the short-term. At the time of the origination, we
elected to account for these loans at fair value. The associated interest rate and credit spread derivatives were not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. As a result, changes in
the fair value of these derivatives are reported in current earnings. It is expected that changes in the fair value of the held-for-sale loans, which will also be recorded
through earnings as a result of our fair value election, will materially offset the changes in the fair value of the interest rate and credit spread derivatives. There was no unpaid principal balance
on the loans as of December 31, 2012. 

 GAAP
requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the financial statements, for which it is practical to estimate the value. In
cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based upon the estimation of discount rates to estimated future cash flows using market yields or other valuation methodologies.
Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value. Accordingly, fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amount we could realize on disposition of
the financial instruments. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

 14. Commitments and Contingencies 

As of December 31, 2012, we had future funding commitments on 20 loans totaling 218.3 million. The funding commitments relate primarily to leasing commissions and tenant
improvements to the extent new leases on the underlying collateral are signed. 

 Management
is not aware of any other contractual obligations, legal proceedings, or any other contingent obligations incurred in the normal course of business that would have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

16. Subsequent Events 

On January 23, 2013, we entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement with LNR, Aozora Investments LLC, CBR I LLC, iStar Marlin LLC, Opps
VIIb LProp, L.P., and VNO LNR Holdco LLC, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire all the outstanding equity interests of LNR. LNR is a diversified real estate investment,
management, finance and development company whose principal line of business is serving as a special servicer for CMBS transactions. Under the terms

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 

 As of December 31, 2012 

 16. Subsequent Events (Continued) 

 of
the transaction, we will acquire the following LNR business segments for a total cash purchase price of 843 million. The remainder of the LNR businesses, totaling approximately
 206 million, will be acquired by an investment fund controlled by an affiliate of STWD's external manager: 

U.S. Special Servicer A U.S. special servicer of commercial loans with approximately 133.6 billion in
loans under management and real estate owned as of December 31, 2012; 
 U.S. Investment Securities Portfolio a portfolio of whole loans, CMBS and collateralized debt obligation
("CDO") investments; 
 Archetype Mortgage Capital a commercial real estate conduit loan origination platform; 
 Archetype Financial Institution Services an acquirer, manager, and servicer of portfolios of small balance
commercial loans; 
 LNR Europe consists of Hatfield Philips, a wholly-owned subsidiary that is an independent primary and special
servicer in Europe, and a non-controlling interest in LNR European Investment Fund, a European CRE debt fund; and 
 Auction.com 50 percent of LNR's interest in a real estate exchange selling residential and commercial
real estate via auction. 

If
the acquisition of LNR is not completed, we may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks and consequences, including the following: 

following the execution of the purchase agreement, we paid a 50 million deposit and, if the closing has not
occurred by April 1, 2013, we will be required to pay an additional 25 million deposit and an interest charge will accrue on the amount of the purchase price that we pay for the
acquisition. To the extent the transaction is not completed due to an uncured breach of the purchase agreement by us, we will not recover any deposits or interest paid with respect to the
transaction; 
 we will be required to pay certain costs relating to the acquisition, whether or not the acquisition is completed, such as
legal, accounting and financial advisor fees; and 
 matters relating to the acquisition may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management team,
which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us. 

The
acquisition of LNR has not yet been completed, and accordingly this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the consolidated financial statements included herein do not
reflect the results of LNR's business. 

 On
January 17, 2013, we originated an 86.0 million first mortgage construction financing for the development of a proposed 31-story tower containing 30 luxury
condominium residences and a ground floor retail space. 

 On
February 15, 2013, we issued 600.0 million of 4.55 Convertible Senior Notes due 2018. The notes were sold to the underwriters at a discount of 2.05 , resulting in net
proceeds to us of 587.7 million. 

 On
February 27, 2013, our board of directors declared a dividend of 0.44 per share for the quarter ending March 31, 2013.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures. 

 As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal
control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

 As
of December 31, 2012, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework,
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 is effective. 

 Our
internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

 The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on pages 53 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. 

 Changes to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. No change in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

This summary supplements and should be read together with the discussion under "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" in the prospectus dated February 11, 2013 and filed as part of a
Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-186561). 

Recent Legislation 

 Pursuant to recently enacted legislation, as of January 1, 2013, (1) the maximum tax rate on "qualified dividend income"
received by U.S. shareholders taxed at individual rates is 20 , (2) the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gain applicable to U.S. shareholders taxed at individual rates is 20 ,
and (3) the highest marginal individual income tax rate is 39.6 . Pursuant to such legislation, the backup withholding rate remains at 28 . We urge you to consult your tax advisors regarding
the impact of this legislation on the purchase, ownership and sale of our stock. 

Taxation of Taxable U.S. Shareholders 

 For payments after December 31, 2013, a U.S. withholding tax at a 30 rate will be imposed on dividends paid on our stock
received by U.S. shareholders who own their stock through foreign accounts or foreign intermediaries if certain disclosure requirements related to U.S. accounts or ownership are not satisfied. In
addition, if those disclosure requirements are not satisfied, a U.S. withholding tax at a 30 rate will be imposed on proceeds from the sale of our stock received after December 31, 2016 by
U.S. shareholders who own their stock through foreign accounts or foreign intermediaries. We will not pay any additional amounts in respect of any amounts withheld. 

Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders 

 For payments after December 31, 2013, a U.S. withholding tax at a 30 rate will be imposed on dividends paid on our stock
received by certain non-U.S. shareholders if they held our stock through foreign entities that fail to meet certain disclosure requirements related to U.S. persons that either have
accounts with such entities or own equity interests in such entities. In addition, if those disclosure requirements are not satisfied, a U.S. withholding tax at a 30 rate will be imposed on proceeds
from the sale of our stock received after December 31, 2016 by certain non-U.S. shareholders. If payment of withholding taxes is required, non-U.S. shareholders that are
otherwise eligible for an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding taxes with respect of such dividends and proceeds will be required to seek a refund from the Internal Revenue Service to
obtain the benefit or such exemption or reduction. We will not pay any additional amounts in respect of any amounts withheld.
