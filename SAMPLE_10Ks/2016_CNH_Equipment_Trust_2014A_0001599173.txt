 Except as disclosed in the following paragraph, the registrant knows of no material pending legal proceedings or material legal proceedings contemplated by governmental authorities against any of the parties or property for which Item 1117 of Regulation AB would require disclosure. 
 
 Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas DBTCA ), as the indenture trustee, has provided the following information for inclusion in the registrant s Securities Exchange Act filings (in the following, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company is referred to as DBNTC ): 
 
 On June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds managed by Blackrock Advisors, LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed a derivative action against DBNTC and DBTCA in New York State Supreme Court purportedly on behalf of and for the benefit of 544 private-label RMBS trusts asserting claims for alleged violations of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (TIA), breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on DBNTC and DBTCA s alleged failure to perform their duties as trustees for the trusts. Plaintiffs subsequently dismissed their state court complaint and filed a derivative and class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of and for the benefit of 564 private-label RMBS trusts, which substantially overlapped with the trusts at issue in the state court action. The complaint alleges that the trusts at issue have suffered total realized collateral losses of U.S. 89.4 billion, but the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain. DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion to dismiss, and on January 19, 2016, the court partially granted the motion on procedural grounds: as to the 500 trusts that are governed by Pooling and Servicing Agreements, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction. The court did not rule on substantive defenses asserted in the motion to dismiss as to the 64 trusts formed under indentures for which it retained jurisdiction. Instead, the court ordered plaintiffs to file an amended complaint as to those indenture trusts. On February 23, 2016, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint as to 62 of the 64 indenture trusts included in the original U.S. District Court complaint. DBNTC and DBTCA will have an opportunity to file new defensive motions with respect to this amended complaint. It is anticipated that plaintiffs will, in the near future, file a new state court complaint as to some or all of the 500 trusts governed by Pooling and Servicing Agreements which were dismissed from the U.S. District Court action. 
 
 On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. and IKB Deutsche Industriebank A.G. filed a Summons With Notice in New York state court naming as defendants DBNTC and DBTCA, as trustees of 37 RMBS trusts (the IKB Action ). The claims in the IKB Action appear to be substantively similar to the SDNY Action. The IKB Action is not styled as a putative class action, but may attempt to bring derivative claims on behalf of the named RMBS Trusts. DBTCA intends to vigorously defend the IKB Action . 
 
 Item 1119 of Regulation AB. Affiliates and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. 
 
 Information required by Item 1119 of Regulation AB has been omitted from this report on Form 10-K in reliance on the Instruction to Item 1119 because such information has been previously provided as permitted by the Instructions to Item 1119.

Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria.

Exhibit 34.1 
 
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors of New Holland Credit Company, LLC: 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Certification Regarding Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that New Holland Credit Company, LLC (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the asset backed securities transactions related to the trusts listed on Appendix A (the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, except for Items 1122 (d)(1)(iii), 1122 (d)(1)(iv), 1122 (d)(2)(ii), 1122 (d)(2)(iii), 1122 (d)(2)(vi), 1122 (d)(4)(x), 1122 (d)(4)(xi), 1122 (d)(4)(xii), 1122 (d)(4)(xiii), and 1122 (d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 
 As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(2)(i) and 1122 (d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by C DI 200.06. As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122 (d)(2)(i) and 1122 (d)(4)(i) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 for the Platform, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria.

Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, is fairly stated, in all material respects.
