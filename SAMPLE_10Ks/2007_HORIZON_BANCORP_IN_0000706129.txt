ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

Horizon Bancorp Horizon or the Company is a registered bank holding company incorporated in
Indiana and headquartered in Michigan City, Indiana. Horizon provides a broad range of banking
services in Northwestern Indiana and Southwestern Michigan through its bank subsidiary, Horizon
Bank, N.A. (the Bank and other affiliated entities. Horizon operates as a single segment which
is commercial banking. Horizon s Common Stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the
symbol HBNC. The Bank was chartered as a national banking association in 1873 and has operated
continuously since that time. The Bank is a full-service commercial bank offering commercial and
retail banking services, corporate and individual trust and agency services and other services
incident to banking.

On June 10, 2005, Horizon acquired Alliance Financial Corporation and its wholly owned bank
subsidiary, Alliance Banking Company (collectively referred to as Alliance). Alliance had three
offices in southwest Michigan, and one office in Michigan City, Indiana, 141 million of assets and
 117 million of deposits at the date of the acquisition. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion regarding the acquisition.

On June 1, 2006, the Bank opened a full service branch in Elkhart, Indiana. The Bank maintains
thirteen other full service facilities in Northwest Indiana and Southwest Michigan. The Bank also
maintains a loan production office in Lake County Indiana. At December 31, 2006, the Bank had
total assets of 1,222 million and total deposits of 914 million. The Bank has three wholly-owned
subsidiaries: Horizon Trust Investment Management, N.A. Horizon Trust ), Horizon Investments,
Inc. Horizon Investments and Horizon Insurance Services, Inc. Horizon Insurance ). Horizon
Trust offers corporate and individual trust and agency services and investment management services.
Horizon Investments manages the investment portfolio of the Bank. Horizon Insurance offered a full
line of personal insurance products until March 2005, at which time the majority of its assets were
sold to a third party.

Horizon formed Horizon Statutory Trust I in 2002 Trust I ), Horizon Bancorp Capital Trust II in
2004 Trust II and Horizon Bancorp Capital Trust III in 2006 Trust III for the purpose of
participating in pooled trust preferred securities offerings. The Company assumed additional
debentures as the result of the acquisition of Alliance in 2005 which formed Alliance Financial
Statutory Trust I Alliance Trust . See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion regarding these previously consolidated entities that are now
reported separately. The business of Horizon is not seasonal to any material degree.

No material part of Horizon s business is dependent upon a single or small group of customers, the
loss of any one or more of whom would have a materially adverse effect on the business of Horizon.
In 2006, revenues from loans accounted for 73 of the total consolidated revenue and revenues from
investment securities accounted for 14 of total consolidated revenue.

Employees 

The Bank, Horizon Trust and Horizon Investments employed approximately 277 full and part-time
people as of December 31, 2006. Horizon does not have any employees.

Competition 

A high degree of competition exists in all major areas where Horizon engages in business. The
Bank s primary market consists of Porter, LaPorte St. Joseph and Elkhart Counties, Indiana, and
Berrien County, Michigan. The Bank competes with commercial banks located in LaPorte County and
contiguous counties in Indiana and Michigan, as well as with savings and loan associations,
consumer finance companies, and credit unions. To a more moderate extent, the Bank competes with
Chicago money center banks, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, brokerage houses,
other institutions engaged in money market financial services and certain government agencies.

Based on deposits as of June 30, 2006, Horizon was the largest of the 11 bank and thrift
institutions in LaPorte County with a 39.12 market share and the fifth largest of the 15 such
institutions in Porter County with a 7.50 market share. In Berrien County, Michigan, Horizon was
the fourth largest of the 10 bank and thrift institutions with a 7.38 market share. In 2005,
Horizon opened new offices in St. Joseph and Elkhart Counties, Indiana. Horizon s market share of
deposits was less than 1.00 in each of these counties. (Source: FDIC Summary of Deposits Market
Share Reports, available at www.fdic.gov).

Supervision and Regulation 

Horizon is registered as a bank holding company and is subject to the supervision of, and
regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve under the
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended BHC Act ). The Federal Reserve has issued
regulations under the BHC Act requiring a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial
and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that,
pursuant to this requirement, a bank holding company should stand ready to use its resources to
provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or
adversity.

The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve to acquire more than a 5 voting
interest of any bank or bank holding company. Additionally, the BHC Act restricts Horizon s
nonbanking activities to those which are determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to
banking and a proper incident thereto.

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the FDICIA ), a bank
holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any insured depository institution
subsidiary that may become undercapitalized (as defined in FDICIA) with the terms of any capital
restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal bank regulatory agency.

Bank holding companies are required to comply with the Federal Reserve s risk-based capital
guidelines. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC have adopted risk-based capital ratio guidelines to which
depository institutions under their respective supervision are subject. The guidelines establish a
systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to
differences in risk profiles among banking organizations. Risk-based capital ratios are determined
by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet commitments to four risk weighted categories,
with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater
risk. As a condition of approval for the Alliance acquisition, the OCC required the Bank to
maintain regulatory capital ratios at 100 basis points above the well capitalized minimums. The
Bank exceeded the risk-based capital requirements of the FDIC and OCC as of December 31, 2006. For
Horizon s regulatory capital ratios and regulatory requirements as of December 31, 2006, see the
information in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation
in Item 7 below, which is incorporated herein by reference.

The Bank is (i) subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act; (ii) supervised, regulated, and
examined by the OCC; and (iii) subject to the rules and regulations of the OCC, Federal Reserve,
and the FDIC.

The Bank s deposits are insured to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the Reform Act ), which was signed
into law in February 2006, has resulted in significant changes to the federal deposit insurance
program:

Effective March 31, 2006, the Bank Insurance Fund BIF and the Savings Association
Insurance Fund SAIF were merged to create a new fund, called the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF 

The current 100,000 deposit insurance coverage is subject to adjustment for inflation
beginning in 2010 and every succeeding five years 

4 

Table of Contents 

Deposit insurance coverage for individual retirement accounts and certain other
retirement accounts has been increased from 100,000 to 250,000 and also will subject to
adjustment for inflation 

Pursuant to the Reform Act, the FDIC is authorized to set the reserve ratio for the DIF annually at
between 1.15 and 1.5 of estimated insured deposits and the FDIC has been given discretion to set
assessment rates according to risk regardless of the level of the fund reserve ratio. On November
2, 2006, the FDIC adopted final regulations that set the designated reserve ratio for the DIF at
1.25 beginning January 1, 2007.

Insured depository institutions that were in existence on December 31, 1996, and paid assessments
prior to that date (or their successors) are entitled to a one-time credit against future
assessments based on their past contributions to the BIF or SAIF. In 2006, the Bank received a
one-time credit of 458,184 against future assessments.

Also on November 2, 2006, the FDIC adopted final regulations that establish a new risk-based
premium system. Under the new system, the FDIC will evaluate each institution s risk based on
three primary sources of information: supervisory ratings for all insured institutions, financial
ratios for most institutions, and long-term debt issuer ratings for large institutions that have
such ratings. An institution s assessments will be based on the insured institution s ranking in
one of four risk categories. Effective January 1, 2007, well-capitalized institutions with the
CAMELS ratings of 1 or 2 are grouped in Risk Category I and will be assessed for deposit insurance
at an annual rate of between five and seven cents for every 100 of domestic deposits.
Institutions in Risk Categories II, III and IV will be assessed at annual rates of 10, 28 and 43
cents, respectively. An increase in assessments could have a material adverse effect on the
Company s earnings.

FDIC-insured institutions remain subject to the requirement to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund
interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation FICO ), an agency of the Federal
government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the SAIF. These assessments will
continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017. For the quarter ended December 31, 2006, the FICO
assessment rate was equal to 1.24 cents for each 100 in domestic deposits maintained at an
institution.

Both federal and state law extensively regulates various aspects of the banking business, such as
reserve requirements, truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings disclosures, equal credit opportunity,
fair credit reporting, trading in securities and other aspects of banking operations. Branching by
the Bank is subject to the jurisdiction and requires notice to or the prior approval of the OCC.

Horizon and the Bank are subject to the Federal Reserve Act, which restricts financial transactions
between banks and affiliated companies. The statute limits credit transactions between banks,
affiliated companies and its executive officers and its affiliates. The statute prescribes terms
and conditions for bank affiliate transactions deemed to be consistent with safe and sound banking
practices, and restricts the types of collateral security permitted in connection with a bank s
extension of credit to an affiliate.

The FDICIA accomplished a number of sweeping changes in the regulation of depository institutions
and their holding companies. The FDICIA requires, among other things, federal bank regulatory
authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect to banks that do not meet minimum
capital requirements. The FDICIA further directs that each federal banking agency prescribe
standards for depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating to
internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit
underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, management compensation, a maximum ratio of
classified assets to capital,
minimum earnings sufficient to absorb losses, a minimum ratio of market value to book value of
publicly traded shares and such other standards as the agency deems appropriate.

On November 12, 1999, the President signed into law comprehensive legislation that modernizes the
financial services industry for the first time in decades. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act GLBA permits

5 

Table of Contents 

bank holding companies to conduct essentially unlimited securities and insurance
activities, in addition to other activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be related to
financial services. As a result of the GLBA, Horizon may underwrite and sell securities and
insurance. It may acquire, or be acquired by, brokerage firms and insurance underwriters. Horizon
does not anticipate significant changes in its products or services as a result of the GLBA.

The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the PATRIOT Act is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. Law
Enforcement to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The PATRIOT Act contains sweeping
anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires financial institutions to
implement additional policies and procedures with respect to, or additional measures designed to
address, any or all the following matters, among others: money laundering, suspicious activities
and currency transaction reporting, and currency crimes. Many of the provisions in the PATRIOT Act
were to have expired December 31, 2005, but the U.S. Congress authorized renewals that extended the
provisions until March 10, 2006. In early March 2006, the U.S. Congress approved the USA PATRIOT
Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 (the Reauthorization Act and the USA PATRIOT Act
Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006 (the PATRIOT Act Amendments ), and they were
signed into law by President Bush on March 9, 2006. The Reauthorization Act makes permanent all
but two of the provisions that had been set to expire and provides that the remaining two
provisions, which relate to surveillance and the production of business records under the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act, will expire in three years. The PATRIOT Act Amendments include
provisions allowing recipients of certain subpoenas to obtain judicial review of nondisclosure
orders and clarifying the use of certain subpoenas to obtain information from libraries. Horizon
does not anticipate that these changes will materially affect its operations.

On July 30, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act ). The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents a comprehensive revision of laws
affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations and corporate reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley
Act is applicable to all companies with equity or debt securities registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act ). In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act establishes: (i) new
requirements for audit committees, including independence, expertise and responsibilities; (ii)
additional responsibilities regarding financial statements for the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer of the reporting company; (iii) new standards for auditors and regulation
of audits; (iv) increased disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and their
directors and executive officers; and (v) new and increased civil and criminal penalties for
violation of the securities laws. Management expects that significant additional efforts and
expense will continue to be required to comply with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (the FACT Act amended the Fair Credit
Reporting Act and made permanent certain federal preemptions that form the basis for a national
credit reporting system. The FACT Act was also intended to (i) address identity theft, (ii)
increase access to credit information, (iii) enhance the accuracy of credit reporting, (iv)
facilitate the opt-out by consumers from certain marketing solicitations, (v) protect medical
information, and (vi) promote financial literacy. The statute applies to credit reporting agencies
(commonly referred to as credit bureaus ), financial institutions, other users of credit reports
and those who furnish information to credit bureaus.

In addition to the matters discussed above, Horizon Bank is subject to additional regulation of its
activities, including a variety of consumer protection regulations affecting its lending, deposit,
and collection activities and regulations affecting secondary mortgage market activities. The
earnings of financial institutions are also affected by general economic conditions and prevailing
interest rates, both domestic and foreign, and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United
States Government and its various agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve.

Additional legislative and administrative actions affecting the banking industry may be considered
by the United States Congress, state legislatures and various regulatory agencies, including those
referred to above. It cannot be predicted with certainty whether such legislative or
administrative action will be enacted or the extent to which the banking industry in general or
Horizon and its affiliates will be affected.

LOAN PORTFOLIO (continued) 

The increase in nonaccrual loans in 2006 is primarily due to an increase in
commercial real estate loans of 761 thousand. This increase was partially offset by
a decrease in mortgage loans and consumer loans of 67 thousand and 36 thousand,
respectively. The increase in nonaccrual loans in 2005 is primarily due to nonaccrual
loans acquired from Alliance of 389 thousand, an increase in consumer and commercial
loans of 44 thousand and 189 thousand, respectively. The decrease in nonaccrual
loans in 2004 is primarily due to decreases in consumer loans of 125 thousand and
mortgage loans of 337 thousand partially offset by an increase in commercial loans
of 112 thousand. The increase in nonaccrual loans in 2003 is primarily due to
increases in consumer loans of 89 thousand, mortgage loans of 254 thousand and
commercial loans of 146 thousand. The decrease in nonaccrual loans in 2002 is
primarily due to a decrease in commercial loans of 868 thousand partially offset by
an increase in mortgage loans of 340 thousand.

Discussion of Nonaccrual Policy 

1. 
 
 From time to time, the Bank obtains information, which may lead
management to believe that the collection of payments may be doubtful on a
particular loan. In recognition of such, it is management s policy to convert
the loan from an earning asset to a nonaccruing loan. Further, it is
management s policy to place a commercial loan on a nonaccrual status when
delinquent in excess of 90 days, unless the Loan Committee approves otherwise.
The officer responsible for the loan, the senior lending officer and the senior
collections officer must review all loans placed on nonaccrual status. The
senior collections officer monitors the loan portfolio for any potential problem
loans. 

2. 
 
 Potential Problem Loans 

Impaired loans for which the discounted cash flows or collateral value exceeded
the carrying value of the loan totaled 1,768,000 and 583,000 at December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively. The allowance for impaired loans, included in the
Bank s allowance for loan losses totaled 406,000 and 492,000 at those respective
dates. The average balance of impaired loans during 2006 and 2005 was 942,000
and 150,000, respectively.

In 1999, Horizon began a mortgage warehousing program. This program is described in
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in
Item 7 below and in the Notes to the Financial Statements in Item 8 below, which are
incorporated herein by reference. The greatest risk related to these loans is
transaction and fraud risk. During 2006, Horizon processed over 2.3 billion in mortgage
warehouse loans.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS 

A cautionary note about forward-looking statements: In its oral and written statements, Horizon
from time to time includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements can include statements about
estimated cost savings, plans and objectives for future operations and expectations about Horizon s
financial and business performance as well as economic and market conditions. They often can be
identified by the use of words like expect, may, could, intend, project, estimate, 
 believe or anticipate. 

Horizon may include forward-looking statements in filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC ), such as this Form 10-K, in other written materials, and in oral statements made
by senior management to analysts, investors, representatives of the media, and others. It is
intended that these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and Horizon
undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances
after the date on which the forward-looking statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events.

By their nature, forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and are subject to risks,
uncertainties, and other factors. You are cautioned that actual results may differ materially from
those contained in the forward-looking statement. The discussion in Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in Item 7 of this Form 10-K lists some of
the factors that could cause Horizon s actual results to vary materially from those expressed in or
implied by any forward-looking statements. Your attention is directed to this discussion.

Other risks and uncertainties that could affect Horizon s future performance are set forth
immediately below in Item 1A Risk Factors

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

As a financial institution, we are subject to a number of types of risks. Although we undertake a
variety of efforts to manage and control those risks, many of the risks are outside of our control.
Among the risks we face are the following:

credit risk: the risk that loan customers or other parties will be unable to
perform their contractual obligations; 

market risk: the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adversely
affect our financial condition or results of operation; 

liquidity risk: the risk that Horizon or the Bank will have insufficient cash or
access to cash to meet its operating needs; and 

operational risk: the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes, people and systems, or external events. 

Investors should consider carefully these risks and the other risks and uncertainties described
below. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition or operating results which could cause our stock price to decline. The risks and
uncertainties described below are not, however, the only ones that we may face. Additional risks
and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently believe are not material, could
also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.

Our financial performance may be adversely impacted if we are unable to continue to grow our
commercial and consumer loan portfolios, obtain low-cost funds and compete with other providers of
financial services. 

Our ability to maintain our history of record earnings year after year will depend, in large part,
on our ability to continue to grow our commercial and consumer loan portfolios and obtain low-cost
funds. During 2005 and 2006, we focused on increasing consumer loans, and we intend to continue to
emphasize and grow consumer, as well as commercial types of loans in the foreseeable future. This
represented a shift in our emphasis from 2002 and 2003 when we focused on mortgage banking
services, which generated a large portion of our income during those years.

12 

Table of Contents 

We have also funded our growth with low-cost consumer deposits, and our ability to sustain our
growth will depend in part on our continued success in attracting such deposits or finding other
sources of low-cost funds.

Another factor in maintaining our history of record earnings will be our ability to expand our
scope of available financial services to our customers in an increasingly competitive environment.
In addition to other banks, our competitors include credit unions, securities dealers, brokers,
mortgage bankers, investment advisors, and finance and insurance companies. Competition is intense
in most of our markets. We compete on price and service with our competitors. Competition could
intensify in the future as a result of industry consolidation, the increasing availability of
products and services from nonbanks, greater technological developments in the industry, and
banking reform.

Our commercial and consumer loans expose us to increased credit risks. 

We have a large percentage of commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans generally have
greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans because repayment of these loans often depends
on the successful business operations of the borrowers. These loans also typically have much
larger loan balances than residential mortgage loans. Consumer loans generally involve greater
risk than residential mortgage loans because they are unsecured or secured by assets that
depreciate in value. Although we undertake a variety of underwriting, monitoring and reserving
protections with respect to these types of loans, there can be no guarantee that we will not suffer
unexpected losses.

Changes in market interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations. 

Our financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market
interest rates. Our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which
is the difference between the interest income that we earn on our interest-earning assets and the
interest expense that we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our profitability depends on our
ability to manage our assets and liabilities during periods of changing market interest rates. If
rates increase rapidly as a result of an improving economy, we may have to increase the rates paid
on our deposits and borrowed funds more quickly than loans and investments reprice, resulting in a
negative impact on interest spreads and net interest income. The impact of rising rates could be
compounded if deposit customers move funds from savings accounts to higher rate certificate of
deposit accounts. Conversely, should market interest rates fall below current levels, our net
interest margin could also be negatively affected, as competitive pressures could keep us from
further reducing rates on our deposits, and prepayments and curtailments on assets may continue.
Such movements may cause a decrease in our interest rate spread and net interest margin, and
therefore, decrease our profitability.

We also are subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in
interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Increases in
interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or may make it more difficult for borrowers to repay
adjustable rate loans. Decreases in interest rates often result in increased prepayments of loans
and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowing costs.
Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to
reinvest the cash received from such prepayments in loans or other investments that have interest
rates that are comparable to the interest rates on existing loans and securities.

An economic slowdown in Northwestern Indiana and Southwestern Michigan could affect our business. 

Our primary market area for deposits and loans consists of LaPorte and Porter Counties in
Northwestern Indiana and Berrien County in Southwestern Michigan. An economic slowdown in these
areas could hurt our business. Possible consequences of such a downturn could include the
following:

increases in loan delinquencies and foreclosures; 

declines in the value of real estate and other collateral for loans; and 

a decline in the demand for our products and services.

Table of Contents 

We are subject to increased regulatory capital requirements. 

As a condition to the approval of our acquisition of Alliance Financial Corporation in 2005, the
OCC, our primary regulator, required us to maintain regulatory capital ratios at 100 basis points
above the well capitalized minimums. This could affect our ability to compete with other financial
institutions not required to maintain these higher capital levels by limiting our ability to grow
assets. The OCC has not told us when these increased capital requirements will be lifted, but as
of December 31, 2006, we exceeded these heightened capital requirements.

If we are required to change the classification of our mortgage warehouse loans for capital
purposes, this could restrict the capital we have available for further growth. 

We purchase home mortgages from mortgage companies under warehouse agreements whereby the mortgage
company has the right to repurchase the loan. We have historically classified these loans as home
mortgage loans for call report and regulatory capital purposes as opposed to treating them as
 other loans. During the course of a routine, periodic examination by bank regulatory authorities
commenced in February 2003, the examination personnel raised the issue of whether our mortgage
warehouse loans should be treated as other loans for call report purposes. We submitted a
position statement to the regulators in 2003 substantiating our classification of these loans and
had various follow-up conversations with them thereafter. The regulatory authorities have never
required us to change the classification of these loans, and we believe the matter is resolved;
although the regulatory authorities have never told us this matter is settled and recently informed
us that they are still considering the issue. If we are required to change our treatment of these
loans, it will change our calculations for risk-based capital and reduce our risk-based capital
ratios which may restrict our ability to grow our assets.

Because our stock is thinly traded, it may be more difficult for you to sell your shares or buy
additional shares when you desire to do so and the price may be volatile. 

Although our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market since December 2001 and
since February 1, 2007, has been listed on NASDAQ Global Market, our common stock is thinly traded.
Average daily trading volume during 2006 was only 3,476 shares. The prices of thinly traded
stocks, such as ours, are typically more volatile than stocks traded in a large, active public
market and can be more easily impacted by sales or purchases of large blocks of stock. Thinly
traded stocks are also less liquid, and because of the low volume of trades, you may be unable to
sell your shares when you desire to do so.

The preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual
results. 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make significant
estimates that affect the financial statements. One of our most critical estimates is the level of
the allowance for loan losses. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, we cannot provide
absolute assurance that we will not have to increase the allowance for loan losses and/or sustain
loan losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance.

Our mortgage warehouse and indirect lending operations are subject to a higher fraud risk than our
other lending operations. 

We buy loans originated by mortgage bankers and automobile dealers. Because we must rely on the
mortgage bankers and automobile dealers in making and documenting these loans, there is an
increased risk of fraud to us on the part of the third-party originators and the underlying
borrowers. In order to guard against this increased risk, we perform investigations on the loan
originators we do business with, and we review the loan files and loan documents we purchase to
attempt to detect any irregularities or legal noncompliance. However, there is no guarantee that
our procedures will detect all cases of fraud or legal noncompliance.

We are subject to extensive regulation and changes in laws, regulations and policies could
adversely affect our business. 

Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal agencies. See Supervision and
Regulation in the description of our Business in Item 1 above for detailed information on the laws
and regulations to which we are subject. Changes in applicable laws, regulations or regulator
policies could materially affect our business. The likelihood of any major changes in the future
and their effects are impossible to determine.

Our inability to continue to accurately process large volumes of transactions could adversely
impact our business and financial results. 

In the normal course of business, we process large volumes of transactions. If systems of internal
control should fail to work as expected, if systems are used in an unauthorized manner, or if
employees subvert the system of internal controls, significant losses could result.

We process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis and are exposed to numerous types of
operational risk. Operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people
and systems includes the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside the company, the execution of
unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems, and
breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements. This risk of loss also
includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or
as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.

We establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with timely and
accurate information about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systems have
been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures exist
that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices are
followed. From time to time, losses from operational risk may occur, including the effects of
operational errors.

While we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, data processing systems,
and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance that future losses will not
occur.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATION 

Horizon Bancorp and Subsidiaries 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
(Table Dollar Amounts in Thousands)

Overview 

Throughout 2006, Horizon s net interest margin declined as the cost of funds increased faster than
the yield on earning assets. Cost of funds was impacted by competitive rate pressure for deposits
and certificates of deposit renewing at higher rates. The yield on earning assets was hampered by
a lack of commercial loan growth. Commercial loans carry higher yields than mortgage and consumer
loans. Commercial loan growth was negatively impacted by the pay off of approximately 30 million
of loans. The net interest margin declined from 3.27 in 2005 to 3.05 in 2006. This 22 basis point
decline had the impact of reducing net interest income by approximately 2.3 million.

Mortgage loans outstanding grew 63 million and mortgage loans originated and sold totaled 96
million, which is comparable to the prior year. Mortgage activity at Horizon continued strong
despite the general slow down in residential mortgage activity nationwide. Indirect consumer loan
activity continued strong as well, pushing total consumer loans to 238 million, an increase of 36
million from the prior year. Restructuring was completed in the investment portfolio. Throughout
the year 764 thousand of losses were taken and the investment portfolio yield was improved by 60
basis points.

Asset growth was funded by an increase of 58 million in deposits and a 28 million increase in
borrowed funds.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Horizon has established various accounting policies, which govern the application of accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States in the preparation the Company s financial
statements. The significant accounting policies of the Company are described in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 on Form 10-K. Certain of these
policies are important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition, since they require
management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters
that are inherently uncertain. Management has identified the following as critical accounting
policies:

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses, which is established through the provision for loan losses, is based
on management s evaluation of the level of allowance required in relation to the estimated loss
exposure in the loan portfolio. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is a significant
estimate and therefore evaluates it for adequacy each quarter. Management considers factors such
as previous loss experience, the size and composition of the loan portfolio, current economic and
real estate market conditions, the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms,
and estimated fair value of collateral that secures the loans. The use of different estimates or
assumptions could produce a different allowance for loan losses. Additional discussion regarding
the allowance for loan losses is included in the commentary on Loans in the following Analysis of
Financial Condition.

19 

Table of Contents 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

Management believes that the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets also involves a
higher degree of judgment than most other significant accounting policies. Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142, Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, 
establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment assessment
of goodwill. At December 31, 2006, Horizon had core deposit intangibles of 2.412 million subject
to amortization and 5.787 million of goodwill, which was not subject to amortization. Goodwill
arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible
assets in the business acquired. Horizon s goodwill relates to the value inherent in the banking
industry and that value is dependent upon the ability of Horizon to provide quality, cost effective
banking services in a competitive marketplace. The goodwill value is supported by revenue that is
in part driven by the volume of business transacted. A decrease in earnings resulting from a
decline in the customer base or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained
periods can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods.
SFAS No. 142 requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment. The evaluation of goodwill
for impairment requires the use of estimates and assumptions. Horizon has concluded that the
recorded value of goodwill is not impaired.

Mortgage Servicing Rights 

Servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through purchase or
through the sale of financial assets on a servicing-retained basis. Capitalized servicing rights
are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated
future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets. Servicing assets are evaluated
regularly for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost.
Impairment is determined by stratifying servicing rights by predominant characteristics, such as
interest rates, original loan terms and whether the loans are fixed or adjustable rate mortgages.
Fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics, when
available, or based upon discounted cash flows using market-based assumptions. When the book value
of an individual stratum exceeds its fair value, an impairment reserve is recognized so that each
individual stratum is carried at the lower of its amortized book value or fair value. In periods
of falling market interest rates, accelerated loan prepayment speeds can adversely impact the fair
value of these mortgage-servicing rights relative to their book value. In the event that the fair
value of these assets was to increase in the future, Horizon can recognize the increased fair value
to the extent of the impairment allowance but cannot recognize an asset in excess of its amortized
book value. Future changes in management s assessment of the impairment of these servicing assets,
as a result of changes in observable market data relating to market interest rates, loan prepayment
speeds, and other factors, could impact Horizon s financial condition and results of operations
either positively or adversely.

Analysis of Financial Condition 

Investment Securities 

Horizon maintains a high quality investment portfolio with low credit risk. Investment securities
totaled 243.078 million at December 31, 2006, and consisted of U S. Treasury and Government Agency
securities of 58.445 million (24.0) ; Municipal securities of 81.800 million (33.7) ;
Mortgage-backed securities of 91.174 million (37.5) ; collateralized mortgage obligations of
 11.010 million (4.5) ; and corporate securities of 649 thousand (.3) .

As indicated above, 42.0 of the investment portfolio consists of mortgage-backed securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations. These instruments are secured by residential mortgages of
varying maturities. Principal and interest payments are received monthly as the underlying
mortgages are repaid. These payments also include prepayments of mortgage balances as borrowers
either sell their homes or refinance their mortgages. Therefore, mortgage-backed securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations have maturities that are stated in terms of average life. The
average life is the average amount of time that each dollar of principal is expected to be
outstanding. As of December 31, 2006, the mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage
obligations in the investment portfolio had an average life of 4.05 years. Securities that have
interest rates above current market rates are purchased at a premium. These securities may
experience a significant increase in prepayments when lower market interest rates create an
incentive for the borrower to refinance the underlying mortgage. This may result in a decrease of
current income, however, this risk is mitigated by a shorter average life. Management currently
believes that prepayment risk on these securities is nominal.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, all investment securities were classified as available for sale.
Securities classified as available for sale are carried at their fair value, with both unrealized
gains and losses added or subtracted, net of tax, directly to stockholders equity. This
accounting method adds potential volatility to stockholders equity, but net income is not affected
unless securities are sold. Net depreciation on these securities totaled 2.318 million, which
resulted in a 1.507 million reduction, net of tax, to stockholders equity at December 31, 2006.
This compared to a 2.853 million, net of tax, addition in stockholders equity at December 31,
2005.

As a member of the Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank system, Horizon is required to
maintain an investment in the common stock of each entity. The investment in common stock is based
on a predetermined formula. At December 31, 2006, Horizon has investments in the common stock of
the Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank totaling 12.136 million compared to 12.983 million
at December 31, 2005.

At December 31, 2006, Horizon does not maintain a trading account and is not using any derivative
products for hedging or other purposes.

Loans 

Total loans, the principal earning asset of the Bank, were 843.834 million at December 31, 2006.
The current level of loans is an increase of 15.2 from the December 31, 2005, level of 732.734
million. As the table below indicates, the increase is related to growth in all lending areas
except for commercial loans, which declined during 2006.

The acceptance and management of credit risk is an integral part of the Bank s business as a
financial intermediary. The Bank has established underwriting standards including a policy that
monitors the lending function through strict administrative and reporting requirements as well as
an internal loan review of consumer and small business loans. The Bank also uses an independent
third-party loan review function that regularly reviews asset quality.

Real Estate Loans 

Real estate loans totaled 222.235 million or 26.3 of total loans as of December 31, 2006,
compared to 159.312 million or 21.7 of total loans as of December 31, 2005. This category
consists of home mortgages that generally require a loan to value of no more than 80 . Some
special guaranteed or insured real estate loan programs do permit a higher loan to collateral value
ratio.

22 

Table of Contents 

In addition to the customary real estate loans described above, the Bank also has outstanding on
December 31, 2006, 54.527 million in home equity lines of credit compared to 52.129 million at
December 31, 2005. Credit lines normally limit the loan to collateral value to no more than 89 .
These loans are classified as consumer loans in the table above and in Note 4 of the consolidated
financial statements.

Residential real estate lending is a highly competitive business. As of December 31, 2006, the
real estate loan portfolio reflected a wide range of interest rates and repayment patterns, but
could generally be categorized as follows:

During 2006 and 2005, approximately 96 million and 98 million, respectively, of residential
mortgages were sold into the secondary market.

In addition to the real estate loan portfolio, the Bank sells real estate loans and retains the
servicing rights. Loans serviced for others are not included in the consolidated balance sheets.
During 2006 Horizon sold a large portion of its mortgage servicing business. The unpaid principal
balances and number of loans serviced for others totaled approximately 23,988,000 and 279 and
 164,885,000 and 1,971 at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Bank began capitalizing mortgage servicing rights during 2000 and the aggregate fair value of
capitalized mortgage servicing rights at December 31, 2006, totaled approximately 245,000.
Comparable market values and a valuation model that calculates the present value of future cash
flows were used to estimate fair value. For purposes of measuring impairment, risk characteristics
including product type, investor type and interest rates, were used to stratify the originated
mortgage servicing rights.

Commercial Loans 

Commercial loans totaled 271.457 million, or 32.1 of total loans as of December 31, 2006,
compared to 273.310 million, or 36.2 as of December 31, 2005. During the course of the year,
Horizon had 30.944 million in commercial real estate and 500 thousand of agricultural loans pay
off prematurely. Of this dollar amount, approximately 14 were loans that were acquired by Horizon
in the Alliance Bank acquisition that had credit issues. Another 43 were commercial real estate
loans that either refinanced elsewhere for more favorable terms or the properties were sold. New
loan production essentially offset the losses in commercial loan balances arising from the
aforementioned early payoffs.

Consumer loans totaled 237.875 million, or 28.2 of total loans as of December 31, 2006, compared
to 202.383 million, or 27.6 as of December 31, 2005. The total consumer loan portfolio increased
17.5 in 2006. The growth in consumer loans came from the indirect automobile segment of the
portfolio as Horizon expanded its dealer network in southwest Michigan and north central Indiana.
Direct consumer loans, mostly consisting of home equity term and revolving loans, were relatively
stable in 2006.

Mortgage Warehouse Loans 

In November 1999, Horizon began a mortgage-warehousing program. Horizon enters into agreements
with mortgage companies and purchases, at its discretion, mortgage loans from mortgage companies at
par, net of certain fees, and later sells them back to the mortgage companies at the same amount
and without recourse provisions. Interest income is recorded based upon a rate of interest tied to
the prime rate during the funding period, not the rates on the individual note. Such loans are
made to individuals and reviewed, prior to purchase, for evidence that the loans are of secondary
market quality and meet Horizon s internal underwriting guidelines. An assignment of the mortgage
to Horizon is required. In addition, Horizon takes possession of the original note and forwards
such note to the end investor. In the event that the end investor would not honor this commitment
and the mortgage companies would not be able to honor their repurchase obligations, Horizon would
then need to sell these loans in the secondary market at the fair value of these loans. Loans are
typically resold within 30 days and are seldom held more than 90 days.

Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses/Critical Accounting Policy 

An allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio.
The determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that involves
management s ongoing quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan
portfolio. The identification of loans that may have potential losses is subjective, therefore, a
general reserve is maintained to cover all potential losses within the entire loan portfolio.
Horizon utilizes a loan grading system that helps identify, monitor and address asset quality
problems, in an adequate and timely manner. Each quarter, various factors affecting the quality of
the loan portfolio are reviewed.

24 

Table of Contents 

Large credits are reviewed on an individual basis for loss
potential. Other loans are reviewed as a group based upon previous trends of loss experience.
Horizon also reviews the current and anticipated economic conditions of its lending market as well
as transaction risk to determine the effect they may have on the loss experience of the loan
portfolio.

At December 31, 2006, the allowance for loan losses was 8.738 million, or 1.03 of total loans
outstanding, compared to 8.368 million, or 1.14 at December 31, 2005. During 2006, the provision
for loan losses totaled 905 thousand compared to 1.521 million in 2005. The allowance as a
percent of total loans decreased due to strong credit quality and loan loss ratios that are better
than those of Horizon s peers. In addition, the lack of growth in commercial and mortgage
warehouse loans resulted in no appreciable increase to reserve allocations for these portfolios.
However, no assurance can be given that Horizon will not, in any particular period, sustain loan
losses that are significant in relation to the amount reserved, or that subsequent evaluations of
the loan portfolio, in light of factors then prevailing, including economic conditions and
management s ongoing quarterly assessments of the portfolio, will not require increases in the
allowance for loan losses. Horizon considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to cover
losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2006.

Nonperforming Loans 

Nonperforming loans are defined as loans that are greater than 90 days delinquent or have had the
accrual of interest discontinued by management. Management continues to work diligently toward
returning nonperforming loans to an earning asset basis. Nonperforming loans for the previous
three years ending December 31 are as follows:

2006 
 
 2005 
 
 2004 

Nonperforming loans

2,625 

1,822 

1,358 

Nonperforming loans total 30 of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2006, compared to
22 and 19 of the allowance for loan losses on December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

A loan becomes impaired when, based on current information, it is probable that a creditor will be
unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a
loan is classified as impaired, the degree of impairment must be recognized by estimating future
cash flows from the debtor. The present value of these cash flows is computed at a discount rate
based on the interest rate contained in the loan agreement. However, if a particular loan has a
determinable market value, the creditor may use that value. Also, if the loan is secured and
considered collateral dependent, the creditor may use the fair value of the collateral.

Smaller-balance, homogeneous loans are evaluated for impairment in total. Such loans include
residential first mortgage loans secured by 1 4 family residences, residential construction
loans, automobile, home equity, second mortgage loans and mortgage warehouse loans. Commercial
loans and mortgage loans secured by other properties are evaluated individually for impairment.
When analysis of borrower operating results and financial condition indicate that underlying cash
flows of a borrower s business are not adequate to meet its debt service requirements, the loan is
evaluated for impairment. Often this is associated with a delay or shortfall in payments of 30
days or more. Loans are generally moved to nonaccrual status when 90 days or more past due. These
loans are often considered impaired. Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when
deemed uncollectible.

Deposits 

The primary source of funds for the Bank comes from the acceptance of demand and time deposits.
However, at times the Bank will use its ability to borrow funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank and
other sources when it can do so at interest rates and terms that are superior to those required for
deposited funds. Total deposits were 913.973 million at December 31, 2006, compared to 855.566
million at December 31, 2005, or an increase of 6.8 . Average deposits and rates by category for

Horizon continually revises and enhances its interest-bearing consumer and commercial demand
deposit products based on local market conditions and its need for funding to support various types
of assets. These product changes caused the changes in the average balances and rates paid as
displayed in the table above.

Certificates of deposit of 100,000 or more, which are considered to be rate sensitive and are not
considered a part of core deposits, mature as follows as of December 31, 2006:

Due in three months or less

53,053 

Due after three months through six months

5,984 

Due after six months through one year

Interest expense on time certificates of 100,000 or more was approximately 5.533 million, 2.059
million and 1.762 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of December 31, 2006, Horizon does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, change
in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term off-balance sheet
arrangement generally means any transaction, agreement, or other contractual arrangement to which
an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party under which the Company has (i) any obligation
arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained
or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as
credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.

Shareholder Value Plan 

During 2001, Horizon initiated a Shareholder Value Plan. The Plan is a comprehensive strategic
plan to broaden and improve the market for Horizon s common stock with local community investors
who have a long-term, personal interest in helping Horizon remain an independent community bank.
It includes improved communications with stockholders and customers as well as efforts to improve
the marketability of its common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2001, two important components
of the Shareholder Value Plan were completed. These included a 3-for-1 stock split and the listing
of Horizon s stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market (formerly named the NASDAQ SmallCap Market) and
effective February 1, 2007, Horizon is listed on Nasdaq Global Market. Before this, Horizon s
stock was traded on the Bulletin Board. A dividend reinvestment plan was implemented in early 2002
and the quarterly per share dividend was increased to .10 2/3 in the fourth quarter of
2002. In October of 2003, Horizon s Board of Director s declared a 3-for-2 stock split and in
December of 2003 increased the dividend to .12. In December 2004, the Board of Director s
increased the quarterly dividend to .13 per share and in December 2005, the Board of Director s
increased the quarterly dividend to .14 per share.

Capital Resources 

The capital resources of Horizon and the Bank exceed regulatory capital ratios for well
capitalized banks at December 31, 2006. Stockholders equity totaled 61.877 million as of
December 31, 2006, compared to 53.530 million as of December 31, 2005. At year-end 2006, the
ratio of stockholders equity to assets was 5.06 compared to 4.75 for 2005. Horizon s capital
increased during the year 2006 as a result of increased earnings, net of dividends declared,
exercise of stock options and net of tax, decrease in unrealized gain (loss) on securities
available for sale and the amortization of unearned compensation. Due to the acquisition of
Alliance for cash, the percentage growth in assets was greater than the percentage growth in
equity, causing the equity to asset ratio from 2004 to 2005 to decrease.

Horizon declared dividends in the amount of .56 per share in 2006, and .53 per share in 2005 and
 .49 per share in 2004. The dividend payout ratio (dividends as a percent of net income) was 24 
during 2006, 23 during 2005 and 21 during 2004. For additional information regarding dividend
conditions, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2002, Horizon formed Horizon Statutory Trust I (Trust I), a statutory business trust.
Trust I issued 12 million of Trust Preferred Capital Securities as a participant in a pooled trust
preferred securities offering. Horizon issued subordinated debentures aggregating 12 million to
Trust I. The junior subordinated debentures are the sole assets of Trust I. The junior
subordinated debentures and the trust preferred securities pay interest and dividends,
respectively, on a quarterly basis. The junior subordinated debentures and the securities bear
interest at a rate of 90 day LIBOR plus 3.60 and mature on March 26, 2032, and are noncallable for
five years. After that period, the securities may be called at any quarterly interest payment date
at par. These securities have been called and will be redeemed on March 26, 2007. Costs associated
with the issuance of the securities totaling 362 thousand were capitalized and are being amortized
to the first call date of the securities.

In October of 2004, Horizon formed Horizon Bancorp Capital Trust II (Trust II), a statutory
business trust. Trust II issued 10 million of Trust Preferred Capital Securities as a participant
in a pooled trust preferred securities offering. Horizon issued junior subordinated debentures
aggregating 10 million to Trust II. The junior subordinated debentures are the sole assets of
Trust II. The junior subordinated debentures and the trust preferred securities pay interest and
dividends, respectively, on a quarterly basis. The junior subordinated debentures and the
securities bear interest at a rate of 90 day LIBOR plus 1.95 and mature on October 21, 2034, and
are noncallable for five years. After that period, the securities may be called at any quarterly
interest payment date at par. Costs associated with the issuance of the securities totaling
 17,500 were capitalized and are being amortized to the first call date of the securities.

The Company assumed additional debentures as the result of the acquisition of Alliance in 2005. In
June 2004, Alliance formed Alliance Financial Statutory Trust I (Alliance Trust) to issue the 5
million in trust preferred securities. Alliance had issued junior subordinated debentures
aggregating 5 million to Alliance Trust. The junior subordinated debentures are the sole assets
of Alliance Trust. The junior subordinated debentures and the trust preferred securities pay
interest and dividends, respectively, on a quarterly basis. The junior subordinated debentures and
the securities bear interest at a rate of 90 day LIBOR plus 2.65 , mature in June 2034, and are
noncallable for five years. After that period, the securities may be called at any quarterly
interest payment date at par.

In December of 2006, Horizon formed Horizon Bancorp Capital Trust III (Trust III), a statutory
business trust. Trust III issued 12 million of Trust Preferred Capital Securities as a
participant in a pooled trust preferred securities offering. Horizon issued junior subordinated
debentures aggregating 12 million to Trust III. The junior subordinated debentures are the sole
assets of Trust III. The junior subordinated debentures and the trust preferred securities pay
interest and dividends, respectively, on a quarterly basis. The junior subordinated debentures and
the securities bear interest at a rate of 90 day LIBOR plus 1.65 and mature on January 30, 2037,
and are noncallable for five years. After that period, the securities may be called at any
quarterly interest payment date at par. Costs associated with the issuance of the securities
totaling 12,647 were capitalized and are being amortized to the first call date of the securities.
The proceeds of this issue will be used to redeem the securities issued by Trust I on March 26,
2007.

The Trust Preferred Capital Securities, subject to certain limitations, are included in Tier 1
Capital for regulatory purposes. At December 31, 2006, 20.605 million of the 39 million in
securities were not included in Tier 1 Capital for regulatory purposes. Dividends on the Trust
Preferred Capital Securities are recorded as interest expense.

The Bank purchases home mortgages from mortgage companies under warehouse agreements whereby the
mortgage company has the right to repurchase the loan. Because these transactions are sales of the
loans to the Bank and the Bank is the owner of the purchased loans, the Bank has historically
treated these loans as home mortgage loans for call report and regulatory capital
purposes. During the course of the routine, periodic examination by bank regulatory authorities
commenced in February 2003, the examination personnel raised the issue of whether the Bank s
mortgage warehouse loans should be treated as other loans rather than as home mortgage loans for
call report purposes. If these mortgage loans were treated as other loans, it would change the
calculations for risk-based capital and reduce the Bank s risk-based capital ratios. The following
table shows, for year-ends in

If the Bank is required to reclassify such loans, the Bank still meets the regulatory well
capitalized standards for all of 2006, 2005 and 2004. Bank regulators have not issued a final
opinion on this matter but management continues to believe that these loans are properly
characterized for risk-based capital purposes. However, there is no assurance that the regulators
will concur with that determination. If required to treat mortgage warehouse loans as commercial
loans, the Bank will consider increasing the amount of its capital through the issuance of
subordinated debt, trust
preferred securities or equity securities; or consider other alternatives.

As a condition of approval for the Alliance acquisition, the OCC required Horizon Bank to
maintain regulatory capital ratios at 100 basis points above the well capitalized minimums shown
above.

Table of Contents 

As of December 31, 2006, management is not aware of any other recommendations by banking
regulatory authorities, which, if they were to be implemented, would have or are reasonably likely
to have a material effect on Horizon s liquidity, capital resources or operations.

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

Consolidated net income was 7.484 million or 2.33 per diluted share in 2006, 7.091 million or
 2.24 per diluted share in 2005 and 6.935 million or 2.22 per share in 2004.

Net Interest Income 

The primary source of earnings for Horizon is net interest income. Net interest income is the
difference between what Horizon has earned on assets it has invested and the interest paid on
deposits and other funding sources. The net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a
percentage of average earning assets. Horizon s earning assets consist of loans, investment
securities and interest-bearing balances in banks.

Horizon s average earning assets were 1,048.250 million in 2006 compared to 941.991 million in
2005 and 769.541 million in 2004. The net interest margin for 2006 was 3.01 compared to 3.28 
and 3.31 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Short-term interest rates began to increase in the third
quarter of 2004 and continued through 2005 until June of 2006. Short-term interest rates have
remained relatively stable since then.

Horizon began to experience slightly higher loan yields due to the increase in short-term rates
throughout 2006. This is due in part to new loans and loan renewals coming in at higher rates than
those maturing or paying off and rates on loans with variable rates rising with short-term rates.
Average loans outstanding during 2006 showed significant growth from 2005 due to a full year of the
Alliance acquisition and concerted effort in new business. The mix of the loan portfolio also
showed significant change as shown in the following table.

Average commercial loans grew nearly 14 , consumer loans increased by over 27 and residential real
estate loans increased by over 63 . Commercial loans grew on average due a full year s impact of
the growth achieved in 2005 through the Alliance acquisition and additional lenders. The southwest
Michigan market, in which Horizon increased market share through the acquisition of Alliance in
2005, continued to have a strong growth pattern. Average consumer loans grew as a result of
expansion of indirect lending into southwest Michigan and north central Indiana. The continued
decrease in mortgage refinancing caused mortgage warehouse loans to decrease by over 11 .

To help fund the loan growth, investment portfolio was allowed to decrease through normal
maturities and securitiy sales. Restructuring of the investment portfolio occurred by selling low
yielding investment ssecurities and reinvesting the proceeds in higher yielding securities. The
loss taken on the sale will be recovered within one year through improved yield on the new
securities.

Average interest-bearing deposits increased by over 11 during 2006. Short-term deposit rates
increased throughout the year. The overall cost of time deposits increased as maturing
certificates of deposit renewed at higher rates.

The increase in net interest income during 2006 and 2005 is primarily the result of increased
earning assets, particularly investment securities in 2005 and the loan portfolio in 2005 and 2006.
The increase in net interest income resulting from increased earning assets was partially offset
by declines in the net interest margin.

Noninterest Income 

The major components of noninterest income consist of service charges on deposit accounts, gain on
sale of loans and fiduciary fees. Service charges on deposit accounts are based upon: a) recovery
of direct operating expenses associated with providing the service, b) allowing for a profit margin
that provides an adequate return on assets and stockholders equity and c) competitive factors
within the Bank s markets. Service charges on deposits were 3.102 million, 2.966 million and
 3.088 million, for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Gain on sale of loans was 1.681 million for 2006, 1.756 million for 2005 and 2.126 million in
2004. Horizon has sold between 50 and 60 of its residential mortgage loan production in 2004
through 2006. The loans retained are predominantly adjustable rate mortgage loans. During 2006,
Horizon sold 96 million of current production of residential mortgage loans into the secondary
market compared to 98 million in 2005 and 106 million in 2004. The 2004 gain includes
approximately 394 thousand from the sale of portfolio loans. Portfolio mortgage loans were sold
to reduce the interest rate risk related to long-term fixed rate assets and to provide funding for
the growth in other loan areas. Horizon anticipates that the volume of mortgage loan activity will
remain fairly constant in 2007 however, it is anticipated that a higher percentage of production
will be sold into the secondary market. Overall mortgage activity is anticipated to decline,
however, as Horizon enters new markets, originations in these markets should offset the overall
decline.

Fiduciary fees were 3.100 million in 2006 compared to 2.748 million in 2005 and 2.694 million in
2004. The fluctuations are primarily due to changes in the market value of assets under
administration and an increase in one time Employee Stock Ownership Plan fees.

Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense totaled 30.455 million in 2006 compared to 29.129 million in 2005 and
 25.672 million in 2004.

Salaries and benefits decreased .6 during 2006 compared to an increase of 11.9 during 2005. The
decrease in 2006 related to a decline in incentive compensation and staff reduction through
attrition resulting from an efficiency study conducted during the fourth quarter of 2004, partially
offset by the cost of additional staff for the newly created wholesale mortgage lending division
created during the third quarter of 2006. The increase for 2005 related to the cost of expansion
into new markets,

32 

Table of Contents 

including the acquisition of Alliance, partially offset by declines in incentive compensation and commissions
paid to mortgage originators.

Total other expenses, excluding salaries and benefits, increased 11.2 in 2006 and 15.6 in 2005.
During 2006 and 2005 other expenses were impacted by costs related to the acquisition of Alliance
as well as ongoing expenses relative to the operation of the additional branches, including the
amortization of the core deposit intangible acquired in the acquisition. 2006 was also impacted by
an increase in the deferred loan fees being amortized over the life of the loan.

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense totaled 2.838 million in 2006 compared to 2.945 million in 2005 and 2.494
million in 2004. The effective tax rate was 27.5 , 29.3 and 26.45 for 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2006 was due to an increase in the
percentage of tax-exempt income to pre-tax income. The increase in the effective rate in 2005 was
due to a decline in the percentage of tax exempt income to pre-tax income.

Liquidity and Rate Sensitivity Management 

Management and the Board of Directors meet regularly to review both the liquidity and rate
sensitivity position of Horizon. Effective asset and liability management ensures Horizon s
ability to monitor the cash flow requirements of depositors along with the demands of borrowers and
to measure and manage interest rate risk. Horizon utilizes an interest rate risk assessment model
designed to highlight sources of existing interest rate risk and consider the effect of these risks
on strategic planning. Management maintains (within certain parameters) an essentially balanced
ratio of interest sensitive assets to liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide
interest rate fluctuations.

Liquidity 

The Bank maintains a stable base of core deposits provided by long standing relationships with
consumers and local businesses. These deposits are the principal source of liquidity for Horizon.
Other sources of liquidity for Horizon include earnings, loan repayments, investment security sales
and maturities, sale of real estate loans and borrowing relationships with correspondent banks,
including the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB). At December 31, 2006, Horizon has available
approximately 197.693 million in available credit from various money center banks, including the
FHLB. During 2006, cash flows were generated primarily from proceeds from borrowings of 33.8
million, increase in deposits of 58.4 million and sales, maturities, and prepayments of investment
securities of 125.0 million. Cash flows were used to purchase investments totaling 91.8 million
and increase loans 112.2 million. The net cash and cash equivalent position increased by 13.1
million during 2006.

Interest Sensitivity 

The degree by which net interest income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates is monitored
by Horizon using computer simulation models, incorporating not only the current GAP position but
the effect of expected repricing of specific financial assets and liabilities. When repricing
opportunities are not properly aligned, net interest income may be affected when interest rates
change. Forecasting results of the possible outcomes determines the exposure to interest rate risk
inherent in Horizon s balance sheet. The goal is to manage imbalanced positions that arise when
the total amount of assets that reprice or maturing in a given time period differs significantly
from liabilities that reprice or mature in the same time period. The theory behind managing the
difference between repricing assets and liabilities is to have more assets repricing in a rising
rate environment and more liabilities repricing in a declining rate environment. At December 31,
2006, the amount of assets that reprice within one year were 96 of liabilities that reprice within
one year. At December 31, 2005, the amount of assets that reprice within one year were
approximately 109 of the amount of liabilities that reprice within the same time period.

Included in the GAP analysis are certain interest-bearing demand accounts and savings accounts.
These interest-bearing accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal. However, Horizon considers
approximately 59 of these deposits to be insensitive to gradual changes in interest rates and
generally to behave like deposits with longer maturities based upon historical experience.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Horizon s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk (IRR) is the risk
that Horizon s earnings and capital will be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. The
primary approach to IRR management is one that focuses on adjustments to the asset/liability mix in
order to limit the magnitude of IRR.

Horizon s exposure to interest rate risk is due to repricing or mismatch risk, embedded options
risk, and yield curve risk. Repricing risk is the risk of adverse consequence from a change in
interest rates that arise because of differences in the timing of when those interest rate changes
affect Horizon s assets and liabilities. Basis risk is the risk that the spread, or rate
difference, between instruments of similar maturities will change. Options risk arises whenever
products give the customer the right, but not the obligation, to alter the quantity or timing of
cash flows. Yield curve risk is the risk that changes in prevailing interest rates will affect
instruments of different maturities by different amounts. Horizon s
objective is to remain reasonably neutral with respect to IRR. Horizon utilizes a variety of
strategies to maintain this position including the sale of mortgage loans on the secondary market
and varying maturities of FHLB advances, certificates of deposit funding and investment securities.

Table of Contents 

The table, which follows, provides information about Horizon s financial instruments that are
sensitive to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2006. The table incorporates Horizon s
internal system generated data related to the maturity and repayment/withdrawal of interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities. For loans, securities and liabilities with contractual
maturities, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by
contractual maturities as well as the historical experience of Horizon related to the impact of
interest rate fluctuations on the prepayment of residential loans and mortgage-backed securities.
From a risk management perspective, Horizon believes that repricing dates are more relevant than
contractual maturity dates when analyzing the value of financial instruments. For deposits with no
contractual maturity dates, the table presents principal cash flows and weighted average rate, as
applicable, based upon Horizon s experience and management s judgment concerning the most likely
withdrawal behaviors.

Horizon had no derivative financial instruments or trading portfolio as of December 31, 2006.

(Table Dollar Amounts in Thousands)

Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Nature of Business The consolidated financial statements of Horizon Bancorp (Horizon) and its
wholly owned subsidiary, Horizon Bank, N.A. (Bank) conform to accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and reporting practices followed by the banking industry.

The Bank is a full-service commercial bank offering a broad range of commercial and retail banking
and other services incident to banking. The Bank has two active wholly owned subsidiaries: Horizon
Trust Investment Management, Inc. (HTIM) and Horizon Investments, Inc. (Investment Company).
HTIM offers corporate and individual trust and agency services and investment management services.
Horizon Investments, Inc. manages the investment portfolio of the Bank. The Bank maintains
fourteen full service facilities in Northwest Indiana and Southwest Michigan. The Bank also
maintains a loan production office in Lake County Indiana. The Bank also wholly owns Horizon
Insurance Services, Inc. (Insurance Agency) which is inactive, but previously offered a full line
of personal insurance products. The net income generated from the insurance operations was not
significant to the overall operations of Horizon and the majority of the insurance agency assets
were sold during 2005. Horizon conducts no business except that incident to its ownership of the
subsidiaries.

Horizon formed Horizon Statutory Trust I in 2002, Horizon Statutory Trust II in 2004 and Horizon
Bancorp Capital Trust III in 2006 for the purpose of participating in Pooled Trust Preferred Stock
offerings. The Company assumed additional debentures as the result of the acquisition of Alliance
in 2005 which formed Alliance Financial Statutory Trust I (Alliance Trust). See Note 11 for
further discussion regarding these previously consolidated entities that are now reported
separately.

Horizon formed one nonbank subsidiary, HBC Insurance Group, Inc. (Insurance Company). The
Insurance Company previously offered credit life and accident and health insurance and was
dissolved during 2004. The net income generated from the Insurance Company was not significant to
the overall operations of Horizon.

Basis of Reporting The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Horizon and
subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Investment Securities Available for Sale Horizon designates its investment portfolio as available
for sale based on management s plans to use such securities for asset and liability management,
liquidity and not to hold such securities as long-term investments. Management repositions the
portfolio to take advantage of future expected interest rate trends when Horizon s long-term
profitability can be enhanced. Investment securities available for sale and marketable equity
securities are carried at estimated fair value and any net unrealized gains/losses (after tax) on
these securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains/losses on the
disposition of securities available for sale are recognized at the time of the transaction and are
determined by the specific identification method.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Table Dollar Amounts in Thousands)

Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or market value in the
aggregate.

Interest and Fees on Loans Interest on commercial, mortgage and installment loans is recognized
over the term of the loans based on the principal amount outstanding. When principal or interest
is past due 90 days or more, and the loan is not well secured or in the process of collection, or
when serious doubt exists as to the collectibility of a loan, the accrual of interest is
discontinued. Loan origination fees, net of direct loan origination costs, are deferred and
recognized over the life of the loan as a yield adjustment.

Concentrations of Credit Risk The Bank grants commercial, real estate and consumer loans to
customers located primarily in Northwest Indiana and southwest Michigan and provides mortgage
warehouse lines to mortgage companies in the United States. Commercial loans make up approximately
32 of the loan portfolio and are secured by both real estate and business assets. These loans are
expected to be repaid from cash flows from operations of the businesses. Residential real estate
loans make up approximately 27 of the loan portfolio and are secured by residential real estate.
Installment loans make up approximately 28 of the loan portfolio and are primarily secured by
consumer assets. Mortgage warehouse loans make up approximately 13 of the loan portfolio and are
secured by residential real estate.

Mortgage Warehouse Loans Horizon purchases residential mortgage loans from various mortgage
companies prior to sale of these loans by the mortgage companies in the secondary market. Horizon
held loans that were purchased under agreements to resell from 32 approved mortgage companies at
December 31, 2006. Horizon purchases such loans from mortgage companies, net of certain fees and
later sells them back to the mortgage companies at the same amount and without recourse provisions.
As a result, no gains and losses are recorded at the resale of loans. Horizon records interest
and fee income on the loans during the funding period. Horizon uses the stated interest rate in
the agreement with each mortgage company for interest income recognition, and not the interest
rates on the individual loans. Horizon does not retain servicing of the loans when they are
resold. Loans consist of purchase money and refinance mortgage loans and are generally held no
more than 90 days by Horizon and are typically resold within 30 days.

Allowance for Loan Losses An allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb loan losses
inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the
probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the
provision for credit losses, which is charged against current period operating results and
decreased by the amount of charge offs, net of recoveries. Horizon s methodology for assessing the
appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements, which include the formula
allowance, specific allowances for identified problem loans and the unallocated allowance.

The formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to pools of outstanding loans. Loss
factors are based on a historical loss experience and may be adjusted for significant factors that,
in management s judgment, affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date.

Specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified conditions or
circumstances related to a credit that management believes indicate the probability that a loss
will be incurred in excess of the amount determined by the application of the formula allowance.

The unallocated allowance is based upon management s evaluation of various conditions, the effects
of which are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances.
The evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree
of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific credits. The conditions evaluated in
connection with the unallocated allowance may include factors such as local, regional and national
economic conditions and forecasts, concentrations of credit and changes in the composition of the
portfolio.

Loan Impairment When analysis determines a borrower s operating results and financial condition
are not adequate to meet debt service requirements, the loan is evaluated for impairment. Often
this is associated with a delay or shortfall in payments of 30 days or more. Loans are generally
placed on nonaccrual status when 90 days or more past due. These loans are also often considered
impaired. Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off when deemed uncollectible. This
typically occurs when the loan is 120 or more days past due.

Loans are considered impaired if full principal or interest payments are not made in accordance
with the original terms of the loan. Impaired loans are measured and carried at the lower of cost
or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest
rate, at the loan s observable market price or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is
collateral dependent.

Smaller balance homogenous loans are evaluated for impairment in the aggregate. Such loans include
residential first mortgage loans secured by one to four family residences, residential construction
loans and automobile, home equity and second mortgages. Commercial loans and mortgage loans
secured by other properties are evaluated individually for impairment.

Premises and Equipment Buildings and major improvements are capitalized and depreciated using
primarily the straight-line method with useful lives ranging from 3 to 40 years. Furniture and
equipment are capitalized and depreciated using primarily the straight-line method with useful
lives ranging from 2 to 20 years. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred while major
additions and improvements are capitalized. Gains and losses on disposition are included in
current operations.

Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank Stock The stock is a required investment for
institutions that are members of the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB)
systems. The required investment in the common stock is based on a predetermined formula.

Mortgage Servicing Rights Mortgage servicing rights on originated loans that have been sold are
capitalized by allocating the total cost of the mortgage loans between the mortgage servicing
rights and the loans based on their relative fair values. Capitalized servicing rights are
amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated servicing revenue. Impairment of
mortgage-servicing rights is assessed based on the fair value of those rights. Fair values are
estimated using discounted cash flows based on a current market interest rate. For purposes of
measuring impairment, the rights are stratified based on the predominant risk characteristics of
the underlying loans. The predominant characteristic currently used for stratification is type of
loan. The amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the capitalized mortgage
servicing rights for a stratum exceed their fair value. Amortization expense and charges related
to an impairment write-down are included in other income.

Goodwill Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. If the implied fair value of goodwill is
lower than its carrying amount, a goodwill impairment is indicated and goodwill is written down to
its implied fair value. Subsequent increases in goodwill value are not recognized in the financial
statements. As of December 31, 2004, and for the year then ended, goodwill totaled 158 thousand.
During 2005, 5.629 million of goodwill was acquired as a result of the Alliance Financial
Corporation acquisition resulting in a total of 5.787 million of goodwill as of December 31, 2005
and 2006.

Income Taxes Horizon files annual consolidated income tax returns with its subsidiaries. Income
tax in the consolidated statements of income includes deferred income tax provisions or benefits
for all significant temporary differences in recognizing income and expenses for financial
reporting and income tax purposes.

Trust Assets and Income Property, other than cash deposits, held in a fiduciary or agency
capacity is not included in the consolidated balance sheets since such property is not owned by
Horizon.

Earnings per Common Share Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution
that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted
into common stock. In August 2002, substantially all of the participants in Horizon s Stock Option
and Stock Appreciation Rights Plans voluntarily entered into an agreement with Horizon to cap the
value of their stock appreciation rights (SARS) at 14.67 per share and cease any future vesting of
the SARS. These agreements with option holders make it more advantageous to exercise an option
rather than a SAR whenever Horizon s stock price exceeds 14.67 per share, therefore, the option
becomes potentially dilutive at 14.67 per share or higher. The number of shares used in the
computation of basic earnings per share is 3,177,272 for 2006, 3,067,632 for 2005 and 2,993,696 for
2004. The number of shares used in the computation of diluted earnings per share is 3,217,050 for
2006, 3,162,950 for 2005 and 3,123,325 for 2004. For 2006 there were 5,000 shares excluded from
diluted earnings per share as they were anti-dilutive. There were no anti-dilutive shares for 2005
or 2004.

Dividend Restrictions Regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency limit the amount of
dividends that may be paid by a national bank to its parent holding company without prior approval
of the Comptroller of the Currency. At December 31, 2006, 4.921 million was available for payment
of dividends from the Bank to Horizon. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Board limits the amount
of dividends that may be paid by Horizon to its stockholders under its capital adequacy guidelines.

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash
equivalents are defined to include cash and due from banks, money market investments and federal
funds sold with maturities of one day or less. Horizon reports net cash flows for customer loan
transactions, deposit transactions, short-term investments and short-term borrowings.

Share-Based Compensation At December 31, 2006, Horizon has stock option plans, which are
described more fully in Note 19. Effective January 1, 2006, Horizon adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment SFAS 123(R) ). SFAS 123(R) addresses all
forms of share-based payment awards, including shares under employee stock purchase plans, stock
options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based
payments to be recognized as expense, based upon their fair values, in the financial statements
over the vesting period of the awards. Horizon has elected the modified prospective application
and, as a result, has recorded approximately 40 thousand in compensation expense relating to
vesting of stock options less estimated forfeitures for the 12 month period ended December 31,
2006. Prior to adoption of SFAS 123(R), unearned compensation related to restricted stock awards
was classified as a separate component of stockholders equity. Upon the adoption of SFAS 123(R)
on January 1, 2006, the balance in unearned compensation was reclassified to additional paid-in
capital.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), Horizon accounted for these plans under the recognition and
measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost was reflected in net income, as all
options granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying
common stock on the grant date. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and
earnings per share if Horizon had applied the fair value provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based
employee compensation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets The FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets (SFAS 156), which amends SFAS No. 140, Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. SFAS 156
permits an entity to choose either of the following subsequent measurement methods for each class
of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities:

Amortization Method Amortize servicing assets or servicing liabilities in proportion
to and over the period of net servicing income or net servicing loss and assess the servicing
assets or liabilities for impairment or increased obligation based on fair value at each
reporting date. 

Fair Value Measurement Method Measure servicing assets or servicing liabilities at
fair value at each reporting date and report changes in fair value in earnings in the periods
in which the changes occur. 

Horizon adopted the amortization method on January 1, 2007. The adoption of SFAS 156 did not have
a material impact on Horizon s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) on fair value measurement. SFAS 157 provides guidance for
using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 also responds to investors requests
for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair
value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on
earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to
be measured at fair value. SFAS 157 does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances.

Over forty current accounting standards within generally accepted accounting principles require (or
permit) entities to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. Prior to SFAS 157, the methods
for measuring fair value were diverse and inconsistent, especially for items that are not actively
traded. In the case of derivatives, the FASB consulted with investors, who generally supported fair
value, even when market data are not available, along with expanded disclosure of the methods used
and the effect on earnings.

Under SFAS 157, fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in
which the reporting entity transacts such sales or transfers. SFAS 157 clarifies the principle
that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an
asset or liability. In support of this principle, SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the
highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data,
for example, the reporting entity s own data. Under SFAS 157, fair value measurements would be
separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy.

SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Horizon has not
determined the impact that SFAS 157 will have on its consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes The FASB released the final interpretation of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN
48), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 creates a
single model to address uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income
tax positions by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet
before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure and transition.

FIN 48 utilizes a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition (step one) occurs
when an enterprise concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is
more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (step two) is only addressed if
step one has been satisfied (i.e., the position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained). Under
step two, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative
probability basis that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 s
use of the term more-likely-than-not in steps one and two is consistent with how that term is
used in SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (i.e., a likelihood of occurrence greater than
50 percent).

Those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first
subsequent interim period in which they meet the more-likely-than-not standard, or are resolved
through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority, or upon expiration of the statute of
limitations. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a
company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not
threshold of being sustained. FIN 48 specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a
substitute for derecognition of tax positions.

FIN 48 includes expanded disclosure requirements, including a tabular roll forward of the beginning
and ending aggregate unrecognized tax benefits as well as specific detail related to tax
uncertainties for which it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefit will
significantly increase or decrease within twelve months. These disclosures are required at each
annual reporting period unless a significant change occurs in an interim period. Horizon adopted
FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on Horizon s
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Note 2 Acquisition 

On June 10, 2005, Horizon acquired Alliance Financial Corporation and its wholly owned bank
subsidiary, Alliance Banking Company (collectively referred to as Alliance). Horizon purchased the
outstanding shares of Alliance for 42.50 per share in cash. The cost of the transaction,
including legal, accounting, and investment fees was 13.348 million. The assets and liabilities
of Alliance were recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value as of the acquisition date. The
results of Alliance s operations have been included in Horizon s consolidated statement of income
from the date of acquisition. The 5,629,000 of goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

Securities with a carrying value of 78,795,000 and 76,183,000 were pledged at December 31, 2006
and 2005, respectively, to secure certain public and trust deposits and securities sold under
agreements to repurchase.

Proceeds from sales of securities available for sale during 2006 were 91,265,000. Gross gains of
 1,247,000 and gross losses of 2,011,000 were recognized on these sales in 2006. Proceeds from
sales of securities available for sale during 2005 were 7,150,000. Gross gains of 37,000 and
gross losses of 33,000 were recognized on these sales. There were no sales of securities
available for sale during 2004. The tax benefit on net realized losses for 2006 was 267,000. The
tax expense on net realized gains for 2005 was 1,400.

Certain investments in debt securities are reported in the financial statements at an amount less
than their historical cost. Total fair value of these investments at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
was 150,402,000 and 226,292,000, respectively, which is approximately 62 and 82 of Horizon s
available-for-sale investment portfolio. These declines primarily resulted from increases in
market interest rates.

Based on evaluation of available evidence, including recent changes in market interest rates,
credit rating information and information obtained from regulatory filings, management believes the
declines in fair value for these securities are temporary.

Should the impairment of any of these securities become other than temporary, the cost basis of the
investment will be reduced and the resulting loss recognized in net income in the period the
other-than-temporary impairment is identified.

Note 12 Employee Stock Bonus Plan 

Horizon maintains an employee stock bonus plan (Stock Bonus Plan) that covers substantially all
employees. The Stock Bonus Plan is noncontributory and Horizon may make matching contributions of
amounts contributed by employees to the Employee Thrift Plan and discretionary contributions.
Prior to the establishment of the Stock Bonus Plan, Horizon maintained an employee stock ownership
plan (ESOP) that was terminated. Effective January 1, 2007, the stock bonus plan was converted back
to a new ESOP. The prior ESOP accounts of active employees and the discretionary accounts of
active employees will remain in the new ESOP. The Matching contribution accounts under the Stock
Bonus Plan will be transferred to the Horizon Bancorp Employees Thrift Plan. The retirement plans
of Horizon own approximately 14.7 of the outstanding shares.

Total cash contributions and expense recorded for the Stock Bonus Plan was 200,000 in 2006 and
2005 and 250,000 in 2004.

Note 17 Commitments, Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Contingencies 

Because of the nature of its activities, Horizon is subject to pending and threatened legal actions
that arise in the normal course of business. In management s opinion, after consultation with
counsel, none of the litigation to which Horizon or any of its subsidiaries is a party will have a
material effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Horizon.

The Bank was required to have approximately 1,478,000 of cash on hand or on deposit with the
Federal Reserve Bank to meet regulatory reserve and clearing balance requirements at December 31,
2006. These balances are included in cash and cash equivalents and do not earn interest.

The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the ordinary course of
business to meet financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments
to make loans and standby letters of credit. The Bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to make loans and
standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank
follows the same credit policy to make such commitments as is followed for those loans recorded in
the financial statements.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, commitments to make loans amounted to approximately 154,686,000 and
 149,429,000 and commitments under outstanding standby letters of credit amounted to approximately
 3,000,000 and 1,995,000. Since many commitments to make loans and standby letters of credit
expire without being used, the amount does not necessarily represent future cash advances. No
losses are anticipated as a result of these transactions. Collateral obtained upon exercise of the
commitment is determined using management s credit evaluation.

Note 18 Regulatory Capital 

Horizon and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the
federal banking agencies and are assigned to a capital category. The assigned capital category is
largely determined by three ratios that are calculated according to the regulations: total risk
adjusted capital, Tier I capital and Tier I leverage ratios. The ratios are intended to measure
capital relative to assets and credit risk associated with those assets and off-balance sheet
exposures of the entity. The capital category assigned to an entity can also be affected by
qualitative judgments made by regulatory agencies about the risk inherent in the entity s
activities that are not part of the calculated ratios.

There are five capital categories defined in the regulations, ranging from well capitalized to
critically undercapitalized. Classification of a bank in any of the undercapitalized categories
can result in actions by regulators that could have a material effect on a bank s operations. As a
condition of approval for the Alliance acquisition, the OCC
required Horizon Bank to maintain regulatory capital ratios at 100 basis points above the well
capitalized minimums shown below. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, Horizon and the Bank are
categorized as well capitalized and met all subject capital adequacy requirements including the
requirements imposed with the approval of the Alliance acquisition noted above.

During the course of a periodic examination by the Bank s regulators that commenced in February
2003, the examination personnel raised the issue of whether the Bank s mortgage warehouse loans
should be treated as other loans rather than home mortgages for call report purposes. If these
loans are treated as other loans for regulatory reporting purposes, it would change the
calculations for risk based capital and reduce the Bank s risk-based capital ratios. Management
believes that it has properly characterized the loans in its mortgage warehouse loan portfolio for
risk-based capital purposes, but there is no assurance that the regulators will concur with that
determination. Should the call report classification of the loans be changed, Horizon and the Bank
would still be categorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Note 19 Share Based Compensation 

Horizon maintained the 1987 Nonqualified Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Right Plan (1987
Plan). As of December 31, 2006, no options or stock appreciation rights for the 1987 Plan were
outstanding or available for grant. No compensation expense relating to the 1987 Plan was recorded
in 2006 or 2005.

Under Horizon s 1997 Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Right Plan (1997 Plan), which is accounted
for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment (FAS 123R), Horizon may grant certain officers
and employees stock option awards or stock appreciation rights which vest and become fully
exercisable at the end of five years of continued employment. SARs entitle eligible employees to
receive cash, stock or a combination of cash and stock totaling the excess, on the date of
exercise, of the fair market value of the shares of common stock covered by the option over the
option exercise price. The underlying stock options are deemed to have been cancelled upon
exercise of the SARs. In the third quarter of 2002, Horizon entered into agreements with
participants that capped the value of their SARs at 14.67 per share and discontinued any future
vesting. No additional compensation expense is recognized when the fair value of Horizon stock
exceeds 14.67 per share as there is a presumption that participants will exercise their options
rather than the SARs. No compensation expense relating to the SARs was recorded in 2006, 2005 or
2004.

Horizon Bancorp 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Table Dollar Amounts in Thousands)

On January 21, 2003, the Board of Directors adopted the Horizon Bancorp 2003 Omnibus Equity
Incentive Plan (2003 Plan) which was approved by stockholders on May 8, 2003. Under the 2003 Plan,
Horizon may issue up to 150,000 common shares, plus the number of shares that are tendered to or
withheld by Horizon in connection with the exercise of options plus that number of shares that are
purchased by Horizon with the cash proceeds received upon option exercises. The 2003 Plan limits
the number of shares available to 150,000 for incentive stock options and to 75,000 for the grant
of nonqualified option awards. The shares available for issuance under the 2003 Plan may be
divided among the various types of awards and among the participants as the Compensation Committee
(Committee) determines. The Committee is authorized to grant any type of award to a participant
that is consistent with the provisions of the 2003 Plan. Awards may consist of incentive stock
options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance
units, performance shares or any combination of these awards. The Committee determines the
provisions, terms and conditions of each award. The restricted shares vest at the end of five
years of continuous employment. Holders of restricted shares receive dividends and may vote the
shares. The restricted shares are recorded at fair market value (on the date granted) as a
separate component of stockholders equity. The cost of these shares are being amortized against
earnings using the straight-line method over five years. The options shares granted under the 2003
plan vest at a rate of 20 per year. The restricted shares granted under the 2003 Plan vest after
five years.

The fair value of options granted is estimated on the date of the grant using an option-pricing
model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years 2006, 2005 and 2004
was 7.12, 7.66 and 6.97, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the
year ended December 31, 2006 was 956. No options granted under the 2003 Plan were exercised in
2005 or 2004.

There were no shares granted, vested or forfeited during 2006. These restricted shares all vest on
August 2, 2009.

Total compensation cost recognized in the income statement for option-based payment arrangements
during 2006 was 40,000 and the related tax benefit recognized was 16,000. No cost was recognized
for the years 2005 and 2004.

Total compensation cost recognized in the income statement for restricted share based payment
arrangements during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 212,000, 212,000 and 88,000, respectively. The
recognized tax benefit related thereto was 84,000, 84,000 and 35,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Cash received from option exercise under all share-based payment arrangements for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 735,000, 946,000 and 445,000, respectively. The actual tax
benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercise of the share-based payment
arrangements totaled 723,000, 1,139,000 and 308,000, respectively, for the years ended December
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

As of December 31, 2006, there was 706,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all
nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under all of the plans. That cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.

Note 20 FDIC One-Time Assessment Credit 

Effective November 17, 2006, the FDIC implemented a one-time credit of 4.7 billion to eligible
institutions. The purpose of the credit is to recognize contributions made by certain institutions
to capitalize the Bank Insurance Fund and Savings Association
Insurance Fund, which have now been merged into the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Bank is an
eligible institution and has received notice from the FDIC that its share of the credit is
 458,184. This amount is not reflected in the accompanying financial statements as it represents
contingent future credits against future insurance assessment payments. As such, the timing and
ultimate recoverability of the one-time credit may change.

Note 21 Fair Values of Financial Instruments 

The estimated fair value amounts were determined using available market information, current
pricing information applicable to Horizon and various valuation methodologies. Where market
quotations were not available, considerable management judgment was involved in the determination
of estimated fair values. Therefore, the estimated fair value of financial instruments shown below
may not be representative of the amounts at which they could be exchanged in a current or future
transaction. Due to the inherent uncertainties of expected cash flows of financial instruments,
the use of alternate valuation assumptions and methods could have a significant effect on the
derived estimated fair value amounts.

The estimated fair values of financial instruments, as shown below, are not intended to reflect the
estimated liquidation or market value of Horizon taken as a whole. The disclosed fair value
estimates are limited to Horizon s significant financial instruments at December 31, 2006 and 2005.
These include financial instruments recognized as assets and liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheet as well as certain off-balance sheet financial instruments. The estimated fair
values shown below do not include any valuation of assets and liabilities which are not financial
instruments as defined by SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments .

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instrument:

Cash and Cash Equivalents The carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Interest-Bearing Deposits The carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Investment Securities For debt and marketable equity securities available for sale and held to
maturity, fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes. For those securities
where a quoted market price is not available, carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair
value based upon comparison with similar securities.

Net Loans The fair value of portfolio loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows
using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit
ratings and for the same remaining maturities. The carrying amounts of loans held for sale
approximate fair value.

Interest Receivable/Payable The carrying amounts approximate fair value.

FHLB and FRB Stock Fair value of FHLB and FRB stock is based on the price at which it may be
resold to the FHLB and FRB.

Deposits The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts
and money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of
fixed maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using
rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturity.

Short-Term Borrowings The carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Long-Term Borrowings Rates currently available to Horizon for debt with similar terms and
remaining maturities are used to estimate fair values of existing long-term borrowings.

66 

Table of Contents 

Horizon Bancorp and Subsidiaries 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Table Dollar Amounts in Thousands)

Subordinated Debentures Rates currently available for debentures with similar terms and remaining
maturities are used to estimate fair values of existing debentures.

Commitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letter of Credit The fair value of commitments is
estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account
the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For
fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of
interest rates and the committed rates. The fair value of letters of credit is based on fees
currently charged for similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise
settle the obligations with the counterparties at the reporting date. Due to the short-term nature
of these agreements, carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Audit Committee, Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Horizon Bancorp 
Michigan City, Indiana

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Horizon Bancorp as of December 31,
2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Horizon Bancorp as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

Horizon Bancorp 

Management s Report on Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial
statements and related notes on the preceding pages. The statements have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
appropriate in the circumstances and include amounts that are based on management s best estimates
and judgments. Financial information elsewhere in the Annual Report is consistent with that in the
consolidated financial statements.

In meeting its responsibility for the accuracy of the consolidated financial statements, management
relies on Horizon s system of internal accounting controls. This system is designed to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly recorded to permit
the preparation of appropriate financial information. The system of internal controls is
supplemented by a program of internal audits to independently evaluate the adequacy and application
of financial and operating controls and compliance with Company policies and procedures.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets periodically with management, the independent
accountants and the internal auditors to ensure that each is properly discharging its
responsibilities with regard to the consolidated financial statements and internal accounting
controls. The independent accountants have full and free access to the Audit Committee and meet
with it to discuss auditing and financial reporting matters.

The consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report have been audited by BKD,
 llp , independent registered public accounting firm, for 2006, 2005 and 2004. Their audits
were conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) and included consideration of internal accounting controls, tests of accounting
records and other audit procedures to the extent necessary to allow them to express their opinion
on the fairness of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION 

Section 2.1 Eligibility . Any salaried employee who is employed by the Company
or Horizon Bank, N.A. or another Affiliate that has adopted the Plan under Article IX is eligible
to become a Participant in the Plan provided the employee is designated as a Participant by the
Committee in writing.

Section 2.2 Participation . A designated employee will become a Participant 
as of the later of the Effective Date or the date specified by the Committee. A Participant may be
removed as an active Participant by the Committee, effective as of any date, so that the
Participant will not be entitled to accrue additional benefits under Sections 3.3 or 3.4 on or
after that date.

ARTICLE III

CONTRIBUTIONS AND ALLOCATIONS 

Section 3.1 Employee Deferral Contributions. Subject to the terms and limitations of
this Article, a Participant may elect, pursuant to Section 3.2, to have a portion of the
Participant s Compensation payable in any Plan Year withheld by the Company or an Affiliate

2 

and credited as an Employee Deferral Contribution under the Plan. The term contribution 
is used for ease of reference; however, contributions are merely credits to each Participant s
Account, which is a bookkeeping account.

The term Compensation, for purposes of the Plan, means the total cash compensation paid to
the Participant by the Company or an Affiliate during a Plan Year (including the compensation that,
but for the deferral election made under this Section or an election made under a Code Section 125
Plan or the Thrift Plan would have been paid to the Participant) for services rendered as an
employee, including overtime pay, commissions and bonuses, but excluding fringe benefits, welfare
benefits, deferred compensation and reimbursements (including moving expenses) and expense
allowances. Compensation does not include wages received upon the exercise by a Participant of a
stock appreciation right received under any plan provided by the Company or its Affiliates.

Section 3.2 Deferral Elections . Employee Deferral Contributions will be
withheld from a Participant s Compensation in accordance with the following terms and conditions.

(a) 
 
 Requirement for Deferral Elections . As a condition to the Company s or
an Affiliate s obligation to withhold and the Committee s obligation to credit Employee
Deferral Contributions for the benefit of a Participant pursuant to Section 3.1, the
Participant must complete and file a deferral election form with the Committee (in a
format prescribed by the Committee). 

(b) 
 
 Timing of Execution and Delivery of Elections . To be effective to
defer any portion of a Participant s Compensation, a deferral election form must be
filed with the Committee on or prior to the last day of the calendar year preceding the
Plan Year in which the services giving rise to the Compensation are performed. For
example, to defer Compensation payable with respect to services performed during the
2007 Plan Year, an election must be filed on or before December 31, 2006. 

(c) 
 
 Maximum Deferral . For Plan Years beginning on and after January 1,
2007, the Participant may elect to defer as an Employee Deferral Contribution for a
Plan Year, up to 25 percent of the Participant s Compensation. For Plan Years ending
prior to January 1, 2007, the Participant could elect to defer an overall percentage
(or dollar amount) which represented the total amount of deferrals to both the Thrift
Plan and the Plan, and such amount could not exceed 75 percent of such Participant s
Compensation for such Plan Year. 

(d) 
 
 Initial Eligibility . In the case of the first Plan Year in which an
individual becomes a Participant, the deferral election form may be filed with the
Committee at any time within 30 days of the date the individual becomes a Participant
(rather than the date specified under subsection 3.2 (b)). This initial election will
only apply to Compensation paid for services performed after the filing of the deferral
election form. This special initial eligibility election rule will not apply if the
Participant is or has been a participant in a deferred compensation arrangement
required to be aggregated with the Plan under the rules of Code Section 409A. 

(e) 
 
 Change of Deferral Elections . Subject to the provisions of subsection
3.2(f), once made, a deferral election will remain in effect for a Plan Year unless and
until the election is revoked or a new election filed. The revocation or new

3 

election must be filed in accordance with the requirements of subsection 3.2(b). No
deferral election may be changed for Compensation payable for a Plan Year after the
last day of the election period described in subsection 3.2 (b). For example,
except as provided in Section 3.2(f), any election in place for 2007 Compensation
may not be changed after December 31, 2006. 

(f) 
 
 Unforeseeable Emergency . The Committee, in its sole discretion, may
cancel a Participant s election to defer Compensation if the Committee determines the
Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency. The cancellation will apply to
the period after the Committee s determination. The Participant must submit a signed
statement of the facts causing the severe financial hardship and any other information
required by the Committee, in its sole discretion. An Unforeseeable Emergency is a
severe financial hardship of the Participant or beneficiary resulting from an illness
or accident of the Participant or beneficiary, the Participant s or beneficiary s
spouse, or the Participant s or beneficiary s dependent (as defined in Code Section
152(a)); loss of the Participant s or beneficiary s property due to casualty (including
the need to rebuild a home following damage to a home not otherwise covered by
insurance, for example, not as a result of a natural disaster); imminent foreclosure of
or eviction from the Participant s primary residence; the need to pay for medical
expenses, including non-refundable deductibles, as well as for the costs of
prescription drug medication; the need to pay for the funeral expenses of a spouse or a
dependent (as defined in Code Section 152(a)) or other similar extraordinary and
unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the
Participant or beneficiary. An Unforeseeable Emergency will be deemed to occur if a
Participant receives a hardship withdrawal from the Thrift Plan pursuant to Code
Section 401(k) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(3). 

Section 3.3 Company Matching Contributions .

(a) 
 
 Amount of Company Matching Contribution . The Company and its
Affiliates may, as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, make Company
Matching Contributions to Participant Accounts each Plan Year, in an amount determined
by the Committee in its sole discretion. 

(b) 
 
 Allocation of Company Matching Contribution . Any Company Matching
Contributions made under subsection 3.3(a) for a Plan Year will be allocated and
credited to the Accounts of Participants, according to the Employee Deferral
Contributions credited under Section 3.1 for the Plan Year. 

(c) 
 
 Timing of Contribution . A Company Matching Contribution contributed
for the benefit of a Participant for a Plan Year will be credited to a Participant s
Account monthly. 

(d) 
 
 Maximum Company Matching Contribution . Company Matching Contributions
made for the benefit of a Participant for any Plan Year will not exceed 25,000. This
limit can be changed prior to the beginning of any Plan Year by Resolution of the
Committee. 

4 

Section 3.4 Supplemental Contributions . The Company and its Affiliates may,
as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, make Supplemental Contributions under the
Plan, in accordance with subsections 3.4(a) and (b).

(a) 
 
 Amount of Contribution . The Company may, but is not required to,
credit to a Participant s Account such amount as the Committee may in its discretion
determine from time to time, which amount will constitute a Supplemental Contribution
under the Plan. 

(b) 
 
 Timing of Contribution . A Supplemental Contribution may be credited to
a Participant s Account at any time. 

Section 3.5 Plan Account . The Committee will establish and maintain an
 Account under the Plan for each Participant and will increase and decrease a Participant s
Account as provided in Section 3.7.

Section 3.6 Investment Credits. . A Participant s Account will be increased or
decreased to reflect the increase or decrease in the value of the Account established for the
Participant. The amount of interest credited will be determined based on the investment earnings
under the funding method(s) used by the Company pursuant to Section 7.2. However, if no such
method is used, earnings and losses on the Participant s Account will be determined by treating the
Participant s Account as if such balance were hypothetically invested in five-year U.S. Treasury
Bonds, at the rate published in the Wall Street Journal as in effect as of the first business day
of each calendar month, plus 200 basis points, but not to exceed 120 of the Applicable Long Term
Federal rate for monthly compounding. In the event any Participant is entitled to a distribution
of the Account under Article IV, the increase or decrease in the value of the Account will be
allocated as of the last day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment to
the Participant will be made.

Section 3.7 Account Allocations . As of each accounting date, each
Participant s Account will be:

(i) 
 
 Increased by the amount credited to the Account under Sections
3.1, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.8 since the last accounting; 

(ii) 
 
 Increased or decreased by the amount determined under Section
3.6 since the last accounting; and 

(iii) 
 
 Decreased by any payment made under Article IV. 

The accounting date under this Section will be any date determined by the Committee. However, the
accounting required under this Section must be made, at a minimum, as of the last day of each Plan
Year.

Section 3.8 Allocation of Forfeitures The amount, if any, of a Participant s
Company Matching Contributions and Supplemental Contributions forfeited under Section 4.4 will
revert to the Company and its Affiliates.

Section 3.9 Military Service . Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to
the contrary, contributions and benefits with respect to qualified military service will be
provided in accordance with Code Section 414(u).

ARTICLE IV

BENEFIT PAYMENTS 

Section 4.1 Time of Payment of Benefits . Except as provided in Sections 4.5
through 4.7, a Participant will receive or will begin to receive payment of his vested Account
balance within 90 days following the date specified for payment or the commencement of payment
effectively elected by the Participant, as provided in this Section.

(a) 
 
 Timing of Execution and Delivery of Payment Election . A Participant
may elect the date his vested Account balance will be paid or will begin to be paid by
completing and filing with the Committee a payment election form approved by the
Committee. The specified date must be a date at least two years from the beginning of
the Plan Year for which the first deferral under the Plan is made. To be effective,
the election under this Section must be filed with the Committee no later than the
later of: (i) the time the Participant first makes a deferral election under this Plan
(or under any other plan required to be aggregated with this Plan pursuant to the
requirements of Code Section 409A); or (ii) December 31, 2006. In lieu of specifying a
date certain, a Participant may elect to have payment made or commenced within a
specified period of time following the date the Participant experiences a Separation
from Service (as defined in subsection 4.1(b)). If no date is specified, payment will
be made or commenced within 90 days following the Participant s Separation from
Service. 

(b) 
 
 Separation from Service . Separation from Service means the date on
which the Participant dies, retires or otherwise experiences a Termination of
Employment with the Company. Provided, however, a Separation from Service does not
occur if the Participant is on military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of
absence (such as temporary employment by the government) if the period of such leave
does not exceed six months, or if the leave is for a longer period, so long as the
individual s right to reemployment with the Company is provided either by statute or by
contract. If the period of leave exceeds six months and the Participant s right to
reemployment is not provided either by statute or contract, there will be a Separation
from Service on the first date immediately following such six-month period. A
Participant will incur a Termination of Employment when a termination of employment
is incurred under Proposed Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(h)(ii) or any final version of
such Proposed Regulation. 

(c) 
 
 Change of Payment Election . An election as to the date payment will be
made or commenced may be changed by a Participant by filing a new payment election form
with the Committee; provided, however, that: (i) the new election will not take effect
until at least 12 months after the date the new election is filed, (ii) the single
lump-sum payment or the commencement of installment payments will be delayed for a
period of not less than five years from the date the payment or first payment would
otherwise have been made, and (iii) the new election is filed with the Committee at
least 12 months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment under the Plan. 

(d) 
 
 Suspension of Payments to Specified Employees . If a benefit is payable
to a Participant under the Plan due to the Participant s Separation from Service, for 

6 

any reason other than death, and if at the time of the Separation from Service the
Participant is a Specified Employee, payment of all amounts to the Participant under
the Plan will be suspended for six months following the Participant s Separation from
Service. If the Participant elected to receive payment of his benefit in the form of
installments, payment of any installments that the Participant was otherwise entitled
to receive during the six-month suspension period will be accumulated and paid in the
form of a lump sum on the first day following the six-month suspension period. The
remainder of the Participant s benefit will then continue distribution in the manner
and at the time elected by the Participant. If the Participant elected to receive
payment of his benefit in the form of a lump sum, he will receive payment of that
amount on the first day following the six-month suspension period. If the Participant
incurs a Separation from Service due to death, regardless of whether the Participant
meets the definition of a Specified Employee, payment of his benefit will not be
suspended. 

(i) 
 
 A Specified Employee means a Participant who is a Key
Employee at a time when the Company s stock is publicly traded on an
established securities market. A Participant will be a Specified Employee on
the first day of the fourth month following any Identification Date on which
the Participant is a Key Employee. 

(ii) 
 
 A Participant is a Key Employee if at any time during the
12-month period ending on an Identification Date the Participant is: (A) an
officer of the Company or an Affiliate having annual compensation greater than
 130,000 (as adjusted in the same manner as under Code Section 415(d) except
that the base period will be the calendar quarter beginning July 1, 2001, and
any increase under this sentence which is not a multiple of 5,000 will be
rounded to the next lower multiple of 5,000); (B) a five-percent owner of the
Company; or (C) a one-percent owner of the Company having an annual
compensation greater than 150,000. For purposes of determining whether a
Participant is an officer under clause (A), nor more than 50 employees (or, if
lesser, the greater of 3 or 10 percent of the employees) will be treated as
officers, and those categories of employees listed in Code Section 414(q)(5)
will be excluded. 

(iii) 
 
 The Identification Date for purposes of this Plan is December
31 of each Plan Year. 

Section 4.2 Method of Payment . Except as provided in Sections 4.5 through
4.7, the balance of a Participant s vested Account will be distributed in cash in one of the
following methods effectively elected by the Participant:

(a) 
 
 A single lump sum payment; 

(b) 
 
 Annual installment payments over a period of 3 to 12 years; or 

(c) 
 
 A combination of the methods specified in subsections (a) and (b). 

7 

Section 4.3 Method of Payment Elections .

(a) 
 
 Initial Election . A Participant may elect the manner in which his
vested Account balance will be paid to him under Section 4.2 in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Section. To make an election, a Participant must file an
election with the Committee (on a form or forms prescribed by the Committee). To be
effective, the election under this Section must be filed with the Committee no later
than the later of: (i) the time the Participant first makes a deferral election under
the Plan (or under any other plan required to be aggregated with this Plan pursuant to
the requirements of Code Section 409A); or (ii) December 31, 2006. If no election is
made or if the election is not timely or properly made, distribution will be made in
the form of three substantially equal annual installments. 

(b) 
 
 Change of Method of Payment Election . An election as to the manner of
payment may not be changed after the payment has been made or payments have commenced.
Prior to that time, a Participant may change his election by filing a new election form
with the Committee; provided, however, that: (i) the new election will not take effect
until at least 12 months after the date the new election is filed; (ii) the single lump
sum payment or the commencement of installment payments with respect to which such
election is made must be deferred for a period of not less than five years from the
date such payment would otherwise have been made; and (iii) the new election is filed
at least 12 months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment under the Plan. 

(c) 
 
 Installments . If installment distributions are elected, the initial
annual installment amount will be the Account balance otherwise payable in a single sum
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is
the total number of installment payments. Subsequent annual installments will also be
a fraction of the unpaid Account balance, the numerator of which is always one but the
denominator of which is the denominator used in calculating the previous installment
minus one. For example, if five annual installment payments are elected, the initial
installment will be one-fifth of the vested single sum Account balance, the second
installment will be one-fourth of the remaining vested Account balance and the third
installment will be one-third of the remaining vested Account balance, and so on. 

Section 4.4 Forfeitures on Separation from Service . A Participant s Account
will not be subject to forfeiture or reversion to the Company hereunder. Provided, however, to the
extent specified by the Committee, the Participant s Company Matching Contributions and
Supplemental Contributions under the Plan will be subject to forfeiture upon the Participant s
Separation from Service, prior to his completion of such number of Years of Service as determined
by the Committee, under circumstances other than any one of the following: (i) the death of the
Participant while still employed; (ii) the Committee s determination that the Participant is
Disabled; or (iii) a Participant s retirement on or after attaining age sixty-five (65). For
purposes of this Section, a Year of Service means each Plan Year (commencing on and after the
date of the Participant s first day of participation in this Plan) during which the employee has
completed one thousand (1,000) Hours of Service for the Employer, as defined in the Thrift Plan.

Section 4.5 Disability and Death . Subject to the provisions of subsection
4.1(d), in the event a Participant Separates from Service due to the Participant s Disability or if
the Participant

8 

dies or becomes Disabled before he has received his entire Account balance, the unpaid balance
will be paid to the Participant, or in the event of his death to his designated beneficiary or
beneficiaries, in a single lump sum within 90 days of a determination by the Committee that the
Participant is Disabled or within 90 days of the Participant s death.

(a) 
 
 Beneficiary Designations . A Participant may designate a beneficiary or
beneficiaries to receive any amount payable under this Section as a result of his
death. A Participant may change his designation of beneficiaries at any time by filing
with the Committee a written notice of the change on a form approved by the Committee.
Each beneficiary designation filed with the Committee will cancel all previously filed
beneficiary designations. If no designation is in effect on the Participant s death,
or if the designated beneficiary does not survive the Participant, his beneficiary will
be his surviving spouse, if any, and then his estate. 

(b) 
 
 Disabled. A Participant is Disabled for purposes of the Plan if the
Participant in question is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by
reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be
expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not
less than 12 months. A Participant who, by reason of any medically determinable
physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or last for a
continuous period of not less than 12 months, is receiving income replacement benefits
for a period of not less than three months under an accident and health plan sponsored
by an Employer will be deemed to be Disabled. The Committee will be the sole and final
judge of whether a Participant is Disabled for purposes of this Plan, after
consideration of any evidence it may require, including the reports of any physician or
physicians it may designate. 

Section 4.6 Unforeseeable Emergency . In the event the Committee determines in
its sole discretion that a Participant has experienced an Unforeseeable Emergency, all or a portion
of a Participant s vested Account may be distributed no later than 90 days following such
determination, in a single lump sum payment. The Participant must submit a signed statement of the
facts causing the severe financial hardship and any other information required by the Committee, in
its sole discretion. Payment under this Section is subject to the following conditions:

(a) 
 
 The emergency must not be able to be relieved through reimbursement or
compensation from insurance or otherwise, by liquidation of the Participant s assets,
to the extent liquidation of such assets would not cause severe financial hardship, or
by cessation of deferrals under this Plan. 

(b) 
 
 The amount of the distribution must be limited to the amount reasonably
necessary to satisfy the emergency need (which may include amounts necessary to pay any
Federal, state, or local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result
from the distribution) and must take into account any additional compensation available
due to cancellation of a deferral election under subsection 3.2(f). 

Section 4.7 Acceleration of Time of Payment . Except as provided in Section
4.6 or this Section, the time or schedule of payment of a Participant s Account provided in
Sections 4.1 through 4.5 may not be accelerated. The time and schedule of payment of a
Participant s

9 

Account may be accelerated in the following circumstances, each of which is an Acceleration
Event, to a time that is no later than 90 days following the Committee s determination that one of
the Acceleration Events has occurred and payment will be made in the form of a single lump sum:

(a) 
 
 Domestic Relations Order . The time or schedule of a payment from a
Participant s Account may be accelerated to make a payment to an individual other than
the Participant as may be necessary to fulfill a domestic relations order (as defined
in Code Section 414(p)(1)(B)). 

(b) 
 
 Conflicts of Interest . The time or schedule of a payment from a
Participant s Account may be accelerated as may be necessary to comply with a
certificate of divestiture (as defined in Code Section 1043(b)(2)). 

(c) 
 
 Payment of Employment Taxes . The time or schedule of a payment from a
Participant s Account may be accelerated to pay the Federal Insurance Contribution Act
tax imposed under Code Sections 3101, 3121(a) and 3121(v)(a), where applicable, on
compensation deferred under the Plan (the FICA Amount as well as to pay the income
tax at source on wages imposed under Code Section 3401 or the corresponding withholding
provisions of state or local tax laws as a result of payment of the FICA Amount;
provided, however, the total payment under this paragraph (c) will not exceed the
aggregate of the FICA Amount and the related income tax withholding. 

(d) 
 
 Income Inclusion Under Code Section 409A . The time or schedule of a
payment from a Participant s Account may be accelerated to pay the income tax, interest
and penalties imposed if the Plan fails to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A;
provided, however, such payment will not exceed the amount required to be included in
income as a result of the failure to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A. 

(e) 
 
 Plan Termination . The time or schedule of payment or commencement of
payments from a Participant s Account may be accelerated when the Plan is terminated in
accordance with one of the following: 

(i) 
 
 The Company terminates the Plan within 12 months of a corporate
dissolution taxed under Code Section 331, or with the approval of a bankruptcy
court pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 503(b)(1)(A), provided that the amounts deferred
under the Plan are included in the Participants gross incomes in the latest
of: 

(A) 
 
 The calendar year in which the Plan termination
occurs; 

(B) 
 
 The calendar year in which the amount is no
longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture; or 

(C) 
 
 The first calendar year in which the payment is
administratively practicable. 

(ii) 
 
 The Company s termination of the Plan within the 30 days
preceding or the 12 months following a change in control event (as defined in
Treasury 

10 

Regulation 1.409A-2(g)(4)(i)). For purposes of this paragraph the Plan may
be terminated only if all substantially similar arrangements sponsored by
the Company are terminated, so that the Participants in the Plan and all
Participants under substantially similar arrangements are required to
receive all amounts of compensation deferred under the terminated Plan and
other arrangements within 12 months of the date of termination of the Plan
and other arrangements. 

(iii) 
 
 The Company s termination of the Plan, provided that: 

(A) 
 
 All arrangements sponsored by the Company, that
would be aggregated with any terminated arrangement under Treasury
Regulation 1.409A-1(c) if the Participant participated in all of the
arrangements, are terminated; 

(B) 
 
 No payments other than payments that would be
payable under the terms of the arrangements if the termination had not
occurred are made within 12 months of the termination of the
arrangements; 

(C) 
 
 All payments are made within 24 months of the
termination of the arrangements; and 

(D) 
 
 The Company does not adopt a new arrangement

at any time within five years following the date of termination of the
Plan. 

(iv) 
 
 Such other events and conditions as the Internal Revenue
Service may prescribe in generally applicable guidance published in the
Internal Revenue Bulletin.

Section 5.2 Powers and Responsibilities of the Committee .

(a) 
 
 Committee Powers . The Committee will have all powers
necessary to administer the Plan, including the power to construe and interpret
the Plan documents; to decide all questions relating to an individual s

(b) 
 
 Records and Reports . The Committee will be responsible
for maintaining sufficient records to determine each Participant s eligibility
to participate in the Plan, and for purposes of determining the amount of
contributions that may be made on behalf of the Participant under the Plan. 

(c) 
 
 Rules and Decisions . The Committee may adopt such
rules as it deems necessary, desirable, or appropriate in the administration of
the Plan. All rules and decisions of the Committee will be applied uniformly
and consistently to all Participants in similar circumstances. When making a
determination or calculation, the Committee will be entitled to rely upon
information furnished by a Participant or beneficiary, the Company or the legal
counsel of the Company. 

(d) 
 
 Application for Benefits . The Committee may require a
Participant or beneficiary to complete and file with it an application for a
benefit, and to furnish all pertinent information requested by it. The
Committee may rely upon all such information so furnished to it, including the
Participant s or beneficiary s current mailing address. 

(e) 
 
 Delegation . The Committee may authorize one or more

behalf under the Plan. Any such duly authorized officer will have all powers
necessary to carry out the administrative duties delegated to such officer by
the Committee.

12 

ARTICLE VI

BENEFIT CLAIMS 

While a Participant or beneficiary need not file a claim to receive his benefit under the
Plan, if he wishes to do so, a claim must be made in writing and filed with the Committee. If a
claim is denied, the Committee will furnish the claimant with written notice of its decision. A
claimant may request a review of the denial of a claim for benefits by filing a written request
with the Committee. The Committee will afford the claimant a full and fair review of such request.
The claim and claim review process will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of
Supplement A.

ARTICLE VIII

FUNDING AND TRANSFERS 

Section 7.1 Unfunded Status . The Plan will be maintained in such a fashion
that at all times for purposes of ERISA and the Code it will be unfunded and will constitute a mere
promise by the Company to make Plan benefit payments in the future. Any and all rights created
under this Plan will be unsecured contractual rights against the Company.

Section 7.2 Trust . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.1, the
Committee may, in its discretion, satisfy all or any part of the Company s obligations under the
Plan from a trust established by the Company in connection with the Plan or from an insurance
contract, annuity or similar vehicle owned by the Company or by setting aside and investing amounts
deferred under the Plan as an asset of the Company. Any such trust or other vehicle will
constitute solely a means to assist the Company in meeting its promised obligations under the Plan
and will not constitute a funded account within the meaning of ERISA or the Code, nor will it
create a security interest for the benefit of any Participant or beneficiary. Any trust created
hereunder will conform in substantially all respects to the terms of the Model Trust, as described
in Revenue Procedure 92-64.

Section 7.3 Change in Control .

(a) 
 
 Establishment of a Trust Due to Change in Control of the Company .
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 7.1 and 7.2, upon a Change in Control of the
Company, as defined in subsection 7.3(b), the Company will, as soon as possible, but in
no event later than 90 days following the Change in Control, establish a trust that
will substantially conform to the model trust, as described in Revenue Procedure 92-64.
Upon the creation of such trust, the Company will make an irrevocable lump sum
contribution to the trust in an amount that is sufficient to pay all Plan Participants
and beneficiaries the benefits to which Plan Participants or their beneficiaries would
be entitled pursuant to the terms of the Plan as of the date on which the Change in
Control occurred. 

(b) 
 
 Definition of Change in Control : A Change in Control occurs when there
is a change in ownership as described in (i), a change in effective control as
described in (ii) or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the
Company s assets as described in (iii) of this subsection 7.3(b). 

13 

(i) 
 
 Change in Ownership . A change in the ownership of the Company
occurs on the date that any person, or group of persons, as defined in
subparagraph (b), acquires ownership of stock of the Company that, together
with stock held by the person or group, constitutes more than 50 percent of the
total fair market value or total voting power of the stock. 

(A) 
 
 However, if any person or group is considered
to own more than 50 percent of the total fair market value or total
voting power of the stock, the acquisition of additional stock by the
same person or group is not considered to cause a change in the
ownership of the Company. 

(B) 
 
 An increase in the percentage of stock owned by
any person or group, as a result of a transaction in which the Company
acquires its stock in exchange for property will be treated as an
acquisition of stock. 

(ii) 
 
 Change in the Effective Control . A change in the effective
control of the Company will occur when: 

(A) 
 
 Any person or group, acquires, or has acquired
during the twelve-month period ending on the date of the most recent
acquisition by such person(s), ownership of stock of the Company
possessing 35 percent or more of the total voting power; or 

(B) 
 
 A majority of members of the Board is replaced
during any twelve-month period by directors whose appointment or
election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Board
prior to the date of the appointment or election. 

However, if any person or group is considered to effectively control the
Company, the acquisition of additional control of the Company by the same
person(s) is not considered to cause a change in the effective control. 

(iii) 
 
 Change in the Ownership of a Substantial Portion of the
Company s Assets . A change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the
Company s assets occurs on the date that any person or group acquires, or has
acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent
acquisition by such person(s), assets from the Company that have a total gross
fair market value equal to or more than 40 percent of the total gross fair
market value of all of the assets immediately prior to such acquisition(s). 

(A) 
 
 Gross fair market value means the value of the
assets of the Company, or the value of the assets being disposed of,
determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such
assets. 

(B) 
 
 However, there is no Change in Control under
this subparagraph when there is a transfer to an entity that is
controlled by the 

14 

shareholders of the Company immediately after the transfer. A
transfer of assets by the Company is not treated as a change in the
ownership of such assets if the assets are transferred to: (i) a
shareholder of the Company (immediately before the asset transfer) in
exchange for or with respect to its stock; (ii) an entity, 50 percent
or more of the total value or voting power of which is owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company; (iii) a person, or group of
persons, that owns, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more of the
total value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of the
Company or (iv) an entity, at least 50 percent of the total value or
voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by a person
described in (iii). For purposes of this subsection, and except as
otherwise provided, a person s status is determined immediately after
the transfer of the assets. For example, a transfer to a corporation
in which the Company has no ownership interest before the
transaction, but which is a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company
after the transaction is not treated as a change in the ownership of
the assets of the Company. 

(iv) 
 
 Acting as a Group . For purposes of this Section, persons will
not be considered to be acting as a group solely because they purchase or own
stock of the Company at the same time, or as a result of the same public
offering. However, persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they
are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase
or acquisition of stock or similar business transaction with the Company. If a
person, including an entity, owns stock in both corporations that enter into a
merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock or similar transaction,
such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders
in a corporation prior to the transaction giving rise to the change and not
with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation. 

(v) 
 
 Exceptions . Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control
of the Company (i) will not occur as a result of the issuance of stock by the
Company in connection with any public offering of its stock; (ii) will not be
deemed to have occurred with respect to any transaction unless such transaction
has been approved or shares have been tendered by a majority of the
shareholders who are not Section 16 Persons; and (iii) will not occur due to
stock ownership by either the Horizon Bancorp Employees Stock Bonus Plan
Trust, which forms a part of the Horizon Bancorp Employees Stock Bonus Plan,
or any other employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company or an Affiliate.
 Section 16(b) Person means a person subject to potential liability under
Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act with respect to transactions which involve equity
securities of the Company. 

ARTICLE VIII

AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN 

15 

Section 8.1 Amendment of the Plan . The Company may amend the Plan at any time
in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not amend the Plan to
reduce a Participant s Account balance as determined on the day preceding the effective date of the
amendment.

Section 8.2 Termination of the Plan . The Company may terminate the Plan at
any time in its sole discretion. Absent an amendment to the contrary, Plan benefits that had

counterparts, each one constituting but one and the same instrument, and may be sufficiently
evidenced by any one counterpart.

16 

Section 10.5 No Enlargement of Employment Rights . Nothing contained in the
Plan may be construed as a contract of employment between the Company and any person, nor may the
Plan be deemed to give any person the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or limit
the right of the Company to employ or discharge any person with or without cause.

Section 10.6 Limitations on Liability . Notwithstanding any other provision of
the Plan, neither the Company nor any individual acting as an employee or agent of a Company will
be liable to a Participant or any beneficiary for any claim, loss, liability or expense incurred in
connection with the Plan, except when the same has been judicially determined to be due to the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of that person.

Section 10.7 Incapacity of Participant or Beneficiary . If any person entitled
to receive a distribution under the Plan is physically or mentally incapable of personally
receiving and giving a valid receipt for any payment due (unless a prior claim for the distribution
has been made by a duly qualified guardian or other legal representative), then, unless and until a
claim for the distribution has been made by a duly appointed guardian or other legal representative
of the person, the Committee may provide for the distribution to be made to any other individual or
institution then contributing toward or providing for the care and maintenance of the person. Any
payment made for the benefit of the person under this Section will be a payment for the account of
such person and a complete discharge of any liability of the Company and the Plan.

Section 10.8 Evidence . Evidence required of anyone under the Plan may be by
certificate, affidavit, document or other information which the person relying on the evidence

Section 10.10 Severability . In the event any provisions of the Plan are held
to be illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity will not affect the remaining
parts of the Plan, and the Plan will be construed and endorsed as if the illegal or invalid

Section 10.11 Information to be Furnished by a Participant . A Participant, or
any other person entitled to benefits under the Plan, must furnish the Committee with any and all
documents, evidence, data or other information the Committee considers necessary or desirable for
the purpose of administering the Plan. Benefit payments under the Plan are conditioned on a
Participant (or other person who is entitled to benefits) furnishing full, true and complete data,
evidence or other information to the Committee, and on the prompt execution of any document
reasonably related to the administration of the Plan requested by the Committee.

Section 10.12 Binding on Successors . The Plan will be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns, and the successors, assigns,
designees and estates of a Participant. The Plan will also be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of any successor organization succeeding to substantially all of the assets and business
of the Company, but nothing in the Plan will preclude the Company from merging or
consolidating into or with, or transferring all or substantially all of its assets to, another
organization which assumes the Plan and all obligations of the Company hereunder. The Company
agrees that it will make appropriate provision for the preservation of a Participant s

17 

rights under
the Plan in any agreement or plan which it may enter into to effect any merger, consolidation,
reorganization or transfer of assets. Upon such a merger, consolidation, reorganization, or

SUPPLEMENT A 

CLAIMS AND REVIEW PROCEDURES 

Section A-1 Procedures Governing the Filing of Benefit Claims . All Benefit
Claims must be filed on the appropriate claim forms available from the Committee or in accordance
with the procedures established by the Committee for claim purposes. The term Benefit Claim 
means a request for a Plan benefit or benefits, made by a Claimant or by an authorized
representative of a Claimant, that complies with the Plan s procedures for making benefit claims.
The term Claimant means a Participant, a Surviving Spouse of a Participant, a Beneficiary, or an
Alternate Payee, who is claiming entitlement to the payment of any benefit payable under the Plan.

Section A-2 Notification of Benefit Determinations . The Committee will notify
a Claimant, in accordance with Section A-3, of the Plan s benefit determination within a reasonable
period of time after receipt of a Benefit Claim, but not later than 90 days (45 days in the case of
a Disability Claim) after receipt of the Benefit Claim by the Plan.

If special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the Benefit Claim, the
Committee will notify the Claimant of the extension prior to the termination of the initial period
described above. The notice will indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension of
time and the date by which the Plan expects to make the benefit determination. In no event will
the extension exceed a period of 90 days from the end of the initial period.

In the case of a Disability Claim, the extension period will not exceed 30 days, unless prior
to the end of first 30-day extension period, the Committee determines that, due to matters beyond
its control, a decision cannot be rendered within the extension period, in which case the period
for making the determination may be extended for an additional 30 days. Every Disability Claim
notice will specifically explain the standards on which entitlement to a benefit is based, the
unresolved issues that prevent a decision on the claim, the additional information needed to
resolve those issues and the Claimant s right to provide the specified information within 45 days.
If the extension is in effect due to the Claimant s failure to submit information necessary to
decide a Disability Claim, the period for making the benefit determination will be tolled from the
date on which the notice of the extension is sent to the Claimant until the date on which the
Claimant responds to the request for information. The term Disability Claim means a request for
a Plan benefit made by a Claimant due to the purported Total and Permanent Disability of a Plan
Participant.

Section A-3 Manner And Content of Notification of Benefit Determinations . All
notices given by the Committee will be given to a Claimant, or to his authorized representative, in
a manner that satisfies the standards of 29 CFR 2520.104b-1(b) as appropriate with respect to the
particular material required to be furnished or made available to that individual. The Committee
may provide a Claimant with either a written or an electronic notice of the Plan s benefit
determination. Any electronic notification will comply with the standards imposed by 29 CFR
2520.104b-1(c)(1)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). In the case of an Adverse Benefit Determination, the
notice will set forth, in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant:

(a) 
 
 The specific reasons for the adverse determination; 

(b) 
 
 Reference to the specific Plan provisions (including any internal rules,
guidelines, protocols, criteria, etc.) on which the determination is based; 

(c) 
 
 A description of any additional material or information necessary for the
Claimant 

19 

to complete the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is
necessary; 

(d) 
 
 For a Disability Claim, the identification of any medical or vocational experts
whose advice was obtained on behalf of the Plan in connection with Claimant s Adverse
Benefit Determination, without regard to whether the advice was relied upon; and 

(e) 
 
 A description of the Plan s review procedures and the time limits applicable to
such procedures. 

The term Adverse Benefit Determination means a denial, reduction, or termination of, or a failure
to provide or make payment (in whole or in part) for, any benefit payable under the Plan.

Section A-4 Appeal of Adverse Benefit Determinations . A Claimant who receives
an Adverse Benefit Determination and desires a review of that determination must file, or his
authorized representative must file on his behalf, a written request for a review of the Adverse
Benefit Determination, not later than 60 days 180 days for a Disability Claim after receiving the
determination.

The written request for a review must be filed with the Committee. Upon receiving the written
request for review, the Committee will advise the Claimant, or his authorized representative, in
writing that:

(a) 
 
 The Claimant, or his authorized representative, may submit written comments,
documents, records, and any other information relating to the claim for benefits; and 

(b) 
 
 The Claimant will be provided, upon request of the Claimant or his authorized
representative, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other
information relevant to the Claimant s Benefit Claim, without regard to whether those
documents, records, and information were considered or relied upon in making the
Adverse Benefit Determination that is the subject of the appeal. 

Section A-5 Benefit Determination on Review . All appeals by a Claimant of an
Adverse Benefit Determination will receive a full and fair review by an appropriate named fiduciary
of the Plan. In the case of a Disability Claim, the named fiduciary will not be: (i) the party who
made the Adverse Benefit Determination that is the subject of the appeal, nor (ii) the subordinate
of that party. In performing this review for a Disability Claim, the named fiduciary will take
into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by the Claimant (or
the Claimant s authorized representative) relating to the claim, without regard to whether the
information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination, and will not afford
deference to the initial Adverse Benefit Determination. For a Disability Claim, the named
fiduciary will consult with a healthcare professional who has appropriate training and experience
in the field of medicine involved in the medical judgment and who was not consulted in connection
with the Adverse Benefit Determination and who is not the subordinate of such an individual if the
named fiduciary believes that such a consultation is necessary to properly complete the review
process.

Section A-6 Notification of Benefit Determination on Review . The Committee
will notify a Claimant, in accordance with Section A-7, of the Plan s benefit determination on
review within a reasonable period of time, but not later than 60 days (45 days in the case of a
Disability Claim) after the Plan s receipt of the Claimant s request for review of an Adverse
Benefit Determination. If, however, special circumstances require an extension of time for
processing the review by the named fiduciary, the Claimant will be notified, prior to the
termination of the

20 

initial 60-day (or 45 day) period, of the special circumstances requiring the extension and
the date by which the Plan expects to render the Plan s benefit determination on review, which will
not be later than 120 days (90 days in the case of a Disability Claim) after receipt of a request
for review. Provided, however, in the case of a Plan with a Committee or other group designated as
the appropriate named fiduciary that holds regularly scheduled meetings at least quarterly, the
time limit of this Section will be modified in accordance with 29 CFR 2560.503-1(i)(1)(ii) or 29
CFR 2560.503-1(i)(3)(ii), whichever is applicable.

If the extension period is in effect for a Disability Claim but the extension is due to the
Claimant s failure to submit information necessary to decide a claim, the period for making the
benefit determination on review will be tolled from the date on which notification of the extension
is sent to the Claimant until the date on which the Claimant responds to the request for additional
information.

Section A-7 Manner and Content of Notification of Benefit Determination on
Review . The Committee will provide a Claimant with notification of its benefit determination
on review in a method described in Section A-3.

In the case of an Adverse Benefit Determination on review, the notification must set forth, in
a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant:

(a) 
 
 The specific reasons for the adverse determination on review; 

(b) 
 
 Reference to the specific Plan provisions (including any internal rules,
guidelines, protocols, criteria, etc.) on which the benefit determination on review is
based; 

(c) 
 
 A statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of
charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other
information relevant to the Claimant s Benefit Claim, without regard to whether those
records were considered or relied upon in making the Adverse Benefit Determination on
review, including any reports, and the identities, of any experts whose advice was
obtained.
