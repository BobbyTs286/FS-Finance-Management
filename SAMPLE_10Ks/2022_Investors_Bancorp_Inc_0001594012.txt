Table of Contents 

 The Bank is a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Short Hills, New Jersey. Originally founded in 1926 as a New Jersey-chartered mutual savings and loan association, it has grown through acquisitions and internal growth, including de novo branching. In 1992, the charter was converted to a mutual savings bank and in 1997 the charter was converted to a New Jersey-chartered stock savings bank in connection with a reorganization into the mutual holding company structure. In 2019, the charter was converted to a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank. 
 The Bank is in the business of attracting deposits from the public through its branch network and a secure online channel and borrowing funds in the wholesale markets to originate loans and to invest in securities. The Bank originates multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial C I loans, one-to four- family residential mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, construction loans and consumer loans, the majority of which are cash surrender value lending on life insurance contracts, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. Securities, primarily mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Government and Federal Agency obligations, and other securities represented 14.4 of consolidated assets at December 31, 2021. The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance NJDOBI ), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB ). 
 Citizens Financial Group, Inc. Merger Agreement 
 On July 28, 2021, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. Citizens and the Company announced that they entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger under which Citizens will acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company for a combination of stock and cash. Under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger, shareholders of the Company will receive 0.297 of a share of Citizens common stock and 1.46 in cash for each share of the Company they own. Following completion of the transaction, former shareholders of the Company will collectively own approximately 14 of the combined company. The implied total transaction value based on closing prices on July 27, 2021was approximately 3.5 billion. The agreement and plan of merger has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each company. On November 19, 2021, Investors shareholders approved the planned merger with Citizens at a special meeting. Citizens and Investors are targeting a transaction close in the second quarter of 2022, subject to the receipt of required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. 
 COVID-19 Pandemic 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic dislocation in the United States. Since March 2020, many state and local governments, including New Jersey, have from time to time ordered non-essential businesses to close and residents to shelter in place at home, or placed other restrictions on businesses and individuals, resulting in a slow-down in economic activity and increases in unemployment. Certain industries have been particularly hard-hit, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Federal Reserve reduced the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range of 0 to 0.25 , and the yields on 10 and 30-year treasury notes declined to historic lows. Various state governments and federal agencies required lenders to provide forbearance and other relief to borrowers (e.g., waiving late payment and other fees). From time to time, the spread of the coronavirus has caused us to modify our business practices, including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. Government actions and business practices continue to evolve in response to the advent of COVID-19 variants. 
 We continue to monitor developments related to COVID-19, including, but not limited to, its impact on our employees, customers, communities and results of operations. All of our branches have normal operating hours and all lobbies have re-opened for our clients. In addition, the majority of our corporate workforce has returned to our corporate offices in some capacity while the remainder continue to work remotely in an effective manner. Proper protocols have been put in place in our branches and corporate offices to ensure the continued safety of our employees and customers and compliance with current regulations. 
 As a result of the pandemic, certain borrowers were unable to meet their contractual payment obligations. While we have continued to support our customers by granting payment deferrals in 2020 and 2021 for those experiencing continued hardship because of the pandemic, we have also worked diligently with our customers to ensure a return to current payment status. As of December 31, 2021, COVID-19 Cares Act related loan payment deferrals decreased to 279 million, or 1.2 of loans, compared to 790.0 million, or 3.8 of loans as of December 31, 2020. All the commercial deferments under the Cares Act are scheduled to expire in the first quarter of 2022. As of February 8, 2022, residential and consumer loans deferring principal and interest payments under the Cares Act totaled 4.5 million. 
 At the onset of the pandemic we offered increased mobile deposit limits and increased customer support through our call center and bankers to further support our customers. Our continued focus on digital transformation and implementation of online account opening has also benefited our customers. During 2020 we participated in government-sponsored programs including PPP and Main Street Lending, originating approximately 335 million of PPP loans and subsequently sold the majority of these loans to a well-established SBA lender that could continue to assist our customers in the forgiveness process.

 We will continue to support our customers as necessary, to ensure they are able to participate in government-sponsored economic relief programs. 
 
 Our Business Strategy 
 Since the Company s initial public offering in 2005, we have transitioned from a wholesale thrift business to a retail commercial bank. This transition has been primarily accomplished by increasing the amount of our commercial loans and core deposits (savings, checking and money market accounts). Our transformation can be attributed to a number of factors, including organic growth, de novo branch openings, bank and branch acquisitions, as well as product expansion. We believe the attractive markets we operate in, namely, New Jersey and the greater New York metropolitan area, will continue to provide us with growth opportunities. In addition, the Bank has national exposure through our Investors eAccess online deposit platform and our equipment finance, healthcare and leveraged lending portfolios. Our primary focus is to build and develop profitable customer relationships across all lines of business, both consumer and commercial. 
 Opportunities through Our Attractive Markets 
 The primary markets in which we have a retail presence are considered attractive banking markets within the United States, and we believe they will continue to provide us with opportunities to grow. In addition to our strong presence in our historic markets throughout New Jersey, we have expanded our retail franchise to include the suburbs of Philadelphia and the boroughs of New York City as well as Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island. With the August 2021 acquisition of eight branches from Berkshire Bank, we have expanded our branch footprint into Pennsylvania. We accomplished this expansion through de novo growth and select bank and branch acquisitions. As a result of this growth, the Bank is one of the largest banks headquartered in the state of New Jersey as measured by New Jersey deposits as of June 30, 2021. The markets in which we operate are desirable from an economic and demographic perspective as they are characterized by large and dense population centers, areas of high income households and centers of robust business and commercial activity. Our competition in these markets tends to be from out-of-state headquartered money centers and super-regional financial institutions as well as smaller, local community banks. We believe that as a locally headquartered institution, situated between these extremes, we can compete and capitalize on opportunities that exist in our market area. We also examine our branch network to optimize our market presence, which may include branch rationalization plans. 
 Many of the counties we serve are projected to experience moderate to strong household income growth through 2027. Though slower population growth is projected for many of the counties we serve, it is important to note that these counties are densely populated. All of the counties we serve have a strong mature market and nearly all have median household incomes greater than the national median. 
 We face intense competition in making loans as well as attracting deposits in our market area. Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, insurance companies and new technology-driven market entrants. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms and mutual funds. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as trust services and private banking. As of June 30, 2021, the latest date for which statistics are available, our market share of deposits was ranked in the top 10 of total deposits in the State of New Jersey and in the top 20 within the New York metropolitan area for all institutions. 
 Diversifying the Loan Portfolio 
 To further diversify our loan portfolio, we have increased C I lending by building relationships with small to medium sized companies. In recent years, we have hired a number of experienced C I lending teams, including a team specializing in the healthcare industry, and in 2018, we acquired an equipment finance team and portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we originated 1.26 billion in C I loans. A significant portion of our C I loans are secured by commercial real estate and are primarily on properties and businesses located in New Jersey and New York. In addition, we have national exposure through our equipment finance, healthcare and leveraged lending portfolios. Our Equipment Finance Group originates equipment finance loans and leases which are primarily secured by critical use assets. We have diversified our loan portfolio, as evidenced by the fact that C I loans represent approximately 18.2 of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2017, when C I loans were approximately 8 of total loans. We have been focused on diversifying our loan portfolio which has been a focus of our business strategy, however, we are mindful of concentrations as it pertains to capital.

 Deposit Strategy 
 We are focused on generating relationship-based core deposits (savings, checking and money market accounts). As of December 31, 2021, we had core deposits of 18.73 billion, representing approximately 89.9 of total deposits. Core deposits are an attractive funding alternative because they are generally a more stable source of low cost funding and are less sensitive to changes in market interest rates. The percent of non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits has grown to 22.4 at December 31, 2021. Despite intense competition for deposits, we continue to pursue a customer-centric model to meeting their financial needs and continue to invest in branch staff training, product development, de novo branch growth based on existing market presence and acquired branches, as well as commercial deposit gathering efforts. Over the past few years we have developed a suite of commercial deposit and treasury management products, designed to appeal to small and mid-sized businesses and non-profit organizations including electronic deposit services such as mobile and remote deposit capture. 
 Our deposit business has become more commercial oriented over the past few years as we attract more deposits from commercial entities, including businesses that borrow from us. The Bank is one of the largest depositories for government and municipal deposits in New Jersey, which provides us with an additional funding source. Government and municipal deposits were 27.2 of our total deposits at December 31, 2021. Our branch network, concentrated in markets with attractive demographics and a high-density population, provide us with opportunities to grow and improve our deposit base. 
 
 Digital Capabilities and Strategy 
 In addition to our branch network, we offer online banking capabilities for consumers and small businesses. We are always looking to enhance our mobile and online banking services which allow us to serve our customers needs in an omnichannel environment. We offer account opening capabilities on our website and also offer online-exclusive deposit accounts through Investors eAccess, a secure online channel to attract consumer deposits nationwide. Other capabilities include Zelle for real-time person to person payments, the ability to view personal credit scores, and online alerts. For our commercial customers, we have Small Business Online Banking and Commercial Online Banking, including robust online treasury management services. We continue to enhance our digital capabilities as a way to enhance the customer experience and deliver our products and services in a safe and secure manner. 
 
 Acquisitions 
 A significant portion of our historic growth can be attributed to our acquisition strategy. Although management evaluates a number of factors when considering an acquisition, we have maintained a fundamental focus on preserving tangible book value per share. Acquisitions have provided us with the opportunity to grow our business, expand our geographic footprint and improve our financial performance. 
 On August 27, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of eight New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania branches of Berkshire Bank, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc. pursuant to the definitive purchase and assumption agreement dated as of December 2, 2020 by and between the Company and Berkshire Bank. The acquisition included the assumption and acquisition of 632 million of deposits and 219 million of consumer and commercial loans, together with the related operations. The Company assumed a net liability of 413.0 million and received consideration of 391.3 million from Berkshire Bank. 
 On April 3, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Gold Coast Bancorp, Inc. Gold Coast Bancorp under which we acquired Gold Coast Bancorp. The acquisition included six branches in Nassau and Suffolk counties in suburban Long Island and one branch in Brooklyn, NY, as well as total assets of 535.3 million and deposits of 489.9 million. 
 
 Capital Management 
 Capital management is a key component of our business strategy. As of December 31, 2021, our tangible equity to asset ratio was 10.14 . We continue to manage our capital through a combination of organic growth, stock repurchases, dividends and acquisitions. Effective capital management and prudent growth allows us to effectively leverage our capital, while being mindful of tangible book value for stockholders. Since March 2015, we have repurchased 130.5 million shares totaling 1.58 billion at an average price per share of 12.08. 
 We have paid continuous quarterly dividends since September 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our dividend payout ratio per share was approximately 42 . We have recently increased our quarterly dividend to 0.16 per share. 
 
 Involvement in Our Communities 
 The Bank proudly promotes a higher quality of life in the communities it serves in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania through employee volunteer efforts and our Charitable Foundations. Employees are continually encouraged to become leaders in their communities and use the Bank s support to help others. Through the Investors Charitable Foundation, established in 2005, and the Roma Charitable Foundation, which we acquired in December 2013, the Bank has contributed or

Table of Contents 

 committed 47.9 million in donations to enrich the lives of New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania citizens by supporting initiatives in the arts, education, youth development, affordable housing, financial education, and health and human services. 
 Community involvement is one of the principal values of the Bank and provides our staff with a meaningful ability to help others. We believe these efforts contribute to creating a culture at the Bank that promotes high employee morale while enhancing the presence of the Bank in our local markets. We always look for opportunities to help the communities we serve. 
 
 Lending Activities 
 Our loan portfolio is comprised of multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans, C I loans, construction loans, residential mortgage loans and consumer and other loans. At December 31, 2021, multi-family loans totaled 7.87 billion, or 34.8 of our total loan portfolio, commercial real estate loans totaled 5.37 billion, or 23.8 of our total loan portfolio, C I loans totaled 4.11 billion, or 18.2 of our total loan portfolio, and construction loans totaled 551.0 million, or 2.4 of our total loan portfolio. Residential mortgage loans represented 3.93 billion, or 17.4 of our total loans at December 31, 2021. We also offer consumer loans, which consist primarily of cash surrender value lending on life insurance contracts, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. At December 31, 2021, consumer and other loans totaled 766.8 million, or 3.4 of our total loan portfolio. 
 Net loans increased 1.76 billion from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, which was driven by an increase in multi-family, C I, commercial real estate and construction loans of 742.8 million, 538.2 million and 424.5 million and 146.6 million respectively.

 Multi-family Loans. At December 31, 2021, 7.87 billion, or 34.8 , of our total loan portfolio was comprised of multi-family loans. Our policy generally has been to originate multi-family loans in New York, New Jersey and surrounding states, which represent approximately 98 of total multi-family loans at December 31, 2021. The multi-family loans in our portfolio consist of both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, which were originated at prevailing market rates. Multi-family loans are generally five to fifteen year term balloon loans amortized over fifteen to thirty years. 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans . At December 31, 2021, 5.37 billion, or 23.8 , of our total loan portfolio was commercial real estate loans. We originate commercial real estate loans which are generally secured by industrial properties, retail buildings, office buildings and other commercial properties. As of December 31, 2021, commercial real estate loans in New Jersey, New York and surrounding states represent approximately 90 of our commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans in our portfolio consist of both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans which were originated at prevailing market rates. Commercial real estate loans are generally five to fifteen year term balloon loans amortized over fifteen to thirty years.

 Commercial and Industrial Loans. At December 31, 2021, 4.11 billion, or 18.2 , of our total loan portfolio were classified as C I loans. We offer a wide range of credit facilities to C I clients throughout our geographic footprint and nationally. Our credit offerings are lines of credit, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate term loans, lease financing and letters of credit. A significant portion of our C I loans are secured by commercial real estate and are primarily properties and businesses located in New Jersey and New York. Other collateral for these types of loans can be comprised of real estate, equipment and/or a lien on the general assets, including inventory and receivables of the underlying business, and in many cases are further supported by a personal guarantee of the owner. Our product offerings include certain C I lending subspecialties that originate loans both locally and nationally, including leveraged lending, healthcare lending and equipment finance. Our equipment finance portfolio totaled 1.06 billion, or 25.8 of our C I portfolio at December 31, 2021 and has grown substantially from the 345.8 million portfolio acquired in February 2018. Our equipment finance portfolio, comprised of both loans and leases throughout the U.S., is primarily secured by critical use assets. At December 31, 2021, approximately 33 of our C I loans were to borrowers outside of New Jersey and New York. 
 Construction Loans. At December 31, 2021, we held 551.0 million in construction loans representing 2.4 of our total loan portfolio. We offer loans directly to owners and developers on income-producing properties and residential for-sale housing units. Generally, construction loans are structured to have a three-year term and are made in amounts of up to 70 of the appraised value of the completed property, or a maximum up to the cost of the improvements. Funds are disbursed based on inspections in accordance with a schedule reflecting the completion of portions of the project. Construction financing for units to be sold require a pre-sale contract or we will limit the amount of speculative building without a sales contract. 
 Residential Mortgage Loans. At December 31, 2021, 3.93 billion, or 17.4 , of our loan portfolio consisted of residential mortgage loans. We originate residential mortgage loans for our loan portfolio and for sale to third parties. During 2021, we also purchased mortgage loans from correspondent entities including other banks and mortgage brokers. Our agreements call for these correspondent entities to originate loans that adhere to our underwriting standards and we generally acquire the loans with servicing rights. 
 We offer various loan programs to provide financing for low-and moderate-income home buyers, some of which include down payment assistance for home purchases. Through these programs, qualified individuals receive a reduced rate of interest on most of our loan programs and have their application fee refunded at closing, as well as other incentives if certain conditions are met. 
 Consumer and Other Loans. At December 31, 2021, consumer loans totaled 766.8 million, or 3.4 of our total loan portfolio. We offer consumer loans, most of which consist of cash surrender value lending on life insurance contracts, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. At December 31, 2021, cash surrender value loans totaled 490.8 million, or 64 of consumer and other loans. Acceptable credit history and FICO scores are reviewed along with the evaluation of the financial rating of the insurance carrier. Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit are secured by residences primarily located in New Jersey and New York. Home equity loans are generally offered with fixed rates of interest, with terms generally up to 20 years and to a maximum of 750,000. Home equity lines of credit generally have adjustable rates of interest, indexed to the prime rate.

 Credit Policy and Procedures 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. The credit approval process provides for prompt and thorough underwriting and approval or decline of loan requests. The approval method used is a hierarchy of individual credit authorities for new credit requests and renewals according to the Bank s credit policies. All commercial credit actions require a total of two signatures, one from the Bank s business line and one from the Bank s credit risk management group. Transactions exceeding certain thresholds are submitted to the Bank s Credit Approval Committee for decision. Consumer and small business transactions are underwritten according to guidelines and policy approved by the Credit Risk Committee. Any exceptions are approved by a credit risk officer. Our credit authority standards and limits are reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors (the Board ). Approval limits are established on criteria such as the risk associated with each credit action, amount, and aggregate credit exposure of a borrower. While the Bank s Board has delegated credit authority and the responsibility to approve authorities for lending and credit personnel to the Chief Credit Officer, the Board regularly monitors credit authority. Credit authorities are based on position, capability, and experience of the individuals.

 Loans to One Borrower. With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower or to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15 of the Bank s capital funds. As of December 31, 2021, our regulatory lending limit was 410.9 million. We may lend an additional 10 of the Bank s capital funds if secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act. The Bank s internal policy limit is 200.0 million, with exceptions to this policy communicated to the Board. The Bank reviews these group exposures on a regular basis. The Bank also sets additional limits on size of loans by loan type. At December 31, 2021, there were no relationships that exceeded the internal limit. 
 Asset Quality. One of our key operating objectives has been, and continues to be, maintaining a high level of asset quality. We maintain sound credit standards for new loan originations and purchases. We do not originate sub-prime loans, negative amortization loans or option ARM loans. Our portfolio contains interest-only and no income verification residential mortgage loans. We have not originated residential mortgage loans without verifying income in recent years. At December 31, 2021, these loans totaled 81.3 million. At December 31, 2021, interest-only residential and consumer loans totaled 20.0 million, which represented less than 1 of the residential and consumer portfolio. Although it is not a standard product offering for commercial real estate and multi-family loans, we originate interest-only in addition to amortizing loans in these segments. At December 31, 2021, interest-only loans in these segments totaled 2.56 billion. As part of our underwriting, these loans are evaluated as fully amortizing for risk classification purposes, with the interest-only period generally ranging from one to ten years. In addition, we evaluate our policy limits on a regular basis. We believe these criteria adequately control the potential risks of such loans and that adequate provisions for loan losses are provided for all known and inherent risks. At the request of commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty resulting from the pandemic, we temporarily deferred the payment of principal and/or interest for an agreed-upon period of time. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 267 million of commercial loans not included in the amount of interest-only loans disclosed in this section. 
 For leases, the Company records a residual value of the equipment based on an estimate of the equipment s value at the end of the lease. On at least an annual basis, the Company reviews the residual values of leased assets and assets off-lease and recognizes an impairment charge if the equipment s current market value has declined below the estimated value. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an impairment charge of 2.6 million as the fair value of certain equipment decreased at a rate greater than originally projected. An additional impairment charge of 2.2 million was recorded on the same equipment class during the year ended December 31, 2020 given the extended downturn in the market for these assets. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized an impairment charge of 150,000 on the value of equipment coming off lease. The Company subsequently sold the equipment in 2021 resulting in the realization of a nominal gain in non-interest income. 
 The underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio is dependent primarily on each borrower s continued ability to make required loan payments and, in the event a borrower is unable to do so, is dependent on the value of the collateral securing the loan, if any. A borrower s ability to pay is typically dependent on employment and other sources of income in the case of one-to four-family mortgage loans and consumer loans. In the case of multi-family and commercial real estate loans, repayment is dependent on the cash flow generated by the property; in the case of C I loans, on the cash flows generated by the business, which in turn is impacted by general economic conditions. Other factors, such as unanticipated expenditures or changes in interest rates or the financial markets, may also impact a borrower s ability to pay. Collateral values, particularly real estate values, may also be impacted by a variety of factors including general economic conditions, demographics, interest rates, maintenance and collection or foreclosure delays, including delays resulting from local, state and federal laws.

 Loan Deferrals. While we have continued to support our customers by granting payment deferrals for those experiencing continued hardship because of the pandemic, we have also worked diligently with our customers to ensure a return to current payment status for a significant portion of our clients who have ended their initial deferral period. At May 4, 2020, loans with an aggregated outstanding balance of 4.3 billion, or 20.1 of total loans, were in COVID-19 related deferment. Since then, customers representing approximately 4.0 billion in loan balances have ended their COVID-19 related deferrals and as of December 31, 2021, loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of approximately 279 million, or 1.2 of total loans, were in COVID-19 related deferment. 
 The following table presents the balance of deferred loans in the Company s loan portfolio by loan segment, industry sector and type of deferral as of December 31, 2021.

 Given the continually evolving economic and social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the future direct and indirect impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition are highly uncertain. Should economic conditions deteriorate, the macroeconomic environment may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including loan modification, delinquent loans and non-accrual loans. For more information on how the risks related to COVID-19 may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors herein. 
 Purchased Financial Assets with Credit Deterioration - Loans. Loans purchased with credit deterioration PCD loans are loans acquired that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. PCD loans are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Subtopic 326-20 and are initially recorded at fair value with an allowance recognized on acquisition through a gross-up that increases the amortized cost basis of the asset with no effect on net income. As of December 31, 2021, PCD loans totaled 276.9 million as compared with 238.0 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company acquired PCD loans with a par value of 94.8 million and an allowance for credit losses of 1.0 million in the Berkshire Bank branch acquisition on August 27, 2021. The Company acquired PCD loans with a par value of 251.5 million and an allowance for credit losses of 4.2 million in its acquisition of Gold Coast on April 3, 2020.

 Non-Performing Assets. Non-performing assets include loans delinquent 90 days or more, non-accrual loans, performing troubled debt restructurings, real estate owned and other repossessed assets. Loans are classified as non-accrual when they are delinquent 90 days or more or if management has specific information that it is probable they will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We did not have any loans delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Non-accrual loans decreased by 1.9 million to 105.2 million at December 31, 2021 from 107.1 million at December 31, 2020. Included in the amount of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2021 were 1.1 million of C I loans, 1.2 million of commercial real estate loans and 850,000 of multi-family loans that were classified as non-accrual which were performing in accordance with their contractual terms. Included in the amount of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2020 were 4.8 million of commercial real estate loans, 3.7 million of commercial and industrial loans and 1.5 million of multi-family loans that were classified as non-accrual which were performing in accordance with their contractual terms. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold three non-performing multi-family loans totaling 19.9 million and recognized a recovery of 1.4 million in the allowance for credit losses on the sale of one of the loans. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we also sold two non-performing commercial real estate loans totaling 1.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold a non-performing multi-family loan with a net book balance of 18.1 million. The Company recognized a recovery of 1.9 million in the allowance for credit losses on the sale.

 The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans decreased to 0.47 at December 31, 2021 from 0.51 at December 31, 2020. Our ratio of non-performing assets to total assets decreased to 0.42 at December 31, 2021 from 0.47 at December 31, 2020. The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total non-accrual loans decreased to 228.82 at December 31, 2021 from 264.17 at December 31, 2020. For further discussion of our non-performing assets and non-performing loans and the allowance for credit losses, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5, Loans Receivable, Net, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets at the dates indicated. 
 
 December 31, 2021 2020 (Dollars in thousands) Non-accrual loans: Multi-family loans 55,276 35,567 Commercial real estate loans 8,269 15,894 Commercial and industrial loans 3,329 9,212 Construction loans Total commercial loans 66,874 60,673 Residential mortgage loans 37,170 43,958 Consumer and other loans 1,140 2,494 Total non-accrual loans 105,184 107,125 Real estate owned and other repossessed assets 2,882 7,115 Performing troubled debt restructurings 7,565 9,232 Total non-performing assets 115,631 123,472 Total non-accrual loans to total loans 0.47 0.51 Total non-performing assets to total assets 0.42 0.47 
 
 The increase in Multi-family non-accrual loans for the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by a previously disclosed Multi-family potential problem loan that was restructured and classified as a troubled debt restructuring. The borrower is performing in accordance with its modified terms. 
 
 Other Real Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets. Real estate and other assets we acquire as a result of foreclosure, by deed in lieu of foreclosure or repossession are classified as other real estate owned and other repossessed assets until sold. When property is acquired it is recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure or repossession less estimated costs to sell the property. Holding costs and declines in fair value result in charges to expense after acquisition. At December 31, 2021, we had other real estate owned of 1.2 million, consisting of 6 residential properties and other repossessed assets of 1.7 million, consisting of 34 pieces of industrial equipment. 
 Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide that loans and other assets of lesser quality should be classified as substandard, doubtful or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. An asset classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable. An asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance on the institution s books as an asset, without the establishment of a specific valuation allowance or charge-off, is not warranted. We classify an asset as special mention if the asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution s credit position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. See Note 5, Loans Receivable, Net, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. 
 We are required to establish an allowance for credit losses on loans in an amount that management considers prudent for loans classified substandard or doubtful, as well as for other problem loans. Expected losses are evaluated and calculated on a collective basis for those loans which share similar risk characteristics. Loans which do not share risk characteristics with other loans are evaluated for an allowance on an individual basis. When we classify problem assets as loss, we are required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100 of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount.

Table of Contents 

 Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the NJDOBI and the FDIC, which can require that we establish additional loss allowances. 
 We review the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Not all classified assets constitute non-performing assets. 
 Individually Evaluated Loans. A loan is individually evaluated when it is a collateral dependent commercial loan with an outstanding balance greater than 1.0 million and on non-accrual status, a loan modified in a troubled debt restructuring, or is a commercial loan with 1.0 million in outstanding principal if management has specific information that it is probable they will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When the Company determines that the loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics of other loans in the portfolio, the allowance will be determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected cash flows or, for loans secured by real estate, the fair value of the collateral as of the reporting date, less estimated selling costs, as applicable, to ensure that the credit loss is not delayed until actual loss. A collateral dependent loan is a loan for which repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the amortized cost basis of the loan, the Company will charge off the difference between the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell at the reporting date and the amortized cost basis of the loan. Smaller balance loans are evaluated collectively unless they are modified in a TDR. Such loans include residential mortgage loans, consumer loans, and loans not meeting the Company s criteria for individual evaluation. At December 31, 2021, loans meeting the requirements to be individually evaluated totaled 74.6 million. For further detail on individually evaluated loans, see Note 1 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans 
 On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the CECL methodology. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 using a modified retrospective approach. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Principles, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the allowance for credit losses on loans was a contra-asset valuation account established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represented management s best estimate of inherent losses that had been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance for credit losses on loans included allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 310, Receivables and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies. 
 A description of our methodology in establishing our allowance for credit losses is set forth in the section Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses. 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses inherent in financial assets at the balance sheet date. For the year ended December 31, 2021 our allowance was impacted by improving economic and commercial real estate conditions and forecasts. The following table presents credit ratios, along with the components of their calculation, for the dates indicated.

 Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. The following table sets forth the allowance for credit losses on loans allocated by loan category and the percent of loans in each category to total loans at the dates indicated. The allowance for credit losses allocated to each category is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses inherent in any particular category as of the balance sheet date and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories.

 The allowance for credit losses on loans as of December 31, 2021 is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in loans at the balance sheet date. However, this analysis process involves a high degree of judgment due to the subjectivity of assumptions used and the potential for changes in the forecasted economic environment. Although we believe we have established and maintained the allowance for credit losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if the future economic environment deteriorates from forecasted conditions. 
 As an integral part of their examination processes, the NJDOBI and the FDIC will periodically review our allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. 
 Securities 
 The Board has adopted our Investment Policy. This policy determines the types of securities in which we may invest. The Investment Policy is reviewed annually by management and changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to approval by the Board. The Board delegates operational responsibility for the implementation of the Investment Policy to the 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 Asset Liability Committee, which is primarily comprised of senior officers. While general investment strategies are developed by the Asset Liability Committee, the execution of specific actions rests primarily with our Treasurer. The Treasurer is responsible for ensuring the guidelines and requirements included in the Investment Policy are followed and all securities are considered prudent for investment. Investment transactions are reviewed and ratified by the Board at their regularly scheduled meetings. 
 Our Investment Policy requires that investment transactions conform to Federal and State investment regulations. Our investments purchased may include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury obligations, securities issued by various Federal Agencies, State and Municipal subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions, overnight and short-term loans to other banks, corporate debt instruments, and mutual funds. In addition, the Company may invest in equity securities subject to certain limitations. 
 The Investment Policy requires that securities transactions be conducted in a safe and sound manner. Purchase and sale decisions are based upon a thorough pre-transaction analysis of each instrument to determine if it conforms to our overall asset/liability management objectives. The analysis must consider its effect on our risk-based capital measurement, prospects for yield and/or appreciation and other risk factors. 
 In December 2013, regulatory agencies adopted a rule on the treatment of certain collateralized debt obligations backed by trust preferred securities as covered funds under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), known as the Volcker Rule. At December 31, 2021, none of our securities were deemed to be a covered fund under the Volcker Rule. 
 On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, which requires the measurement of expected credit losses for financial assets, including debt securities. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Principles, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. 
 At December 31, 2021, our securities portfolio totaled 4.00 billion representing 14.4 of our total assets. At December 31, 2021, equity securities reported at fair value totaled 8.2 million. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale when purchased. At December 31, 2021, 1.59 billion of our debt securities were classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost less allowance for credit losses and 2.39 billion were classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. 
 Mortgage-Backed Securities. We purchase mortgage-backed pass through and collateralized mortgage obligation CMO securities insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac (government-sponsored enterprises) and Ginnie Mae (government agency), and to a lesser extent, a variety of federal and state housing authorities (collectively referred to below as agency-issued mortgage-backed securities ). At December 31, 2021, agency-issued mortgage-backed securities including CMOs, totaled 3.51 billion, or 87.8 , of our total securities portfolio. 
 Actual cash flows on mortgage-backed securities may differ from estimated cash flows over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments that can change the yield on such securities. There is reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities. The fair value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates and/or other market variables. 
 Our mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a weighted average yield of 1.71 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The estimated fair value of our mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2021 was 3.52 billion, which is 28.2 million more than the carrying value. At December 31, 2021, we had no allowance for credit losses on mortgage-backed securities. 
 We also may invest in securities issued by non-agency or private mortgage originators, provided those securities are rated AAA by nationally recognized rating agencies and satisfactorily pass an internal credit review at the time of purchase. Currently, the Company does not hold any non-agency mortgage-backed securities in its portfolio. 
 Corporate and Other Debt Securities. Our corporate and other debt securities portfolio primarily consists of subordinated debt issued by other financial institutions. In addition, our corporate and other debt securities portfolio contains collateralized debt obligations CDOs backed by pooled trust preferred securities TruPS ), principally issued by banks and to a lesser extent insurance companies and real estate investment trusts. These securities have been classified in the held-to-maturity portfolio since their purchase. At December 31, 2021, corporate and other debt securities totaled 128.2 million, or 3.2 , of our total securities portfolio. 
 At December 31, 2021, the TruPS portfolio had a carrying value of 50.6 million, or 1.3 of our total securities portfolio, and a fair value of 83.1 million. None of the TruPS were in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2021. Throughout the year we engage an independent valuation firm to assist us in valuing our TruPS portfolio. As a result of the 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, our TruPS and other held-to-maturity debt securities are evaluated for expected credit losses. At December 31, 2021, our allowance for credit losses on corporate and other debt securities was 1.8 million. Prior to January 1, 2020, an other-than temporary impairment OTTI analysis was performed. We did not recognize any OTTI charges for the year ended December 31, 2019. We continue to closely monitor the performance of our CDO portfolio. 
 Municipal Bonds . At December 31, 2021, we had 214.3 million in municipal bonds which represents 5.3 of our total securities portfolio. These bonds are comprised of 30.7 million in short-term Bond Anticipation or Tax Anticipation notes and 183.6 million of longer term bonds. At December 31, 2021, our allowance for credit losses on municipal bonds was 22,000. 
 Government Sponsored Enterprises. At December 31, 2021, debt securities issued by Government Sponsored Enterprises held in our security portfolio totaled 136.7 million representing 3.4 of our total securities portfolio. At December 31, 2021, we had no allowance for credit losses on debt securities issued by Government Sponsored Enterprises. 
 Equity Securities. At December 31, 2021, the fair value of equity securities was 8.2 million, representing 0.2 of our total securities portfolio. Equity securities are not insured or guaranteed investments and are affected by market interest rates and other factors. Such investments are carried at their fair value with fluctuations in the fair value of such investments reflected in the consolidated income statement.

 Sources of Funds 
 General. Deposits are the primary source of funds used for our lending and investment activities. Our primary strategy is to grow the balance of core deposits (savings, checking and money market accounts) to fund these activities. In addition, we use borrowings, primarily advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLB ), to supplement cash flow needs, and to manage the duration of our liabilities and our cost of funds. Additional sources of funds include principal and interest payments from loans and securities, prepayments and maturities of loans and securities, repurchase agreements, brokered deposits, income on other earning assets and retained earnings. Cash flows from deposits, loans and securities can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. 
 Deposits. At December 31, 2021, we held 20.82 billion in total deposits, representing 83.7 of our total liabilities. Our long-term deposit strategy has been focused on attracting core deposits (savings, checking and money market accounts). At December 31, 2021, we held 18.73 billion in core deposits, representing 89.9 of total deposits. At December 31, 2021, 2.09 billion, or 10.1 , of our total deposit balances were certificates of deposit. Municipal deposits are a significant source of funds for the Company. At December 31, 2021, 5.66 billion, or 27.2 , of our total deposits consisted of public fund deposits from local government entities, predominately domiciled in the state of New Jersey and the majority of which are interest bearing. Municipal deposits are collateralized using municipal letters of credit or securities collateral. Included in total deposits are 734.4 million of brokered deposits. During 2021, deposits increased by 1.30 billion, or 6.7 primarily driven by an increase in checking account deposits, partially offset by decreases in certificates of deposits and money market deposits. 
 We have a suite of commercial deposit products, designed to appeal to small and mid-sized businesses and non-profit organizations. Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are all reviewed on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on our current operating strategies, market rates, liquidity requirements and competitive forces. We also rely on personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers and an active marketing program to attract and retain deposits. 
 The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market rates and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts we offer allows us to respond to changes in consumer demands and to be competitive in obtaining deposit funds. Our ability to attract and maintain deposits and the rates we pay on deposits will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. 
 We continue to invest in technology platforms and branch staff training, de novo and acquired branches, and to aggressively market and advertise our core deposit products and will attempt to generate our deposits from a diverse client group within our primary market area. We remain focused on attracting and maintaining deposits from consumers, businesses and municipalities which operate in our marketplace. The Bank also utilizes Investors eAccess, a secure online channel, to attract deposits nationwide.

 we are willing to assume. The Board receives reports on the management of critical risks and the effectiveness of risk management systems. While our full Board maintains the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, its committees, including Audit, Risk Oversight and Compensation and Benefits committees, oversee risk in certain specified areas. The Risk Oversight Committee of the Board meets quarterly and provides independent oversight of all risk functions. Our Board has assigned responsibility to our Chief Risk Officer for maintaining the Enterprise Risk Management ERM framework to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate risks in the execution of our strategic goals and objectives and ensure we operate in a safe and sound manner in accordance with the Board approved policies. 
 The Bank s Management Risk Committee meets regularly and provides governance over risk policy and risk escalation. The ERM framework supports a culture that promotes proactive risk management by all Bank employees, a risk appetite framework with defined risk tolerance limits, and risk governance with a three lines of defense model to manage and oversee risk. In a three lines of defense structure, each line of business and corporate function serves as the first line of defense and has responsibility for identifying, assessing, managing and mitigating risks in their areas. Independent Risk Management serves as the second line of defense and is responsible for providing guidance, oversight and appropriate challenge to the first line of defense. Internal Audit serves as the third line of defense and ensures that appropriate risk management controls, processes and systems are in place and functioning effectively. 
 Our ERM framework is consistent with common industry practices and regulatory guidance and is appropriate to our size, growth trajectory and the complexity of our business activities. The ERM Framework encompasses the following categories of risks; credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, price risk, operational risk, model risk, supplier risk, fraud risk, information security including cybersecurity, compliance risk, strategic risk, and reputational risk. 
 Human Capital Management 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,598 full-time employees and 101 part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

 Supervision and Regulation 
 The Bank is a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank, and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC under the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF ). The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Commissioner of the NJDOBI (the Commissioner as the issuer of its charter, and, as a non-member state chartered commercial bank, by the FDIC as the deposit insurer and its primary federal regulator. The Bank must file reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, and it must obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions and opening or acquiring branch offices. The Commissioner and the FDIC each conduct periodic examinations to assess the Bank s compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a commercial bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the DIF and its depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. 
 As a bank holding company controlling the Bank, the Company is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended BHCA ), and the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA and to the provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948 (the New Jersey Banking Act and the regulations of the Commissioner under the New Jersey Banking Act applicable to bank holding companies. 
 The regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks is intended to protect depositors, the DIF, and the U.S. banking system as a whole. This system is not designed to protect equity investors in bank holding companies. The Company is required to file reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of, the Federal Reserve Board, the Commissioner and the FDIC. The Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner conduct periodic examinations to assess the Company s compliance with various regulatory requirements. The Company files certain reports with, and otherwise complies with, the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws and the listing requirements of NASDAQ. 
 Our business is heavily regulated by both state and federal agencies. Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years, in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. In addition, on May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the EGRRCP Act was enacted. This legislation includes targeted amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act and other financial services laws. While there have been some changes to the post-financial crisis framework applicable to the Company, primarily relating to stress testing, the Company expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision. 
 Stress Tests 
 Prior to the enactment of the EGRRCP Act, the Dodd-Frank Act required banks with total consolidated assets of more than 10 billion to conduct annual stress tests. The Dodd-Frank Act also required the FDIC, in coordination with federal financial regulatory agencies, to issue regulations establishing methodologies for stress testing that provide for at least three different sets of conditions, including baseline, adverse, and severely adverse. The regulations also required banks to publish a summary of the results of the stress tests. The EGRRCP Act has eliminated the annual mandated stress test requirement for banks like us with total consolidated assets of less than 100 billion. 
 While we are no longer required to conduct annual stress tests, we have advised our regulators that we will continue to conduct stress testing of our loan portfolio and advise our Board and our regulators of the results of such testing. 
 Volcker Rule 
 Under the provisions of the Volcker Rule we are prohibited from: (i) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for our own account; and (ii) having certain ownership interest in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds. The final Volcker Rule regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities. The Company has put in place the compliance programs required by the Volcker Rule and has also implemented a governance and control program to ensure appropriate oversight and ongoing compliance. In 2019, the U.S. banking agencies adopted changes to the regulations implementing the Volcker Rule designed to establish a more risk-based approach to compliance and reduce the complexity of 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 the regulations. The changes were effective January 1, 2020. Regulatory changes to the Volcker Rule effective October 1, 2020, streamlined portions of the rule and loosened certain restrictions so that banks may engage in certain activities that the Volcker Rule was not intended to address. These regulatory changes resulted in no impact to the Company. 
 Consumer Protection and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Supervision 
 The Dodd-Frank Act also established the CFPB. The CFPB has rulemaking authority over all banks, and its examination and enforcement authority applies to banks with total assets of 10 billion or more. The Bank is subject to CFPB supervision and examination of compliance with Federal Consumer Protection Laws. In addition, this agency is responsible for interpreting and enforcing a broad range of consumer protection laws Federal Consumer Protection Laws that govern the provision of deposit accounts and the making of loans, including the regulation of mortgage lending and servicing. This includes laws such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and for state attorneys general to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the CFPB. The Company expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulations and supervision by the CFPB as well as applicable state consumer protection laws and regulations, which may result in continued increases in our operating and compliance costs. 
 New Jersey Banking Regulation 
 Activity Powers. The Bank derives its lending, investment and other powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and its related regulations. Under these laws and regulations, commercial banks, including the Bank, generally may invest in: 
 real estate mortgages; 
 consumer and commercial loans; 
 specific types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies; 
 certain types of corporate equity securities; and 
 certain other assets. 
 A commercial bank may also make investments pursuant to a leeway power, which permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act, subject to certain restrictions imposed by the FDIC. Leeway investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of leeway investments. A commercial bank may also exercise trust powers upon approval of the Commissioner. Lastly, New Jersey commercial banks may exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks or out-of-state banks or for federal or out-of-state commercial banks or savings associations, provided that before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege, prior approval by the Commissioner by regulation or by specific authorization is required. The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers are limited by federal law and the related regulations. See Federal Banking Regulation Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks below. 
 Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations. With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower or to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15 of the bank s capital funds. A commercial bank may lend an additional 10 of the bank s capital funds to a single borrower if the debt is secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act. The Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations. 
 Dividends. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a commercial bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the commercial bank. In addition, a commercial bank may not pay a dividend unless the commercial bank would, after the payment of the dividend, have a surplus of not less than 50 of its capital stock, or if not, the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus. Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. See Federal Banking Regulation Prompt Corrective Action below. 
 Minimum Capital Requirements. NJDOBI regulations impose minimum capital requirements on New Jersey-chartered depository institutions, including the Bank, similar to those imposed on insured state banks. See Federal Banking Regulation Capital Requirements below. 
 Examination and Enforcement. The NJDOBI may examine the Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable. The NJDOBI engages in routine annual examinations of the Bank. The Commissioner may order any commercial bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice, and may direct any director, officer, attorney or

 employee of a commercial bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Commissioner has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Commissioner why such person should not be removed. The Commissioner may also seek the appointment of a receiver or conservator for a New Jersey commercial bank under certain conditions. 
 Federal Banking Regulation 
 Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0 , a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0 , and a 4.0 Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. 
 Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI ), up to 45 of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). The Bank exercised its AOCI opt-out election. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0 is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50 is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four- family residential real estate loans, a risk weight of 100 is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150 is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0 to 600 is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 
 CECL Capital Implications . On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit loss to be based on the best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company s relevant financial asset. For more information, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Principles, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. On March 27, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. banking regulators issued an interim final rule that the Company adopted to delay for two years the initial adoption impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during 2020 and 2021 (i.e. a five-year transition period). During the two-year delay, the Company added back to common equity tier 1 capital CET1 100 of the initial adoption impact of CECL plus 25 of the cumulative quarterly changes in the allowance for credit losses (i.e., quarterly transitional amounts). Starting on January 1, 2022, the quarterly transitional amounts along with the initial adoption impact of CECL will be phased out of CET1 capital over the three-year period. 
 Paycheck Protection Program . On April 9, 2020, in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued an interim final rule that excludes loans pledged as collateral to the Federal Reserve s PPP Lending Facility from supplemental leverage ratio exposure, average total consolidated assets and Advanced and Standardized risk-weighted assets. Additionally, PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, will receive a zero percent risk weight under the Basel 3 Advanced and Standardized approaches regardless of whether they are pledged as collateral to the PPP Lending Facility. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, was enacted and included a reopening of the PPP. The majority of the Company s PPP loans were sold in the fourth quarter of 2020 with the remainder being forgiven by the Small Business Administration in the second quarter of 2021.

 Qualitative Capital Factors. In assessing an institution s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. 
 The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have also adopted regulations to require an assessment of an institution s exposure to declines in the economic value of a bank s capital due to changes in interest rates when assessing the bank s capital adequacy. Under such a risk assessment, examiners evaluate a bank s capital for interest rate risk on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors. Institutions with significant interest rate risk may be required to hold additional capital. According to the agencies, applicable considerations include: 
 the quality of the bank s interest rate risk management process; 
 the overall financial condition of the bank; and 
 the level of other risks at the bank for which capital is needed. 
 As of December 31, 2021, the Bank and the Company were considered well capitalized under applicable regulations and exceeded all regulatory capital requirements as follows:

 (2) Prompt corrective action provisions do not apply to the bank holding company. 
 Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks. Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC. 
 Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity. The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance funds. Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a financial subsidiary are subject to additional restrictions. 
 Federal law permits a state-chartered commercial bank to engage, through financial subsidiaries, in any activity in which a national bank may engage through a financial subsidiary and on substantially the same terms and conditions. In general, the law permits a national bank that is well-capitalized and well-managed to conduct, through a financial subsidiary, any activity permitted for a financial holding company other than insurance underwriting, insurance investments or real estate development or merchant banking. The total assets of all such financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45 of the bank s total assets or 50 billion. The bank must have policies and procedures to assess the financial subsidiary s risk and protect the bank from such risk and potential liability, must not consolidate the financial subsidiary s assets with the bank s and must exclude from its own assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in the financial subsidiary. State-chartered commercial banks may retain subsidiaries in existence as of March 11, 2000 and may engage in activities that 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 are not authorized under federal law. Although the Bank meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries, it has not chosen to engage in such activities. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which consists of the regional Federal Home Loan Banks, each subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency FHFA ). The Federal Home Loan Banks provide a credit facility for member institutions. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Banks make loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures, including collateral requirements, established by the respective Boards of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Banks. These policies and procedures are subject to the regulation and oversight of the FHFA. The FHFA has also established standards of community or investment service that members must meet to maintain access to such long-term advances. 
 Safety and Soundness Standards. Pursuant to the requirements of FDICIA, as amended by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, each federal banking agency, including the FDIC, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to matters such as internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal stockholder. 
 In addition, the FDIC adopted regulations to require a commercial bank that is given notice by the FDIC that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan to the FDIC. If, after being so notified, a commercial bank fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the FDIC may issue an order directing corrective and other actions of the types to which a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA. If a commercial bank fails to comply with such an order, the FDIC may seek to enforce such an order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties. 
 Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured commercial banks, including the Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and to unsafe or unsound practices. 
 Prompt Corrective Action. Federal law establishes a prompt corrective action framework to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. Those regulations were amended effective January 1, 2015 to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective on the same date. An institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5 or greater. An institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5 or greater. An institution is undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 4.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5 . An institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 3.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0 . An institution is considered to be critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0 . 
 Generally, a receiver or conservator must be appointed for an institution that is critically undercapitalized within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date a commercial bank receives notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. Various restrictions, such as restrictions on capital distributions and growth, also apply to undercapitalized institutions. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 
 The Bank was classified as well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework as of December 31, 2021. 
 Liquidity. The Bank maintains sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation, in accordance with FDIC regulations. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources.

 Deposit Insurance. The Bank is a member of the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC, up to a maximum of 250,000 for each separately insured depositor. 
 The FDIC assesses insured depository institutions to maintain the DIF. Under the FDIC s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions with 10 billion or more of assets are primarily based on a scorecard approach by the FDIC, including factors such as examination ratings, financial measures, and modeling measuring the institution s ability to withstand asset-related and funding-related stress and potential loss to the DIF in the event of the institution s failure. The assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments specified by the regulations) for institutions with total assets of more than 10 billion is 1.5 to 40 basis points. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We are not currently aware of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
 Transactions with Affiliates of Investors Bank. Transactions between an insured bank, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and implementing regulations. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. Generally, a subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution or financial subsidiary is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B. 
 Section 23A: 
 limits the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10 of such bank s capital and surplus, as defined in the applicable regulations. Such transactions with all affiliates are limited to an amount equal to 20 of such capital and surplus; and 
 requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. 
 The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions. Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 of the loan amounts. In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate. 
 Pursuant to Federal Reserve Board Regulation O, we are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their related interests. In general, such extensions of credit (i) may not exceed certain dollar limitations, (ii) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and (iii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Certain extensions of credit also require the approval of our Board. 
 Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Banks are subject to the prohibitions of 12 U.S.C. Section 1972 on certain tying arrangements. A depository institution is prohibited, subject to specific exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution. 
 Privacy Standards. FDIC regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares non-public personal information, to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. 
 The Bank is also required to provide its customers with the ability to opt-out of having the Bank share their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties before it can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions. 
 In addition, in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Bank must provide its customers with the ability to opt-out of having the Bank share their non-public personal information for marketing purposes with an affiliate or subsidiary before it can disclose such information. 
 The FDIC and other federal banking agencies adopted guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. The guidelines describe the agencies expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, which includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to

 the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. 
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All FDIC-insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act CRA and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income individuals and neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of a state chartered commercial bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution s record of compliance with the CRA. Among other things, the current CRA regulations rates an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs. In particular, the current evaluation system focuses on three tests: 
 a lending test, to evaluate the institution s record of making loans in its service areas; 
 an investment test, to evaluate the institution s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low- or moderate-income individuals and/or census tracts and businesses; and 
 a service test, to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices. 
 An institution s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities. The Bank received a satisfactory CRA rating in our most recent publicly-available federal evaluation, which was conducted by the FDIC in December 2020. 
 In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. 
 In December 2019, the FDIC, along with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the agency that regulates national banks, issued a proposed rule that would significantly amend the CRA regulations. In May 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency adopted a final rule amending its CRA regulations, which was later rescinded in December 2021. The FDIC has to date not finalized any revisions to the CRA rules or regulations. In September 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that seeks public comment on ways to modernize the Federal Reserve s CRA regulations. The effects on the Company and the Bank of any potential change to the CRA rules or regulations will depend on the final form of any federal rulemaking and cannot be predicted at this time. We will continue to evaluate any potential changes to the CRA rules or regulations and their impact on the Company s and the Bank s operations. 
 Loans to a Bank s Insiders 
 Federal Regulation. A bank s loans to its insiders executive officers, directors, principal shareholders (any owner of 10 or more of its stock) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such persons (an insider s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations. Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to the Bank. All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank s capital and surplus. Federal regulation also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider s related interests, would exceed either (1) 500,000 or (2) the greater of 25,000 or 5 of the bank s unimpaired capital and surplus. 
 Generally, loans to insiders must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons. An exception is made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank. 
 In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. 
 With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer s children and certain loans secured by the officer s residence, may not exceed the lesser of (1) 100,000 or (2) the greater of 25,000 or 2.5 of the bank s capital and surplus. 
 New Jersey Regulation. The New Jersey Banking Act imposes conditions and limitations on loans and extensions of credit to directors and executive officers of a commercial bank and to corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons, 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 which are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under federal law, as discussed above. The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a commercial bank that is in compliance with federal law is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act. 
 Federal Reserve System 
 Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, the Bank was required to maintain reserves against its transaction accounts. The requirements were adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board. Required reserves were maintained in the form of vault cash and/or an interest-bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank; or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve Board. Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero, effectively eliminating the requirements, due to a change in its approach to monetary policy. The Federal Reserve Board indicated that it has no plans to re-impose reserve requirements but could in the future if conditions warrant. 
 Anti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification 
 The Bank is subject to FDIC regulations implementing the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act. The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering AML requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act BSA ), Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act contains measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory and law enforcement agencies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. 
 Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act and the related FDIC regulations require the: 
 Establishment of AML compliance programs that includes policies, procedures, and internal controls; the appointment of an AML compliance officer; an effective training program; and independent testing; 
 Making of certain reports to FinCEN and law enforcement that are designated to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing activities; 
 Establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining and maintaining certain records from customers seeking to open new accounts, including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time; 
 Establishment of enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money-laundering, terrorist financing and other suspicious activity; 
 Monitoring account activity for suspicious transactions; and 
 Impose a heightened level of review for certain high risk customers or accounts. 
 The USA PATRIOT Act also includes prohibitions on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and requires compliance with record keeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks. Bank regulators are directed to consider a holding company s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on Federal Reserve Act and Bank Merger Act applications. 
 The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of the BSA and AML programs maintained by financial institutions. Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory orders may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements. In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies must consider the effectiveness of financial institutions engaging in a merger transaction in combating money laundering activities. The Bank has adopted policies and procedures to comply with these requirements. 
 Holding Company Regulation 
 Federal Regulation. Bank holding companies, including the Company, are subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. Federal Reserve Board regulations impose consolidated capital adequacy requirements on bank holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated regulatory capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. The Company is therefore subject to such capital requirements. 
 In addition, Federal Reserve Board guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with Federal Reserve Board staff in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 should inform the Federal Reserve Board and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if (i) net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. 
 A bank holding company is required to provide the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, would be equal to 10 or more of the company s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that is as well capitalized under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, that has received a composite 1 or 2 rating, as well as a satisfactory rating for management, at its most recent bank holding company examination by the Federal Reserve Board, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues. Notwithstanding that regulation, Federal Reserve Board guidance provides that bank holding companies should notify the Federal Reserve Board of any proposed redemption or repurchase of outstanding stock that will result in a net reduction in total shares outstanding over the quarter. The guidance indicates that such notification is to allow the Federal Reserve Board to review the proposed redemption or repurchase from a supervisory perspective and possibly object to the redemption or repurchase. 
 As a bank holding company, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval is also required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5 of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company. 
 In addition, a bank holding company that does not elect to be a financial holding company under federal regulations is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking are: 
 making or servicing loans; 
 performing certain data processing services; 
 providing discount brokerage services; or acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; 
 leasing personal or real property; and 
 making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare. 
 A bank holding company that elects to be a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident to activities which are financial in nature. The Company has not elected to be a financial holding company, although it may seek to do so in the future. A bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company if: 
 each of its depository institution subsidiaries is well capitalized 
 each of its depository institution subsidiaries is well managed 
 each of its depository institution subsidiaries has at least a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating at its most recent examination; and 
 the bank holding company has filed a certification with the Federal Reserve Board stating that it elects to become a financial holding company. 
 Under federal law, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution, or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default. This law would potentially be applicable to the Company if it ever acquired as a separate subsidiary a depository institution in addition to the Bank. 
 The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended by Section 613 of the Dodd-Frank Act, regulates interstate banking activities by establishing a framework for nationwide interstate banking and branching. As amended, this interstate banking and branching authority generally permits a bank in one state to establish a de novo branch at a location in another host state if state banks chartered in such host state would also be permitted to establish a branch at that location in the state. Under these amendments, the Bank is permitted to establish branch offices in other states in addition to its existing New Jersey and New York branch offices.

 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 eliminated most of the barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial companies previously imposed under federal banking laws if certain criteria are satisfied. Certain subsidiaries of well-capitalized and well-managed banks may be treated as financial subsidiaries, which are generally permitted to engage in activities that are financial in nature, including securities underwriting, dealing, and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. 
 New Jersey Regulation. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a bank is regulated as a bank holding company. The New Jersey Banking Act defines the terms company and bank holding company as such terms are defined under the BHCA. Each bank holding company controlling a New Jersey-chartered bank must file certain reports with the Commissioner and is subject to examination by the Commissioner. 
 Acquisition of Investors Bancorp, Inc. Under federal law and under the New Jersey Banking Act, no person may acquire control of the Company or the Bank without first obtaining approval of such acquisition of control by the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner. 
 Federal Securities Laws. The Company s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 The Company s common stock held by persons who are affiliates (generally officers, directors and principal stockholders) of the Company may not be resold without registration or unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. If the Company meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of the Company is able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 . The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted to address, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. 
 As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. We have existing policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations. 
 Taxation 
 Federal Taxation 
 General. The Company and its subsidiary are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The Company and its subsidiary file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company s federal tax returns are not currently under audit. 
 The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company or its subsidiary. 
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal and state income tax returns. 
 Bad Debt Reserves. Historically, the Bank was subject to special provisions in the tax law regarding allowable bad debt tax deductions and related reserves. Tax law changes were enacted in 1996 pursuant to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act ), which eliminated the use of the percentage of taxable income method for tax years after 1995 and required recapture into taxable income over a six-year period of all bad debt reserves accumulated after 1987. The Bank has fully recaptured its post-1987 reserve balance. Currently, the Bank uses the specific charge off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes. 
 Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 (pre-base year reserves) were subject to recapture into taxable income if the Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. As a result of the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves accumulated after 1987 are required to be recaptured into income over a six-year period. However, all pre-base year reserves are subject to recapture if the Bank makes certain non-dividend 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 distributions, repurchases any of its stock, pays dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits, or ceases to maintain a bank charter. At December 31, 2021, the Bank s total federal pre-base year reserve was approximately 45.2 million. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers. A corporation may carry forward net operating losses arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 indefinitely, subject to a deduction limitation of 80 of taxable income in a given year. However, net operating losses arising in tax years on or before December 31, 2017 are not subject to the 80 limitation deduction. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of 4.0 million related to prior acquisitions, arising in tax years prior to December 31, 2017. 
 Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction . The Company may exclude from its federal taxable income 100 of dividends received from the Bank as a wholly owned subsidiary. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 65 when the dividend is received from a corporation having at least 20 of its stock owned by the recipient corporation. A 50 dividends-received deduction is available for dividends received from a corporation having less than 20 of its stock owned by the recipient corporation. 
 State Taxation 
 New Jersey State Taxation. Generally, the income of corporations and savings institutions in New Jersey, which is calculated based on federal taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, and allocable to New Jersey is subject to New Jersey tax at a rate of 9.0 . On July 1, 2018, Assembly Bill 4202 A.4202 was signed into law, providing significant revisions to New Jersey s Corporation Business Tax laws. Among the changes provided for in the new legislation was a surtax, an additional imposition of tax, on corporate taxpayers that have allocated New Jersey net income in excess of 1 million. For tax years 2018 and 2019, the surtax rate imposed was 2.5 ; and for tax years 2020 and 2021, the surtax rate was to be 1.5 . On September 29, 2020, Assembly Bill 4721 was signed into law, extending and retroactively increasing the surtax rate to 2.5 through December 31, 2023. 
 In addition, A.4202 mandated combined reporting for tax years ending on or after July 31, 2019. In December 2019, a technical bulletin was issued by the State of New Jersey providing clarification on mandatory combined reporting, excluding investment companies and real estate investment trusts. One of the Company s indirect subsidiaries meets the definition of a real estate investment trust, and therefore is excluded from combined filing with the Company s other affiliates and is required to file a standalone return. 
 New York State Taxation. The New York State corporate franchise tax is based on the federal consolidated taxable income of the Company and its affiliates allocable and apportionable to New York State and taxed at a rate of 7.25 . The amount of revenues that are sourced to New York State can be expected to fluctuate over time. In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority MTA Surcharge allocable to business activities carried on in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District. The MTA surcharge for 2021 was 30.0 of a recomputed New York State franchise tax, calculated using a 7.25 tax rate on allocated and apportioned entire net income. The Company and its affiliates are currently under audit with respect to their New York State combined franchise tax return for tax years 2016 through 2018. 
 New York City Taxation. The Company and its affiliates are subject to the combined corporate tax for New York City calculated on a similar basis as the New York State franchise tax, subject to the New York City apportionment rules. The Company and its affiliates are currently under audit with respect to their New York City combined business corporation tax return for tax years 2016 through 2018. 
 Pennsylvania Taxation. Considered a mutual thrift institution conducting business in Pennsylvania, the Bank is subject to the mutual thrift institutions tax. The mutual thrift institutions tax is imposed at the rate of 11.5 on apportionable net taxable income and is required to be reported and filed on the annual Net Income Tax Report. Mutual thrift institutions are exempt from all other Pennsylvania corporate taxes. 
 Delaware State Taxation. As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Company is exempted from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file annual returns and pay annual fees and an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware. 
 Other State Taxation . To a lesser extent, the Company receives income from customers in other states. The Company s filing obligations with respect to the receipts vary from state to state and depend upon the reporting requirements in the various jurisdictions.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The risks set forth below, in addition to the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition to the risks set forth below and the other risks described in this annual report, there may also be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. As a result, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us. 
 
 Proposed Merger with Citizens Financial Group, Inc. 
 
 There is no assurance when or even if the Merger will be completed. 
 Completion of the Merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. There can be no assurance that the Company and Citizens will be able to satisfy the closing conditions or that closing conditions beyond their control will be satisfied or waived. Additionally, the Company and/or Citizens can terminate the merger agreement under specified circumstances. Moreover, the Company could face stockholder litigation relating to the Merger, which could prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger. 
 
 Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the Merger. 
 Before the Merger may be completed, Citizens and the Company must obtain approvals (or waivers) from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Other approvals, waivers or consents from regulators may also be required. In determining whether to grant these approvals the regulators consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party. An adverse development in either party s regulatory standing or other factors could result in an inability to obtain approval or delay their receipt. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the Merger or require changes to the terms of the Merger. Such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the Merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the Merger. 
 
 Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the Company s stock price, business and financial results. 
 If the Merger is not completed, the ongoing business of the Company may be adversely affected and the Company may be subject to a number of risks, including the following: 
 the Company will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, proxy solicitation and printing fees; 
 under the Merger agreement, the Company is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business before completing the Merger, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies if the Merger is terminated; and 
 matters relating to the Merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources by the Company s management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to the Company as an independent company. 
 In addition, if the Merger is not completed, the Company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its customers and employees. The Company could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger, or to proceedings commenced by Citizens seeking damages or to compel the Company to perform its obligations under the merger agreement. These factors and similar risks could have an adverse effect on the Company s results of operation, business and stock price. 
 
 Combining the Company and Citizens may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the Company and Citizens may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger. 
 The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on the ability to realize the anticipated cost savings from combining the businesses of the Company and Citizens. To realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the Merger, the Company and Citizens must successfully integrate and combine their businesses in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized. If the Company and Citizens are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost savings and anticipated benefits of the Merger could be less than anticipated, and integration may result in additional unforeseen expenses. 
 The Company and Citizens have operated and, until the completion of the Merger, must continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the companies ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the Merger on the combined company. 
 
 The Company s shareholders will have significantly reduced ownership and voting interests after the Merger and will exercise less influence over management of the combined organization. 
 The Company s shareholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the Company s board of directors and on various other matters affecting the Company. Upon the completion of the Merger, the Company s shareholders will become shareholders of Citizens with ownership of approximately 14 of the combined company. Therefore, the Company s shareholders will have significantly reduced ownership and voting interests after the Merger. 
 
 The Company will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending. 
 Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on the Company. These uncertainties may impair the Company s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others who deal with the Company to seek to change existing business relationships with the Company. Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to the effective time of the Merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. 
 The pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the integration may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect our financial results. In addition, the Merger Agreement requires that the Company operate in the ordinary course of business and restricts the Company from taking certain actions prior to the effective time of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement without Citizen s consent. These restrictions may prevent the Company from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger. 
 
 The combined company may be unable to retain the Company s or Citizens personnel successfully after the Merger is completed. 
 The success of the Merger will depend in part on the combined company s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by the Company and Citizens. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with the Company or Citizens, as applicable, while the Merger is pending or with the combined company after the Merger is consummated. If the Company and Citizens are unable to retain key employees, including management, who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the companies, the Company could face disruptions in their operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. In addition, if key employees terminate their employment, the combined company s business activities may be adversely affected and management s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating the Company and Citizens to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause the combined company s business to suffer. In addition, the Company and Citizens may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company. 
 
 Economic, Market Area and Interest Rates 
 
 The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic, which was declared a national emergency in the United States in March 2020, continues to create extensive disruptions to the global economy and financial markets and to businesses and the lives of individuals throughout the world. Federal and state governments, including in New Jersey and New York, have taken, and continue to take, unprecedented actions to contain the spread of the disease, including by instituting quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief to businesses and individuals impacted by the pandemic. Although in various locations certain activity restrictions have been relaxed with some level of success, including in New Jersey and New York, in many states and localities the number of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 has increased significantly at various times throughout 2021. Despite governmental approval of three COVID-19 vaccines and the initial distribution of these vaccines to certain high-risk populations, the sustained surge of positive cases across a number of jurisdictions throughout the United States has increased pressure on 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 governmental officials to reverse the relaxation of activity restrictions, which could lead to the shutdown of certain businesses and operations and exacerbate economic uncertainty and instability related to the pandemic. 
 Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when the coronavirus can be controlled and abated and when and how the economy may be fully reopened. As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we may be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations: 
 demand for our products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income; 
 if economic activity slows or high levels of unemployment return for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income; 
 collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase; 
 our allowance for credit losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect our net income; 
 the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; 
 if short-term interest rates, anchored by the Federal Funds target rate, increase or the yield curve flattens or inverts, our net interest income and net interest margin could decline; 
 a material decrease in net income or a net loss over several quarters could result in a decrease in the rate of our quarterly cash dividend; 
 our cyber security risks are increased as the result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely; 
 we rely on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service due to the COVID-19 outbreak could have an adverse effect on us; and 
 government actions in response to the pandemic, such as vaccination mandates, may affect our customers, business and operations, workforce, human capital resources and infrastructure. 
 Any one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects. 
 Certain industries have been particularly hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. Refer to the COVID-19 Pandemic section included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details on the Company s loan portfolio by industry as of December 31, 2021. In addition, the spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. We have many employees working remotely and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. 
 The Company is not a traditional SBA lender however, we have been an active participant in the PPP. The PPP authorizes financial institutions to make federally-guaranteed loans to qualifying small businesses and non-profits organizations. These loans carry an interest rate of 1 per annum and a maturity of two years if originated before June 5, 2020 and five years if originated on or after June 5, 2020. The PPP provides that such loans may be forgiven if the borrowers meet certain requirements with respect to maintaining employee headcount and payroll and the use of the loan proceeds after the loan is originated. If not forgiven, these loans will be guaranteed by the SBA under the SBA s section 7(a) program. We sold approximately 328 million of PPP loans in December 2020 to The Loan Source, Inc. Loan Source ), a company with significant experience in the origination, funding and servicing of PPP loans, including the PPP loan forgiveness process. We had no PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2021. 
 The PPP loan application submission deadline was August 8, 2020. However, on December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act Economic Aid Act was adopted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and reopened the PPP to certain businesses that satisfy applicable eligibility criteria. Specifically, among other things, the Economic Aid Act: (i) extends the original PPP (or the First Draw deadline from August 8, 2020 to March 31, 2021; and (ii) establishes Second Draw PPP loans, which enables certain entities to receive a second round of PPP credit. Any customer inquiries received by the Company regarding the second round of PPP will be referred to Loan Source. 
 As a result of our participation in the PPP, we may be subject to litigation and claims by borrowers in connection with the PPP loans that we have made, as well as investigation and scrutiny by our regulators, Congress, the SBA, the Treasury Department and other governmental authorities. Regardless of whether these claims and investigations may be founded or 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 unfounded, if such claims and investigations are not resolved in a timely and favorable manner for us, they may result in significant costs and liabilities (including increased legal and professional costs) and/or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services. 
 Moreover, our future success and profitability substantially depends on the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to COVID-19 pandemic could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability. Any one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects. 
 
 A worsening of national or local economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Deteriorating economic or business conditions could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our on-going operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and unemployment levels, particularly in New York and New Jersey given our concentration in this region, may result in greater loan delinquencies, increases in our nonperforming, criticized and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The majority of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate in New York and New Jersey. In addition, a migration of individuals and businesses from urban areas, including New York City, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in similar ways given our concentration in New York City. At December 31, 2021, approximately 7.4 billion, or 41 of our commercial loans were to borrowers or secured by collateral in New York City. Inflation could also negatively impact us through rising costs and interest rates. 
 
 Increases in short-term interest rates and other changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and capital. 
 Our ability to make a profit largely depends on our net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. 
 The cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is largely based on short-term interest rates, the level of which is significantly influenced by the Federal Funds target rate which is administered by the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC of the Federal Reserve Board FRB ). However, the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by intermediate-term interest rates that are fixed for a contractual period of time. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility. In a period of rising interest rates, our interest-bearing liabilities will generally reprice faster than our interest-earning assets, thereby causing a reduction in net interest income and earnings as the interest paid on our liabilities would increase more rapidly than the interest income earned on our assets. It is widely expected that the FOMC of the FRB will increase the Federal Funds target rate to combat persistent inflation. The speed and magnitude of such rate increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and capital. Increases in interest rates could also make it more difficult for borrowers to repay or refinance their loans. 
 In addition, relative changes in interest rates of varying tenors could have an effect on the slope of the yield curve. If the yield curve were to invert or flatten, our net interest income and net interest margin could contract, adversely affecting our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and capital. Changes in interest rates could also affect our ability to originate loans and attract and retain deposits; the fair values of our securities and other financial assets; the fair values of our liabilities; and the average lives of our loan and securities portfolios. Changes in interest rates also could have an effect on loan refinancing activity, which, in turn, would impact the amount of prepayment penalty income we receive on our multi-family and CRE loans. Because prepayment penalty income is recorded as interest income, the extent to which it increases or decreases during any given period could have a significant impact on the level of net interest income and net income we generate during that time. 
 We evaluate interest rate sensitivity using models that estimate net interest income sensitivity and the change in our economic value of equity over a range of interest rate scenarios. The economic value of equity analysis is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. At December 31, 2021, in the event of a 200 basis point gradual increase in interest rates, whereby rates increase evenly over a twelve-month period, and assuming management takes no action to mitigate the effect of such rate movement change, our interest rate risk model projects that we would experience a 2.8 or 22.6 million decrease in net interest income. In a 200 basis point instantaneous rate shock scenario, the economic value of equity EVE model projects a 5.4 or 262.0 million decrease in EVE. To the extent that the speed and magnitude of rate movements, curve shape and related management assumptions differ from those assumed in the scenarios noted above, our actual experience may differ materially from our model results. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.

 Our inability to achieve profitability on new branches may negatively affect our earnings. 
 We have expanded our presence throughout our market area and may pursue further expansion through de novo branching or the purchase of branches from other financial institutions. The profitability of our expansion strategy will depend on whether the income that we generate from the new branches will offset the increased expenses resulting from operating these branches. We expect that it may take a period of time before these branches can become profitable, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. During this period, the expense of operating these branches may negatively affect our net income. 
 
 Strong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability. 
 Competition in the banking and financial services and non-bank industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with numerous commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. In addition, we compete with numerous online financial service providers who compete in the new digital fintech marketplace and who may not be subject to our regulatory requirements. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have, have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger bank and non-bank competitors may be able to price loans and/or deposits more aggressively than we can. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. The greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets. For additional information see Item 1. Business. 
 
 Severe weather, acts of terrorism, public health issues, geopolitical and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business. 
 Weather-related events have adversely impacted our market area in recent years, especially areas located near coastal waters and flood prone areas. Such events that may cause significant flooding and other storm-related damage may become more common events in the future. Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and communication systems and the metropolitan New York area and Northern New Jersey remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism. Such events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. 
 Additionally, global markets may be adversely affected by natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyber attacks or campaigns, military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical events, including escalating military tension between Russia and Ukraine. Global market fluctuations may affect our business liquidity. Also, any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the U.S. or abroad, as a result of the above factors or otherwise could result in a decline in revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels. 
 
 Asset Quality 
 
 If our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual losses, our earnings could decrease. 
 We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If actual results differ significantly from our assumptions, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. Bank regulators also periodically review our loan portfolio, the allowance for credit losses, and our assumptions underlying the determinations we have made regarding the allowance for credit losses, and as a result can require us to increase our provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. 
 
 Because we intend to continue to increase our commercial originations, our credit risk will increase. 
 At December 31, 2021, our portfolio of multi-family, commercial real estate, C I and construction loans totaled 17.90 billion, or 79.2 of our total loans. We intend to continue to increase our originations of multi-family, commercial real estate, C I and construction loans, which generally have more risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Since repayment of commercial loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower s properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market, local economy or the management of the business or property. Our commercial borrowers may have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss. Because we plan to continue to increase our originations of these loans, it may be necessary to increase the level of 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 our allowance for loan losses because of the increased risk characteristics associated with these types of loans. Any such increase to our allowance for loan losses would adversely affect our earnings. 
 
 Our C I loan portfolio is unseasoned. It is difficult to judge the future performance of unseasoned loans. 
 Our C I loan portfolio has increased to 4.11 billion at December 31, 2021 from 1.28 billion at December 31, 2016. It is difficult to assess the future performance of these recently originated loans because of their relatively limited payment history from which to judge future collectability, especially in the economic environment since 2016. These loans may experience higher delinquency or charge-off levels than our historical loan portfolio experience, which could adversely affect our future performance. 
 
 We continue to expand our commercial lending efforts and footprint, which may expose us to increased lending risks and may have a negative effect on our results of operations. 
 In an effort to diversify our loan portfolio, we have expanded our commercial lending team to include leveraged lending and equipment finance teams, as well as a healthcare lending team that originate loans nationally. We will continue to explore other markets within commercial lending. These types of loans generally have a higher risk of loss compared to our one- to four-family residential real estate loans and multi-family loans, which could have a negative effect on our results of operations. In addition, some of our equipment finance portfolio relies on the residual values of the underlying equipment and therefore could be negatively impacted by a change in valuation. Because we are not as experienced with these new loan products and areas, we may incur losses or require additional time and resources for offering and managing such products effectively. At December 31, 2021, C I loans represent approximately 18 of our total loans. In addition, at December 31, 2021, approximately 27 of our total C I loans are to borrowers or secured by collateral located outside of New Jersey, New York and surrounding states. 
 
 Source of Funds 
 
 Public funds deposits are an important source of funds for us and a reduced level of those deposits may hurt our profits and liquidity position. 
 Public funds deposits are a significant source of funds for our lending and investment activities. At December 31, 2021, 5.66 billion, or 27.2 of our total deposits, consisted of public funds deposits from local government entities, predominantly domiciled in the state of New Jersey, such as townships, school districts, hospital districts, sheriff departments and other municipalities. These deposits are collateralized by letters of credit from the FHLB or through the pledge of eligible investment securities. Given our reliance on these typically high-average balance public funds deposits as a source of funds, our inability to retain such funds could adversely affect our liquidity. Further, our public funds deposits are primarily floating rate interest-bearing demand deposit accounts or short-term time deposits and therefore their pricing is more sensitive to changes in interest rate risks. If we are forced to pay higher rates on our public funds accounts to retain those funds, or if we are unable to retain such funds and we are forced to resort to other sources of funds for our lending and investment activities, such as borrowings from the FHLB, the interest expense associated with these other funding sources may be higher than the rates we are currently paying on our public funds deposits, which would adversely affect our net interest income. 
 In addition, the State of New Jersey is considering creating a State Bank, the purpose of which would be to promote economic development, commerce, and industry in the State. The proposal under consideration would permit State funds, including funds from State institutions and any State public source, to be held by the State Bank. Given the degree of our funding reliance on New Jersey-based municipal deposits and the potential lending ability of the proposed State Bank, we are uncertain of the impact this proposal may have on us. The possible loss of public funds on deposit may increase the costs of our funding needs, which could have a negative impact on our net income and negatively impact liquidity. The proposed legislation was first introduced in 2018, and in 2019, the Governor of New Jersey signed an executive order establishing an implementation board to develop criteria for establishing a State Bank. At this time, there is no assurance that a State Bank will be established or what its powers or authority may be. 
 
 FHLB funds are an important source of funding for the Company and reduced available capacity may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We borrow directly from the FHLB and various other financial institutions. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. If we are unable to secure alternative funding or need to rely on more expensive funding sources, our operating margins, profitability and liquidity would be negatively impacted.

Regulatory Matters 
 
 We operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations. 
 The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the NJDOBI, our chartering authority, by the FDIC, as insurer of our deposits, and by the CFPB, with respect to consumer protection laws. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the requirement for additional capital, the imposition of restrictions on our operations, restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and make other capital distributions to shareholders, restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares, the classification of our assets and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, compliance and privacy issues, BSA and AML compliance, and approval of merger transactions. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on the Bank, the Company and our operations. 
 The potential exists for additional Federal or state laws and regulations regarding capital requirements, lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to remain active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the potential issuance of formal enforcement orders. New laws, regulations, and other legal and regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. 
 
 If the bank regulators impose limitations on our commercial real estate lending activities, our earnings, dividend paying capacity and/or ability to repurchase shares could be adversely affected. 
 In 2006, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (collectively, the Agencies issued joint guidance entitled Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices (the CRE Guidance ). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank s commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate and construction and land loans, represent 300 or more of an institution s total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50 or more during the preceding 36 months. Our level of non-owner occupied commercial real estate equaled 513 of Bank total risk-based capital at December 31, 2021, however our commercial real estate loan portfolio increased by only 8 during the preceding 36 months. 
 In December 2015, the Agencies released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending (the 2015 Statement ). In the 2015 Statement, the Agencies express concerns about easing commercial real estate underwriting standards, direct financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and indicate that the Agencies will continue to pay special attention to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. If the FDIC, the Bank s primary federal regulator were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans we can hold in our portfolio, or require higher capital ratios as a result of the level of commercial real estate loans we hold, our earnings, dividend paying capacity and/or ability to repurchase shares would be adversely affected. 
 
 The performance of our multi-family and commercial real estate loan portfolios could be adversely impacted by recent or proposed changes in laws and regulation. 
 On June 14, 2019, the State of New York enacted legislation increasing restrictions on rent increases in a rent-regulated apartment building, including, among other provisions, (i) repealing the vacancy bonus and longevity bonus , which allowed a property owner to raise rents as much as 20 each time a rental unit became vacant, (ii) eliminating high rent vacancy deregulation and high-income deregulation, which allowed a rental unit to be removed from rent stabilization once it crossed a statutory high-rent threshold and became vacant, or the tenant s income exceeded the statutory amount in the preceding two years, and (iii) eliminating an exception that allowed a property owner who offered preferential rents to tenants to raise the rent to the full legal rent upon renewal. As a result of this new legislation as well as previously existing laws and regulations, which are outside the control of the borrower or the Bank, the value of the collateral for our multi-family loans or the future cash flow of such properties could be impaired. It is possible that rental income might not rise sufficiently over time to satisfy increases in the loan rate at repricing or increases in overhead expenses (e.g., utilities, taxes, etc.). In addition, if the cash flow from a collateral property is reduced or constrained, the borrower s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral for the loan may be impaired.

Any future increase in FDIC insurance premiums will adversely impact our earnings. 
 As a large institution within the meaning of FDIC regulations (i.e., greater than 10 billion in assets), the Bank s deposit insurance premium is determined differently than smaller banks. Small banks are assessed based on a risk classification determined by examination ratings, financial ratios and certain specified adjustments. Large institutions are subject to assessment based upon a more detailed scorecard approach involving (i) a performance score determined using forward-looking risk measures, including certain stress testing, and (ii) a loss severity score, which is designed to measure, based on modeling, potential loss to the FDIC insurance fund if the institution failed. The total score is converted to an assessment rate, subject to certain adjustments, with institutions deemed riskier paying higher assessments. 
 
 Capital requirements for financial institutions have increased in recent years, which may adversely impact our return on equity, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares. 
 In 2015, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board instituted a new rule which substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. This rule implemented the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. 
 The rule included new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, and refines the definition of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 to risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 ; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6 (increased from 4 under prior rules); (iii) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8 ; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 . The rule also established a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital, and resulted in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0 ; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5 ; and (iii) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 10.5 . The required minimum capital conservation buffer increased in annual increments to 2.5 on January 1, 2019, which is the fully phased in conservation buffer. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions. 
 The application of these more stringent capital requirements for the Bank and the Company could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions constraining us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. 
 
 The current Administration could cause changes to tax laws and regulations. 
 The current Administration could seek enactment of changes in tax laws as well as changes in regulatory requirements. We are subject to changes in tax law that could increase our effective tax rates. These law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. An increase in our corporate tax rate could have an unfavorable impact on our earnings and capital generation abilities. Similarly, the Bank s customers could experience varying effects from changes in tax laws and such effects, whether positive or negative, may have a corresponding impact on our business and the economy as a whole. In addition, changes to regulatory requirements could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. 
 
 Business Issues 
 
 We will be required to transition from the use of LIBOR in the future. 
 On July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. In November 2020, the LIBOR administrator announced plans to consult on easing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors. The United States banking regulators concurrently issued a joint statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. The continuation of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed after 2021 or June 30, 2023, depending on tenor. 
 In the United States, the Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ARRC ), a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, was tasked with identifying alternative reference interest rates to replace LIBOR. A new index based on the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities , the Secured Overnight Finance Rate ("SOFR") emerged as the ARRC's preferred alternative rate for LIBOR; however, other market alternatives have been developed. Although the ARRC has announced SOFR as its recommended alternative to LIBOR, SOFR may not gain market acceptance or be widely used as a benchmark. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to alternative reference rates as markets transition away from LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 LIBOR-based loans and securities in our portfolio and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings. 
 The Company has established a cross-functional team to develop and manage transition plans to address potential revisions to documentation, as well as customer management and communication, internal training, financial, operational and risk management implications, and legal and contract management. In addition, we have engaged with our regulators and with industry working groups and trade associations to develop strategies for transitioning away from LIBOR. The Company has approximately 8.55 billion in financial instruments which are indexed to USD-LIBOR at December 31, 2021. If LIBOR rates are no longer available and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates, we may incur expenses in effecting the transition, we may suffer a loss in the conversion to a new rate because the new rate may not be equal to what we were being paid on the LIBOR rate, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers and security holders over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 We may not be able to continue to grow our business, which may adversely impact our results of operations. 
 Our total assets have grown from approximately 23.17 billion at December 31, 2016 to 27.81 billion at December 31, 2021. Our business strategy calls for continued growth. Our ability to continue to grow depends, in part, upon our ability to successfully attract deposits, identify favorable loan and investment opportunities, acquire other banks and non-bank entities and enhance our market presence. In the event that we do not continue to grow, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. 
 Our ability to grow successfully will depend on whether we can continue to fund this growth while maintaining cost controls and asset quality, remain in good standing with our regulators, as well as on factors beyond our control, such as national and regional economic conditions and interest rate trends. If we are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality, such growth could adversely impact our earnings and financial condition. 
 
 We could be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers due to breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We sell into the secondary market a portion of the residential mortgage loans that we originate. The whole loan sale agreements we enter into in connection with such loan sales require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans in the event there is a breach of any of representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. We have established a reserve for estimated repurchase and indemnification obligations on the residential mortgage loans that we sell. We make various assumptions and judgments in determining this reserve. If our assumptions are incorrect, our reserve may not be sufficient to cover losses from repurchase and indemnification obligations related to our residential loans sold. Such event would have an adverse effect on our earnings. 
 
 We may incur impairments to goodwill. 
 At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 116.2 million recorded as goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment, at least annually. Significant negative industry or economic trends, including declines in the market price of our common stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows or disruptions to our business, could result in impairments to goodwill. We operate in competitive environments and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. If our analysis results in impairment to goodwill, we would be required to record an impairment charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which such impairment is determined to exist. Any such change could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 Growing by acquisition entails integration and certain other risks. 
 Although we have successfully integrated business acquisitions in recent years, failure to successfully integrate systems subsequent to the completion of any future acquisitions could have a material impact on the operations of the Bank. 
 
 Future acquisition activity could dilute book value. 
 Both nationally and in our region, the banking industry is undergoing consolidation marked by numerous mergers and acquisitions. From time to time we may be presented with opportunities to acquire institutions and/or bank branches and we may engage in discussions and negotiations. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and trading values, and therefore, may result in the dilution of our book value per share. 
 44 

Table of Contents 

We currently utilize incentive-based payment arrangements with our employees as compensation practices. Potential regulatory changes to this practice could have an impact on our current practices and impact our results of operations. 
 The Bank is subject to the compensation-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act which prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the future. 
 
 We may eliminate dividends on our common stock. 
 Although we pay quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders, stockholders are not entitled to receive dividends. Downturns in domestic and global economies and other factors could cause our board of directors to consider, among other things, the elimination of or reduction in the amount and/or frequency of cash dividends paid on our common stock. 
 
 We could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls. 
 We continue to devote a significant amount of effort, time and resources to continually strengthen our controls and ensure compliance with complex accounting standards and banking regulations. A failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the perception that customers, regulators and investors may have of us. 
 
 Our recruitment efforts may not be sufficient to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations. 
 As we continue to grow, we may find our recruitment efforts more challenging. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating experienced or qualified personnel, we may not be able to continue to successfully implement our business strategy. 
 
 Our failure to effectively deploy capital may have an adverse effect on our financial performance. 
 We utilize our capital for general corporate purposes, including, among other items, organic growth, paying cash dividends, repurchasing shares of our common stock and acquisitions. Our failure to deploy capital effectively may reduce our profitability and may adversely affect the value of our common stock. 
 
 Information Security 
 
 A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses, and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm. 
 The Bank collects, processes and stores sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both the Bank and third-party service providers. Our operational and security systems, infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our business. We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct or malfeasance, or failure or breach of third- party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. We have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with our own systems. 
 We handle a substantial volume of customer and other financial transactions every day. Our financial, accounting, data processing, check processing, electronic funds transfer, loan processing, online and mobile banking, automated teller machines, or ATMs, backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. This could adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide these services. There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume, electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages, natural disasters, events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts, and cyber attacks. We continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, and cause reputational harm.

 A cyber attack, information or security breach, or a technology failure of ours or of a third-party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or manage our exposure to risk, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, increase our costs to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure, and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm. 
 Our business is highly dependent on the security and efficacy of our infrastructure, computer and data management systems, as well as those of third parties with whom we interact. Cyber security risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign state actors. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. We rely on digital technologies, computer, database and email systems, software, and networks to conduct our operations. In addition, to access our network, products and services, our customers and third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment. 
 Financial services institutions have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber attacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of the institution, its employees or customers or of third parties, or otherwise materially disrupt network access or business operations. For example, denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial institutions and several large retailers have disclosed substantial cyber security breaches affecting debit and credit card accounts of their customers. We have experienced cyber security incidents in the past, although not material, and we anticipate that, as a larger bank, we could experience further incidents. There can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure, cyber attacks or other information or security breaches. 
 Misconduct by employees could also result in fraudulent, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of clients or improper use of confidential information. The Bank may not be able to prevent employee errors or misconduct, and the precautions the Bank takes to detect this type of activity might not be effective in all cases. Employee errors or misconduct could subject the Bank to civil claims for negligence or regulatory enforcement actions, including fines and restrictions on our business. 
 In addition, there have been instances where financial institutions have been victims of fraudulent activity in which criminals pose as customers to initiate wire and automated clearinghouse transactions out of customer accounts. The recent massive breach of the systems of a credit bureau presents additional threats as criminals now have more information about a larger portion of the population of the United States than past breaches have involved, which could be used by criminals to pose as customers initiating transfers of money from customer accounts. Although the Bank has policies and procedures in place to verify the authenticity of its customers, the Bank cannot assure that such policies and procedures will prevent all fraudulent transfers. Such activity can result in financial liability and harm to our reputation. 
 As cyber threats and other fraudulent activity continues to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Any of these matters could result in our loss of customers and business opportunities, significant disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information and/or that of our customers, or damage to our customers and/or third parties computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs. In addition, any of the matters described above could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We rely on third-party providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business. An interruption or cessation of an important service by any third-party could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 We are dependent for the majority of our technology, including our core operating system, on third-party providers. If these companies were to discontinue providing services to us, we may experience significant disruption to our business. In addition, each of these third parties faces the risk of cyber attack, information breach or loss, or technology failure. If any of our third-party service providers experience such difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with them, we may be required to find alternative sources of such services. We are dependent on these third-party providers securing their information systems, over which we have limited control, and a breach of their information systems could adversely affect our ability to process transactions, service our clients or manage our exposure to risk and could result in the disclosure of sensitive, personal customer information, which could have a material adverse impact on our business through damage to our reputation, loss of business, remedial costs, additional regulatory scrutiny or exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Since the Company s initial public offering in 2005, we have transitioned from a wholesale thrift business to a retail commercial bank. This transition has been primarily accomplished by increasing the amount of our commercial loans and core deposits (savings, checking and money market accounts). Our transformation can be attributed to a number of factors, including organic growth, de novo branch openings, bank and branch acquisitions, as well as the expansion of our offered loan and deposit products. We believe the attractive markets we operate in, namely, New Jersey and the greater New York metropolitan area, will continue to provide us with growth opportunities. In addition, we have national exposure through our Investors eAccess online deposit platform and our equipment finance, healthcare and leveraged lending portfolios. Our primary focus is to build and develop profitable customer relationships across all lines of business, both consumer and commercial. 
 Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which is directly impacted by the interest rate environment. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, primarily loans and investment securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily interest-bearing transaction accounts, time deposits, and borrowed funds. Net interest income is affected by the level and direction of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, the timing of the placement and the repricing of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities on our balance sheet, and the rate of prepayments on our loans and mortgage-related assets. 
 We continue to manage our interest rate risk against a backdrop of an elevated inflationary environment and the potential for short-term interest rates to increase in the near future. If short-term interest rates increase, the yield curve flattens, inverts or deposit competition increases, we could experience a decline in our net interest margin and net interest income. 
 During 2020 and 2021, the entire country was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in March 2020, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including social distancing guidelines, closure of non-essential businesses and shelter-at-home mandates, caused a global economic downturn. The economic downturn included an increase in unemployment and a decline in gross domestic product. Since April 2020, the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated above the pre-pandemic unemployment rate. Gross domestic product has grown each quarter beginning with the third quarter of 2020 after declining in the first and second quarters of 2020. Supply chain issues, labor participation and other factors have contributed to an elevated inflationary environment. 
 Total assets increased 1.78 billion, or 6.9 , to 27.81 billion at December 31, 2021 from 26.02 billion at December 31, 2020. Net loans increased 1.76 billion, or 8.6 , to 22.34 billion at December 31, 2021 from 20.58 billion at December 31, 2020. Securities decreased 46.8 million, or 1.2 , to 4.00 billion at December 31, 2021 from 4.04 billion at December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we originated or funded 2.43 billion in multi-family loans, 1.27 billion in residential loans, 1.26 billion in commercial and industrial loans, 1.24 billion in commercial real estate loans, 170.6 million in construction loans and 118.2 million in consumer and other loans. Our ongoing strategy is to continue to enhance our commercial banking capabilities and maintain a well-diversified loan portfolio. We have shifted focus to C I originations while maintaining our commercial real estate and multi-family portfolio and continue to be diligent in our underwriting and credit risk monitoring of these portfolios. The overall level of non-performing loans remains low compared to our national and regional peers. 
 Capital management is a key component of our business strategy. We continue to manage our capital through a combination of organic growth, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. Effective capital management and prudent growth allows us to effectively leverage our capital, while being mindful of tangible book value for stockholders. Our capital to total assets ratio has increased to 10.57 at December 31, 2021 from 10.41 at December 31, 2020. Since March 2015, we have repurchased 130.5 million shares at an average cost of 12.08 per share totaling 1.58 billion. Stockholders equity was impacted for the year ended December 31, 2021 by cash dividends of 0.56 per share totaling 138.6 million and the repurchase of 975,469 shares of common stock for 12.1 million. 
 In addition to our branch network, we offer online banking capabilities for consumers as well as small businesses, including providing robust online treasury capabilities to our customers. We complement our branch network with Investors eAccess, a secure online channel to attract deposits nationwide. Mobile and online banking services allow us to serve our customers needs and adapt to a changing environment. We continue to enhance our digital capabilities as a way to enhance the customer experience and deliver our services in a safe and secure manner. We will continue to execute our business strategies with a focus on prudent and opportunistic growth while striving to produce financial results that will create value for our stockholders. We intend to continue to grow our business by successfully attracting deposits, identifying favorable loan and investment opportunities, acquiring other banks and non-bank entities, enhancing our market presence and product offerings as well as continuing to invest in our people.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our audited Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Application of these principles requires management to establish policies make estimates that affect the amounts reported in our audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Our significant accounting policies described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and our financial condition. We consider our accounting policies and estimates for allowance for credit losses and derivatives to be critical accounting policies and estimates because they require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or to make significant assumptions that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. The allowance for credit losses represents the estimated amount considered necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses inherent in financial assets at the balance sheet date. The measurement of expected credit losses is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures such as loan commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable and unused lines of credit. The determination of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate by management because of the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the potential for changes in the forecasted economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for credit losses. Changes in the provision for credit losses may materially affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Estimates incorporated into the Allowance for Credit Losses include the following: 
 Borrower performance is estimated primarily using quantitative methodologies that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience, loan characteristics, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. 
 Estimated data inputs include PD, LGD and EAD for commercial loans, point in time term structures for residential and consumer loans, probability of funding of lending commitments and expected utilization of unused lines of credit. 
 The Company incorporates forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. 
 These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses and include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads and long-term interest rate forecasts. 
 The scenarios that are chosen and the amount of weighting given to each scenario consider a variety of factors including third party economists and firms, industry trends and other available published economic information. 
 Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of each loan taking into consideration expected prepayments which are developed using industry standard estimation techniques. 
 Also included in the allowance for loans are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Company s assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative method or the economic assumptions described above. For held to maturity debt securities, a range of historical losses method is utilized. In estimating the net amount expected to be collected for TruPS, the Company employs a single scenario forecast methodology informed by historical industry default data as well as current and near term operating conditions for the banks and other financial institutions that are the underlying issuers. 
 
 We utilize multiple scenarios to forecast macroeconomic conditions to estimate lifetime expected credit losses. See Note 6, Allowance for Credit Losses , for additional information regarding the economic outlooks and the selection of probability weightings used in the Company s determination of the ACL. Because current economic conditions and forecasts can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses on loans, and therefore the appropriateness of the allowance for credit loss, could change significantly. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the allowance and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across the entire loan portfolio. Additionally, changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. 
 Derivative Financial Instruments. As required by ASC 815, the Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.

A significant portion of our commercial loan portfolio, including commercial and industrial loans, are secured by commercial real estate and are primarily on properties and businesses located in New Jersey and New York. In addition to the loans originated for our portfolio, we originated residential mortgage loans for sale to third parties totaling 145.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. We also purchased mortgage loans from correspondent entities including other banks and mortgage bankers.

 Total non-accrual loans decreased to 105.2 million at December 31, 2021 compared to 107.1 million at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, there were 1.1 million of commercial and industrial loans, 1.2 million of commercial real estate loans and 850,000 of multi-family loans that were classified as non-accrual which were performing in accordance with their contractual terms. The increase in Multi-family non-accrual loans for the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by a previously disclosed Multi-family potential problem loan that was granted a deferral of payment due to circumstances related to COVID-19, classified as a troubled debt restructuring and moved to non-accrual. The borrower is performing in accordance with its modified terms. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold three non-performing multi-family loans totaling 19.9 million and recognized a recovery of 1.4 million in the allowance for credit losses on the sale of one of the loans. Also during the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold two non-performing commercial real estate loans totaling 1.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold an 18.1 non-performing multi-family loan. 
 Criticized and classified loans as a percent of total loans decreased to 6.25 at December 31, 2021 from 7.99 at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, our allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 1.07 . At December 31, 2021, there were 60.6 million of loans deemed as TDRs, of which 35.8 million were multi-family, 19.7 million were residential and consumer loans, 4.3 million were commercial real estate loans and 778,000 were commercial and industrial loans. TDRs of 7.6 million were classified as accruing and 53.1 million were classified as non-accrual at December 31, 2021. We continue to proactively and diligently work to resolve our troubled loans. 
 In addition to non-accrual loans, we continue to monitor our portfolio for potential problem loans. Potential problem loans are defined as loans about which we have concerns as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the current loan repayment terms and which may cause the loan to be placed on non-accrual status. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has deemed potential problem loans totaling 114.2 million, which is comprised of 10 multi-family loans totaling 54.8 million, 11 commercial real estate loans totaling 37.1 million and 12 commercial and industrial loans totaling 22.3 million. In addition, we continue to support our customers by deferring payments for borrowers experiencing hardship because of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of February 8, 2022, there were no commercial loans deferring principal payments under the Cares Act. As of February 8, 2022, there were 9 residential and consumer loans deferring principal and interest payments under the Cares Act totaling 4.5 million. For further information, please refer to the Loan Deferrals disclosure in Part I, Item 1. Business. Management is actively monitoring all of these loans.

 The allowance for loan losses decreased by 42.3 million to 240.7 million at December 31, 2021 from 283.0 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease reflects a negative provision for loan losses of 43.8 million, partially offset by an increase of 541,000 resulting from net recoveries and an increase of approximately 1.0 million from the initial allowance on loans identified as PCD which were acquired from Berkshire Bank. Our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2021 was affected by the improving current and forecasted economic conditions and commercial real estate prices. Future increases in the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on the growth and composition of the loan portfolio, the level of loan delinquency and the current and forecasted economic condition over the life of our loans. At December 31, 2021, our allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 1.07 . 
 Securities. Securities are held primarily for liquidity, interest rate risk management and yield enhancement. Our Investment Policy requires that investment transactions conform to Federal and State investment regulations. Our investments purchased may include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury obligations, securities issued by various Federal Agencies, State and Municipal subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions, overnight and short-term loans to other banks, corporate debt instruments, and mutual funds. In addition, the Company may invest in equity securities subject to certain limitations. Purchase and sale decisions are based upon a thorough analysis of each instrument to determine if it conforms to our overall asset/liability management objectives. The analysis must consider its effect on our risk-based capital measurement, prospects for yield and/or appreciation and other risk factors. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale when purchased. 
 At December 31, 2021, our securities portfolio represented 14.4 of our total assets. Securities, in the aggregate, decreased by 46.8 million, or 1.2 , to 4.00 billion at December 31, 2021 from 4.04 billion at December 31, 2020. This decrease was a result of paydowns and sales, partially offset by purchases. 
 Stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank, Bank Owned Life Insurance and Other Assets. The amount of stock we own in the FHLB increased by 16.7 million, or 10.4 to 176.5 million at December 31, 2021 from 159.8 million at December 31, 2020. The amount of stock we own in the FHLB is primarily related to the balance of our outstanding borrowings from the FHLB. Bank owned life insurance was 229.4 million at December 31, 2021 and 223.7 million at December 31, 2020. Other assets were 144.2 million at December 31, 2021 and 163.2 million at December 31, 2020. 
 Deposits. At December 31, 2021, deposits totaled 20.82 billion, representing 83.7 of our total liabilities. Our deposit strategy is focused on attracting core deposits (savings, checking and money market accounts). We are committed to our plan of attracting and retaining more core deposits because they generally represent a more stable source of low cost funds. 
 Deposits increased by 1.30 billion, or 6.7 , to 20.82 billion at December 31, 2021 from 19.53 billion at December 31, 2020. Total checking accounts increased 2.22 billion to 11.93 billion at December 31, 2021 from 9.71 billion at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, we held 18.73 billion in core deposits, representing 89.9 of total deposits. At December 31, 2021, 2.09 billion, or 10.1 , of our total deposit balances were certificates of deposit. Included in total deposits are 734.4 million of brokered deposits. At December 31, 2021, 5.66 billion, or 27.2 , of our total deposits consisted of public fund deposits from local government entities, predominately domiciled in the state of New Jersey and the majority of which are interest bearing. Municipal deposits are collateralized using municipal letters of credit or securities collateral. 
 Borrowed Funds. Borrowings are primarily with the FHLB and are collateralized by our residential and commercial mortgage portfolios. Borrowed funds increased by 239.2 million, or 7.3 , to 3.54 billion at December 31, 2021 from 3.30 billion at December 31, 2020 to support balance sheet growth. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we prepaid 600.0 million of FHLB borrowings. This prepayment resulted in the recognition of 10.2 million of early extinguishment costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 on the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 Stockholders Equity. Stockholders equity increased by 228.4 million to 2.94 billion at December 31, 2021 from 2.71 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributed to net income of 313.3 million, share-based plan activity of 32.1 million and other comprehensive income of 33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. These increases were partially offset by cash dividends of 0.56 per share totaling 138.6 million and the repurchase of 975,469 shares of common stock for 12.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Analysis of Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income represents the difference between income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities.

Included in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 were 23.1 million of gains on from sale-leaseback transactions. Excluding this item, non-interest income decreased 2.9 million, primarily due to a decrease of 9.3 million in gain on loans due to a lower volume of mortgage banking loan sales to third parties offset by increases of 4.2 million in fees and service charges and 3.2 million in other income. 
 Non-Interest Expense. Total non-interest expenses were 455.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 6.2 million, or 1.4 , as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

 Comparison of Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 
 Refer to Item 7. - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a discussion of 2020 results as compared to 2019 results. 
 Management of Market Risk 
 Qualitative Analysis. One significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk results from timing differences in the cash flow or re-pricing of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts (e.g., loan commitments); the effect of loan and securities prepayments, deposit activity; basis risk arising from potential differences in the behavior of lending and funding rates arising from the use of different indices; and yield curve risk arising from changes in the term structure of interest rates. Changes in market interest rates can affect net interest income by influencing the volume and pricing of new loan originations and securities purchases, the ability of borrowers to repay variable rate loans, the volume of loan and securities prepayments and the mix, cost and flow of deposits. 
 The general objective of our interest rate risk management process is to align and manage forecasted interest rate risk with our business model and risk appetite. Our Asset Liability Committee, which consists of senior management and executives, evaluates the interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet and operating environment to assess capital and liquidity requirements and modify our lending, investing and deposit gathering strategies accordingly. On a quarterly basis, our Board of Directors reviews various Asset Liability Committee reports that estimate the sensitivity of the economic value of equity and net interest income under various interest rate scenarios. 
 Our tactics and strategies may include the use of various financial instruments, including derivatives, to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. Certain derivatives are designated as hedging instruments in a qualifying hedge accounting relationship (fair value or cash flow hedge). Hedged items can be either assets or liabilities. 
 As of December 31, 2021, the Company had cash flow and fair value hedges with aggregate notional amounts of 3.33 billion and 150.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had cash flow hedges with aggregate notional amounts of 3.33 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company terminated 475.0 million of fair value hedges and also terminated 400.0 million in cash flow hedges. The fair value hedges terminated during 2020 were asset swap transactions where fixed rate loan payments were exchanged for variable rate payments. 
 We use an internally managed and implemented industry standard asset/liability model to complete our quarterly interest rate risk reports. The model projects net interest income based on various management assumptions, interest rate scenarios and horizons. We use a combination of analyses to monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 Our net interest income sensitivity analysis determines the relative balance between the repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions over various horizons. This asset and liability analysis includes expected cash flows from loans

 and securities, using forecasted prepayment and reinvestment rates, as well as contractual and forecasted liability cash flows. This analysis identifies mismatches in the timing of asset and liability cash flows but does not necessarily provide an accurate indicator of interest rate risk because the rate forecasts and assumptions used in the analysis may not reflect actual experience. The economic value of equity EVE analysis estimates the change in the net present value NPV of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts over a range of immediate interest rate shock scenarios. EVE computations incorporate forecasts for loan and securities prepayment rates and deposit decay rates. 
 In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. In November 2020, the LIBOR administrator announced plans to consult on easing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors. The United States banking regulators concurrently issued a joint statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee ARRC has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR is the recommended alternative rate to USD-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to USD-LIBOR. The Company has approximately 8.55 billion in financial instruments which are indexed to USD-LIBOR at December 31, 2021 for which it is monitoring the activity and evaluating the related risks. 
 Quantitative Analysis. The table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2021, the estimated changes in our EVE and our net interest income that would result from the designated changes in interest rates. Such changes to interest rates are calculated as an immediate and permanent change for the purposes of computing EVE sensitivity and a gradual change over a one-year period for the purposes of computing net interest income sensitivity. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments, deposit pricing and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. The following table reflects management s expectations of the changes in EVE and net interest income for an interest rate decrease of 100 basis points and increase of 200 basis points over the course of the next year.

 (1) EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. 
 (2) Assumes a gradual change in interest rates over a one year period at all maturities. 
 The table above indicates that at December 31, 2021, in the event of a 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would be expected to experience a 5.4 decrease in EVE and a 22.6 million, or 2.8 , decrease in net interest income. In the event of a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would be expected to experience a 4.5 decrease in EVE and a 4.0 million, or 0.5 , decrease in net interest income. This data does not reflect any future actions we may take in response to changes in interest rates, such as changing the mix in or growth of our assets and liabilities, which could change the results of the EVE and net interest income calculations. 
 As mentioned above, we use an internally developed asset liability model to compute our quarterly interest rate risk reports. Certain shortcomings are inherent in any methodology used to calculate interest rate risk. Modeling EVE and net interest income sensitivity requires certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which balance sheet cash flows respond to changes in market interest rates. The EVE and net interest income results presented above assume no balance sheet growth and that generally the composition of our interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of the analysis remains constant over the period being measured and, accordingly, the data does not reflect any actions we may take in response to changes, or expected changes, in interest rates. The EVE and net interest income results presented in the table above provide an indication of our sensitivity to interest rate changes at a point in time informed by the myriad assumptions related to customer behavior, competitive market forces and the evolution of the rate environment, including the frequency, timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates. To the extent that any of these variables do not conform with our models and assumptions our actual experience may differ materially from the metrics presented above.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is the ability to economically meet current and future financial obligations. The Company s primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, FHLB advances and other borrowings and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from the sale of loans and investment maturities. While scheduled amortization and maturities of loans is usually a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan and securities prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, including changes and expected changes thereto, economic conditions and competition. The Company has other sources of liquidity, including unsecured overnight lines of credit, brokered deposits and other types of borrowings. The Company s total borrowing capacity from the FHLB and other borrowing sources was approximately 22.71 billion at December 31, 2021. Excluding outstanding borrowings and encumbered collateral, available borrowing capacity and other available liquidity sources totaled approximately 12.51 billion at December 31, 2021. Our Asset Liability Committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the needs of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 A primary source of funds is provided by cash flows on loans and securities. Principal repayments on loans for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were 5.06 billion, 4.67 billion and 3.66 billion, respectively. Principal repayments on securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were 1.26 billion, 1.30 billion and 744.0 million, respectively. During year ended December 31, 2021, there were sales of securities of 42.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there were no sales of securities; however, the Company received proceeds of 16.5 million from the call of a held-to-maturity debt security which resulted in a gain of 124,000 and received a principal payment of 26,000 on a held-to-maturity debt security which resulted in a gain recognized as non-interest income. During the year ended December 31, 2019, there were sales of securities of 399.4 million. There were no unusual payoffs or paydowns of TruPS for the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2019. 
 In addition to cash provided by principal and interest payments on loans and securities, our other sources of funds include cash provided by operating activities, deposits and borrowings. Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 totaled 494.8 million, 224.3 million and 160.7 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, excluding deposits assumed in the Berkshire Bank branch acquisition, deposits increased 666.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, excluding deposits assumed in the Gold Coast acquisition, deposits increased 1.18 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2019, deposits increased 280.1 million. Deposit flows are affected by the overall level of and direction of changes in market interest rates, the pricing of products offered by us and our local competitors, and other factors. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, net borrowed funds increased 239.2 million to help fund the growth of the security and loan portfolios and our share repurchases. The increase in borrowed funds during year ended December 31, 2021 was partially offset by the early extinguishment of 600.0 million of FHLB advances. For the year ended December 31, 2020, excluding borrowed funds assumed in the Gold Coast acquisition, net borrowed funds decreased 2.55 billion. The decrease includes the early extinguishment of 1.20 billion of FHLB advances during the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net borrowed funds increased 391.4 million. 
 Borrowed funds included 449.1 million of repurchase agreements with various brokers as of December 31, 2021. These agreements are recorded as financing transactions as we maintain effective control over the transferred or pledged securities. The dollar amount of the securities underlying the agreements continues to be carried in our securities portfolio while the obligations to repurchase the securities are reported as liabilities. The securities underlying the existing repurchase agreements are delivered to the party with whom each transaction is executed. Those parties agree to resell to us the identical securities we delivered to them at the maturity of the agreement. 
 Our primary use of funds is for the origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of securities. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we originated loans totaling 6.51 billion, 3.57 billion and 3.53 billion, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, excluding loans purchased in the Berkshire Bank branch acquisition, we purchased loans of 103.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, excluding loans purchased in the acquisition of Gold Coast, we purchased loans of 158.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we purchased loans of 427.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased securities of 1.32 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2020, excluding securities purchased in the acquisition of Gold Coast, we purchased securities of 1.41 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we purchased securities of 1.27 billion. In addition, we utilized 12.1 million, 23.9 million and 475.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. During December 2019, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Blue Harbour Group, L.P. Blue Harbour ), pursuant to which we purchased from Blue Harbour the 27,318,628 shares of our common stock beneficially owned by Blue Harbour, at a purchase price of 12.29 per share, representing aggregate consideration of approximately 335.7

 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 20.9 million of common stock to finance the Gold Coast acquisition. 
 At December 31, 2021, we had commitments to originate commercial loans of 305.1 million. Additionally, we had commitments to originate residential loans of approximately 81.2 million. The Company had commitments to correspondent banks to purchase residential loans of 13.1 million as of December 31, 2021. We had no purchase commitments for such loans as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. Unused home equity lines of credit and undisbursed business and constructions loans totaled approximately 2.08 billion at December 31, 2021. Certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2021 totaled 1.79 billion, or 8.6 of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including but not limited to other retail and commercial deposits and wholesale funding. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay. 
 Liquidity management is both a short and long-term function of business management. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets depend upon our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled 288.0 million. Securities, which provide an additional source of liquidity, totaled 4.00 billion at December 31, 2021, of which 2.09 billion are pledged to secure borrowings, municipal deposits and available borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, we have wholesale funding alternatives, which provide an additional source of funds. At December 31, 2021, our total borrowing capacity at the FHLB was 11.55 billion, of which we had outstanding borrowings of 7.14 billion, which included letters of credit totaling 4.06 billion. Our remaining borrowing capacity at the FHLB was 4.41 billion. We also had available unsecured overnight borrowing lines (Fed Funds) with other financial institutions totaling 750.0 million, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2021. In addition, our total borrowing capacity from other sources was 6.16 billion, of which 734.4 million was outstanding at December 31, 2021. 
 Investors Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At December 31, 2021, Investors Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Investors Bank is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines. See Item 1. Supervision and Regulation Federal Banking Regulation Capital Requirements. 
 Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities. On July 30, 2021 our rating was placed on positive after the acquisition agreement with Citizens Financial Group was announced. On May 24, 2021 S P revised our rating outlook to stable from negative to reflect decreasing economic risks. In May 2020, S P had revised our rating outlook to negative due to economic downturn from COVID-19. 
 We have other liabilities which include 212.7 million of operating lease liabilities net of imputed interest of which 9.3 million was acquired in the Berkshire Bank acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 3.6 million was acquired from Gold Coast during the year ended December 31, 2020. We have 813,000 of finance lease liabilities. These contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 have not changed significantly from December 31, 2020. 
 During each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2019, the Company invested 10.0 million in a low income housing tax credit program that qualifies for community reinvestment tax credits. There was no investment in a program during the year ended December 31, 2020. Commitments related to the tax credit investments are payable on demand and are recorded in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total commitments related to tax credit investments were 11.5 million, 5.5 million and 9.2 million as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Company has entered into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Derivative financial instruments present on the Company s balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company s borrowings and loans. During the year ended December 31, 2021, such derivatives were used (i) to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with borrowings and (ii) to hedge changes in the fair value of certain pools of prepayable fixed-rate assets. These derivatives had an aggregate notional amount of 3.48 billion as of December 31, 2021. Derivatives with an aggregate notional amount of 475.0 million that had been used to hedge changes in the fair value of certain pools of prepayable fixed- and adjustable-rate assets were terminated during the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 400.0 million that had been designated as cash flow hedges on wholesale funding were terminated during the year ended December 31, 2020.

 The Company has credit derivatives resulting from participation in interest rate swaps provided to external lenders as part of loan participation arrangements which are, therefore, not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company s assets or liabilities. Additionally, the Company provides interest rate risk management services to commercial customers, primarily interest rate swaps. The Company s market risk from unfavorable movements in interest rates related to these derivative contracts is minimized by concurrently entering into offsetting derivative contracts that have identical notional values and critical terms. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the derivatives resulting from participation in interest rate swaps provided to lenders was a liability of 160,000. The fair value of the exchange cleared derivatives resulting from customer interest rate risk management services was an asset of 8.2 million as of December 31, 2021. However, not all of the derivatives supporting customer interest rate risk management services were cleared through an exchange. For these bi-lateral derivatives we have recorded an asset of 360,000. The interest rate risk associated with interest rate swaps executed with customers supporting our interest rate risk management services are protected by mirror interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 22 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules for a description of recent accounting pronouncements already adopted. 
 New Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted 
 In July 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-05, Lessors Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments. The update affects lessors with lease contracts that have variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or a rate and where the lessor would have recognized a selling loss at lease commencement if classified as sales-type or direct financing even if the lessor expects the arrangement to be profitable. To reduce the risk of recognizing losses at lease commencement in such circumstances, the update requires lessors to classify and account for such leases as operating. The amendments may be applied either retrospectively or prospectively. The update will be effective for the Company January 1, 2022 with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the update to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848). The update specifically addresses whether Topic 848 applies to derivative instruments that do not reference a rate that is expected to be discontinued but that instead use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform, commonly referred to as the discounting transition. This ASU extends certain optional expedients provided in Topic 848 to contract modifications and derivatives affected by the discounting transition. The amendments in ASU 2021-01 may be applied under a retrospective approach as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is after March 12, 2020 or prospectively to new modifications made on or after any date within the interim period including January 7, 2021. The update is in effect for a limited time from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity. The amendments simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with the characteristics of liabilities and equity by reducing the number of models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock and amends how convertible instruments and equity contracts with an option to be settled in cash or shares affect the EPS calculation. The update also amends the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity s own equity. The update will be effective for the Company January 1, 2022 with early adoption permitted not earlier than fiscal years beginning 2021. The Company does not expect the update to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The amendments provide expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts or hedging relationships affected by the discontinuance of LIBOR as a benchmark rate to alleviate the burden and cost of such modifications. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022, that an entity has elected certain optional expedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. The amendments also provide a one-time election to sell and/or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. The update is in effect for a limited time from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company continues to evaluate its financial instruments indexed to USDLIBOR for which Topic 848 provides expedients, exceptions and elections. The Company has established a crossfunctional team to develop transition plans to address potential revisions to documentation, as well as customer management and communication, internal training, financial, operational and risk management implications, and legal and contract management. In addition, the

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
 With the participation of management, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2021. Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of that date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 (b) Changes in internal controls. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 (c) Management s report on internal control over financial reporting. 
 The management of Investors Bancorp, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Investors Bancorp s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
 Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of Investors Bancorp; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Investors Bancorp s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Investors Bancorp s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on our assessment we believe that, as of December 31, 2021, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Investors Bancorp, Inc.: 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Investors Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiary (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 1, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Change in Accounting Principle 
 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for the recognition and measurement of credit losses as of January 1, 2020 due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurements of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Assessment of the allowance for credit losses related to loans receivable evaluated and calculated on a collective basis 
 As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s total allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021 was 240.7 million, a portion of which related to the allowance for credit losses on loans receivable evaluated and calculated on a collective basis (the collective ACL). The collective ACL includes the measurement of expected credit losses on a collective basis for those loans that share similar risk characteristics. In order to capture the specific risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, the Company segments the portfolio based upon 
 69 

Table of Contents 

 loan type. The Company s collective ACL consists of both quantitative methodologies and qualitative reserves. The quantitative methodologies consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience, loan characteristics, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as multiple weighted economic scenarios over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, after which, the Company reverts to average historical losses on a straight line basis. The expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the Company s estimates of probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and individual loan level exposure at default on an undiscounted basis. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of each loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. The collective ACL also includes qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Company s assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methodologies or the related economic assumptions. 
 We identified the assessment of the collective ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the collective ACL due to significant measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed an evaluation of (1) the quantitative methodologies, including the methods and models used to estimate the PD and LGD, (2) the key assumptions for the quantitative methodologies, including the segmentation of the loan portfolio by similar risk characteristics, the reasonable and supportable forecast period including the reversion period, multiple economic scenarios including the weighting of those scenarios, and expected prepayments, and (3) the qualitative reserves. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD and LGD models. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company s measurement of the collective ACL, including controls over the: 
 development of the collective ACL methodology 
 development of the PD and LGD models 
 performance monitoring of the PD and LGD models 
 identification and determination of the key assumptions used in the quantitative methodologies 
 evaluation of qualitative reserves 
 analysis of the collective ACL results, trends and ratios. 
 
 We evaluated the Company s process to develop the collective ACL by testing certain sources of data, inputs, factors and assumptions that the Company used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, inputs, factors and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the: 
 Company s collective ACL estimate methodology, including the key assumptions, for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
 judgments made by the Company relative to the development and performance testing of the PD and LGD models by comparing them to relevant Company-specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and regulatory practices 
 conceptual soundness and performance testing of the PD and LGD models by inspecting the model documentation to determine whether the models are suitable for their intended use 
 multiple economic scenarios and the relative weightings of each scenario by comparing the scenarios to the Company s business environment, relevant industry practices, and publicly available forecasts 
 length of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and the reversion period by comparing them to specific portfolio risk characteristics and trends 
 expected prepayments by comparing to specific portfolio risk characteristics 
 segmentation of the loan portfolio by similar risk characteristics by comparing to the Company s business environment and relevant industry practices 
 methodology used to develop the qualitative reserves and the effect of those reserves on the collective ACL compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends and identified limitations of the underlying quantitative methods.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

days of its contractual due date. The accrual of income on loans is discontinued when required interest or principal payments are days in arrears or when the timely collection of such income is doubtful. Loans on which the accrual of income has been discontinued are designated as non-accrual loans and outstanding interest previously credited is reversed. Interest income on non-accrual loans and impaired loans is recognized in the period collected unless the ultimate collection of principal is considered doubtful. A loan is returned to accrual status when all amounts due have been received and the remaining principal is deemed collectible. Loans are generally charged off after an analysis is completed which indicates that collectability of the full principal balance is in doubt. 
 Troubled Debt Restructuring . On a case-by-case basis, the Company may agree to modify the contractual terms of a borrower s loan to remain competitive and assist customers who may be experiencing financial difficulty, as well as preserve the Company s position in the loan. If the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a concession has been made at the time of such modification, the loan is classified as a TDR. 
 Substantially all of our TDR loan modifications involve lowering the monthly payments on such loans through either a reduction in interest rate below a market rate, an extension of the term of the loan, or a combination of these two methods. These modifications rarely result in the forgiveness of principal or accrued interest. In addition, we frequently obtain additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying commercial loans. Restructured loans remain on non-accrual status until there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally six consecutive months of payments) and both principal and interest are deemed collectible. 
 Guidance on Non-TDR Loan Modifications due to COVID-19. The Company implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification programs to provide its borrowers relief from the economic impacts of COVID-19. In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CARES Act ), the Company elected to not apply troubled debt restructuring classification to any COVID-19 related loan modifications that occurred after March 1, 2020 to borrowers who were current as of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, these modifications are exempt from troubled debt restructuring classification under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP and were not classified as troubled debt restructurings TDRs ). The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 extended this provision of the CARES Act to January 1, 2022. In addition, for loans modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not meet the above criteria (e.g., current payment status at December 31, 2019), the Company applied the guidance included in an interagency statement issued by the bank regulatory agencies. For loan modifications that include a payment deferral and are not TDRs, the borrower s past due and non-accrual status have not been impacted during the deferral period. Interest income has continued to be recognized over the contractual life of the loan. million were in COVID-19 related payment deferment and qualified for exemption from TDR classification.

 million and on non-accrual status; 
 Troubled debt restructured loans; and 
 Other commercial loans with greater than million in outstanding principal, if management has specific information that it is probable they will not collect all principal amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. 
 When the Company determines that the loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics of other loans in the portfolio, the allowance will be determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral as of the reporting date, less estimated selling costs, as applicable, to ensure that the credit loss is not delayed until actual loss. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the amortized cost basis of the loan, the Company will charge off the difference between the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell at the reporting date and the amortized cost basis of the loan. 
 In determining the fair value for collateral-dependent loans, the Company reviews whether there has been an adverse change in the collateral value supporting the loan. As a substantial amount of the Company s loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate, appraisals of the underlying value of property are used. The Company utilizes information from its commercial lending officers and its credit department and special assets department s knowledge of changes in real estate conditions to identify if possible deterioration has occurred. Based on the severity of the changes in market conditions, management determines if an updated appraisal is warranted or if downward adjustments to the previous appraisal are warranted. 
 For residential mortgage loans, the Company s policy is to obtain an appraisal upon the origination of the loan and an updated appraisal in the event a loan becomes 90 days delinquent. Thereafter, the appraisal is updated every two years if the loan remains in non-performing status and the foreclosure process has not been completed. Management adjusts the appraised value of residential loans to reflect estimated selling costs and declines in the real estate market. 
 Management believes the potential risk for outdated appraisals has been mitigated due to the fact that the loans are individually assessed to determine that the loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the collateral. Loans are generally charged off after an analysis is completed which indicates that collectability of the full principal balance is in doubt. 
 Acquired assets. Subsequent to the adoption of CECL, acquired assets are included in the Company's calculation of the allowance for credit losses. How the allowance on an acquired asset is recorded depends on whether it has been classified as a Purchased Financial Asset with Credit Deterioration PCD ). PCD assets are assets acquired at a discount that is due, in part, to credit quality. PCD assets are accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 326-20 and are initially recorded at fair value as determined by the sum of the present value of expected future cash flows and an allowance for credit losses at acquisition. The allowance for PCD assets is recorded through a gross-up effect, while the allowance for acquired non-PCD assets such as loans is recorded through provision expense, consistent with originated loans. Thus, the determination of which assets are PCD and non-PCD can have a significant effect on the accounting for these assets. 
 Subsequent to acquisition, the allowance for PCD loans will generally follow the same estimation, provision and charge-off process as non-PCD acquired and originated loans. Additionally, TDR identification for acquired loans (PCD and non-PCD) will be consistent with the TDR identification for originated loans.

 million. In connection with our annual impairment assessment we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company s qualitative assessment concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. 
 Mortgage Servicing Rights . The Company recognizes as separate assets the rights to service mortgage loans. The right to service loans for others is generally obtained through the sale of loans with servicing retained. The initial asset recognized for originated mortgage servicing rights MSR is measured at fair value. The estimated fair value of MSR is obtained through independent third party valuations through an analysis of future cash flows, incorporating assumptions market participants would use in determining fair value including market discount rates, prepayment speeds, servicing income, servicing costs, default rates and other market driven data, including the market s perception of future interest rate movements. MSR are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income. We apply the amortization method for measurements of our MSR. MSR are assessed for impairment based on fair value at each reporting date. MSR impairment, if any, is recognized in a valuation allowance through charges to earnings as a component of fees and service charges. Subsequent increases in the fair value of impaired MSR are recognized only up to the amount of the previously recognized valuation allowance. Fees earned for servicing loans are reported as income when the related mortgage loan payments are collected.

 Berkshire Bank Branch Acquisition 
 As of the close of business on August 27, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania branches of Berkshire Bank, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc. pursuant to the definitive purchase and assumption agreement dated as of December 2, 2020 by and between the Company and Berkshire Bank. The acquisition included the assumption and acquisition of million of deposits and million of consumer and commercial loans, together with the related operations. The Company assumed a net liability of million and received consideration of million from Berkshire Bank. 
 The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting as prescribed by Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805 Business Combinations , as amended. Under this method of accounting, the purchase price has been allocated to the respective assets acquired based on their estimated fair values, net of applicable income tax effects. The excess cost over fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, or million, has been recorded as goodwill. 
 The acquired loans and deposits were fair valued on the date of acquisition based on guidance from ASC 820-10 which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The valuation methods utilized took into consideration adjustments for interest rate risk, funding cost, servicing cost, residual risk, credit and liquidity risk.

 Fair Value Measurement of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed 
 Described below are the methods used to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Berkshire Bank branch acquisition based on guidance from ASC 820-10 which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
 Loans. The estimated fair values of the loan portfolio generally consider adjustments for interest rate risk, required equity return, servicing costs, credit and liquidity risk. Level 3 inputs were utilized to determine the fair value of the acquired loan portfolio and included the use of present value techniques employing cash flow estimates and incorporated assumptions that market participants would use in estimating fair values. In instances where reliable market information was not available, the Company used its own assumptions in an effort to determine fair value. The primary approach to determining the fair value of the loan portfolio was a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors including the type of loan, underlying collateral, classification status or grade, interest rate structure (fixed or variable interest rate), and remaining term. For the non-credit component, loans were grouped together according to similar characteristics when applying the various valuations techniques. For the credit component, loans were also grouped based on whether they had more than insignificant deterioration in credit since origination (purchase credit deteriorated PCD as defined by ASC 326-20). The estimated lifetime loan losses were calculated based on an annual loss rate developed by using the historical annual average charge-off percentages for Mid- Atlantic institutions as a proxy for how a market participant acquirer would value the portfolio. 
 Deposits / Core Deposit Intangible. The core deposit intangible represents the value assigned to the stable and below market rate funding sources within the acquired deposit base; typically demand deposits, interest checking, money market and savings accounts. The core deposit intangible value represents the value of the relationships with deposit customers as a below market rate funding source. The fair value was based on a discounted cash flow methodology that gave appropriate consideration to expected deposit attrition rates, net maintenance costs of the deposit base, projected interest costs and alternative funding costs. Certificates of deposit (time deposits) are not considered to be core deposits as they typically are less stable and generally do not have an all-in favorable funding advantage to alternative funding costs. The fair value of certificates of deposit represents the present value of the certificates expected contractual payments discounted by market rates for similar certificates and is determined utilizing Level 2 inputs.

The foregoing was subject to proration to ensure that, in the aggregate, of Gold Coast s shares would be converted into Investors Bancorp common stock. 
 The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting as prescribed by FASB ASC 805, as amended. Under this method of accounting, the purchase price has been allocated to the respective assets acquired based on their estimated fair values, net of applicable income tax effects. The excess cost over fair value of assets acquired, or million, has been recorded as goodwill. 
 The acquired portfolio was fair valued on the date of acquisition based on guidance from ASC 820-10 which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

 million. The allowance is related to non-agency corporate and other debt securities. The majority of the allowance is related to a portfolio of collateralized debt obligations backed by pooled TruPS, principally issued by banks and to a lesser extent insurance companies and real estate investment trusts. At December 31, 2021 the TruPS had a carrying value before allowance for credit losses and estimated fair value of million and million, respectively. The Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and does not believe it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities before a recovery of amortized cost. Refer to Note 6 , Allowance for Credit Losses, for additional information on the Company s allowance for credit losses. 
 At December 31, 2021, the available-for-sale debt securities portfolio was almost entirely comprised of agency securities. As such, the unrealized losses in this portfolio are primarily driven by changes in interest rates and other non-credit related factors. The Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and does not believe it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities before a recovery of amortized cost. At December 31, 2021, there is no allowance for credit losses related to the Company s available-for-sale debt securities as the decline in fair value did not result from credit issues. 
 Debt securities with a carrying value before allowance for credit losses of billion and an estimated fair value of billion are pledged to secure borrowings and municipal deposits. The contractual maturities of the Bank s mortgage-backed securities are generally less than years with effective lives expected to be shorter due to prepayments. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to underlying loan prepayments or early call privileges of the issuer; therefore, mortgage-backed securities are not included in the following table.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, there were sales of securities; however, the Company received proceeds of million from the call of a held-to-maturity debt security which resulted in a gain of and received a principal payment of on a held-to-maturity debt security. 
 The Company recognized net unrealized gains on equity securities of for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company received proceeds of million on securities sold from the debt securities available-for-sale portfolio resulting in gross realized losses of million recognized in non-interest income. Proceeds from the sale were reinvested in higher yielding debt securities. There were sales of equity securities or debt securities held-to-maturity for the year ended December 31, 2019. 
 Other-Than-Temporary Impairment OTTI 
 Prior to January 1, 2020, under previous other-than-temporary impairment guidance, the Company conducted a quarterly review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the value of any security had declined below its cost or amortized cost, and whether such decline was other-than-temporary. If a determination was made that a debt security was other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company would estimate the amount of the unrealized loss that was attributable to credit and all other non-credit related factors. The credit related component would be recognized as an other-than-temporary impairment charge in non-interest income. The non-credit related component would be recorded as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. 
 With the assistance of a valuation specialist, the Company evaluated the credit and performance of each issuer underlying the Company s pooled TruPS. Cash flows for each security were forecasted using assumptions for defaults, recoveries, pre-payments and amortization. At December 31, 2019, the Company deemed that the present value of projected cash flows for each security was greater than the book value and did not recognize any additional OTTI charges for the year ended December 31, 2019. 
 Reductions: Accretion of credit loss impairment due to an increase in expected cash flows ) Reductions for securities sold or paid off during the period Balance of credit related OTTI, end of period 
 
 The credit loss component of the impairment loss represented the difference between the present value of expected future cash flows and the amortized cost basis of the securities prior to considering credit losses. The beginning balance represented the credit loss component for debt securities for which OTTI occurred prior to the period presented. If OTTI was recognized in earnings for credit impaired debt securities, it would have been presented as an addition based upon whether it was the first time a debt security was credit impaired (initial credit impairment) or was not the first time a debt security was credit impaired (subsequent credit impairments). The credit loss component was reduced if the Company sold, intended to sell or believed it would have been required to sell previously credit impaired debt securities. Additionally, the credit loss component was reduced if (i) the Company received cash flows in excess of what it expected to receive over the remaining life of the credit impaired debt security, (ii) the security matured or (iii) the security was fully written down.

 Credit Quality Indicators 
 The Company has lending policies and procedures that provide target market, underwriting and other criteria for identified lending segments to codify the level of credit risk the Company is willing to accept. Approval authority levels are delegated to qualified individuals and approval bodies for the extension of credit within the guidance of these policies and procedures. In addition, the Company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews and validates risk assessment on a continual basis. 
 The Company assigns ratings to borrowers and transactions based on the assessment of a borrower s ability to service their debt based on relevant information such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends, among other factors. 
 In connection with the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the Company implemented new risk rating models for borrowers and transactions within its commercial loan portfolio. The risk rating methodology transitioned to a dual risk rating framework which bifurcates ratings into probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD). Relevant risks are evaluated prior to approving a transaction to determine if the transaction is within the Company s risk appetite and the appropriate rating. Strong credit analysis requires current, reliable financial information and documented assessment of the customer s: 
 ability to perform in accordance with the terms of the credit, including adherence to covenants; 
 assets and liabilities, liquidity, net worth, and contingent and other off-balance sheet items; 
 tax liabilities; 
 cash reserves and ability to convert assets to cash; 
 income statement and the sources, level, stability, and quality of earnings; 
 projected performance, sensitized for stressed circumstances; and 
 industry performance relative to peers and industry. 
 Each commercial credit facility is assigned a PD and LGD rating for the purpose of informing a credit decision, facilitating the determination of the expected level of credit loss and other portfolio management activities (as well as relationship profitability). The dual risk rating framework and risk rating methodologies allow for consistent determination of risk across the Commercial business as indicated by the risk rating assigned. The methodology used by the Bank applies the same criteria for identification of a credit as for the regulatory definitions of risk ratings: 
 Pass - Pass assets are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor (or guarantors, if any) or by the fair value, less cost to acquire and sell, of any underlying collateral in a timely manner.

 - days are considered watch if not a troubled debt restructuring TDR ). In addition, any residential or consumer loan currently on deferment in accordance with the CARES Act or the interagency statement issued by bank regulatory agencies are considered watch. 
 Special Mention - A Special Mention asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution s credit position at some future date. Special Mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. Residential and consumer loans delinquent - days are considered special mention if not a TDR. 
 Substandard - A Substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Residential and consumer loans delinquent days or greater as well as TDRs are considered substandard. 
 Doubtful - An asset classified Doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently known facts, conditions, and values. 
 Loss - An asset or portion thereof, classified Loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance on the institution s books as an asset, without establishment of a specific valuation allowance or charge-off, is not warranted. This classification does not necessarily mean that an asset has no recovery or salvage value; but rather, there is much doubt about whether, how much, or when the recovery will occur. As such, it is not practical or desirable to defer the write-off.

 The increase in commercial non-accrual loans for the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by a previously disclosed multi-family potential problem loan that was restructured and classified as a troubled debt restructuring. The Company recognized million of interest income on non-accrual loans during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 Individually Evaluated Loans 
 Loans which do not share common risk characteristics with other loans are individually evaluated as part of the process of calculating the allowance for credit losses. The evaluation is determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected cash flows or the fair value of the collateral as of the reporting date. When management determines that the fair value of collateral securing a collateral dependent loan inadequately covers the balance of net principal, the net principal balance is written down to the fair value of the collateral, net of estimated selling costs as applicable, rather than assigning an allowance. See Note 16, Fair Value Measurements , for information regarding the valuation process for individually evaluated loans.

 For leases, the Company records a residual value of the equipment based on an estimate of the equipment s value at the end of the lease. On at least an annual basis, the Company reviews the residual values of leased assets and assets off-lease and recognizes an impairment charge if the equipment s current market value has declined below the estimated value. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an impairment charge of million as the fair value of certain equipment decreased at a rate greater than originally projected. An additional impairment charge of million was recorded on the same equipment class during the year ended December 31, 2020 given the extended downturn in the market for these assets.

 Guidance on Non-TDR Loan Modifications due to COVID-19 
 The Company implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification programs to provide its borrowers relief from the economic impacts of COVID-19. In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CARES Act ), the Company elected to not apply troubled debt restructuring classification to any COVID-19 related loan modifications that occurred after March 1, 2020 to borrowers who were current as of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, these modifications are exempt from troubled debt restructuring classification under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP and were not classified as troubled debt restructurings TDRs ). The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 extended this provision of the CARES Act to January 1, 2022. In addition, for loans modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not meet the above criteria (e.g., current payment status at December 31, 2019), the Company applied the guidance included in an interagency statement issued by the bank regulatory agencies. For loan modifications that include a payment deferral and are not TDRs, the borrower s past due and non-accrual status have not been impacted during the deferral period. Interest income has continued to be recognized over the contractual life of the loan. 
 Troubled Debt Restructurings 
 On a case-by-case basis, the Company may agree to modify the contractual terms of a borrower s loan to remain competitive and assist customers who may be experiencing financial difficulty, as well as preserve the Company s position in the loan. If the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a concession has been made at the time of such modification, the loan is classified as a TDR. 
 Substantially all of our TDR loan modifications involve lowering the monthly payments on such loans through either a reduction in interest rate below a market rate, principal deferral, an extension of the term of the loan, or a combination of these

 Collateral dependent loans classified as TDRs were written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral. There were million in charge-offs of TDRs of collateral dependent commercial loans, in charge-offs of an unsecured commercial and industrial loan and in charge offs for TDRs of collateral dependent residential loans during the year ended December 31, 2021. There were in charge-offs for a TDR of an unsecured commercial and industrial loan and in charge offs for TDRs of collateral dependent residential loans during the year ended December 31, 2020. The allowance for credit losses associated with the TDRs presented in the above tables totaled million and million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Loan modifications generally involve the reduction in loan interest rate, principal deferral, and/or extension of loan maturity dates and also may include step up interest rates in their modified terms which will impact their weighted average yield in the future. Two of the commercial loan modifications which qualified as TDRs in the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted from forbearance agreements. The multi-family TDR which qualified as a TDR for the year ended December 31, 2021 was a previously disclosed potential problem loan granted a deferral of payment due to circumstances related to COVID-19. The residential loan modifications which qualified as TDRs during the year ended December 31, 2021 had their maturity extended and/or interest rate reduced to current market terms. 
 Residential loans modified in the year ended December 31, 2020 and deemed to be TDRs were granted a payment deferral related to COVID-19 but did not meet the criteria to be excluded from TDR as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Principles - Loans Receivable, Net - Guidance on Non-TDR Loan Modifications due to COVID-19. of the commercial loan modifications which qualified as a TDR in the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted from forbearance agreements. of the commercial loan modifications which qualified as a TDR in the year ended December 31, 2020 were loans which had already been on non-accrual status and were granted a deferral of payment due to circumstances related to COVID-19.

 The allowance for credit losses represents the estimated amount considered necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses inherent in financial assets at the balance sheet date. The lifetime estimate considers multiple economic scenarios, including recessionary scenarios that assume deterioration in key economic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate and real estate prices. The Company assesses the selection and probability weightings of each economic scenario. In estimating the allowance for credit losses, multiple economic outlooks are used that include a base or consensus case, a downside recessionary case and an upside scenario to reflect the potential for continued improvement in the economic outlook. In addition, the allowance for credit losses includes qualitative reserves for certain segments that may not be fully recognized through its quantitative models. There are still many unknowns including the duration of the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and the results of the government fiscal and monetary actions. The Company will continue to evaluate the allowance for credit losses and the related economic outlook each quarter.

 In determining the present value of lease payments, the discount rate used for each individual lease is the rate implicit in the lease, unless that rate cannot be readily determined, in which case the Company is required to use its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date. For its incremental borrowing rate, the Company uses the borrowing rates offered to the Company by the Federal Home Loan Bank, which reflects the rates a lender would charge the Company to obtain a collateralized loan.

The unpaid principal balance of these loans were billion and billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, all of which relate to mortgage loans. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the servicing asset, included in intangible assets, had an estimated fair value of million and million, respectively. At December 31, 2021, fair value was based on expected future cash flows considering a weighted average discount rate of , a weighted average constant prepayment rate on mortgages of and a weighted average life of years. Based on an analysis of fair values as of December 31, 2021, the Company determined that a valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights was required, a decrease of approximately from December 31, 2020. See Note 16, Fair Value Measurements, for additional details. 
 Core deposit premiums are amortized using an accelerated method and having a weighted average amortization period of years.

 A deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. The measurement of such deferred tax items is reduced by the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on available evidence. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences and carryforwards become deductible. A valuation allowance is recorded for tax benefits which management has determined are not more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there was valuation allowance. 
 Under ASC 740, Income Taxes , companies are required to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment; therefore, the Company re-measures its deferred tax assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when its temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. In December 2019, a technical bulletin was issued by the State of New Jersey providing clarification on mandatory combined reporting, causing a remeasurement of the Company s deferred tax balances. This remeasurement resulted in a decrease of million to the deferred tax asset. In April 2021, New York State governor signed FY21-22 New York State budget legislation that increased the New York State corporate income tax rate from 6.5 to 7.25 causing a remeasurement of the Company s deferred tax balances. The remeasurement resulted in an increase of million to the deferred tax asset for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Based upon projections of future taxable income and the ability to carry forward net operating losses indefinitely, management believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize the remaining deferred tax asset. 
 Retained earnings at December 31, 2021 included approximately million for which deferred income taxes of approximately million have not been provided. The retained earnings amount represents the base year allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only. Base year reserves are subject to recapture if the Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its stock, pays dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits, or ceases to maintain a bank charter. Under ASC 740, this amount is treated as a permanent difference and deferred taxes are not recognized unless it appears that it will be reduced and result in taxable income in the foreseeable future. Events that would result in taxation of these reserves include failure to qualify as a bank for tax purposes or distributions in complete or partial liquidation. 
 The Company had unrecognized tax benefits or related interest or penalties at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

 SERPs, Directors Plan and Other Postretirement Benefits Plan 
 The Company has an Executive Supplemental Retirement Wage Replacement Plan SERP II and the Supplemental ESOP and Retirement Plan SERP I (collectively, the SERPs ). The SERP II is a nonqualified, defined benefit plan which provides benefits to certain executives as designated by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors (the Board ). More specifically, the SERP II was designed to provide participants with a normal retirement benefit equal to an annual benefit of of the participant s highest annual base salary and cash incentive (over a consecutive 36-month period within the participant s credited service period) reduced by the sum of the benefits provided under the Pentegra DB Plan and the SERP I. Effective as of the close of business of December 31, 2016, the SERP II was amended to freeze future benefit accruals subsequent to the 2016 year of service. 
 The SERP I compensates certain executives (as designated by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board) participating in the ESOP whose contributions are limited by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also maintains the Amended and Restated Director Retirement Plan Directors Plan for certain directors, which is a nonqualified, defined benefit plan. The Directors Plan was frozen on November 21, 2006 such that no new benefits accrued under, and no new directors were eligible to participate in the plan. The SERPs and the Directors Plan are unfunded and the costs of the plans are recognized over the period that services are provided.

 Employee Stock Ownership Plan 
 The ESOP is a tax-qualified plan designed to invest primarily in the Company s common stock that provides employees with the opportunity to receive a funded retirement benefit from the Bank, based primarily on the value of the Company s common stock. During the Company s initial public stock offering in October 2005, the ESOP was authorized to purchase, and did purchase, shares of the Company s common stock at a price of per share with the proceeds of a loan from the Company to the ESOP. In connection with the completion of the Company s mutual to stock conversion on May 7, 2014, the ESOP purchased an additional common shares of stock at a price of per share with the proceeds of a loan from the Company to the ESOP. The Company refinanced the outstanding principal and interest balance of million and borrowed an additional million to purchase the additional shares. The outstanding loan principal balance at December 31, 2021 was million. Shares of the Company s common stock pledged as collateral for the loan are released from the pledge pro-rata for allocation to participants as loan payments are made. 
 At December 31, 2021, shares allocated to participants were since the plan inception. ESOP shares that were unallocated or not yet committed to be released totaled at December 31, 2021 and had a fair value of million. ESOP compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was million, million and million, respectively, representing the fair value of shares allocated or committed to be released during the year. 
 The SERP I also provides supplemental benefits to certain executives as designated by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board who are prevented from receiving the full benefits contemplated by ESOP s benefit formula due to the Internal Revenue Code. During the year ended December 31, 2021, compensation expense related to this plan amounted to million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the decline in our stock price resulted in a compensation benefit related to this plan amounted to .

 Equity Incentive Plan 
 At the annual meeting held on June 9, 2015, stockholders of the Company approved the Investors Bancorp, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan 2015 Plan which provides for the issuance or delivery of up to shares restricted stock awards and stock options) of Investors Bancorp, Inc. common stock. 
 Restricted shares granted under the 2015 Plan vest in equal installments, over the service period generally ranging from to years beginning one year from the date of grant. Additionally, certain restricted shares awarded are performance vesting awards, which may or may not vest depending upon the attainment of certain corporate financial targets. The vesting of restricted stock may accelerate in accordance with the terms of the 2015 Plan. The product of the number of shares granted and the grant date closing market price of the Company s common stock determine the fair value of restricted shares under the 2015 Plan. Management recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of restricted shares on a straight-line basis over the

 Stock options granted under the 2015 Plan vest in equal installments, over the service period generally ranging from to years beginning one year from the date of grant. The vesting of stock options may accelerate in accordance with the terms of the 2015 Plan. Stock options were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company s common stock on the grant date based on the closing market price and have an expiration period of years.

 Shareholder Litigation Settlement 
 On March 6, 2019, a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement and Release was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Court in relation to a lawsuit involving the Company and certain of its current and former directors entitled In re Investors Bancorp Inc. Stockholder Litigation, C.A. No. 12327-VCS (the Settlement ). The Settlement resolves a lawsuit challenging the equity compensation granted on or about June 23, 2015 to persons who were then-directors of the Company. 
 On June 21, 2019, the Court entered an order approving the Settlement. Following the expiration of a thirty-day appeal period, the Settlement became effective. Accordingly, pursuant to the Settlement (i) all of the stock options granted to non-employee directors (excluding Brendan J. Dugan who is deceased) and stock options granted to Paul Stathoulopoulos (who was not a director of the Company at the time of the equity grant on or about June 23, 2015), have been surrendered; (ii) a total of shares of the restricted stock granted to the then non-employee directors of the Company (excluding Brendan J. Dugan) and to then non-director Paul Stathoulopoulos scheduled to vest in 2020 have been surrendered; and (iii) shares of restricted stock and stock options granted to the Company s Chief Executive Officer and shares of restricted stock and stock options granted to the Company s President have been surrendered. As a result of the Settlement, the Company recorded million of accelerated stock compensation expense during the third quarter of 2019. 
 The Compensation and Benefits Committee, with the assistance of its independent legal advisor and compensation consultant, considered the issuance of equity grants to both the Company s Chief Executive Officer and President to replace those being surrendered pursuant to the Settlement. On May 20, 2019, the Compensation and Benefits Committee authorized and approved, and recommended to the Board, the issuance of (i) shares of restricted stock and stock options to the Company s Chief Executive Officer, and (ii) shares of restricted stock and stock options to the Company s President (the Replacement Awards ). The Board, excluding both the Company s Chief Executive Officer and

 On September 26, 2019, a related shareholder derivative action was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court. The complaint claims breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the Company s Board in the issuance of the replacement awards to both the Company s Chief Executive Officer and President in connection with the settlement of the case referenced above. The case is active and limited discovery is ongoing.

 million. Additionally, the Company had commitments to originate residential loans of approximately million, and the Company had commitments to correspondent banks to purchase residential loans of million as of December 31, 2021. Unused home equity lines of credit and undisbursed business and construction lines totaled approximately billion at December 31, 2021. No commitments are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company has no exposure to credit loss if the customer does not exercise its rights to borrow under the commitment. 
 The Company uses the same credit policies and collateral requirements in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet loans. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower. 
 The Company principally grants commercial real estate loans, multi-family loans, commercial and industrial loans, construction loans, residential mortgage loans and consumer and other loans to borrowers throughout New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and states in close proximity. Its borrowers abilities to repay their obligations are dependent upon various factors, including the borrowers income and net worth, cash flows generated by the underlying collateral or from business operations, value of the underlying collateral and priority of the Company s lien on the property. Such factors are dependent upon various economic conditions and individual circumstances beyond the Company s control; the Company is, therefore, subject to risk of loss. The Company believes its lending policies and procedures adequately minimize the potential exposure to such risks and adequate provisions for loan losses are provided for all probable and estimable losses. 
 Our portfolio contains interest-only and no income verification mortgage loans. We have not originated residential mortgage loans without verifying income in recent years. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, these loans totaled million

 million. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, interest-only residential and consumer loans totaled million and million, respectively, which represented less than of the residential and consumer portfolios. Although it is not a standard product offering for commercial real estate and multi-family loans, we originate interest-only in addition to amortizing loans in these segments. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, interest-only loans in these segments totaled billion and billion, respectively. As part of its underwriting, these loans are evaluated as fully amortizing for risk classification purposes, with the interest-only period generally ranging from to . In addition, the Company evaluates its policy limits on a regular basis. We believe these criteria adequately control the potential risks of such loans and that adequate provisions for loan losses are provided for all known and inherent risks. At the request of commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty resulting from the pandemic, we temporarily deferred the payment of principal and/or interest for an agreed-upon period of time. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately million of commercial loans not included in the amount of interest-only loans disclosed in this section. 
 In the normal course of business the Company sells residential mortgage loans to third parties. These loan sales are subject to customary representations and warranties. In the event that the Company is found to be in breach of these representations and warranties, it may be obligated to repurchase certain of these loans. 
 The Company has entered into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company s borrowings and loans. During the year ended December 31, 2021, such derivatives were used (i) to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with borrowings and (ii) to hedge changes in the fair value of certain pools of prepayable fixed-rate assets. These derivatives had an aggregate notional amount of billion as of December 31, 2021. The fair value of derivatives designated as hedging activities as of December 31, 2021 was an asset of , inclusive of accrued interest and variation margin posted in accordance with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company terminated interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million which had been used to hedge changes in the fair value of certain pools of prepayable fixed- and adjustable-rate assets. Also during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company terminated interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional of million which had been used to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with wholesale funding. 
 The Company has credit derivatives resulting from participations in interest rate swaps provided to external lenders as part of loan participation arrangements which are, therefore, not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company s assets or liabilities. Additionally, the Company provides interest rate risk management services to commercial customers, primarily interest rate swaps. The fair value of the derivatives resulting from participations in interest rate swaps provided to lenders was a liability of as of December 31, 2021. The fair value of the derivatives resulting from customer interest rate risk management services was an asset of million as of December 31, 2021; however, not all of the derivatives resulting from customer interest rate risk management services were cleared through a clearing agent, for which we have recorded an asset of as a result. 
 In connection with its mortgage banking activities, the Company may have certain freestanding derivative instruments. At December 31, 2021, the Company had commitments to fund loans to be classified as held-for-sale. Such commitments would have a like amount of commitments to sell loans, which would be considered derivative instruments under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The Company had commitments to sell loans at December 31, 2021. The fair values of these derivative instruments are immaterial to the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The guarantees generally extend for a term of up to and are fully collateralized. For each guarantee issued, if the customer defaults on a payment or performance to the third party, the Company would have to perform under the guarantee. Outstanding standby letters of credit totaled million at December 31, 2021. The fair values of these obligations were immaterial at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, the Company had commercial letters of credit outstanding. 
 Other Commitments 
 During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019, the Company invested million in a low income housing tax credit program that qualifies for community reinvestment tax credits. There was no investment in a program during the year ended December 31, 2020. Commitments related to the tax credit investments are payable on demand and are recorded in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total commitments related to tax credit investments were million and million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

 (excluding forecasted transactions related to the payment of variable interest on existing financial instruments). 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company terminated interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional of million. Upon termination, the Company accelerated the reclassification of amounts in other comprehensive income to earnings as a result of the hedged forecasted transactions becoming probable not to occur. 
 Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate borrowings. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that an additional million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense. 
 
 Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its pools of fixed rate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The Company may use interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Such derivatives were used to hedge the changes in fair value of certain of its pools of prepayable fixed rate assets. 
 For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income. 
 The Company terminated interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional of million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The terminated swaps were due to mature in April and May 2021. The remaining balance of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the assets previously hedged is being amortized into interest income on a straight-line basis over the remaining lives of the assets previously hedged. 
 
 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges 
 The Company has credit derivatives resulting from participation in interest rate swaps provided to external lenders as part of loan participation arrangements which are, therefore, not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company s assets or liabilities. Additionally, the Company provides interest rate risk management services to commercial customers, primarily interest rate swaps. The Company s market risk from unfavorable movements in interest rates related to these derivative contracts is economically hedged by concurrently entering into offsetting derivative contracts that have identical notional values, terms and indices. 
 Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain lenders which participate in loans and commercial customers.

A significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing the mortgage servicing rights using Level 3 inputs. The use of different assumptions could have a significant positive or negative effect on the fair value estimate. 
 
 Individually Evaluated Loans 
 A loan is individually evaluated when it is a collateral dependent commercial loan with an outstanding balance greater than million and on non-accrual status, a loan modified in a troubled debt restructuring, or is a commercial loan with million in outstanding principal if management has specific information that it is probable they will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. A collateral dependent loan is a loan for which repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. Collateral dependent loans secured by property are carried at the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. Estimated fair value is calculated using an independent third-party appraiser. In the event the most recent appraisal does not reflect the current market conditions due to the passage of time and other factors, management will obtain an updated appraisal or make downward adjustments to the existing appraised value based on their knowledge of the property, local real estate market conditions, recent real estate transactions, and for estimated selling costs, if applicable. Appraisals were generally discounted in a range of to . Collateral securing a loan may consist of real estate or other property such as equipment or inventory. Collateral securing commercial and industrial loans may include real estate, other property or the operating results of the business. For non-collateral dependent loans, management estimates the fair value using discounted cash flows based on inputs that are largely unobservable and instead reflect management s own estimates of the assumptions as a market participant would in pricing such loans. 
 Other Real Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets 
 Other Real Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets are recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs when acquired, thus establishing a new cost basis. Repossessed assets that are available for lease are included in operating lease equipment reviewed below. Fair value of foreclosed real estate property and other repossessed assets is generally based on independent appraisals. These appraisals include adjustments to comparable assets based on the appraisers market knowledge and experience, and are discounted an additional to for estimated costs to sell. When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated selling costs, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. If further declines in the estimated fair value of the asset occur, a writedown is recorded through expense. The valuation of foreclosed and repossessed assets is subjective in nature and may be adjusted in the future because of changes in economic conditions. Operating costs after acquisition are generally expensed.

 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 For cash, short-term U.S. Treasury securities and due from banks, the carrying amount approximates fair value. 
 Debt Securities Held-to-Maturity, net 
 Our debt securities held-to-maturity portfolio, consisting primarily of agency mortgage backed securities and other debt securities for which we have a positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, is carried at amortized cost less any allowance for credit losses. The fair values for the majority of debt securities held-to-maturity are provided by a third-party pricing service. The pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or a variety of other forms of analysis, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities (Level 2). Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and non-binding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, a quarterly analysis of the prices received from the pricing service is performed to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Company s internal price verification procedures and the review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by the independent pricing services has not resulted in material adjustments in the prices obtained from the pricing services. For certain held-to-maturity debt securities that trade in illiquid markets, valuation techniques, which require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable, are used to determine fair value of the investment. Valuation techniques are based on various assumptions, including, but not limited to forecasted cash flows, discount rates, required rate of return, adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity, and liquidation values (Level 3).
