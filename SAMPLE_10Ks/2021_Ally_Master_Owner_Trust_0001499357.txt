REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 Board of Directors 
 Ally Financial Inc. 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Certification Regarding Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Ally Financial Inc. AFI ), including its wholly owned subsidiary Ally Bank (Ally Bank and AFI are collectively referred to herein as the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the Commercial Automotive Receivables Platform (the Commercial Platform ), excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv) (the servicing criteria ), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Commercial Platform. The Commercial Platform consists of the activities involved in the performance of servicing functions for all publicly and privately issued wholesale dealer floor-plan asset-backed transactions. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria and its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management's assertion about compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Commercial Platform, determining whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction included in the Commercial Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that the evidence we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C&DI 200.06). As permitted by C&DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C&DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to apply C&DI 200.06. 
 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, for the Commercial Automotive Receivables Platform, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

With respect to applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), management has determined that there were no activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 with respect to the ABS Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. Appendix A to the Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the ABS Platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the ABS Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the ABS Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 is fairly stated, in all material respects.
