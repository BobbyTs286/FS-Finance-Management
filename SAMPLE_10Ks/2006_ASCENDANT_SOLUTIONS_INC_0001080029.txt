We
 face
 all of the risks of a business with limited capital, the special risks inherent
 in the acquisition, or involvement in each of our particular new business
 opportunities and the added risks associated with the management of diverse
 businesses. There can be no assurances that our current or future investments
 or
 acquisitions will produce cash results similar to those shown in the table
 above. 

Our
 future acquisition criteria may include, but not necessarily be limited to
 the
 following criteria: 

Annual
 revenues of 5-50 million 

Stable
 history of profitability and positive cash flow with minimum EBITDA
 of 1
 million 

Strong
 management team committed to the business 

Leadership
 or proprietary position in either product line, technology, manufacturing,
 service offering or distribution 

Opportunity
 to grow internally and/or through strategic add-on
 acquisitions 

Diversified
 customer base and product line 

Businesses,
 or situations, where we can most effectively deploy our net operating
 loss
 carryforwards 

We
 will
 continue to look for acquisition opportunities, however, our current cash
 resources are limited and we will be required to expend significant executive
 time to assist the management of our acquired businesses. We will continue
 seeking to (1) most effectively deploy our remaining cash, debt capacity (if
 any) and (2) capitalize on the experience and contacts of our officers and
 directors. 

In
 our
 continued acquisition efforts, we will not limit ourselves to a particular
 industry. Most likely, the target business will be primarily located in the
 United States, although we may acquire a target business with operations and/or
 locations outside the United States. In seeking a target business, we will
 consider, without limitation, businesses (i) that offer or provide services
 or
 develop, manufacture or distribute products in the United States or abroad;
 or
 (ii) that are engaged in wholesale or retail distribution among other potential
 target business opportunities and/or where our tax loss carryforwards can be
 utilized effectively. We may also co-invest in certain real estate transactions
 along with Fairways Equities, LLC or its principals. 

We
 have
 acquired, and may acquire in the future, minority or other non-controlling
 investments in other companies or businesses. However, we do not intend to
 engage primarily in acquiring minority investments, as we prefer to control
 the
 businesses in which we invest. Specifically, we intend to conduct our activities
 so as to avoid being classified as an investment company under the Investment
 Company Act of 1940, and therefore avoid application of the costly and
 restrictive registration and other provisions of that Act. We do not believe
 we
 are an investment company.

However,
 if in the future more than 40 of our assets are comprised of investment
 securities (which are basically, non-government securities other than
 securities of majority-owned and certain other controlled companies) we would,
 subject to certain transitional relief, be required to register as an investment
 company, which would involve our incurring significant registration and
 compliance costs under the Investment Company Act. We have obtained no formal
 determination nor have requested any ruling or interpretation from the
 Securities and Exchange Commission as to our status or potential status under
 the Investment Company Act of 1940. Any violation by us of the Investment
 Company Act, whether intentional or inadvertent, could subject us to material
 adverse consequences.

Dougherty s
 Holdings, Inc. 

Description
 of Acquisition 

On
 March
 24, 2004, we acquired, through a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary
 Dougherty s Holdings, Inc. DHI ), substantially all of the assets of Park
 Pharmacy Corporation (the Park Assets pursuant to the First Amended Plan of
 Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code Proposed
 by
 Park Pharmacy Corporation Inc. and the Company (the "Joint Plan") and the Asset
 Purchase Agreement (the Agreement entered into December 9, 2003 between Park
 Pharmacy and DHI. Park Pharmacy had been operating as a debtor in possession
 since December 2, 2002. The purchased assets included all of the cash and
 certain other assets of Park Pharmacy and all equity interests of the following
 entities (each directly or indirectly wholly-owned by Park Pharmacy):
 (i) Dougherty s Pharmacy, Inc., (ii) Park Operating GP, LLC,
 (iii) Park LP Holdings, Inc., (iv) Park-Medicine Man GP LLC
 (v) Park Infusion Services, L.P., and (vi) Park-Medicine Man,
 L.P. 

We
 acquired the Park Assets by investing, through DHI, an aggregate of
 approximately 1.5 million in cash, funded out of our working capital, and
 the
 assumption by DHI of approximately 6.3 million in debt associated with the
 Park
 Assets. 

In
 connection with the acquisition of the Park Assets, DHI also entered into a
 new
 credit facility with Bank of Texas, the prior lender to Park Pharmacy
 Corporation. This new facility provides for three notes, aggregating
 approximately 5.5 million. Each note bears interest at six percent and matures
 in three years. Although DHI has committed to use commercially reasonable
 efforts to locate a replacement lender as soon as possible, DHI is obligated
 to
 make monthly payments 
 (consisting of both interest and principal payments, as applicable) 
 to the
 bank of approximately 56,000. The new credit facility is secured by
 substantially all of the assets of DHI, including the stock of its operating
 subsidiaries. 

In
 connection with the acquisition of the Park Assets, DHI entered into a three
 year supply agreement with AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation
 AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which DHI and our newly acquired indirect
 subsidiaries agreed to purchase prescription and over-the-counter
 pharmaceuticals from AmerisourceBergen through March 2007. This supply agreement
 will also provide us with pricing and payment terms that are improved from
 those
 previously provided by AmerisourceBergen to Park Pharmacy. In exchange for
 these
 improved terms, DHI has agreed to acquire 85 of its prescription
 pharmaceuticals and substantially all of its generic pharmaceutical products
 from AmerisourceBergen and agreed to minimum monthly purchases of 900,000
 of
 all products in order to obtain new favorable pricing terms. AmerisourceBergen
 was a creditor of the operating non-debtor subsidiaries and, in connection
 with
 the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding, AmerisourceBergen agreed to accept a
 cash
 payment of approximately 1.1 million and a promissory note in the amount of
 approximately 750,000 payable by DHI over a period of five years, using a
 15-year amortization schedule and an interest rate of six percent with the
 last
 payment being a balloon payment of the outstanding principal and accrued but
 unpaid interest.

Description
 of Business 

Dougherty s
 Pharmacy 

Dougherty s
 Pharmacy is a turn-key multi-service pharmacy located in a highly prestigious
 area of Dallas. Centrally located, Dougherty s continues to provide a level of
 service not provided by national pharmacy chain stores. We fulfill any
 prescription need, from the simplest to the most complex compounding
 prescriptions. Most national pharmacy chains do not provide complex pharmacy
 prescription services. We specialize in providing solutions for our customers 
pharmacy needs. The company s long history began in 1929 and continues today as
 one of Dallas s oldest, largest and best-known full-service pharmacies, which
 also include durable medical equipment and its home healthcare and other
 pharmacy services. We have a customer service oriented philosophy and typically
 do not attempt to compete solely based on price, as is the case with most of
 the
 national pharmacy chains. 

Medicine
 Man Pharmacies 

Medicine
 Man Pharmacies operates three community pharmacies in a market south of Houston,
 Texas. Medicine Man Pharmacies started business in 1966, and it focuses on
 offering patient pharmacy care on a very personalized and individual basis.
 In
 addition to filling prescriptions, the Medicine Man Pharmacies also offer
 specialized Diabetic care departments; services in nutritional and homeopathic
 treatment, and carry an extensive line of vitamins. Two of the Medicine Man
 Pharmacies stores contain compounding labs to provide specialization in
 prescriptions for patients that have needs other than those readily available
 in
 manufactured versions. Like Dougherty s Pharmacy, Medicine Man Pharmacies
 provide a high level of customer service and solutions for customer s pharmacy
 needs that are typically absent in national pharmacy chain stores. 

Discontinued
 Operations - Park InfusionCare 

Park
 InfusionCare is a specialty pharmacy company which specializes in full service
 home infusion therapy offering full nursing and pharmacy services for home
 infusion therapies. The infusion therapies include antibiotics, total parenteral
 nutrition, intravenous immunoglobulin and other intravenous therapies. The
 primary business referral sources include case managers from hospitals,
 insurance carriers as well as doctors, home health agencies and nursing homes.
 Park InfusionCare has three offices located in Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.
 Park InfusionCare s business territory includes most of South, Central and East
 Texas. All three offices have infusion suites located in each office for the
 convenience of our clientele. The Dallas and San Antonio offices have been
 in
 business for over 10 years whereas the Houston office began operations in
 January 2003. 

On
 November 3, 2005, the Company issued a press release announcing that the board
 of directors of DHI committed to a plan to explore strategic alternatives for
 its infusion therapy business, Park InfusionCare. DHI has retained the services
 of The Braff Group, a financial advisor, to assist in exploring strategic
 alternatives for Park InfusionCare. Neither the timing nor the benefits of
 a
 strategic transaction for Park InfusionCare, if any, can be determined at this
 time, and the Company can give no assurance that any strategic transaction
 will
 occur.

CRESA
 Capital Markets Group, L.P. 

In
 2002,
 the Company formed a capital markets subsidiary, CRESA Capital Markets Group,
 L.P., Capital Markets and entered into a licensing and co-marketing
 agreement with CRESA Partners LLC, a national real estate services firm. Jim
 Leslie, our Chairman, also serves as an advisor to the Board of Directors of
 CRESA Partners, LLC. Kevin Hayes, Chairman of our consolidated subsidiary CRESA
 Partners of Orange County, LP, also serves as the Chief Executive Officer of
 CRESA Partners, LLC. 

Capital
 Markets provides real estate financial advisory services and strategic real
 estate advisory services to corporate clients on a fee basis. These services
 include, but are not limited to, analysis, consulting, acquisition and/or
 disposition of property, capital placement and acquisition, contract
 negotiation, and other matters related to real estate finance. Capital Markets
 is accounted for as a consolidated entity in our consolidated financial
 statements. 

We
 own
 80 of Capital Markets through our 80 ownership of ASE Investments Corporation
 ASE Investments and our 100 ownership of Ascendant CRESA LLC, which is the
 0.1 general partner in Capital Markets. ASE Investments owns the 99.9 limited
 partnership interest of Capital Markets. The remaining 20 of Capital Markets
 and ASE Investments is owned, directly or indirectly, by Brant Bryan, Cathy
 Sweeney and David Stringfield, who are principals in Capital Markets and
 shareholders in the Company. 

Effective
 September 1, 2005, Capital Markets entered into an advisory services agreement
 with Fairways Equities whereby Fairways Equities will provide all of the
 professional and administrative services required by Capital Markets. In
 exchange, Capital Markets will pay Fairways Equities an administrative fee
 of
 25 of gross revenues and a compensation fee of 40 of gross revenues, as
 compensation to the principals working on the transaction that generated the
 corresponding revenues. Under the terms of the agreement, Fairways Equities
 assumed all of the administrative expenses, including payroll, of CRESA Capital
 Markets. Fairways Equities will only receive payments under the agreement if
 its
 principals close a real estate capital markets advisory transaction that
 generates revenue for Capital Markets. The impact of this agreement on Capital

 fees to Fairways Equities under the advisory services agreement. 

CRESA
 Partners of Orange County, L.P. 

Description
 of Acquisition 

Effective
 May 1, 2004, we acquired through ASDS of Orange County, Inc. ASDS all of the
 issued and outstanding stock of CRESA Partners of Orange County, Inc., a
 California corporation f/k/a The Staubach Company - West, Inc. CPOC ),
 pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement dated March 23, 2004 between Kevin
 Hayes, the sole stockholder of CPOC (the Seller ), and ASDS for 6.9 million,
 plus closing costs. CPOC is located in Newport Beach, California and provides
 tenant representation services to commercial and industrial users of real
 estate, which include strategic real estate advisory services, lease management
 services, facility and site acquisition and disposition advice; design,
 construction and development consulting; and move coordination. 

Pursuant
 to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the purchase price was paid
 pursuant to the terms of a 6.9 million promissory note (the Acquisition Note payable to the Seller. The Acquisition Note is secured by a pledge of all of
 the
 personal property of CPOC, bears interest payable monthly at the prime rate
 of
 Northern Trust Bank plus 0.50 per annum, with principal generally payable
 quarterly in arrears over a three year period from the excess cash flow of
 ASDS,
 as defined, and is guaranteed by the Company. The then outstanding principal
 balance of the Acquisition Note is payable in full on May 1, 2007.

The
 purchase price is subject to adjustment downward (by an amount not to exceed
 1.9 million) to reflect the operating results of CPOC during the four year
 period ending December 31, 2007 if CPOC s revenues are less than an aggregate of
 34.0 million during such period. From the date of acquisition on May 1, 2004
 through December 31, 2005, CPOC s cumulative revenues were
 22,034,000. 

Following
 the acquisition of CPOC, ASDS contributed the assets and liabilities of CPOC
 to
 CRESA Partners of Orange County, LP (the Operating LP that is owned jointly
 by (i) CRESA Partners-Hayes, Inc., a California corporation f/k/a The Staubach
 Company of California, Inc. that is the general partner of the Operating LP
 (the
 General Partner ), (ii) ASDS, a limited partner of the Operating LP, (iii) the
 Seller, a limited partner of the Operating LP, and (iv) a Delaware limited
 liability company controlled by the management and key employees of CPOC that
 is
 a limited partner of the Operating LP (the MGMT LLC ). The General Partner is
 controlled by the management and key employees of CPOC. ASDS is entitled to
 receive 99 of the profits of the Operating LP until such time as ASDS has
 received cumulative distributions from the Operating LP equal to the Purchase
 Price plus a preferential return of approximately 1.7 million (total
 distributions equal to 8.6 million), at which time the allocation of the
 profits of the Operating LP shall become: 79.9 to MGMT LLC, 10 to ASDS, 10 
 to
 the Seller and 0.1 to the General Partner. The following is a summary of
 distributions received by ASDS from the Operating LP and the use of those

In
 connection with the acquisition of CPOC, the Company was entitled to receive
 a
 structuring fee of 690,000, plus interest thereon, of which 230,000 was paid
 at closing and 230,000 was paid on May 1, 2005. The remainder of 230,000,
 plus
 interest thereon is payable on May 1, 2006. The structuring fee has been
 eliminated in the consolidation of the Company with CPOC and the Operating
 LP in
 the consolidated financial statements of the Company. 

The
 results of operations of the Operating LP will be consolidated with ASDS and
 ultimately the Company, in accordance with FIN 46R Consolidation of Variable
 Interest Entities , until such time that ASDS has received cumulative
 distributions equal to the Purchase Price plus a preferential return of
 approximately 1.7 million (total distributions of 8.6 million). When and
 if
 the total distributions equal to 8.6 million are fully paid, our residual
 interest will become 10 and the principles of consolidation for financial
 reporting purposes will no longer be satisfied under FIN 46R or APB 18, Equity
 Method for Investments in Common Stock . Accordingly, we would no longer
 consolidate the results of operations of the Operating LP and we would instead
 record our share of income from the Operating LP as Investment Income in our
 consolidated statement of operations.

Ampco
 Partners, Ltd. 

In
 2002,
 we invested 400,000 for a 10 limited partnership interest in Ampco Partners,
 Ltd. Ampco ), a newly formed entity, which acquired the assets and
 intellectual property of the Ampco Safety Tools division of Ampco Metals
 Incorporated of Milwaukee, Wisconsin in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding.
 Ampco Safety Tools, founded in 1922, is a leading manufacturer of non-sparking,
 non-magnetic and corrosion resistant safety tools. These tools are designed
 to
 meet Occupational Safety and Health Administration and National Fire Protection
 Association requirements for use in locations where flammable vapors of
 combustible residues are present. Safety tools are used in industrial
 applications, primarily in manufacturing and maintenance operations. We receive
 quarterly distributions based upon 10 of Ampco s reported quarterly earnings
 before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, or EBITDA. Our
 investment in Ampco is accounted for under the equity method. We recognize
 our
 proportionate share of Ampco s net income, as Equity in income (losses) of
 equity method investees in the consolidated statements of operations. If we
 receive distributions in excess of our equity in earnings, they are accounted
 for as a reduction of our investment in Ampco. 

Our
 distributions from Ampco for the years ending December 31 are as follows, and
 management is not aware of any factors that would materially change such
 distributions going forward:

Fairways
 Equities, LLC 

During
 the fourth quarter of 2003, we entered into a participation agreement (the
 Participation Agreement with Fairways Equities LLC Fairways ), an entity
 controlled by Jim Leslie, our Chairman, and Brant Bryan, Cathy Sweeney and
 David
 Stringfield who are principals of Capital Markets and shareholders of the
 Company Fairways Members ), pursuant to which we will receive up to 20 of the
 profits realized by Fairways in connection with certain real estate acquisitions
 made by Fairways. Additionally, we will have an opportunity, but not the
 obligation, to invest in the transactions undertaken by Fairways, through our
 80 owned subsidiary, ASE Investments. Our profit participation with Fairways
 is
 subject to modification or termination by Fairways at the end of 2005 in the
 event that the aggregate level of cash flow (as defined in the Participation
 Agreement) generated by our acquired operating entities has not reached 2
 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. For the twelve months
 ended December 31, 2005, the Company did not meet this cash flow requirement
 and
 there has been no action taken by the Fairways Members to terminate the
 Participation Agreement. The Company is currently negotiating with the Fairways
 Members to modify the Participation Agreement, however, there can be no
 assurances that a mutually acceptable modification can be reached. We are unable
 to determine what real estate Fairways, may acquire or the cost, type, location,
 or other specifics about such real estate. There can be no assurances that
 we
 will be able to generate the required cash flow to continue in the Participation
 Agreement after 2005, or that Fairways will be able to acquire additional real
 estate assets, that we will choose to invest in such real estate acquisitions
 or
 that there will be profits realized by such real estate investments. We do
 not
 have an investment in Fairways, but rather a profits interest through our
 Participation Agreement. 

Fairways
 03 New Jersey, LP 

During
 December 2003, we made a capital contribution of 145,000 to Fairways 03 New
 Jersey, LP Fairways NJ which, through a partnership with an institutional
 investor, acquired the stock of a company whose sole asset was a single tenant
 office building and entered into a long-term credit tenant lease with the former
 owner of the building.

Table
 of
 Contents 

In
 December 2003, subsequent to the closing of this transaction, our capital
 contribution of 145,000 was distributed back to us. The Company received a
 distribution of approximately 680,000 on December 30, 2005 from Fairways NJ,
 which represented the Company s share in the profit from the sale of a single
 tenant commercial real estate property interest, the sole asset held by Fairways
 NJ. In addition to the distribution, cash of 162,000, representing the
 Company s share of the total escrow, is being held in escrow to fund any amounts
 owed by Fairways NJ to the purchaser, including any amounts owed for standard
 representations warranties under the sale agreement. The balance of the
 escrow account, if any, is expected to be released in December 2006. Since
 the
 date of the property interest acquisition, the Company has received cumulative
 cash distributions of approximately 1,280,000 on its initial investment of
 145,000 in Fairways NJ. 

Fairways
 36864, LP 

In
 April
 2004, we invested approximately 97,000 through ASE Investments for a 24.75 
 interest in Fairways 36864, LP, (whose other partners also included the Fairways
 Members) that participated in the development of and leaseback of single tenant
 commercial properties. In August and October 2004 these properties were sold
 and
 we recognized investment income of 84,000 in addition to the return of our
 original investment of 97,000. 

Fairways
 Frisco, LP 

On
 December 31, 2004, Fairways Frisco, L.P. (Fairways Frisco) acquired certain
 indirect interests in various partnerships (the Frisco Square Partnerships that own properties (the Properties in the Frisco Square mixed-use real
 estate development in Frisco, Texas, pursuant to a Master Agreement Regarding
 Frisco Square Partnerships Master Agreement ). Frisco Square is planned to
 include approximately 4 million developed square feet, including retail,
 offices, multi-family and municipal space. 

The
 parties to the Master Agreement were the Fairways Group, the Frisco Square
 Partnerships, Cole and Mary Pat McDowell, and the remainder of the Five Star
 Group which is Five Star Development Co., Inc., a Texas corporation, CMP
 Management, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, and CMP Family Limited
 Partnership, a Texas limited partnership. "Frisco Square Partnerships" is a
 group of entities comprised of Frisco Square, Ltd. ("FSLTD"), Frisco Square
 B1-6
 F1-11, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership, Frisco Square B1-7 F1-10, Ltd., a
 Texas limited partnership, and Frisco Square Properties, Ltd., a Texas limited
 partnership. "Fairways Group" is a group of entities comprised of Fairways
 Frisco, Fairways B1-6 F1-11, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, Fairways
 B1-7 F1-10, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, and Fairways FS Properties,
 LLC, a Texas limited liability company. 

As
 further described herein, the Company holds a limited partnership interest
 in
 Fairways Frisco. The Company is not involved in the development or management
 of
 Frisco Square, rather it is solely a limited partner. The Company has invested
 1,219,000 of cash into Fairways Frisco and holds a 14 limited partnership
 interest as of December 31, 2005. The Company was the initial contributing
 limited partner to Fairways Frisco and thus initially owned more than its
 current 14 limited partnership interest. However, as additional limited
 partners have made contributions, the Company s interest has declined. The
 Company has made no additional capital contributions subsequent to December
 31,
 2005. However, Fairways Frisco is expected to request additional capital
 contributions from the limited partners. At present, the Company does not intend
 to fund any additional capital requested from Fairways Frisco. The Company
 expects its limited partnership interest will be reduced further as additional
 limited partner contributions are received and the Company does not fund its
 limited partnership share of such capital contributions into Fairways
 Frisco. Fairways
 Frisco made a capital call for 1.9 million in February 2006, which was not
 funded by the Company and thus will dilute the Company s limited partnership
 interest to approximately 11 .

 Frisco s share of the Net Appraised Value in the table above would be
 approximately 29.4 million based upon the distribution terms and preferences
 in
 the Frisco Square Partnerships partnership agreements. The Company s share of
 this amount would be approximately 4.0 million based on its ownership of 14 
 of
 the limited partnership interests at December 31, 2005, which would be reduced
 to approximately 3.3 million as a result of the February 2006 capital call
 which was not funded by the Company. The
 Net
 Appraised Value in the table above is based on an appraisal provided annually
 to
 its partners by the Frisco Square Partnerships pursuant to their partnership
 agreements. There can be no assurance that the real property held by the Frisco
 Square Partnerships could be sold at the Net Appraised Value. The marketability
 and value of each property will depend upon many factors beyond our control
 and
 beyond the control of the Frisco Square Partnerships. Since investments in
 real
 property are generally illiquid, there is no assurance that there will be a
 market for the Frisco Square Partnerships properties. Furthermore, our
 partnership interest in Fairways Frisco is illiquid and represents a minority
 interest in Fairways Frisco, which may or may not be valued according to the
 liquidation value of the Frisco Square Partnerships. 

On
 April
 15, 2005, the parties to the Master Agreement agreed to terminate the Master
 Agreement effective as of April 15, 2005. In connection with the termination
 of
 the Master Agreement, the Frisco Square Partnerships were amended such that
 Fairways Frisco owns, either directly or indirectly, 60 of the Frisco Square
 Partnerships. The remaining 40 is owned by CMP Family Limited Partnership
 CMP ), which is controlled by Cole McDowell. CMP s partnership interest is
 subject to further reduction and dilution as discussed below. Under the terms
 of
 the amended Frisco Square Partnerships, Fairways Frisco also has a first
 priority distribution preference of 5.5 million, and it will receive its
 pro-rata partnership interest of the next 9.5 million of distributions from
 the
 Frisco Square Partnerships. After 15 million of distributions have been made,
 Fairways Frisco s interest in the Cash Flow of the Frisco Square Partnerships,
 as defined in the partnership agreements, will become 80 and CMP s interest
 will become 20 . 

Furthermore,
 Fairways Frisco s partnership interest in the Frisco Square Partnerships may be
 increased up to 85 if certain capital call and limited partner capital loan
 provisions are not met by CMP. If Fairways Frisco s partnership interest in the
 Frisco Square Partnerships is increased in the future, the Company s indirect
 interest in the Frisco Square Partnerships would also increase on a pro-rata
 basis with its investment in Fairways Frisco. During the year ended December
 31,
 2005, CMP met the capital loan provisions by providing a 400,000 cash loan
 as
 required under the partnership agreement. Subsequent to December 31, 2005,
 an
 additional 400,000 capital loan request due from CMP was funded as
 required. Accordingly,
 Fairways Frisco s partnership interest remains at 60 . 

Under
 the
 terms of the amended Frisco Square Partnerships agreements, Fairways Equities,
 LLC ("FEL") is now the sole general partner of the Frisco Square Partnerships
 and controls all operating activities, financing activities and development
 activities for the Frisco Square Partnerships.

Also
 on
 April 15, 2005, Fairways Frisco, through Frisco Square Land, Ltd., a newly
 created partnership, closed a financing transaction, the proceeds of which
 were
 used to repay the outstanding bank debt of Frisco Square, Ltd and to provide
 additional working capital for Fairways Frisco. Under the terms of the now
 terminated Master Agreement, Fairways Frisco held an option to acquire 50 
 of
 the partnership interests of Frisco Square, Ltd. Concurrently with the
 financing, all of the land and related development held by Frisco Square, Ltd.
 was transferred to Frisco Square Land, Ltd. in exchange for repayment of the
 bank debt, and the option to acquire 50 of the partnership interests of Frisco
 Square, Ltd. was cancelled. As a result of these changes, Fairways Frisco now
 has no interest in Frisco Square, Ltd. Fairways Frisco owns 60 of Frisco Square
 Land, Ltd., subject to the same increases for preference distributions and
 dilution to CMP if certain capital call and limited partner capital loan
 provisions are not met by CMP as discussed above. 

The
 Company has not guaranteed any of the debt of the Frisco Square Partnerships
 or
 Fairways Frisco, L.P. The Company is not involved with any management, financing
 or other operating activities of the Frisco Square Partnerships or Fairways
 Frisco. However, in May 2005, the Company entered into an agreement with FEL,
 pursuant to which the Company is entitled to receive 25 of the fees paid to
 FEL
 pursuant to the Fairways Frisco partnership agreement. These fees, including
 a
 monthly management fee, represent compensation to the Company for supplying
 resources to execute the initial transaction with the Frisco Square Partnerships
 in December 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company received
 fees allocated from FEL of 64,000 under this agreement. 

On
 April
 6, 2006, CMP delivered an offer to the Fairways Group to purchase 100 of
 the
 Fairways Group s interests, pursuant to the buy/sell provisions of the
 various partnership agreements. The offer of 79 million, before repayment
 of
 the Fairways Group s debts, requires the Fairways Group to respond within 60
 days to the offer, electing to either accept the offer, or to buy CMP s
 interests based on the same valuation. Once the Fairways Group responds,
 the
 selected buyer (either the Fairways Group or CMP) will be required to close
 the
 purchase of the other partner interest within 60 days. Pursuant to the
 partnership agreements, financing of the purchase may be structured with
 a 20 
 cash payment and the balance payable in four equal installments annually,
 with
 interest at the prime rate plus 2 payable quarterly. As of the date of this
 report, the Fairways Group had not responded to CMP s offer. The
 Company is not a direct party to the buy/sell provisions described above. 
 However,
 t he
 Company s aggregate share of this offer amount would be approximately 2.3
 million over four years, assuming distribution of the sale proceeds based
 on its
 ownership of 11 of the limited partnership interests subsequent to the February
 2006 capital call which the Company did not fund.

ITEM
 1A. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS 

We
 have limited funds and may require additional financing. 

We
 have
 very limited funds, and such funds may not be adequate to take advantage of
 available business opportunities or fund the ones that we have acquired. Our
 ultimate success may depend upon our ability to raise additional capital. We
 have not investigated the availability, source, or terms that might govern
 the
 acquisition of additional capital and will not do so until we determine a more
 definitive and specific need for additional financing. Our access to capital
 is
 more limited since our stock is no longer traded on the NASDAQ National Market,
 since there is limited trading activity in our stock, since we incurred
 significant debt as a result of our acquisitions in 2004, and since expect
 to
 incur additional debt in order to acquire entities in the future. In addition,
 one of our subsidiaries has committed to use commercially reasonable efforts
 to
 replace the loan facilities associated with the acquisition of the Park Assets,
 which could impair our ability to locate capital for other needs. If additional
 capital is needed, there is no assurance that funds will be available from
 any
 source or, if available, that they can be obtained on terms acceptable to us.
 If
 not available, our operations will be limited to those that can be financed
 with
 our existing capital. 

We
 own subsidiaries that are highly leveraged. 

Our
 subsidiaries are highly leveraged and, as a holding company, we depend on our
 subsidiaries revenues and cash flows to meet our obligations. Due to the high
 leverage, the availability of funds from these subsidiaries may be limited
 by
 contractual restrictions. Additionally, the degree to which our subsidiaries
 are
 leveraged has important consequences, including, but not limited to, the
 reduction in cash flow available to us for our operations and for future
 acquisitions, increased vulnerability to changes in economic conditions and
 the
 impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital,
 capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other
 purposes. 

We
 may not be able to effectively integrate and manage our operating
 subsidiaries. 

Our
 failure to effectively manage our recent and anticipated future growth could
 strain our management infrastructure and other resources and adversely affect
 our results of operations. We expect our recent and anticipated future growth
 to
 present management, infrastructure, systems, and other operating issues and
 challenges. These issues include controlling expenses, retention of employees,
 the diversion of management attention, the development and application of
 consistent internal controls and reporting processes, the integration and
 management of a geographically diverse group of employees, and the monitoring
 of
 third parties. 

Any
 change in management may make it more difficult to integrate an acquired
 business with our existing operations. Any failure to address these issues
 at a
 pace consistent with our business could cause inefficiencies, additional
 operating expenses and inherent risks and financial reporting
 difficulties. 

We
 are dependent upon management. 

We
 currently have two individuals who are serving as management, including our
 President and CEO, and our Chief Financial Officer. We are heavily dependent
 upon our management s skills, talents and abilities to implement our business
 plan. Because investors will not be able to evaluate the merits of possible
 business acquisitions by us, they should critically assess the information
 concerning our management and Board of Directors. In addition to our own
 employees, we use from time to time and are dependent upon, various consultants
 or contractors to perform various support services including, legal and
 accounting. 

We
 are dependent on a small staff to execute our business plan.

Because
 of the limited size of our staff, each acquisition becomes more difficult to
 integrate. Furthermore, it is difficult to maintain a complete segregation
 of
 duties related to the authorization, recording, processing and reporting of
 all
 transactions. In addition, our strategy of acquiring operating businesses will
 require our management and other personnel to devote significant amounts of
 time
 to integrating the acquired businesses with our existing operations. These
 efforts may temporarily distract their attention from day-to-day business and
 other business opportunities.

Certain
 of our subsidiaries account for a significant percentage of our
 revenues. 

In
 2005,
 DHI accounted for approximately 68 of our revenue. In the future, one or more
 of our subsidiaries may continue to account for a significant percentage of
 our
 revenue. The reliance on any of these subsidiaries for a significant percentage
 of our revenue and their subsequent failure could negatively affect our results
 of operations. 

Unforeseen
 costs associated with the acquisition of new businesses could reduce our
 profitability. 

We
 have
 implemented our business strategy and made acquisitions of new businesses that
 may not prove to be successful. We now own an interest in six businesses,
 operating in different industries and we do not have experience in some of
 these
 areas. It is likely that we will encounter unanticipated difficulties and
 expenditures relating to our acquired businesses, including contingent
 liabilities, or needs for significant management attention that would otherwise
 be devoted to our other businesses. These costs may negatively affect our
 results of operations. Unforeseen costs at our recently acquired and to be
 acquired businesses, which have significant liabilities and commitments, could
 result in the inability to make required payments on indebtedness, which could
 result in a loss of our investments in these companies and, in the case of
 CPOC,
 require us to make payments under our guaranty. 

We
 may enter into additional leveraged transactions in connection with an
 acquisition opportunity. 

Based
 on
 our current cash position, it is likely that if we enter into any additional
 acquisitions, such acquisitions will be leveraged, i.e., we may finance the
 acquisition of the business opportunity by borrowing against the assets of
 the
 business opportunity to be acquired, or against the projected future revenues
 or
 profits of the business opportunity. This could increase our exposure to larger
 losses. A business opportunity acquired through a leveraged transaction is
 profitable only if it generates enough revenues to cover the related debt and
 expenses. Failure to make payments on the debt incurred to purchase the business
 opportunity could result in the loss of a portion or all of the assets acquired.
 There is no assurance that any business opportunity acquired through a leveraged
 transaction will generate sufficient revenues to cover the related debt and
 expenses. 

We
 are restricted on our use of net operating loss
 carryforwards. 

At
 December 31, 2005, we had accumulated approximately 51 million of federal
 net
 operating loss carryforwards and approximately 21 million of state net
 operating loss carryforwards, which may be used to offset taxable income and
 reduce income taxes in future years. The use of these losses to reduce future
 income taxes will depend on the generation of sufficient taxable income prior
 to
 the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards. 

The
 carryforwards, if not fully utilized, will expire from 2018 to 2024. Section
 382
 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code imposes an annual
 limitation on the portion of our net operating loss carryforwards that may
 be
 used to offset taxable income. We believe that the issuance of shares of common
 stock pursuant to the initial public offering on November 15, 1999 caused an
 ownership change for purposes of Section 382 of the Code on such date.
 Consequently, we believe that utilization of the portion of our net operating
 loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to November 16, 1999 is
 limited by Section 382 of the Code. The date of an ownership change is based
 upon a factual determination of the value of our stock on such date. If the
 ownership change was determined to have occurred at a date after November 15,
 1999, additional net operating loss carryforwards would be limited by Section
 382 of the Code. In addition, a second ownership change may occur in the
 future as a result of future changes in the ownership of our stock, including
 our issuance of stock in connection with our acquisition of a business. A second
 ownership change would result in Code Section 382 limiting our deduction of
 our future net operating loss carryforwards. 

Our
 results of operations are difficult to predict. 

Although
 we generated net income of 65,000 and 249,000 for the years ended December
 31,
 2005 and 2004 respectively, we have historically incurred net operating losses.
 The Company experienced net losses of approximately 818,000 and 728,000 for
 the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. There can be no
 assurance that we will continue to achieve profitability in the
 future.

RISKS
 SPECIFIC TO OUR OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES 

Dougherty s
 Holdings, Inc. 

We
 may not be able to enter into a successful transaction to sell or otherwise
 dispose of our Park InfusionCare business. 

On
 November 3, 2005, 
 we
 issued a press release announcing that the board of directors of DHI committed
 to a plan to explore strategic alternatives for its infusion therapy business,
 Park InfusionCare. DHI has retained the services of The Braff Group to assist
 in
 exploring strategic alternatives for Park InfusionCare. Neither the timing
 nor
 the benefits of a strategic transaction for Park InfusionCare, if any, can
 be
 determined at this time, and the Company can give no assurance that any
 strategic transaction will occur. If we are unable to successfully complete
 a
 sale of Park InfusionCare, our working capital position will be adversely
 affected. 

Our
 pharmacy subsidiary is subject to extensive regulation. 

Our
 pharmacists and pharmacies are required to be licensed by the Texas State Board
 of Pharmacy. The pharmacies are also registered with the federal Drug
 Enforcement Administration. By virtue of these license and registration
 requirements, the entities owned by DHI are obligated to observe certain rules
 and regulations, and a violation of such rules and regulations could result
 in
 fines and/or in a suspension or revocation of a license or registration. We
 believe that the operating entities owned by DHI currently have all the
 regulatory approvals necessary to conduct its business. However, we can give
 no
 assurance that they will be able to maintain compliance with existing
 regulations. 

In
 recent
 years, an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or
 proposed in Congress and in some state legislatures that would effect major
 changes in the health care system, either nationally or at the state level.
 We
 cannot predict whether any federal or state health care reform legislation
 will
 eventually be passed, and if so, the impact thereof on DHI s financial position
 or results of operations. Health care reform, if implemented, could adversely
 affect the pricing of prescription drugs or the amount of reimbursement from
 governmental agencies and managed care payors, and consequently could be adverse
 to DHI and therefore, to us. However, to the extent health care reform expands
 the number of persons receiving health care benefits covering the purchase
 of
 prescription drugs, it may also result in increased purchases of such drugs
 and
 could thereby have a favorable impact on both DHI and the drug industry in
 general. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that any future federal or
 state health care reform legislation will not adversely affect us, including
 our
 subsidiary DHI, or the retail drugstore industry generally. 

In
 addition, a portion of DHI revenue is derived from high-end, technical pharmacy
 services, such as compounded prescriptions, intravenous infusion, injectables
 and pain management products that are not typically offered by chain drug
 stores, grocery pharmacies or mass merchandise pharmacies. Recently, there
 has
 been some controversy about the lack of federal regulation of these services.
 Additional federal and/or state regulations could also affect our business
 by
 putting additional burdens on us. 

If
 we do not adequately respond to competitive pressures, demand for our products
 and services could decrease. 

Our
 retail pharmacies operate in a highly competitive industry. The markets we
 serve
 are subject to relatively few barriers to entry. These pharmacies compete
 primarily on the basis of customer service, convenience of location and store
 design, price and product mix and selection. Some of our competitors have
 greater financial, technical, marketing and managerial resources than we have.
 Local, regional and national companies are currently competing in many of the
 health care markets we serve and others may do so in the future. In addition
 to
 traditional competition from independent pharmacies and other pharmacy chains,
 our pharmacies face competition from discount stores, supermarkets, combination
 food and drugstores, mail order distributors, hospitals and HMO s. These other
 formats have experienced significant growth in their market share of the
 prescription and over-the-counter drug business. Consolidation among our
 competitors, such as pharmacy benefit managers (PBM s) and regional and national
 infusion pharmacy or specialty pharmacy providers could result in price
 competition and other competitive factors that could cause a decline in our
 revenue and profitability. 

-16- 

Table

 Contents 

We
 expect
 to continue to encounter competition in the future that could limit our ability
 to grow revenue and/or maintain acceptable pricing levels. 

Risk
 related to third party payors. 

DHI s
 revenues and profitability are affected by the continuing efforts of all
 third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care by lowering
 reimbursement rates, narrowing the scope of covered services, increasing case
 management review of services and negotiating reduced contract pricing. Any
 changes in reimbursement levels from these third-party payor sources and any
 changes in applicable government regulations could have a material adverse
 effect on DHI s revenues and profitability. Changes in the mix of patients among
 Medicare, Medicaid and other payor sources may also impact DHI s revenues and
 profitability. There can be no assurance that DHI will continue to maintain
 the
 current payor or revenue mix. 

Collectibility
 of accounts receivable. 

DHI s
 failure to maintain its controls and processes over billing and collecting,
 or
 the deterioration of the financial condition of its payors, could have a
 significant negative impact on its results of operations and financial
 condition. The
 collection of accounts receivable is one of DHI s most significant challenges
 and requires constant focus and involvement by management and ongoing
 enhancements to information systems and billing center operating procedures.
 Further some of DHI s payors and/or patients may experience financial
 difficulties, or may otherwise not pay accounts receivable when due, resulting
 in increased write-offs. There can be no assurance that DHI will be able to
 maintain its current levels of collectibility and days sales outstanding in
 future periods. If DHI is unable to properly bill and collect its accounts
 receivable, its results will be adversely affected. 

We
 are substantially dependent on a single supplier of pharmaceutical products
 to
 sell products to us on satisfactory terms. A disruption in our relationship
 with
 this supplier could have a material adverse effect on our
 business. 

We
 obtain
 a majority of our total merchandise, including over 90 of our pharmaceuticals,
 from a single supplier, AmerisourceBergen, with whom we have a long-term supply
 contract. Any significant disruptions in our relationship with
 AmerisourceBergen, or deterioration in AmerisourceBergen s financial condition,
 could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Failure
 to maintain sufficient sales to qualify for favorable pricing under our long
 term supply contract could increase the costs of our
 products. 

Our
 long
 term supply agreement with AmerisourceBergen provides us with pricing and credit
 terms that are improved from those previously provided by AmerisourceBergen
 to
 Park Pharmacy Corporation. In exchange for these improved terms, DHI has agreed
 to acquire 85 of its prescription pharmaceuticals and substantially all of
 its
 generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen and to maintain certain
 minimum dollar monthly purchases. If we are unable to satisfy minimum monthly
 purchase requirements of 900,000, we may be required to purchase our
 pharmaceutical products on less favorable pricing and credit terms. For the
 year
 ended December 31, 2005, we purchased over 23,159,000 of our pharmaceutical
 products from Amerisource Bergen, of which 3,484,000 relates to our Park
 InfusionCare subsidiary currently classified as a discontinued
 operation. 

The
 current or future shortage in licensed pharmacists, nurses and other clinicians
 could adversely affect our business. 

The
 health care industry is currently experiencing a shortage of licensed
 pharmacists, nurses and other health care professionals. Consequently, hiring
 and retaining qualified personnel will be difficult due to intense competition
 for their services and employment. Any failure to hire or retain pharmacists,
 nurses or other health care professionals could impair our ability to expand
 or
 maintain our operations.

Pharmacies
 are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of
 pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Although we maintain
 professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance, we cannot

 insurance on acceptable terms in the future. 

CRESA
 Partners of Orange County, L.P. 

We
 have numerous significant competitors, some of which may have greater financial
 resources than we do. 

We
 compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real
 estate industry, including investment management, tenant representation,
 corporate services, construction and development management, property
 management, agency leasing, valuation and mortgage banking. In general, with
 respect to each of our business disciplines, we cannot assure you that we will
 be able to continue to compete effectively or maintain our current fee
 arrangements or margin levels or that we will not encounter increased
 competition. Each of the business disciplines in which we compete is highly
 competitive on an international, national, regional and local level. Depending
 on the product or service, we face competition from other real estate service
 providers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms,
 investment managers and accounting firms, many of which may have greater
 financial resources than we do. Many of our competitors are local or regional
 firms. We are also subject to competition from other large national and
 multi-national firms. 

A
 significant portion of our operations are concentrated in southern California
 and our business could be harmed if the economic downturn continues in the
 southern California real estate markets. 

During
 2005 and 2004, a significant amount of our real estate advisory services segment
 revenue was generated from transactions originating in California. As a result
 of the geographic concentrations in California, the continuation of the economic
 downturn in the California commercial real estate markets and in the local
 economies in Orange County area could further harm our results of
 operations. 

Our
 results of operations vary significantly among quarters, which makes comparison
 of our quarterly results difficult. 

The
 nature of our business does not allow for ready comparison of operating results
 from quarter to quarter. Our transaction fees are highly dependent on
 transactions that do not occur ratably over the course of a year. 

Our
 success depends upon the retention of our senior management, as well as our
 ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced
 employees. 

Our
 continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers
 and CPOC s existing management team. The loss of one or more of our members of
 the senior management team could have a material adverse effect on CPOC.

If
 we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to real estate brokerage,
 we may incur significant financial penalties. 

Due
 to
 the nature of our operations, we are subject to numerous federal, state and
 local laws and regulations specific to the services performed. For example,
 the
 brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions requires us to maintain
 brokerage licenses in each state in which we operate. If we fail to maintain
 our
 licenses or conduct brokerage activities without a license, we may be required
 to pay fines or return commissions received or have licenses suspended.
 Furthermore, the laws and regulations applicable to our business also may change
 in ways that materially increase the cost of compliance.

We
 may have liabilities in connection with real estate brokerage
 activities. 

As
 a
 licensed real estate broker, we and our licensed employees are subject to
 statutory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations. Failure
 to
 fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from
 parties who purchased, sold or leased properties we or they brokered or managed.
 We could become subject to claims by participants in real estate transactions
 claiming that we did not fulfill our statutory obligations as a
 broker. 

RISKS
 RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE 

The
 success of real estate developments is dependant on tenants to generate lease
 revenues. 

Real
 estate developments are subject to the risk that, upon the expiration of leases
 for space located in the properties, leases may not be renewed by existing
 tenants, the space may not be re-leased to new tenants or the terms of renewal
 or releasing (including the cost of required renovations or concessions to
 tenants) may be less favorable than current lease terms. A tenant may experience
 a down-turn in its business which may cause the loss of the tenant or may weaken
 its financial condition, and result in the tenant s failure to make rental
 payments when due, result in a reduction in percentage rent receivable with
 respect to retail tenants or require a restructuring that might reduce cash
 flow
 from the lease. In addition, a tenant of any of the properties may seek the
 protection of bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar laws, which could result in
 the
 rejection and termination of such tenant s lease and thereby cause a reduction
 in our available cash flow. Although we have not experienced material losses
 from tenant bankruptcies, no assurance can be given that tenants will not file
 for bankruptcy or similar protection in the future or, if any tenants file,
 that
 they will affirm their leases or continue to make rental payments in a timely
 manner. 

Real
 estate development strategies entail certain risks. 

Real
 estate development activities entail certain risks, including: 

the
 expenditure of funds on and devotion of management s time to projects
 which may not come to fruition; 

the
 risk that development or redevelopment costs of a project may exceed
 original estimates, possibly making the project uneconomic or causing
 the
 project to raise additional cash to fund such
 costs 

the
 risk that occupancy rates and rents at a completed project will be
 less
 than anticipated or that there will be vacant space at the project;

the
 risk that expenses at a completed development will be higher than
 anticipated; and 

the
 risk that permits and other governmental approvals will not be obtained.
 Because of the discretionary nature of these approvals and concerns
 which
 may be raised by various governmental officials, public interest
 groups
 and other interested parties during the approval and development
 process,
 our ability to develop properties and realize income from our projects
 could be delayed, reduced or eliminated.

General
 economic conditions in the areas in which our properties are geographically
 concentrated may impact financial results. 

Our
 real
 estate development investments are exposed to changes in the real estate market
 or in general economic conditions in Texas. Any changes may result in higher
 vacancy rates for commercial property and lower prevailing rents, lower sales
 prices or slower sales, lower absorption rates, and more tenant defaults and
 bankruptcies, which would negatively impact our financial performance. To the
 extent that weak economic conditions or other factors affect these regions
 more
 severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be
 negatively impacted. 

Exposure
 of our assets to damage from natural occurrences such as earthquakes, and
 weather conditions that affect the progress of construction may impact financial
 results. 

Natural
 disasters, such as earthquakes, floods or fires, or unexpected climactic
 conditions, such as unusually heavy or prolonged rain, may have an adverse
 impact on our ability to develop our properties and realize income from our
 projects. 

-19- 

Table
 of
 Contents 

Illiquidity
 of real estate and reinvestment risk may reduce economic returns to investors.

Real
 estate investments are relatively illiquid and, therefore, our ability to vary
 our portfolio quickly in response to changes in economic or other conditions
 is
 limited. Further, certain significant expenditures, including property taxes,
 maintenance costs, mortgage payments, insurance costs and related charges must
 be made throughout the period of ownership of real property regardless of
 whether the real property is producing any income. 

OTHER
 RISKS 

We
 are controlled by our principal stockholders, officers and directors.

Our
 principal stockholders, officers and directors, and affiliates beneficially
 own
 approximately 53 of our Common Stock. As a result, such persons may have the
 ability to control and direct our affairs and business. Such concentration
 of
 ownership may also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change
 in control. 

We
 have certain transactions with related parties. 

We
 have
 relationships or transactions with related parties or affiliates of ours. Please
 see Note 18 of the Ascendant Consolidated Financial Statements contained
 herein. 

Our
 stock is not listed on The NASDAQ National Market. 

Our
 stock
 is quoted and traded on the OTCBB. The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service
 that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices, and volume information in
 OTC
 securities. An OTC security is not listed or traded on NASDAQ or a national
 securities exchange, and NASDAQ has no business relationship with the issuers
 quoted in the OTCBB. Issuers of all securities quoted on the OTCBB are subject
 to periodic filing requirements with the Securities and Exchange Commission
 or
 other regulatory authority. Even with OTCBB eligibility and trading, fewer
 investors have access to trade our common stock, which will limit our ability
 to
 raise capital through the sale of our securities. 

In
 addition, our common stock is subject to penny stock regulations, which could
 cause fewer brokers and market makers to execute trades in our common stock.
 This is likely to hamper our common stock trading with sufficient volume to
 provide liquidity and could cause our stock price to further decrease.

The
 penny
 stock regulations require that broker-dealers who recommend penny stocks to
 persons other than institutional accredited investors must make a special
 suitability determination for the purchaser, receive the purchaser s written
 consent to the transaction prior to the sale and provide the purchaser with
 risk
 disclosure documents which identify risks associated with investing in penny
 stocks. These requirements have historically resulted in reducing the level
 of
 trading activity in securities that become subject to the penny stock rules.
 Holders of our common stock may find it more difficult to sell their shares
 of
 common stock, which is expected to have an adverse effect on the market price
 of
 the common stock. 

We
 may be subject to litigation in the future. 

We
 may be
 subject to future litigation or claims in the normal course of business, with
 or
 without merit. These claims may result in substantial costs and divert
 management s attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business,
 prospects, financial condition and results of operations and may also harm
 our
 reputation, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our ability
 to
 pursue various strategic and financial alternatives as well as have a material
 adverse effect on our stock price. We may be unable to pay expenses or
 liabilities that may arise out of any possible legal claims.

Mr.
 James
 C. Leslie, the Company s Chairman, controls, and Mr. Will Cureton, one of our
 directors, is indirectly a limited partner in the entity that owns the building
 in which the corporate office space is sub-leased by Ascendant and DHI. Also,
 through August 2005, Capital Markets paid rent for office space in the same
 building to an entity controlled by Mr. Leslie. We consider all of these leases
 to be at market terms for comparable space in the same building. During the
 years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, Ascendant and Capital Markets
 paid
 rent of approximately 26,000, 67,200 and 45,000 directly to an entity
 controlled by Mr. Leslie. The remaining rent expense paid by Ascendant and
 DHI
 is paid under sublease agreements with an unrelated third party, and
 approximates 13,000 monthly. We also
 incur certain shared office costs with an entity controlled by Mr. Leslie,
 which
 gives rise to reimbursements from us to that entity. These costs were
 approximately 24,300, 22,800 and 3,400 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In

ITEM
 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On
 January 29, 2004, Bishopsgate Corp. and T.E. Millard filed a lawsuit in the
 192 nd 
 District
 Court of Dallas County, Texas against us, our officers and directors, and Park
 Pharmacy s officers and directors claiming that we breached obligations to fund
 Bishopsgate s proposed purchase of the Park Assets. 
 
 Mr.
 Millard filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in Dallas, Texas on August 15, 2003.
 Millard s Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation
 bankruptcy case on December 20, 2004. Upon the conversion of the bankruptcy
 case, Daniel J. Sherman was appointed Chapter 7 Trustee. In August 2005, the
 Company, its officers and directors and Park Pharmacy s officers and directors
 entered into a compromise and settlement agreement, which was approved by the
 bankruptcy court, whereby the defendants collectively paid 80,000 to the
 bankruptcy Trustee in settlement of all claims. The Company s insurance carrier
 provided the funds for the Company s portion of the settlement amount, which was
 55,000. In exchange for the settlement, and in satisfaction of the
 counterclaims filed against Millard and Bishopsgate Corp, the Company received
 all of the stock of Bishopsgate Corp. The stock has not been assigned any value
 in the Company s financial statements and it is held by a newly-formed entity,
 DM-ASD Holding, Co. 

Between
 January 23, 2001 and February 21, 2001, five putative class action lawsuits
 were
 filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas
 against us, certain of our directors, and a limited partnership of which a
 director is a partner. The five lawsuits assert causes of action under Sections
 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for an
 unspecified amount of damages on behalf of a putative class of individuals
 who
 purchased our common stock between various periods ranging from November 11,
 1999 to January 24, 2000. The lawsuits claim that we and the individual
 defendants made misstatements and omissions concerning our products and
 customers.

In
 April
 2001, the Court consolidated the lawsuits, and on July 26, 2002, plaintiffs
 filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint CAC ). We filed a motion to dismiss the
 CAC on or about September 9, 2002. On July 22, 2003, the Court granted in part
 and denied in part defendants motion to dismiss. On September 2, 2003,
 defendants filed an answer to the CAC. Plaintiffs then commenced discovery.
 On
 September 12, 2003, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, and
 on
 February 17, 2004, we filed our opposition. On July 1, 2004, the Court denied
 plaintiffs motion for certification. On
 September 8, 2004, the Fifth Circuit granted plaintiffs petition for permission
 to appeal the denial of class certification. On
 August
 23, 2005, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court s denial of class
 certification, The Company settled the lead plaintiffs remaining individual
 claims for a confidential amount, which was paid by the Company s directors' and
 officers' insurance carrier. Accordingly, the district court entered a final
 judgment dismissing the claims with prejudice on February 24, 2006. 

We
 are
 also occasionally involved in other claims and proceedings, which are incidental
 to our business. We cannot determine what, if any, material affect these matters
 will have on our future financial position and results of operations.

Our
 stock
 is quoted and traded on the OTC Bulletin Board OTCBB ). The OTCBB is a
 regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices,
 and volume information in over-the-counter OTC securities. An OTC security
 is not listed or traded on NASDAQ or a national securities exchange, and NASDAQ
 has no business relationship with the issuers quoted in the OTCBB. Issuers
 of
 all securities quoted on the OTCBB are subject to periodic filing requirements
 with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authority.
 OTCBB
 requirements include, among other things, a broker-dealer acting as a market
 maker willing to enter a quote for the securities and requires us to remain
 current in our periodic filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
 as
 amended. Even with OTCBB eligibility and trading, delisting adversely affects
 the ability or willingness of investors to purchase our common stock, which,
 in
 turn, severely affects the market liquidity of our securities. 

Following
 is a summary of our stock s quarterly market price ranges for the two most
 recent fiscal years. The price quotations noted herein represent prices between

We
 have
 not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate declaring
 dividends in the foreseeable future. Our current policy is to retain earnings,
 if any, to finance potential acquisitions and fund operations. The future
 payment of dividends will depend on the results of operations, financial
 condition, capital expenditure plans and other factors that we deem relevant
 and
 will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors.

 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
 following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Selected
 Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and notes
 thereto included elsewhere in this report. Except for the historical information
 contained herein, certain statements used in this Form 10-K are forward-looking
 statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
 as
 amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 These forward-looking statements about our financial condition, prospects,
 operations and business are generally accompanied by words such as
 anticipates, expects, estimates, believes, intends, plans or similar
 expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks,
 uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control that
 could
 cause actual results to differ materially from those forecasted or anticipated
 in such forward-looking statements. 

Factors
 that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited
 to, those discussed below under Risks Related to Our Business, Risks Specific
 to Operating Subsidiaries, and Other Risks. These
 risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, (a) the following
 general risks: our limited funds and risks of not obtaining additional funds,
 certain of our subsidiaries are highly leveraged, potential difficulties in
 integrating and managing our subsidiaries, our dependence upon management,
 our
 dependence upon a small staff, certain subsidiaries accounting for a significant
 percentage of revenue, unforeseen acquisition costs, the potential for future
 leveraged acquisitions, restrictions on the use of net operating loss
 carryforwards, and the difficulty in predicting operations; (b) the following
 risks to Dougherty s Holdings, Inc.: potential problems that may arise in
 selling the Park InfusionCare business, extensive regulation of the pharmacy
 business, the competitive nature of the retail pharmacy industry, third party
 payor attempts to reduce reimbursement rates, difficulty in collecting accounts
 receivable, dependence upon a single pharmaceutical products supplier, price
 increases as a result of our potential failure to maintain sufficient
 pharmaceutical sales, shortages in qualified employees, and liability risks
 inherent in the pharmaceutical industry; (c) the following risks to CRESA
 Partners of Orange County, L.P.: the size of our competitors, our concentration
 on the southern California real estate market, the variance of financial results
 among quarters, the inability to retain senior management and/or attract and
 retain qualified employees, the regulatory and compliance requirements of the
 real estate brokerage industry and the risks of failing to comply with such
 requirements, and the potential liabilities that arise from our real estate
 brokerage activities; (d) the following risks to our investments in real estate:
 our dependence on tenants for lease revenues, the risks inherent in real estate
 development activities, the general economic conditions of areas in which we
 focus our real estate development activities, the risks of natural disasters,
 the illiquidity of real estate investments; and (e) the following other risks:
 a
 majority of our common stock is beneficially owned by our principal
 stockholders, officers and directors, relationships and transactions with
 related parties, our stock is not traded on NASDAQ or a national securities
 exchange, effect of penny stock regulations, and
 litigation. 

Because
 such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and
 assumptions, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
 forward-looking statements, which reflect management s view only as of the date
 the forward-looking statement is made. Our forward-looking statements are based
 on the current expectations of management, and we undertake no obligation to
 update publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason, even if new
 information becomes available or other events occur in the future. The
 cautionary statements made in this report should be read as being applicable
 to
 all related forward-looking statements, wherever they appear in this report.

OVERVIEW 

 Our
 company has undergone a series of fundamental changes in the past three years,
 and as a result, our management believes that year-to-year comparisons of our
 past results are not meaningful as a basis for evaluating our future
 prospects. 

During
 2002 - 2005, we made investments and/or acquisitions, which are more fully
 described herein in Item 1, Business of Part 1 and in the Notes to the Ascendant
 Consolidated Financial Statements also included herein. 

There
 is
 no assurance that we will be able to successfully operate these acquired
 businesses or that we will be able to successfully acquire or develop continue
 to add one or more additional business enterprises in the future. 

We
 expect
 our future operating results to fluctuate. Factors that are likely to cause
 these fluctuations include: 

the
 matters discussed under the section titled Risks Related to our Business 
 and Risks Specific to Operating Subsidiaries 
 below; 

our
 ability to profitably operate our acquisitions of the Park Assets
 and CPOC
 and to pay the principal and interest on the significant debt incurred
 to
 make these acquisitions; 

our
 ability to sell Park InfusionCare, as further discussed
 herein; 

our
 success with the investments in, and operations of, Ampco, Capital
 Markets, Fairways Frisco and our participation in other Fairways
 transactions, if any; 

our
 ability to successfully defend outstanding
 litigation; 

fluctuations
 in general interest rates; 

the
 availability and cost of capital to
 us; 

the
 existence and amount of unforeseen acquisition costs;
 and 

our
 ability to locate and successfully acquire or develop one or more
 additional business enterprises.

Key
 measures used by the Company s management to evaluate business segment
 performance include revenue, cost of sales, gross profit, investment income
 and
 EBITDA. EBITDA is calculated as net income before deducting interest, taxes,
 depreciation and amortization. Although EBITDA is not a measure of actual cash
 flow because it does not consider changes in assets and liabilities that may
 impact cash balances, the Company believes it is a useful metric to evaluate
 operating performance and has therefore included such measures in the discussion
 of operating results below. 

Discontinued
 Operations 

In
 September 2005, the Company determined that it would exit the home infusion
 therapy business, which operated as part of its healthcare segment under the
 name Park InfusionCare. This will allow DHI to devote undivided focus on its
 primary business, independent specialty retail pharmacies. In connection
 therewith, the Company retained The Braff Group, a financial advisor, to assist
 in marketing Park InfusionCare for sale. The financial advisor is currently
 in
 discussions with various interested buyers. The Company can provide no assurance
 that it will be able to find a buyer for Park InfusionCare, or to the extent
 a
 buyer is found, that a transaction on terms acceptable or favorable to the
 Company will be consummated. The Company has accounted for Park InfusionCare
 as
 a discontinued operation since the third quarter of 2005.

The
 results for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflect the results of Park
 InfusionCare from the date of acquisition on March 24, 2004 to December 31,
 2004, whereas the 2005 results are comprised of the full twelve months ending
 December 31, 2005. 

The
 gross
 profit as a percentage of revenue declined from 54.6 in 2004 to 49.8 in 2005.
 The decline in gross profit percentage is due primarily to increases in
 wholesale drug prices and a change in the mix of revenue to lower margin
 therapies. The decline in interest expense is due to a decrease in the revolving
 bank debt allocated to Park InfusionCare due to a decline in its overall
 borrowing base. 

Charges
 related to discontinuance represent an accrual for retention bonuses to be
 paid
 to key employees upon the sale of Park InfusionCare. As of December 31, 2005,
 none of these accrued amounts has been paid. Other income in 2005 represents
 amounts received from third party payors which were not billed as infusion
 therapy revenue.

Revenue 

 Revenue
 increased 8,091,000 during the year ended December 31, 2005 to 29,957,000.
 The
 increase is due to increased pharmacy sales at Dougherty s Pharmacy in 2005 as a
 result of increased pricing for prescription drug sales as well as increased
 front end merchandise sales subsequent to the remodeling of Dougherty s
 Pharmacy. The increase is also due to the fact that 2004 results are reflected
 for the period from the date of acquisition on March 24, 2004 to December 31,
 2004, as compared to a full twelve months in 2005. 

Cost
 of Sales 

 Cost
 of
 sales was 21,959,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, representing 73.3 
 of revenue. Cost of sales was 74.0 of sales in 2004. The decline in cost of
 sales as a percentage of revenue in 2005 is due to an increased mix of generic
 prescriptions as compared to brand name drugs, along with improved merchandising
 and purchasing in the front end of the pharmacies. Dougherty s Pharmacy was
 remodeled in 2005, which contributed to increased sales of front end
 merchandise, which carry a higher gross margin than prescription drug sales.
 Cost of sales includes all direct costs related to the sale of products in
 pharmacies. The increase of 5,774,000 in cost of sales for the year ended
 December 31, 2005 is due primarily to the inclusion of DHI s cost of sales for
 the period from the date of acquisition on March 25, 2004 to December 31, 2004
 as compared to a full twelve months in 2005. 

Operating
 Expenses 

 Operating
 expenses increased 2,068,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 to
 8,204,000. Operating expenses represented 27.4 of revenue in 2005 as compared
 to 28.1 of revenue in 2004. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage
 of revenue is due primarily to increased pharmacy revenues combined with smaller
 increases in fixed operating expenses. The overall dollar increase in operating
 expenses is due primarily to the inclusion of DHI s operating expenses,
 including amortization of Patient Prescriptions, for the period from the date
 of
 acquisition on March 25, 2004 to December 31, 2004 as compared to a full twelve
 months in 2005. 

Interest
 Income (Expense), Net 

 Interest
 expense, net is comprised of interest expense related to the debt assumed as
 part of the acquisition of the Park Assets by DHI. Interest expense, net was
 182,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to 225,000 for
 the
 year ended December 31, 2005. Interest expense on DHI s revolving bank debt is
 fixed at six percent per annum. For the year ended December 31, 2005, interest
 expense, net increased due to inclusion of the DHI results for the period from
 the date of acquisition on March 25, 2004 to December 31, 2004 as compared
 to a
 full twelve months in 2005.

 by
 CPOC of 13,176,000 and (ii) fee revenue earned by CRESA Capital Markets of
 655,000. The increase over 2004 revenue is due primarily to the inclusion
 of
 CPOC s revenue for the period from the date of acquisition on May 1, 2004 to
 December 31, 2004 as compared to a full twelve months in 2005. 

Cost
 of Revenue 

 Cost
 of
 revenue was 8,205,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, representing 59.3 
 of revenue. Cost of revenue was 5,387,000 or 55.2 of revenue in 2004. The
 overall increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue is due to
 increased commission and referral fee costs. Cost of revenue includes all direct
 costs, including broker commissions, incurred in connection with a real estate
 advisory transaction. The increase of 2,818,000 in cost of revenue for the
 year
 ended December 31, 2004 is due primarily to the inclusion of CPOC s cost of
 revenue for the period from the date of acquisition on May 1, 2004 to December
 31, 2004 as compared to a full twelve months in 2005.

Operating
 Expenses 

 Operating
 expenses increased 864,000 from 2,479,000 to 3,343,000 for the year ended
 December 31, 2005. This increase includes a decrease of 151,000 in selling,
 general and administrative expenses at Capital Markets due to decreased
 professional bonuses due to lower transaction revenues. The increase also
 includes an increase of 926,000 for CPOC due to the inclusion of CPOC s
 operating expenses for the period from the date of acquisition on May 1, 2004
 to
 December 31, 2004 as compared to a full twelve months in 2005. 

Interest
 Income (Expense), Net 

 Interest
 expense, net is comprised of interest expense related to the debt assumed as
 part of the CPOC acquisition. Interest expense, net was 444,000 in 2005 as
 compared to 247,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase is
 partially due to an increase in the prime rate from 5.25 at December 31, 2004
 to 7.25 at December 31, 2005. The CPOC acquisition note payable bears interest
 at the Northern Trust Bank prime rate plus 0.50 . The remainder of the increase
 in interest expense is due to the inclusion of CPOC s interest expense for the
 period from the date of acquisition on May 1, 2004 to December 31, 2004 as
 compared to a full twelve months in 2005.

 Operating
 expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 were 1,157,000, or a decrease
 of
 102,000 over the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is primarily a
 result of decreased costs for legal and accounting due to the additional
 activity generated by our acquisitions of the Park Assets and CPOC in 2004.
 Operating expenses of 1,157,000 includes payroll and benefits of 515,000;
 legal expense of 111,000; insurance expense of 178,000; audit and accounting

The
 equity in earnings of Fairways NJ of 1,112,000 is comprised of earnings from
 its interest in the leasing of a single tenant commercial building and a gain
 on
 the sale of that building in 2005. Of this total, 951,000 was received is
 cash
 distributions in 2005. The remaining amount is expected to be received in cash
 as described below. The Company received a distribution of approximately
 680,000 on December 30, 2005 from Fairways NJ, which represented the Company s
 share in the profit from the sale of a single tenant commercial real estate
 property interest, the sole asset held by Fairways NJ. In addition to the
 distribution, cash of 162,000, representing the Company s share of the total
 escrow, is being held in escrow to fund any amounts owed by Fairways NJ to
 the
 purchaser, including any amounts owed for standard representations 
warranties under the sale agreement. The balance of the escrow account, if
 any,
 is expected to be released in December 2006. 

The
 equity in losses of Fairways Frisco of 537,000 represents our share of the
 net
 loss of Fairways Frisco for the year ended December 31, 2005. We made our
 initial investment in Fairways Frisco on December 31, 2004, and accordingly
 no
 equity in income (losses) of Fairways Frisco was recorded in 2004. This amount
 is a non-cash adjustment to our operating results and we have no obligation
 to
 fund the operating losses or debts of Fairways Frisco.

 under an agreement whereby the Company receives 25 of certain fees earned
 by
 FEL. 

Income
 tax provision 

 Income
 tax provision of 32,000 in 2005 represents federal alternative minimum taxes
 owed by the Company. Based on the Company s differences in income in various
 legal entities and its temporary differences between taxable income and book
 income, there was no income tax provision recorded for 2004. The Company s net
 operating loss carryforwards are limited to usage of 90 of alternative minimum
 taxable income, and therefore it will be required to pay alternative minimum
 tax
 on 10 of its alternative minimum taxable income at a statutory tax rate of
 20 .

 of
 December 31, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 3.2
 million compared to approximately 1.9 million as of December 31, 2004.

Our
 future capital needs are uncertain. Although management projects positive cash
 flow after debt service based on anticipated operations of our acquired
 businesses, there can be no assurances that this will occur. If the Company
 does
 not generate the necessary cash flow, the Company will need additional financing
 in the future to fund operations. We do not know whether additional financing
 will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will obtain financing
 on terms favorable to stockholders. 

Cash
 from Financing Activities 

Dougherty s
 Holdings, Inc. 

 During
 the year ended December 31, 2005, DHI made principal payments on its notes
 payable of 556,000, and it made no new borrowings under its bank credit
 facility. 

ASDS
 of Orange County, Inc. 

 During
 the year ended December 31, 2005, ASDS of Orange County, Inc. ASDS made
 principal payments of 718,000 on its Acquisition Note Payable to Kevin Hayes.
 There were no new borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2005 by either
 ASDS or CPOC. 

In
 connection with the acquisition of CPOC, the Company was entitled to receive
 a
 structuring fee of 690,000, plus interest thereon, of which 230,000 was paid
 at closing and 230,000 was paid on May 1, 2005. The remainder of 230,000,
 plus
 interest thereon is payable on May 1, 2006. The structuring fee has been
 eliminated in the consolidation of the Company with CPOC and the Operating
 LP in
 the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

Cash
 Flow 

During
 the year ended December 31, 2005 we had positive cash flow of approximately
 1,349,000. Cash flow provided from operating activities for the year ended
 December 31, 2005 was 4,308,000, while cash used in investing activities was
 1,671,000 and cash used in financing activities was 1,288,000. The cash used
 in investing activities was primarily for purchases of property equipment
 and investments in Fairways Frisco. The cash used in financing activities was
 primarily related to payments on the acquisition debt for DHI and
 CPOC. 

Through
 December 31, 2005, we have invested approximately 1.22 million in Fairways
 Frisco. In September 2005, the Company borrowed 225,000 from a bank and used
 the proceeds to increase its investment in Fairways Frisco. This unsecured
 bank
 note payable was repaid in full in January 2006. The Frisco Square Partnerships
 and Fairways Frisco will require additional funding in order to complete
 development of the planned project. We are not obligated to invest any
 additional funds if Fairways Frisco makes a capital call for additional cash,
 although we may choose to do so depending on our available funds. However,
 if we
 do not participate in additional capital calls, our limited partnership interest
 will be diluted. 

In
 December 2005, the Company received
 a cash distribution of approximately 680,000 from Fairways NJ, which
 represented the Company s share in the profit from the sale of a single tenant
 commercial real estate property interest, the sole asset held by Fairways NJ.
 In
 addition to the distribution, cash of 162,000, representing the Company s share
 of the total escrow, is being held in escrow to fund any amounts owed by
 Fairways NJ to the purchaser, including any amounts owed for standard
 representations warranties under the sale agreement. The balance of the
 escrow account, if any, is expected to be released in December
 2006. 

Our
 future capital needs are uncertain. Although management projects positive cash
 flow after debt service based on anticipated operations of our acquired
 businesses, there can be no assurances that this will occur. If the Company
 does
 not generate the necessary cash flow, the Company will need additional financing
 in the future to fund operations. We do not know whether additional financing
 will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will obtain financing
 on terms favorable to stockholders. 

Tax
 Loss Carryforwards 

At
 December 31, 2005, we had approximately 54 million of federal net operating
 loss carryforwards and approximately 21 million of state net operating loss
 carryforwards available to offset future taxable income, which, if not utilized,
 will fully expire from 2018 to 2024. We believe that the issuance of shares
 of
 our common stock pursuant to our initial public offering on November 15, 1999
 caused an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
 Code of 1986, as amended. Consequently, we believe that the portion of our
 net
 operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to November 16,
 1999 is subject to an annual limitation pursuant to Section 382. Our total
 deferred tax assets have been fully reserved as a result of the uncertainty
 of
 future taxable income. Accordingly, no tax benefit has been recognized in the
 periods presented. 

Off
 Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As
 discussed in Part I of this Form 10-K, the Company has guaranteed the
 Acquisition Note in the amount of 6.9 million. The Acquisition Note is payable
 from the excess cash flows of ASDS over a three year period. During the period
 from May 1, 2004 until December 31, 2005, principal payments of 718,000 were
 paid on the Acquisition Note. There were no payments required under the terms
 of
 the Company s guarantee. 

In
 January 2005, the Company agreed to provide a limited indemnification to its
 partners in the Fairways NJ investment for any losses those partners may incur
 under their personal guaranties of the partnership s bank indebtedness. The
 Company s partners in this investment are the
 Fairways Members. The Company s indemnification to these 4 partners is limited
 to 520,000 in the aggregate, which is its 20 pro rata partnership interest
 of
 the 2.6 million in bank debt that was guaranteed by the individuals. In
 December 2005, this bank debt was paid in full by Fairways NJ and the personal
 guarantees, as well as the Company s indemnification, were
 cancelled.

Disclosures
 About Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 

In
 connection with the acquisition of the Park Assets, DHI entered into a three
 year supply agreement with AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation pursuant to which
 DHI and its subsidiaries agreed to purchase prescription and over-the-counter
 pharmaceuticals from AmerisourceBergen through March 2007. This supply agreement
 will also provide us with pricing and payment terms that are improved from
 those
 previously provided by AmerisourceBergen to Park Pharmacy. In exchange for
 these
 improved terms, DHI has agreed to acquire 85 of its prescription
 pharmaceuticals and substantially all of its generic pharmaceutical products
 from AmerisourceBergen and agreed to minimum monthly purchases of 900,000
 of
 all products in order to obtain new favorable pricing terms.

Critical
 Accounting Policies 

The
 discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations
 are
 based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
 in
 accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
 of
 America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires
 management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
 of
 assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
 assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates,
 including those related to long-term investments. We base our estimates on
 historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
 be
 reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
 making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
 not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
 estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the
 following accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect
 the
 preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue
 Recognition 

 Healthcare
 revenues are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts expected to be
 received from individuals, third-party payors, institutional healthcare
 providers and others. We recognize revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical
 products and retail merchandise as transactions occur and product is delivered
 to the customer. Revenue from product sales is recognized at the point of sale
 and service revenue is recognized at the time services are provided.

CPOC s
 primary revenue is from brokerage commissions earned from project leasing and
 tenant representation transactions. Brokerage commission revenue is generally
 recorded upon execution of a lease contract, unless additional activities are
 required to earn the commission pursuant to a specific brokerage commission
 agreement. Participation interests in rental income are recognized over the
 life
 of the lease. Other revenue is recognized as the following consulting services
 are provided: facility and site acquisition and disposition, lease management,
 design, construction and development consulting, move coordination and strategic
 real estate advisory services. Participation interests in rental income are
 recognized over the life of the lease.

Table

Long-Term
 Investments 

Our
 long-term investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting
 for investments and none represent investments in publicly traded companies.
 The
 equity method is used as we do not have a majority interest and do not have
 significant influence over the operations of the respective companies. We
 also
 use the equity method for investments in real estate limited partnerships
 where
 we own more than 3 to 5 of the limited partnership interests. Accordingly,
 we
 record our proportionate share of the income or losses generated by our equity
 method investees in the income statement. If we receive distributions in
 excess
 of our equity in earnings, they are recorded as a reduction of our investment.

The
 fair
 value of our long-term investments is dependent upon the performance of the
 companies in which we have invested, as well as volatility inherent in the
 external markets for these investments. The fair value of our ownership
 interests in, and advances to, privately held companies is generally determined
 based on overall market conditions, availability of capital as well as the
 value
 at which independent third parties have invested in similar private equity
 transactions. We evaluate, on an on-going basis, the carrying value of our
 ownership interests in and advances to the companies in which we have invested
 for possible impairment based on achievement of business plan objectives,
 the
 financial condition and prospects of the company and other relevant factors,
 including overall market conditions. Such factors may be financial or
 non-financial in nature. If as a result of the review of this information,
 we
 believe our investment should be reduced to a fair value below its cost,
 the
 reduction would be charged to loss on investments on the statements of
 operations. Although we believe our estimates reasonably reflect the fair
 value
 of our investments, our key assumptions regarding future results of operations
 and other factors may not reflect those of an active market, in which case
 the
 carrying values may have been materially different than the amounts reported.

Recent
 Accounting Pronouncements. 

 In
 January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
 interpretation No. 46R FIN 46R ), Consolidation
 of Variable Interest Entities .
 FIN 46R
 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated
 Financial Statements 
 to
 certain entities in which the equity investors do not have either a controlling
 interest or sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities
 without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46R
 is
 effective for variable interest entities in which we hold a variable interest.
 FIN 46R will not have an impact on our financial condition or results of
 operations. The Company has applied the provisions of FIN 46R to its acquisition
 of CPOC. As a result, CPOC is treated as a consolidated subsidiary in the
 Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In
 December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Statement
 No. 123R (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment., which required that the
 compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions such as options,
 restricted share plans, performance based awards, share appreciation rights
 and
 employee share purchase plans be recognized in financial statements.

Statement
 123R replaces FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
 Statement 123, as originally issued in 1995, established as preferable a
 fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based payment transactions
 with
 employees. However, that statement permitted entities the option of continuing
 to apply the guidance in Opinion 25, as long as the footnotes to the financial
 statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable
 fair-value-based method been used. 

The
 Company currently expenses the cost of restricted shares issued to employees
 and
 directors over the service vesting period associated with the restricted shares.
 The Company currently has no options outstanding which are not vested. The
 implementation of Statement 123R will not have a material impact on its results
 of operations. 

ITEM
 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
 DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
 currently do not engage in commodity futures trading or hedging activities
 and
 do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for trading
 or
 other speculative purposes. We also do not currently engage in transactions
 in
 foreign currencies or in interest rate swap transactions that could expose
 us to
 market risk. 

We
 are
 exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates with respect to the credit
 agreements entered into by our subsidiaries to the extent that the pricing
 of
 these agreements is floating.

We
 are
 exposed to interest rate risk as the guarantor of ASDS s Acquisition Note, which
 bears interest payable monthly at the prime rate of Northern Trust Bank plus
 0.50 per annum. At December 31, 2005, we were also exposed to interest rate
 risk under the 225,000 term note payable to Comerica Bank, which bears interest
 at the Comerica Bank prime rate plus 1.00 . However, this note payable to
 Comerica Bank was paid in full in January 2006. If the effective interest rate
 under the Acquisition Note and the Comerica Bank term note were to increase
 by
 100 basis points (1.00 ), our annual financing expense would increase by
 approximately 68,000, based on the average balances outstanding during the
 year
 ended December 31, 2005. A 100 basis points (1.00 increase in market interest
 rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately
 69,000. We did not experience a material impact from interest rate risk during
 the year ended December 31, 2005, respectively. 

In
 addition, our ability to finance future acquisitions through debt transactions
 may be impacted if we are unable to obtain appropriate debt financing at
 acceptable rates. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates
 through our investing activities. Our investment portfolio consists primarily
 of
 investments in high-grade commercial bank money market accounts. 

The
 following table summarizes the financial instruments held by us at December
 31,
 2005, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2005,
 approximately 63 of our debt was subject to changes in market interest rates
 and was sensitive to those changes. Scheduled principal cash flows for debt
 outstanding at December 31, 2005 for the twelve months ending December 31 are

 Ascendant
 Solutions, Inc. 

We
 have
 audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ascendant Solutions,
 Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
 consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for
 the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of
 the
 Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
 financial statements based on our audits. 

We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
 Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
 plan
 and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
 financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company has
 determined it is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit
 of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included
 consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
 designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
 for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
 internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
 opinion. An
 audit
 includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
 disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
 accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
 well
 as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe our
 audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In
 our
 opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
 material respects, the consolidated financial position of Ascendant Solutions,
 Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated
 results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended,
 in
 conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States

 management and fulfillment services, portions of which were sold or otherwise
 wound down by July 1, 2001. From July 1, 2001 and continuing through December
 31, 2002, the Company had no revenue producing contracts or operations. In
 December 2001, the Company revised its strategic direction to seek acquisition
 possibilities throughout the United States or enter into other business
 endeavors.

Certain
 of these transactions involved related parties or affiliates as more fully
 described in Notes 2 and 18 of these consolidated financial statements.

The
 Company will continue to look for acquisition opportunities, however, its
 current cash resources are limited and it will be required to expend significant
 executive time to assist the management of its acquired businesses. The Company
 will continue seeking to (1) most effectively deploy its remaining cash and
 debt
 capacity (if any) and (2) capitalize on the experience and contacts of its
 officers and directors. 

Significant
 Accounting Policies 

Basis
 of Presentation 

 The
 consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ascendant and all
 subsidiaries for which the Company owns greater than 50 of the voting equity
 interests or has significant influence over operations. All intercompany
 balances and transactions have been eliminated. The limited partnership
 interests for the consolidated subsidiaries and related minority interests
 are
 included on the balance sheet as Minority Interests.

 Notes
 to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The
 results of operations of CRESA Partners of Orange County, LP CPOC have been
 consolidated with ASDS of Orange County, Inc. ASDS and ultimately the
 Company, in accordance with FIN 46R Consolidation of Variable Interest
 Entities , until such time that ASDS has received cumulative distributions equal
 to 6.9 million (the Purchase Price) plus a preferential return of approximately
 1.7 million (total distributions of 8.6 million). When and if the total
 distributions equal to 8.6 million are fully paid, the Company s residual
 interest will become 10 (through ASDS) and the principles of consolidation
 for
 financial reporting purposes will no longer be satisfied under FIN 46R or APB
 18, Equity Method for Investments in Common Stock . Accordingly, the Company
 would no longer consolidate the results of operations of CPOC and would instead
 record its share of income from CPOC as Equity in income of equity method
 investees in the consolidated statement of operations. 

Use
 of Estimates 

 The
 preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
 consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, including allowance
 for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and recoverability valuation of
 equity method investments. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash
 and Cash Equivalents 

 The
 Company classifies all highly liquid investments with original maturities of
 three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost,
 which approximates fair value. 

Concentration
 of Credit Risk 

 The
 Company s credit risk relates primarily to its trade accounts receivables and
 its receivables from affiliates, along with cash deposits maintained at
 financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. Management
 performs continuing evaluations of debtors financial condition and provides an
 allowance for uncollectible accounts as determined necessary. See Note 4 for
 additional information regarding the Company s trade accounts receivable,
 allowance for doubtful accounts and significant customer
 relationships. 

Property
 and Equipment 

 Property
 and equipment is carried at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided
 over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally three to seven years)
 using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a
 straight-line basis over the lesser of the respective lease term or estimated
 useful life of the asset. See Note 7 for additional information regarding
 property and equipment. 

Inventories 

 Inventories
 consists of healthcare product finished goods held for resale, valued at the
 lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out method, or market. The Company
 provides an estimated reserve against inventory for excess, slow moving and
 obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of
 its
 net realizable value. See Note 5 for additional information regarding
 inventories. 

Long-Lived
 Assets 

 The
 Company evaluates the carrying value of its long-lived assets by comparing
 the
 undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the long-lived assets
 with the assets carrying value. If this comparison indicates that the carrying
 value will not be recoverable, the carrying value of the long-lived assets
 will
 be reduced accordingly based on a discounted cash flow analysis. During the
 year
 ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded an impairment provision of
 approximately 112,000 related to VTE s investment of certain computer software
 and hardware. No impairment was recorded in 2005 or 2004.

 ASCENDANT

 Notes
 to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Equity
 Method Investments 

 Equity
 method investments represent investments in limited partnerships accounted
 for
 using the equity method of accounting for investments, and none represent
 investments in publicly traded companies. The equity method is used as the
 Company does not have a majority interest and does not have significant
 influence over the operations of the respective companies. The Company also
 uses
 the equity method for investments in real estate limited partnerships where
 it
 owns more than 3 to 5 of the limited partnership interests. Accordingly,
 the
 Company records its proportionate share of the income or losses generated by
 equity method investees in the consolidated statements of operations. If the
 Company receives distributions in excess of its equity in earnings, they are
 recorded as a reduction of its investment. 

Revenue
 Recognition 

 Healthcare
 revenues are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts expected to be
 received from individuals, third-party payors, institutional healthcare
 providers and others. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of
 pharmaceutical products and retail merchandise as transactions occur and product
 is delivered to the customer. Revenue from product sales is recognized at the
 point of sale and service revenue is recognized at the time services are
 provided. 

CPOC s
 primary revenue is from brokerage commissions earned from project leasing and
 tenant representation transactions. Brokerage commission revenue is generally
 recorded upon execution of a lease contract, unless additional activities are
 required to earn the commission pursuant to a specific brokerage commission
 agreement. Participation interests in rental income are recognized over the
 life
 of the lease. Other revenue is recognized as the following consulting services
 are provided: facility and site acquisition and disposition, lease management,
 design, construction and development consulting, move coordination and strategic
 real estate advisory services. Participation interests in rental income are
 recognized over the life of the lease. 

Income
 Taxes 

 The
 Company s income taxes are presented utilizing an asset and liability approach,
 and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects
 of
 differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
 liabilities given the provisions of the enacted tax laws. Valuation allowances
 are established for deferred tax assets where management believes it is more
 likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

Net
 Income (Loss) Per Share 

 Basic
 and
 diluted net income (loss) per share is computed based on the net income (loss)
 applicable to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of
 shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Potentially dilutive
 securities consisting of warrants and stock options were not included in the
 calculation for the year ended December 31, 2003 as their effect is
 anti-dilutive. The number of potentially dilutive securities excluded from
 the
 computation of diluted net loss per share was approximately 270,000 for the
 year
 ended December 31, 2003. The number of dilutive shares resulting from assumed
 conversion of stock options and warrants are determined by using the treasury
 stock method. See Note 16 for more information regarding the calculation
 of net income (loss) per share. 

Impairment
 of goodwill and other intangible assets 

 The
 Company has adopted a policy of recording an impairment loss on goodwill and
 other intangible assets when indicators of impairment are present and the
 undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less
 than
 the assets carrying amount. Goodwill and other intangible assets are assessed
 for impairment on at least an annual basis by management. 

Recent
 Accounting Pronouncements 

 In
 December 2003, the FASB revised FASB interpretation No. 46R FIN 46R ),
 Consolidation
 of Variable Interest Entities .
 FIN 46R
 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated
 Financial Statements 
 to
 certain entities in which the equity investors do not have either a controlling
 interest or sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities
 without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.

 Notes
 to Consolidated Financial Statements 

FIN
 46R
 is effective for variable interest entities in which we hold a variable
 interest. FIN 46R will not have an impact on our financial condition or results
 of operations. The Company has applied the provisions of FIN 46R to its
 acquisition of CPOC. As a result, CPOC is treated as a consolidated subsidiary
 in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In
 December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Statement
 No. 123R (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment., which requires that the
 compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions such as options,
 restricted share plans, performance based awards, share appreciation rights
 and
 employee share purchase plans be recognized at fair value in financial
 statements. 

Statement
 123R replaces FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
 Statement 123, as originally issued in 1995, established as preferable a
 fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based payment transactions
 with
 employees. However, that statement permitted entities the option of continuing
 to apply the guidance in Opinion 25, as long as the footnotes to the financial
 statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable
 fair-value-based method been used. 

The
 Company currently expenses the cost of restricted shares issued to employees
 and
 directors over the service vesting period associated with the restricted shares.
 The Company currently has no options outstanding which are not vested. The
 unrecognized compensation cost related to these options is not material and
 as a
 result, the implementation of Statement 123R will not have a material impact
 on
 its results of operations. 

Stock
 Based Compensation 

 The
 Company accounts for its employee stock options and stock based awards utilizing
 the intrinsic value method, whereby, if the exercise price of an employee s
 stock option equals or exceeds the market price of the underlying stock on
 the
 date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized. The Company currently
 applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its
 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan ). Had compensation cost been recognized
 consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company s net income (loss) attributable to
 common stockholders and net income (loss) per share would have been adjusted
 to
 the pro forma amounts indicated below for the years ended December 31, 2005,

 Notes
 to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The
 Company used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value
 of grants made during 2002. The following weighted average assumptions were
 applied in determining the pro forma compensation cost: risk free interest
 rate
 - 4.69 , expected option life in years - 6.00, expected stock price volatility
 -
 1.837 and expected dividend yield - 0.00 . See Note 14 for additional
 information on stock options. 

Fair
 Value of Financial Instruments 

 The
 Company s financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable and accounts
 payable that are carried at cost, which approximates fair value because of
 the
 short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of notes payable
 approximates carrying value as interest rates approximate market rates. The
 fair
 value of equity method investments is not readily determinable without undo
 cost. 

Reclassifications

Certain
 prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year
 presentation. 

2. Significant
 Equity Investments 

Fairways
 03 New Jersey, LP 

During
 December 2003, the Company made a capital contribution of 145,000 to Fairways
 03 New Jersey, LP Fairways NJ which, through a partnership with an
 institutional investor, acquired the stock of a company whose sole asset was
 a
 single tenant office building and entered into a long-term credit tenant lease
 with the former owner of the building. In December 2003, subsequent to the
 closing of this transaction, the Company s capital contribution of 145,000 was
 distributed back. The Company received a distribution of approximately 680,000
 on December 30, 2005 from Fairways NJ, which represented the Company s share in
 the profit from the sale of a single tenant commercial real estate property
 interest, the sole asset held by Fairways NJ. In addition to the distribution,
 cash of 162,000, representing the Company s share of the total escrow, is being
 held in escrow to fund any amounts owed by Fairways NJ to the purchaser,
 including any amounts owed for standard representations warranties under
 the sale agreement. The balance of the escrow account, if any, is expected
 to be
 released in December 2006. Since the date of the property interest acquisition,
 the Company has received cumulative cash distributions of approximately
 1,280,000 on its initial investment of 145,000 in Fairways NJ. 

Fairways
 Frisco Partnerships 

On
 December 31, 2004, Fairways Frisco, L.P. (Fairways Frisco) acquired certain
 indirect interests in various partnerships (the Frisco Square Partnerships that own properties (the Properties in the Frisco Square mixed-use real
 estate development in Frisco, Texas, pursuant to a Master Agreement Regarding
 Frisco Square Partnerships Master Agreement ). Frisco Square is planned to
 include approximately 4 million developed square feet, including retail,
 offices, multi-family and municipal space. 

The
 parties to the Master Agreement were the Fairways Group, the Frisco Square
 Partnerships, Cole and Mary Pat McDowell, and the remainder of the Five Star
 Group which is Five Star Development Co., Inc., a Texas corporation, CMP
 Management, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, and CMP Family Limited
 Partnership, a Texas limited partnership. "Frisco Square Partnerships" is a
 group of entities comprised of Frisco Square, Ltd. ("FSLTD"), Frisco Square
 B1-6
 F1-11, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership, Frisco Square B1-7 F1-10, Ltd., a
 Texas limited partnership, and Frisco Square Properties, Ltd., a Texas limited
 partnership. "Fairways Group" is a group of entities comprised of Fairways
 Frisco, Fairways B1-6 F1-11, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, Fairways
 B1-7 F1-10, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, and Fairways FS Properties,
 LLC, a Texas limited liability company. 

As
 further described herein, the Company holds a limited partnership interest
 in
 Fairways Frisco. The Company is not involved in the development or management
 of
 Frisco Square, rather it is solely a limited partner.

 ASCENDANT

 Notes
 to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The
 Company has invested 1,219,000 of cash into Fairways Frisco and holds a 14 
 limited partnership interest as of December 31, 2005. The Company has made
 no
 additional capital contributions subsequent to December 31, 2005. However,
 Fairways Frisco is expected to request additional capital contributions from
 the
 limited partners. At present, the Company does not intend to fund any additional
 capital requested from Fairways Frisco. The Company expects its limited
 partnership interest will be reduced further as additional limited partner
 contributions are received and the Company does not fund its limited partnership
 share of such capital contributions into Fairways Frisco. 

On
 April
 15, 2005, the parties to the Master Agreement agreed to terminate the Master
 Agreement effective as of April 15, 2005. In connection with the termination
 of
 the Master Agreement, the Frisco Square Partnerships were amended such that
 Fairways Frisco owns, either directly or indirectly, 60 of the Frisco Square
 Partnerships. The remaining 40 is owned by CMP Family Limited Partnership
 CMP ), which is controlled by Cole McDowell. CMP s partnership interest is
 subject to further reduction and dilution as discussed below. Under the terms
 of
 the amended Frisco Square Partnerships, Fairways Frisco also has a first
 priority distribution preference of 5.5 million, and it will receive its
 pro-rata partnership interest of the next 9.5 million of distributions from
 the
 Frisco Square Partnerships. After 15 million of distributions have been made,
 Fairways Frisco s interest in the Cash Flow of the Frisco Square Partnerships,
 as defined in the partnership agreements, will become 80 and CMP s interest
 will become 20 . 

Furthermore,
 Fairways Frisco s partnership interest in the Frisco Square Partnerships may be
 increased up to 85 if certain capital call and limited partner capital loan
 provisions are not met by CMP. If Fairways Frisco s partnership interest in the
 Frisco Square Partnerships is increased in the future, the Company s indirect
 interest in the Frisco Square Partnerships would also increase on a pro-rata
 basis with its investment in Fairways Frisco. During the year ended December
 31,
 2005, CMP met the capital loan provisions by providing a 400,000 cash loan
 as
 required under the partnership agreement. Subsequent to December 31, 2005,
 an
 additional 400,000 capital loan request due from CMP was funded as
 required. Accordingly,
 Fairways Frisco s partnership interest remains at 60 . 

Under
 the
 terms of the amended Frisco Square Partnerships agreements, Fairways Equities,
 LLC (FEL) is now the sole general partner of the Frisco Square Partnerships
 and
 controls all operating activities, financing activities and development
 activities for the Frisco Square Partnerships. 

Also
 on
 April 15, 2005, Fairways Frisco, through Frisco Square Land, Ltd., a newly
 created partnership, closed a financing transaction, the proceeds of which
 were
 used to repay the outstanding bank debt of Frisco Square, Ltd and to provide
 additional working capital for Fairways Frisco. Under the terms of the now
 terminated Master Agreement, Fairways Frisco held an option to acquire 50 
 of
 the partnership interests of Frisco Square, Ltd. Concurrently with the
 financing, all of the land and related development held by Frisco Square, Ltd.
 was transferred to Frisco Square Land, Ltd. in exchange for repayment of the
 bank debt, and the option to acquire 50 of the partnership interests of Frisco
 Square, Ltd. was cancelled. As a result of these changes, Fairways Frisco now
 has no interest in Frisco Square, Ltd. Fairways Frisco owns 60 of Frisco Square
 Land, Ltd., subject to the same increases for preference distributions and
 dilution to CMP if certain capital call and limited partner capital loan
 provisions are not met by CMP as discussed above. 

The
 Company has not guaranteed any of the debt of the Frisco Square Partnerships
 or
 Fairways Frisco, L.P.. The Company is not involved with any management,
 financing or other operating activities of the Frisco Square Partnerships or
 Fairways Frisco. However, in May 2005, the Company entered into an agreement
 with FEL, pursuant to which the Company is entitled to receive 25 of the fees
 paid to FEL pursuant to the Fairways Frisco partnership agreement. These fees,
 including a monthly management fee, represent compensation to the Company for
 supplying resources to execute the initial transaction with the Frisco Square
 Partnerships in December 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the
 Company received fees allocated from FEL of 64,000 under this
 agreement.

Discontinued
 Operations 

In
 September 2005, the Company determined that it would exit the home infusion
 therapy business, which operated as part of its healthcare segment under the
 name Park InfusionCare. This will allow DHI to devote undivided focus on its
 primary business, independent specialty retail pharmacies. In connection
 therewith, the Company retained The Braff Group, a financial advisor, to assist
 in marketing Park InfusionCare for sale. The financial advisor is currently
 in
 discussions with various interested buyers. The Company can provide no assurance
 that it will be able to find a buyer for Park InfusionCare, or to the extent
 a
 buyer is found, that a transaction on terms acceptable or favorable to the
 Company will be consummated. 

The
 Company began accounting for Park InfusionCare as a discontinued operation
 in
 the third quarter of 2005. The following is a summary of the assets held

Accrued
 liabilities at December 31, 2005 above include an accrual of 230,000 for

 of a sale transaction. In order to provide continuity of operations and staff,
 DHI has agreed to pay bonuses to various employees who continue to perform
 their
 duties through the date of the sale transaction. This accrued liability is
 an
 estimated amount and no amounts have been paid under this retention bonus
 plan.

Healthcare
 trade accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts receivable from
 third-party payers (insurance companies and governmental agencies) under various
 medical reimbursement programs, institutional healthcare providers, individuals
 and others and are not collateralized. Certain receivables are recorded at
 estimated net realizable amounts. Amounts that may be received under medical
 reimbursement programs are affected by changes in payment criteria and are
 subject to legislative actions. Healthcare accounts receivable are reduced
 by an
 allowance for the amounts deemed to be uncollectible. In general, an allowance
 for retail pharmacy accounts aged in excess of 60 days is established. Accounts
 that management has ultimately determined to be uncollectible are written off
 against the allowance. 

Healthcare
 accounts receivable from Medicare and Medicaid combined were approximately
 16.1 
 and 18.4 of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
 respectively. Additionally, at December 31, 2005, DHI had accounts receivable
 outstanding from one insurance company of approximately 13.1 of total
 Healthcare accounts receivable. No other single customer or third-party payer
 accounted for more than 10 of DHI s accounts receivable at December 31, 2005 or
 2004, respectively.

 Note B payable to Bank of Texas excludes 1,429,000 and 1,976,000 at December
 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which has been allocated to the discontinued
 operations of Park InfusionCare. An allocated amount of the notes payable to
 Bank of Texas which are based on a borrowing base equal to 84 of eligible
 accounts receivable and 50 of eligible inventory, as further defined in the
 agreement with Bank of Texas, have been included in Liabilities Related to
 Assets Held Available For Sale on the accompanying condensed consolidated
 balance sheets. If the Company is successful in its attempt to sell Park
 InfusionCare, DHI will pay down the Bank of Texas notes payable in accordance
 with these borrowing base requirements. Capital lease obligations above also

The
 Bank
 of Texas credit facility contains a borrowing base formula with which the
 Company must comply. If the outstanding borrowings under the facility exceed
 the
 borrowing base, the Company is obligated to make additional principal payments
 to reduce the outstanding borrowings. As of December 31, 2005, the Company
 was
 in compliance with this borrowing base requirement. During
 2005, DHI failed to notify Bank of Texas, as required under its credit
 agreement, that it was changing the names of certain legal entities. This
 failure to notify Bank of Texas of the legal entity name changes constituted
 a
 technical breach of the credit agreement. This breach of the terms of the credit
 agreement has been waived by Bank of Texas.

The
 Company s total deferred tax assets have been fully reserved because of the
 uncertainty of future taxable income. Accordingly, no tax benefit has been
 recognized in the accompanying financial statements. 

At
 December 31, 2005, the Company had accumulated approximately 51 million of
 federal net operating loss carryforwards and 21 million of state net operating
 loss carryforwards, which may be used to offset taxable income and reduce income
 taxes in future years. The use of these losses to reduce future income taxes
 will depend on the generation of sufficient taxable income prior to the
 expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards. The carryforwards, if not
 fully utilized, will expire from 2018 to 2024. Section 382 of the Internal
 Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code imposes an annual limitation on
 the portion of the Company s net operating loss carryforwards that may be used
 to offset taxable income. The Company believes that the issuance of shares
 of
 common stock pursuant to the initial public offering on November 15, 1999 caused
 an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 of the Code on such date.
 Consequently, the Company believes that utilization of the portion of the
 Company s net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to
 November 16, 1999 is limited by Section 382 of the Code. If an ownership
 change is determined to have occurred at a date after November 15, 1999,
 additional net operating loss carryforwards would be limited by Section 382
 of
 the Code. In addition, an ownership change may occur in the future as a result
 of future changes in the ownership of the Company s stock, including the
 issuance by the Company of stock in connection with the acquisition of a
 business by the Company. A future ownership change would result in Code
 Section 382 limiting the Company s deduction of operating loss carryforwards
 attributable to periods before the future ownership change.

 the date of the grant. Options vest 
 ratably
 over periods of one to six years from the date of the grant. The options have
 a
 maximum life of ten years.

On
 March
 14, 2002, in an attempt to further align the interests of management and members
 of its Board of Directors with its stockholders, the Company granted an
 aggregate of 375,000 options, having an exercise price of 0.24 per share,
 to
 certain of its directors. In addition, the Company granted an aggregate of
 1,000,000 performance-based options, 400,000 to its Chairman and 600,000 to
 its
 President and Chief Executive Officer. These management options, having an
 exercise price of 0.24 per share, are intended to incentivize management.
 The
 management options have a vesting period of six years which can be accelerated
 upon achievement of certain performance goals. In May 2004, these performance
 goals were achieved and the Company s Board of Directors accelerated the vesting
 of the remaining 666,667 unvested options out of the 1,000,000 performance-based
 options issued in 2002.

 Employee
 Benefit Plan 

Effective
 January 1, 2005, the Company established a new 401(k) plan to cover all of
 its
 employees, and it terminated the old 401(k) plans related to the acquired
 entities. The terms of the new plan are substantially the same as the terms
 of
 the 401(k) plans of its acquired subsidiaries, DHI and CPOC. Under the terms
 of
 the new plan, the Company has the option to match employee s contributions, in
 an amount and at the discretion of the Company. During the year ended December
 31, 2005, the Company made matching contributions of 19,000 to the new 401(k)
 plan. 

The
 Company s employees (including employees of its acquired subsidiaries DHI and
 CPOC) participated in three 401(k) plans during 2004 and 2003. Under two of
 the
 plans, the Company made matching contributions based on the amount of employee
 contributions. Total contributions by the Company under all three plans were
 29,000 and 2,160 in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

 Commitments
 and Contingencies 

In
 connection with the acquisition of the Park Assets, DHI entered into a three
 year supply agreement with AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation pursuant to which
 DHI and its newly acquired indirect subsidiaries agreed to purchase prescription
 and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals from AmerisourceBergen through March 2007.
 This supply agreement will also provide DHI with pricing and payment terms
 that
 are improved from those previously provided by AmerisourceBergen to Park
 Pharmacy. In exchange for these improved terms, DHI has agreed to acquire 85 
 of
 its prescription pharmaceuticals and substantially all of its generic
 pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen and agreed to minimum monthly
 purchases of 900,000 of all products in order to obtain new favorable pricing
 terms. For the year ended December 31, 2005 and the period from the date of
 acquisition through December 31, 2004, DHI purchased over 23,159,000 and
 17,250,000, respectively, of its pharmaceutical products from Amerisource
 Bergen, of which 3,484,000 relates to Park InfusionCare currently classified
 as
 a discontinued operation. 

In
 January 2005, the Company agreed to provide a limited indemnification to its
 partners in the Fairways 03 New Jersey LP investment for any losses those
 partners may incur under their personal guaranties of the partnership s bank
 indebtedness. The Company s partners in this investment are the Fairways
 Members. The Company s indemnification to the Fairways Members is limited to its
 20 pro rata partnership interest of the 2.6 million in bank debt that was
 guaranteed by the individuals. In December 2005, this bank debt was paid in
 full
 by Fairways 03 New Jersey LP and the Company s limited indemnification agreement
 was cancelled. 

Operating
 Leases 

 The
 Company and its subsidiaries lease its pharmacy, real estate advisory service

Certain
 leases contain renewal options and provide that the Company pay taxes,
 insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses. Total rent expense for
 operating leases was approximately 1,131,000, 974,000 and 45,000 for the
 years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 

Minimum

Legal
 Proceedings 

 On
 January 29, 2004, Bishopsgate Corp. and T.E. Millard filed a lawsuit in the
 192 nd 
 District
 Court of Dallas County, Texas against us, our officers and directors, and Park
 Pharmacy s officers and directors claiming that we breached obligations to fund
 Bishopsgate s proposed purchase of the Park Assets. Mr. Millard filed a Chapter
 13 bankruptcy case in Dallas, Texas on August 15, 2003. Millard s Chapter 13
 bankruptcy case was converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy case on
 December 20, 2004. Upon the conversion of the bankruptcy case, Daniel J. Sherman
 was appointed Chapter 7 Trustee. In August 2005, the Company, its officers
 and
 directors and Park Pharmacy s officers and directors entered into a compromise
 and settlement agreement, which was approved by the bankruptcy court, whereby
 the defendants collectively paid 80,000 to the bankruptcy Trustee in settlement
 of all claims. The Company s insurance carrier provided the funds for the
 Company s portion of the settlement amount, which was 55,000. In exchange for
 the settlement, and in satisfaction of the counterclaims filed against Millard
 and Bishopsgate Corp, the Company received all of the stock of Bishopsgate
 Corp.
 The stock has not been assigned any value in the Company s financial statements
 and it is held by a newly-formed entity, DM-ASD Holding, Co. 

Between
 January 23, 2001 and February 21, 2001, five putative class action lawsuits
 were
 filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas
 against us, certain of our directors, and a limited partnership of which a
 director is a partner. The five lawsuits assert causes of action under Sections
 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for an
 unspecified amount of damages on behalf of a putative class of individuals
 who
 purchased our common stock between various periods ranging from November 11,
 1999 to January 24, 2000. The lawsuits claim that we and the individual
 defendants made misstatements and omissions concerning our products and
 customers. 

In
 April
 2001, the Court consolidated the lawsuits, and on July 26, 2002, plaintiffs
 filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint CAC ). We filed a motion to dismiss the
 CAC on or about September 9, 2002. On July 22, 2003, the Court granted in part
 and denied in part defendants motion to dismiss. On September 2, 2003,
 defendants filed an answer to the CAC. Plaintiffs then commenced discovery.
 On
 September 12, 2003, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, and
 on
 February 17, 2004, we filed our opposition. On July 1, 2004, the Court denied
 plaintiffs motion for certification. On
 September 8, 2004, the Fifth Circuit granted plaintiffs petition for permission
 to appeal the denial of class certification. On August 23, 2005, the Fifth
 Circuit affirmed the district court s denial of class certification. The Company
 settled the lead plaintiffs remaining individual claims for a confidential
 amount, which was paid by the Company s directors and officers insurance
 carrier. Accordingly, the district court entered a final judgment dismissing
 the
 claims with prejudice on February 24, 2006. 

The
 Company is also occasionally involved in other claims and proceedings, which
 are
 incidental to its business. The Company cannot determine what, if any, material
 affect these matters will have on its future financial position and results
 of
 operations. 

18. Related
 Party Transactions 

During
 the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company entered into a participation agreement
 (the Participation Agreement with Fairways Equities LLC Fairways ), an
 entity controlled by Jim Leslie, the Company s Chairman, and Brant Bryan, Cathy
 Sweeney and David Stringfield who are principals of Capital Markets and
 shareholders of the Company Fairways Members ), pursuant to which the Company
 will receive up to 20 of the profits realized by Fairways in connection with
 all real estate acquisitions made by Fairways. Additionally, the Company will
 have an opportunity, but not the obligation, to invest in the transactions
 undertaken by Fairways. The Company s profit participation with Fairways is
 subject to modification or termination by Fairways at the end of 2005 in the
 event that the aggregate level of cash flow (as defined in the Participation
 Agreement) generated by the acquired operating entities has not reached 2
 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. For the twelve months
 ended December 31, 2005, the Company did not meet this cash flow requirement
 and
 there has been no action taken by the Fairways Members to terminate the
 Participation Agreement. The Company is currently negotiating with the Fairways
 Members to modify the Participation Agreement, however, there can be no
 assurances that a mutually acceptable modification can be reached. The Company
 is unable to determine what real estate Fairways may acquire or the cost, type,
 location, or other specifics about such real estate. 

-66- 

Table
 of Contents 

There
 can
 be no assurances that the Company will be able to generate the required cash
 flow to continue in the Fairways Participation Agreement after 2005, or that
 Fairways will be able to acquire additional real estate assets, that the Company
 will choose to invest in such real estate acquisitions or that there will be
 profits realized by such real estate investments. The Company does not have
 an
 investment in Fairways, but rather a profits interest through its Participation
 Agreement. As of December 31, 2005, the Company held a profits interest in
 one
 real estate development transaction pursuant to the Participation Agreement.
 The
 Company has no investment in the transaction, is not a partner in the investment
 partnership and it has received no distributions. 

During
 the year ended December 31, 2005, CRESA Capital Markets Group, LP, a subsidiary
 of the Company received approximately 108,000 in cash advances from the 4
 members of Fairways Equities, which were used to pay general operating expenses.
 The 4 members of Fairways Equities who each own 25 of its membership interests
 include James C. Leslie, the Chairman and principal shareholder of the Company,
 and Cathy Sweeney, Brant Bryan and David Stringfield, who are each shareholders
 of the Company as well as principals of CRESA Capital Markets Group, LP, a
 subsidiary of the Company (the Fairways Members ). These non-interest bearing
 advances were repaid in full in December 2005 from the receipt of revenues
 from
 Capital Markets real estate advisory transactions. 

Mr.
 James
 C. Leslie, the Company s Chairman, controls, and Mr. Will Cureton, one of our
 directors, is indirectly a limited partner in the entity that owns the building
 in which the corporate office space is sub-leased by Ascendant and DHI. Also,
 through August 2005, Capital Markets also paid rent for office space in the
 same
 building to an entity controlled by Mr. Leslie. The Company considers all of
 these leases to be at market terms for comparable space in the same building.
 During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, Ascendant and Capital
 Markets paid rent of approximately 26,000, 67,200 and 45,000 directly to
 an
 entity controlled by Mr. Leslie. The remaining rent expense paid by Ascendant
 and DHI is paid under sublease agreements with an unrelated third party, and
 approximates 13,000 monthly. The Company 
 also
 incurs certain shared office costs with an entity controlled by Mr. Leslie,
 which gives rise to reimbursements from the Company to that entity. These costs
 were approximately 24,300, 22,800 and 3,400 in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
 respectively. 

During
 the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company paid fees to its
 directors of 8,750 and 11,000, respectively, in exchange for their roles
 as
 members of the board of directors and its related committees. Additionally,
 in
 May 2005, the Company issued 22,500 shares of restricted stock to directors
 in
 lieu of cash fees for their roles as members of the board of directors and
 its
 related committees for the year ended December 31, 2005. These restricted shares
 vested ratably at the end of each quarter ending June, September and December
 2005, respectively. 

The
 Company acquired CPOC on May 1, 2004 and in connection with that acquisition,
 it
 assumed a 500,000 note payable to Kevin Hayes, who is currently the Chairman
 of
 CPOC, and it entered into the Acquisition Note with Mr. Hayes. During the year
 ended December 31, 2005 and the period from the acquisition date through
 December 31, 2004, CPOC paid 1,198,000 and 720,000, respectively to Mr. Hayes
 for principal and interest under the assumed note and the Acquisition
 Note. 

Mr.
 Leslie, the Company s Chairman, also serves as an advisor to the Board of
 Directors of CRESA Partners, LLC, a national real estate services firm. Also,
 Kevin Hayes, the Chairman of CPOC serves as the Chief Executive Officer of
 CRESA
 Partners, LLC. 

In
 April
 2004, the Company invested approximately 97,000 through ASE Investments for
 a
 24.75 interest in Fairways 36864, LP, (whose other partners also included
 the
 Fairways Members) that participated in the development of and leaseback of
 single tenant commercial properties. In August and October 2004, respectively,
 these properties were sold and the Company recognized investment income of
 84,000 in addition to the return of its original investment of
 97,000. 

The
 Company made an investment in Fairways 03 New Jersey, LP in December 2003,
 along
 with the Fairways Members and on substantially the same terms as the other
 limited partners in Fairways 03 New Jersey, LP. As
 discussed in Note 17, the Company agreed to indemnify the other partners of
 Fairways 03 New Jersey, LP (who are also the Fairways Members) for its 20 
 pro
 rata partnership interest of a guarantee of bank indebtedness which the partners
 provided to a bank. The limit of the Company s indemnification under this
 agreement is 520,000. In December 2005, this bank debt was paid in full by
 Fairways 03 New Jersey LP and the Company s limited indemnification agreement
 was cancelled. 

Effective
 September 1, 2005, Capital Markets entered into an advisory services agreement
 with Fairways Equities whereby Fairways Equities will provide all of the
 professional and administrative services required by Capital Markets. In
 exchange, Capital Markets will pay Fairways Equities an administrative fee
 of
 25 of gross revenues and a compensation fee of 40 of gross revenues, as
 compensation to the principals working on the transaction that generated the
 corresponding revenues. Under the terms of the agreement, Fairways Equities
 assumed all of the administrative expenses, including payroll, of CRESA Capital
 Markets. Fairways Equities will only receive payments under the agreement if
 the
 Fairways Members close a real estate capital markets advisory transaction that
 generates revenue for Capital Markets. The impact of this agreement on Capital
 Markets is that it will have no administrative expenses or cash requirements
 unless it closes a revenue generating transaction. The principals in Capital
 Markets are also the four members of Fairways Equities. During the year ended
 December 31, 2005, Capital Markets paid compensation fees to Fairways Equities
 under the advisory services agreement of approximately
 233,000.

20. Subsequent
 Events 

Subsequent
 to December 31, 2005, the Company settled class action securities litigation
 for
 a confidential amount, which was paid by the Company s directors and officers
 insurance carrier. Accordingly, the district court entered a final judgment
 dismissing the claims against the Company with prejudice on February 24, 2006.
 See Note 17 for further information regarding this litigation
 matter. 

21. Segment
 Information 

The
 Company is organized in three segments: (i) healthcare, (ii) real estate
 advisory services and (iii) corporate and other businesses. The healthcare
 segment consists of the operations of DHI, while the real estate advisory
 services segment consists of the operations of the CRESA Partners of Orange
 County LP and CRESA Capital Markets Group LP. Key measures used by the Company s
 management to evaluate business segment performance include revenue, cost of
 sales, gross profit, investment income and EBITDA. EBITDA is calculated as
 net
 income before deducting interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Although
 EBITDA is not a measure of actual cash flow because it does not consider changes
 in assets and liabilities that may impact cash balances, the Company believes
 it
 is a useful metric to evaluate operating performance.

 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON
 ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

 None 

ITEM
 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
 of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
 required by rule 13a-15(b), the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer
 and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period
 covered by this report, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure
 controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on
 that
 evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
 that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the
 end of the period covered by this report. As required by Rule 13a-15(d), the
 Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer also conducted an
 evaluation of the Company s internal control over financial reporting to
 determine whether changes occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter that have
 materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
 Company s internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation,
 there has been no such change during the fourth fiscal quarter. 

It
 should
 be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can
 provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
 the
 system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based
 in
 part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
 events. 

However,
 due to the limited size of the Company s staff, there is inherently a lack of
 segregation of duties related to the authorization, recording, processing and
 reporting of transactions. In October 2004, we added Gary Boyd as our new Chief
 Financial Officer which will allow us to implement additional controls related,
 but not limited to segregation of duties. We will continue to periodically
 assess the cost versus benefit of adding the resources that would improve
 segregation of duties and currently, with the concurrence of the board of
 directors, do not consider the benefits to outweigh the costs of adding
 additional staff in light of the limited number of transactions related to
 the
 company s operations. 

Changes
 in Internal Controls 

There
 were no significant changes in the Company s internal controls that occurred
 during the last quarter of 2005 that materially affected, or are reasonably
 likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial
 reporting.

REPORT
 OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
 the
 Partners of Fairways Frisco, L.P. 

 Dallas,
 Texas 

We
 have
 audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Fairways Frisco, L.P.
 and
 subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005, and the consolidated statements of
 operations, changes in partnership capital and cash flows for the year then
 ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership s
 management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
 statements based on our audit. 

We
 conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
 Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
 plan
 and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
 statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
 on a
 test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
 statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
 and
 significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
 financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
 reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In
 our
 opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
 material respects, the financial position of Fairways Frisco, L.P. and
 subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and the results of their operations and their
 cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting
 principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1. 

Organization

Description
 of Business 

 Fairways
 Frisco, L.P. Fairways or the Partnership is a Texas limited partnership
 formed in December 2004. On
 December 31, 2004, the Partnership acquired certain indirect interests pursuant
 to a Master Agreement Regarding Frisco Square Partnerships, dated December
 31,
 2004 (the Master Agreement in various partnerships (the Frisco Square
 Partnerships that own properties (the Properties in the 150 acre Frisco
 Square mixed-use real estate development in Frisco, Texas. Frisco Square is
 planned to include approximately 4 million developed square feet, including
 retail, offices, multi-family, single-family and municipal space (some of which
 is owned by the City of Frisco and other non affiliated entities, the results
 of
 which are not included in these consolidated financial statements). The
 Partnership and its subsidiaries will own, develop and manage the Properties
 owned by the Partnership. 

The
 parties to the Master Agreement were the Fairways Group, the Frisco Square
 Partnerships, Cole and Mary Pat McDowell, and the remainder of the Five Star
 Group which is Five Star Development Co., Inc. Five Star ), a Texas
 corporation, CMP Management, LLC, a Texas limited liability Partnership, and
 CMP
 Family Limited Partnership, a Texas limited partnership. "Frisco Square
 Partnerships" is a group of entities comprised of Frisco Square, Ltd. ("FSLTD"),
 Frisco Square B1-6 F1-11, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership, Frisco Square
 B1-7
 F1-10, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership, and Frisco Square Properties, Ltd.,
 a
 Texas limited partnership. "Fairways Group" is a group of entities comprised
 of
 Fairways Frisco, Fairways B1-6 F1-11, LLC, a Texas limited liability
 Partnership, Fairways B1-7 F1-10, LLC, a Texas limited liability Partnership,
 and Fairways FS Properties, LLC, a Texas limited liability Partnership. Fairways
 Equities, LLC Fairways Equities is the general partner of the
 Partnership. 

2. Change
 in Control Transaction 

On
 April
 15, 2005, the parties to the Master Agreement agreed to terminate the Master
 Agreement effective as of April 15, 2005. In connection with the termination
 of
 the Master Agreement, the Frisco Square Partnerships were amended such that
 the
 Partnership owns, either directly or indirectly, 60 of the Frisco Square
 Partnerships. The remaining 40 is owned by CMP Family Limited Partnership
 CMP ), which is controlled by Cole McDowell. As of December 31, 2005, CMP s
 partnership interest is subject to further reduction and dilution as discussed
 below. Under the terms of the amended Frisco Square Partnerships, the
 Partnership also has a first priority distribution preference of 5.5 million,
 and will receive its pro-rata partnership interest of the next 9.5 million
 of
 distributions from the Frisco Square Partnerships. After 15 million of
 distributions have been made, the Fairways interest in the Frisco Square
 Partnerships will become 80 and CMP s interest will become 20 . 

Furthermore,
 Fairways partnership interest in the Frisco Square Partnerships may be
 increased up to 90 if certain capital call and limited partner capital loan
 provisions are not met by CMP. During the year ended December 31, 2005, CMP
 met
 the capital loan provisions by providing a 400,000 cash loan as required under
 the partnership agreement. As of December 31, 2005, an additional 400,000
 capital loan request was due from CMP. CMP met the capital loan provisions
 by
 providing the additional 400,000 in cash to the Partnerships in March, 2006,
 as
 required in the partnership agreements. 

Under
 the
 terms of the amended Frisco Square Partnerships agreements, Fairways Equities,
 LLC is now the sole general partner of the Frisco Square Partnerships and
 controls all operating activities, financing activities and development
 activities for the Frisco Square Partnerships.

 Frisco, L.P. 

 Notes
 to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Also
 on
 April 15, 2005, the Partnership, through Frisco Square Land, Ltd., a newly
 created partnership, closed a financing transaction, the proceeds of which
 were
 used to repay the outstanding bank debt of Frisco Square, Ltd and to provide
 additional working capital for the Partnership. Under the terms of the now
 terminated Master Agreement, the Partnership held an option to acquire 50 
 of
 the partnership interests of Frisco Square, Ltd. Concurrently with the
 financing, all of the land and related development held by Frisco Square, Ltd.
 was contributed to Frisco Square Land, Ltd. in the amount of 19.5 million
 in
 exchange for repayment of the bank debt, and the option to acquire 50 of the
 partnership interests of Frisco Square, Ltd. was cancelled. As a result of
 these
 changes, the Partnership has never had an interest in Frisco Square, Ltd.
 Fairways owns 60 of Frisco Square Land, Ltd., subject to the same increases
 for
 preference distributions and dilution to CMP if certain capital call and limited
 partner capital loan provisions are not met by CMP as discussed above. The
 carrying value of the land held by Frisco Square Land, Ltd. is equal to the
 bank
 debt repaid plus capitalized interest and other costs subsequently incurred
 to
 develop the land for building sites. 

Also
 on
 April 15, 2005, the Partnership formed and began operations for Frisco Square
 Development, Ltd., and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Frisco Square Construction,
 Ltd. These entities operate the development and construction activities for
 the
 Frisco Square Partnerships. The Partnership owns 75 of Frisco Square
 Development, Ltd., and the remaining 25 is owned by CMP, subject to the same
 increases for preference distributions and dilutions to CMP as noted
 above.

3. Significant
 Accounting Policies 

Basis
 of Presentation 

 The
 consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Partnership and
 all subsidiaries for which the Partnership is the general partner, owns greater
 than 50 of the voting equity interests or has significant influence over
 operations. The subsidiaries of the Partnership include the Frisco Square B1-6
 F1-11, Ltd. FS B1-6 F1-11 ), a Texas limited partnership, Frisco Square B1-7
 F1-10, Ltd. FS B1-7 F1-10 ), a Texas limited partnership, Frisco Square
 Properties, Ltd. FS Properties ), a Texas limited partnership, Frisco Square
 Land, Ltd, a Texas limited partnership, Frisco Square Construction, Ltd., a
 Texas limited partnership, Frisco Square Development, Ltd., a Texas limited
 partnership and the Fairways Group. All intercompany accounts and transactions
 have been eliminated. The limited partnership interests for the consolidated
 subsidiaries and related minority interests are included on the balance sheet
 as
 Minority Interests. 

The
 Partnership accounted for the investment in the Frisco Square Partnerships
 using
 the equity method from January 1, 2005 through April 14, 2005 as they owned
 50 
 of the voting equity interests, were not the general partner and had no control
 over the operations. On April 15, 2005 the Partnership became the general
 partner and took over control of all operations. As a result, the Partnership
 consolidated the financial statements of FS B1-6 F1-11, FS B1-7 F1-10 and FS
 Properties from April 15, 2005 through December 31, 2005. 

Use
 of Estimates 

 The
 preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
 reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
 results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash
 and Cash Equivalents 

 The
 Partnership classifies all highly liquid investments with original maturities
 of
 three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost,
 which approximates fair value.

Fairways
 Frisco, L.P. 

 Notes
 to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Concentration
 of Credit Risk 

 The
 Partnership s credit risk relates primarily to its trade accounts receivables
 and its receivables from affiliates, along with cash deposits maintained at
 financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. Management
 performs continuing evaluations of debtors financial condition and provides an
 allowance for uncollectible accounts as determined necessary. See Note 4
 for additional information regarding the Partnership s trade accounts
 receivable, allowance for doubtful accounts and significant customer
 relationships. 

Deferred
 Financing Costs and Leasing Commissions 

 Deferred
 financing costs are amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates
 the interest method, over the terms of the related debt. Costs incurred to
 obtain leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the terms of
 the
 respective leases. 

Guarantees 

 The
 Partnership accounts for its guarantees of the obligations of others in
 accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor s Accounting and
 Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Direct Guarantees of
 Indebtedness of Others FIN 45 ). FIN 45 requires that guarantors recognize a
 liability for certain guarantees at the fair value of the guaranteed obligation
 at the inception of the guarantee, even if the likelihood of performance under
 the guarantee is remote. The initial recognition and measurement provisions
 of
 FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified
 after December 31, 2002. See Notes 9 and 11 for disclosures related to the
 Partnership s guarantees in accordance with FIN 45. 

Real
 Estate Assets,
 Depreciation and Impairment 

 Real
 estate assets are stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value, if
 deemed impaired. Major replacements and betterments are capitalized and
 depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is calculated on
 a
 straight-line basis upon the useful lives of the properties (generally three
 to
 thirty-five years). Tenant improvements are capitalized and depreciated over
 the
 life of the related lease. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged
 to operations as incurred. 

The
 Partnership continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value
 of
 its real estate assets using the methodology prescribed in Statement of
 Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment
 or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Factors considered by management in
 evaluating impairment of its existing real estate assets held for investment
 include significant declines in property operating profits, recurring property
 operating losses and other significant adverse changes in general market
 conditions that are considered permanent in nature. Under SFAS No. 144, a real
 estate asset held for investment is not considered impaired if the undiscounted,
 estimated future cash flows of an asset (both the annual estimated cash flow
 from future operations and the estimated cash flow from the disposition of
 the
 asset) over its estimated holding period are in excess of the asset s net book
 value at the balance sheet date. If any real estate asset held for investment
 is
 considered impaired, a loss is provided to reduce the carrying value of the
 asset to its estimated fair value. No impairment was recorded in
 2005. 

Furniture
 and Equipment 

 Furniture
 and Equipment is carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
 and amortization are provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets
 (generally three to thirty-five years) using the straight-line method. Leasehold
 and tenant improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser
 of the respective lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. See
 Note 7 for additional information regarding property and
 equipment. 

-93- 

Fairways
 Frisco, L.P. 

 Notes
 to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The
 Partnership evaluates the carrying value of its long-lived assets by comparing
 the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the long-lived
 assets with the assets carrying value. If this comparison indicates that the
 carrying value will not be recoverable, the carrying value of the long-lived
 assets will be reduced accordingly based on a discounted cash flow analysis.
 No
 impairment was recorded in 2005. 

Equity
 Method Investments 

 Equity
 method investments represent investments in limited partnerships, are accounted
 for using the equity method of accounting for investments and none represent
 investments in publicly traded companies. The equity method was used prior
 to
 April 15, 2005 as the Partnership was not the general partner, did not have
 a
 majority interest and did not have significant influence over the operations
 of
 the Frisco Square Partnerships. Accordingly, the Partnership recorded its
 proportionate share of the income or losses generated by equity method investees
 in the consolidated statements of operations from January 1, 2005 to April
 15,
 2005. 

Subsequent
 to April 15, 2005, the Partnership consolidated all activities of the respective
 Frisco Square Partnerships, as the Partnership and its affiliates became the
 general partner and had obtained a majority interest in those partnerships.
 See
 Note 2 for a discussion of the April 15, 2005 transaction. 

Revenue
 Recognition 

 Rental
 revenue includes the base rent each tenant is required to pay in accordance
 with
 the terms of the respective lease and is reported on a straight-line basis
 over
 the noncancelable lease term. Rental revenue earned in excess of rent payments
 received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements is recorded
 as
 accounts receivable. Certain lease agreements contain provisions that provide
 for the reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance and certain other
 operating costs above their base-year costs. These reimbursements totaled
 approximately 100,000 in 2005 and are included in other revenues in the
 statement of operations. 

Several
 tenants are also required to pay rent as a percentage of their gross sales
 volume to the extent such percentage rents exceed their base rents. There were
 no significant revenues from percentage rents in 2005. 

Income
 Taxes 

 Under
 present income tax laws, the Partnership is not subject to federal income taxes;
 therefore, no taxes have been provided for in the accompanying consolidated
 financial statements. The partners are to include their respective share of
 the
 Partnership s net loss in their income tax returns. 

Leasing
 Arrangements 

 The
 Partnership enters into leasing arrangements with tenants of the building(s),
 which are generally non-cancelable except for cause, which is defined in the
 agreements. Residential leases range in term from three months to one
 year. Commercial leases are generally executed for a term of anywhere from
 five to fifteen years, and include a base amount per square foot that the
 Partnership will pay to the tenant for improvements to the space. These
 improvements are capitalized and amortized over the life of the
 lease. 

Recent
 Accounting Pronouncements 

 In
 December 2003, the FASB revised FASB interpretation No. 46 FIN 46(R) ),
 Consolidation
 of Variable Interest Entities .
 FIN
 46(R) clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,
 Consolidated
 Financial Statements 
 to
 certain entities in which the equity investors do not have either a controlling
 interest or sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities
 without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46(R)
 is effective for variable interest entities in which we hold a variable
 interest. FIN 46(R) does not have an impact on our financial condition or
 results of operations. 

Fair
 Value of Financial Instruments 

 The
 Partnership s financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable and
 accounts payable that are carried at cost, which approximates fair value because
 of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of notes payable
 approximates carrying value as interest rates approximate market rates.

The
 Citibank and First National Bank of Omaha term notes do not contain any
 restrictive covenants with which the Partnership must comply. However, The
 Citibank term note (A) does contain certain ratios which must be met in order
 to
 extend the term of the note by one year to May 1, 2007. As of the date of this
 report, the ratios had not been met, and discussions for an extension of the
 loan were in process with Citibank. In addition, Citibank has waived all
 defaults for filing financial statements by the dates required in the note(s)
 through May 1, 2006. 

The
 balance of 400,000 in notes payable, affiliate at December 31, 2005 represents
 a loan from CMP, as required under the terms of the partnership agreement.
 The
 loan
 bears interest at the rate of 15 per annum, with principal to be paid out
 of
 cash flow, pro rata with other mezzanine loans of the Partnership. An additional
 400,000 mezzanine loan was funded by CMP subsequent to December 31, 2005 as
 further discussed in Note 13.

 Other
 Current Liabilities 

In
 May,
 2005, Citibank applied 1,225,641 of certificates of deposit held by CMP Family
 Limited Partnership (or affiliates) as collateral on the Citibank Note (A)
 toward the principal balance of that note. The pay down was made at the request
 of Citibank in order to extend the term of the existing Note. The amount remains
 an obligation of the Partnership to the affiliates; however, no agreements
 have
 been signed between the parties, and the amount is included in Other Current
 Liabilities on the Balance Sheet. 

CMP
 Family Limited Partnership (and affiliates) has initiated legal proceedings
 related to recovery of this collateral from the Partnership. Mediation has
 been
 set for a date in May, 2006, during which time the Partnership expects to set
 terms for the repayment of the liability. See Note 11 for further discussion
 of
 these legal proceedings.

 Commitments
 and Contingencies 

The
 Development Agreement 

 On
 April
 15, 2005, the Partnership was assigned the rights and assumed obligations under
 that certain Development Agreement Development Agreement dated July 28, 2000
 by and between Frisco Square, Ltd. (see Note 1) and the City of Frisco. The
 Development Agreement was created to define the building restrictions, site
 plan, and obligations for funding the infrastructure for Frisco Square. In
 the
 Development Agreement, the Partnership is obligated to fund one half of the
 negative cash flow annually for the upkeep of the Municipal Management District
 MMD ), which includes payment of principal and interest on approximately 9.5
 million of bonds issued by the City of Frisco. The Partnership s maximum future
 commitment of 4.75 million may be reduced by the ad valorem taxes assessed
 by the City of Frisco on the property in the MMD. To the extent that
 the cash flows of the MMD are insufficient to cover the payment of
 principal and interest on the bonds, the Partnership must pay 50 of the
 shortfall. The four members of Fairways Equities have personally guaranteed
 the
 Partnerships payment of this commitment, and the Partnership has indemnified
 them for the guaranty. In connection with this indemnification, the Partnership
 recorded an obligation of 118,750 which is included in other Long Term
 Liabilities. This amount represents the Partnership s estimate of the fair value
 of the indemnification obligation.

 partnerships has been eliminated in consolidation. The Partnership also leases
 certain equipment under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. Certain
 leases contain renewal options and provide that the Partnership pay taxes,
 insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses. Total rent expense for
 operating leases was approximately 21,000 for the year ended December 31,

Legal
 Proceedings 

 John
 Greer Management, Inc. Greer has filed a suit against the Partnership and
 Five Star related to financial advisor services provided by Greer in connection
 with debt and equity financing for a commercial land development project in
 Frisco, Texas. Greer is seeking a fee of approximately 1.25 million, plus
 attorneys fees and exemplary damages. The suit claims Greer had an agreement
 with Five Star for compensation for the financial advisor services described
 above, but claims that the Partnership has assumed Five Star s obligation to pay
 Greer. The Partnership has no written agreement to pay Greer any monies and
 disagrees that it has assumed any obligation to pay Greer. The Partnership
 intends to file a motion for summary judgment with respect to all of Greer s
 claims. The case is currently set for trial June 19, 2006. The Partnership
 does
 not believe the outcome of this litigation will have a material impact on its
 financial position.

 District (the Lawsuit ). In the Lawsuit, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants
 failed to include certain agreed upon language in a written agreement under
 which Defendants acquired certain assets from Plaintiffs. The allegedly agreed
 upon language would have required Defendants to secure the release of
 Plaintiffs cash collateral from a financial institution that was involved in
 the transaction upon refinancing of a certain debt. Plaintiffs further contend
 that the financial institution seized their cash collateral and applied it
 to
 the debt because the allegedly agreed upon language was not included in the
 written agreement. Plaintiffs purport to state claims for reformation,
 declaratory judgment, fraud in the inducement, fraud, misrepresentation, breach
 of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy and predatory practices. Plaintiffs seek
 judgment reforming the written agreement to include the allegedly agreed upon
 language, actual damages in the amount of 1,225,621 and unspecified exemplary
 damages. Defendants maintain that they did not agree to include the subject
 language in the written agreement.

 Related
 Party Transactions 

The
 four
 members of Fairways Equities have personally guaranteed the Partnership s
 obligations to Comerica Bank, First National Bank of Omaha, Citibank (See Note
 9), and the MMD (See Note 11). In connection with the guarantee of the Comerica
 Bank note payable, the Partnership pays a guaranty fee of 2.50 annually to
 the
 four members of Fairways Equities. During the year ended December 31, 2005,
 the
 Partnership paid total guaranty fees of 253,751. An additional 270,887 is
 included in accounts payable at December 31, 2005. 

The
 Partnership paid financing fees of 1.00 or 138,320 to Fairways Equities in
 connection with the Comerica term loan agreement that was entered into during
 2005. 

During
 2005, the Partnership paid a development fee, under the terms of the Master
 Agreement, of 500,000 to Five Star, which is controlled by Cole McDowell.
 The
 Partnership is not obligated to pay any further development fees to Five Star
 or
 Cole McDowell as of December 31, 2005. 

The
 Partnership pays monthly management fees of 10,000 to Fairways Equities as
 the
 general partner of the Partnership. During 2005, the Partnership paid total
 management fees to Fairways Equities of 120,000. An additional 60,000 was
 accrued in accounts payable, but unpaid as of December 31, 2005. These fees
 are
 authorized pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement. 

13. 
 
 Subsequent
 Events 

Subsequent
 to December 31, 2005, the Partnership has made calls for capital contributions
 from its limited partners of 3,200,000, of which 1,577,935 has been funded
 as
 of March 24, 2006. Additionally, on March 14, 2006, Cole McDowell funded
 400,000 in the form of a mezzanine loan to the Partnership, as required under
 the terms of the partnership agreement. The loan bears interest at the rate
 of
 15 per annum, with principal to be paid out of cash flow, pro rata with other
 mezzanine loans of the Partnership. 

In
 March,
 2006, the Partnership amended the Comerica commitment (see Note 9) to decrease
 the amount of the commitment from 27,644,000 to 26,644,000. Concurrent with
 this amendment, the Partnership executed a line of credit for 2,000,000, the
 proceeds of which are to be used for various pre-construction and development
 costs associated with the construction of future buildings. Interest is payable
 monthly, at the option of the Borrower, a rate of prime plus .25 or Euro plus
 3 . In March, 2006, the Partnerships borrowed 442,461 under the line of credit,
 and expect the amount to be repaid out of construction loans currently being
 negotiated. This line of credit revolver terminates on March 10, 2007. The
 new borrowing is subject to the same terms and conditions as described in
 Note 9 for the Comerica term loan payable. The additional borrowing was
 also personally guaranteed by the four members of Fairways
 Equities.

 Notes
 to Consolidated Financial Statements 

On
 February 7, 2006, the General Partner of the Partnerships made a capital call
 to
 the Partnership s limited partners in the aggregate amount of 3.2 million.
 Approximately 1,280,000 of this amount was requested to be funded by CMP.
 As of April 6, 2006, CMP had not funded its portion of the capital call, which
 was required to be funded by April 7, 2006, in accordance with the partnership
 agreements. 

On
 April
 6, 2006, CMP delivered an offer to the Fairways Group to purchase 100 of the
 Partnership s interests, pursuant to the buy/sell provisions of the various
 partnership agreements. The offer of 79 million, before repayment of the
 Partnership s debts, requires the Fairways Group to respond within 60 days to
 the offer, electing to either accept the offer, or to buy CMP s interests based
 on the same valuation. Once the Fairways Group responds, the selected buyer
 (either the Fairways Group or CMP) will be required to close the purchase of
 the
 other partners interest within 60 days. Pursuant to the partnership agreements,
 financing of the purchase may be structured with a 20 cash payment and the
 balance payable in four equal installments annually, with interest at the prime
 rate plus 2 payable quarterly. As of the date of this report, the limited
 partners of the Partnership had not responded to CMP s offer. 

On
 April
 7, 2006, CMP filed a lawsuit alleging that the Partnership had not properly
 executed the capital call on February 7, 2006, and that CMP s partnership
 interest should not be diluted as a result of capital contributions received
 by
 the Fairways Group from other limited partners pursuant to that same capital
 call. Also on April 7, 2006, CMP obtained a Temporary Restraining
 Order that CMP not be diluted until further order of the Court following an
 evidentiary hearing scheduled for April 21, 2006.

 Notes
 to Financial Statements 

1. 
 
 Organization
 and Significant Accounting
 Policies 

Description
 of Business 

Fairways
 03 New Jersey, LP Fairways NJ or the Partnership is a Texas special
 purpose limited partnership formed for the purpose of holding a 50 investment
 interest in 1515 Route 10 Partners, LP Route 10 Partners ). Route 10 Partners
 holds an indirect investment interest (through multiple special purpose
 financing entities) in a single tenant commercial real estate building. Fairways
 NJ was formed and purchased its investment interest, along with Route 10
 Partners, in December 2003. An unrelated third party is the general partner
 and
 the other 50 limited partner in Route 10 Partners. 

The
 general partner of Fairways NJ is Fairways Equities, LLC, which holds a 1 
 general partner interest. The Class A and Class B limited partners include
 Ascendant Solutions, Inc. and the members of Fairways Equities, LLC or
 affiliates. The Class A limited partners represent 10 of the limited
 partnership interests and the Class B limited partners represent 90 of the
 limited partnership interests. 

As
 of
 December 31, 2005, Fairways NJ has no investment interests, other than its
 unpaid distributions from Route 10 Partners. These unpaid distributions are
 expected to be released in March 2007. As such, Fairways NJ will have no
 significant income or expenses subsequent to December 31, 2005, other than
 interest income earned on its restricted cash. 

2. Significant
 Accounting Policies 

Basis
 of Presentation 

The
 financial statements include the accounts of Fairways NJ, and all intercompany
 balances and transactions have been eliminated. The financial statements have
 been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
 principles. 

Cash
 and Cash Equivalents 

The
 Company classifies all highly liquid investments with original maturities of
 three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost,
 which approximates fair value. 

Restricted
 Cash 

Restricted
 cash represents cash held in an interest bearing escrow account by a title
 company pending the expiration of certain representations and warranties by
 Fairways NJ in connection with the sale of the single tenant commercial real
 estate building in which it held an indirect investment interest. These
 representations and warranties expire in December 2006. If there are no breaches
 of these representations and warranties, this restricted cash will be released
 to the Partnership and distributed to the general and limited
 partners. 

Investment
 in Limited Partnership 

Investment
 in limited partnership represents Fairways NJ s investment in Route 10 Partners,
 which is accounted for using the equity method of accounting for investments.
 The equity method is used as the Partnership is not the general partner, does
 not have a majority interest and does not have significant influence over the
 operations of the respective companies. Accordingly, the Partnership records
 its
 proportionate share of the income or losses generated by equity method investees
 in the income statement. Distributions in excess of equity in earnings received
 by the Partnership are recorded as a reduction of its investment.

-109- 

FAIRWAYS
 03 NEW JERSEY, LP 

 Notes
 to Financial Statements 

Income
 Recognition 

Equity
 in
 earnings of limited partnership in the income statement represents the
 Partnerships pro-rata share of the net income of Route 10 Partners. The income
 earned by Route 10 Partners represents net rental income from the single tenant
 commercial real estate building and the net proceeds from the sale of the
 building in December 2005. Substantially all of the income recognized by the
 Partnership has been distributed in cash to its general and limited partners,
 other than the restricted cash discussed above. 

The
 Partnership does not expect to record any significant income subsequent to
 December 31, 2005, other than interest income earned on its restricted
 cash. 

Income
 Taxes 

Under
 present income tax laws, the Partnership is not subject to federal income
 taxes;
 therefore, no taxes have been provided for in the accompanying consolidated
 financial statements. The partners are to include their respective share
 of the
 Partnership s net loss in their income tax returns. 

3. 
 
 Significant
 Investment Disposition 

Fairways
 NJ s primary purpose is to hold an investment in Route 10 Partners, which has
 an
 indirect investment interest in a single tenant commercial real estate building.
 This investment was formed and acquired in December 2003. Since that time,
 Fairways NJ has received its pro rata share of the net investment rental income
 from this building on a monthly basis. In December 2005, this building was
 sold
 to an unrelated third party and the net proceeds were distributed to Route
 10
 Partners, who in turn distributed 50 of the proceeds to Fairways NJ. The
 proceeds received by Fairways NJ were then distributed to its general partner
 and limited partners in accordance with its partnership agreement. 

4. 
 
 Note
 Payable 

During
 2005, the Partnership had a note payable to a bank outstanding in the amount
 of
 2,655,000. Interest expense was payable monthly at the Colonial Bank, NA prime
 rate plus 0.50 . Total interest paid in 2005 was 190,500. The members of
 Fairways Equities, LLC personally guaranteed the payment of the note payable.
 In
 December 2005, this note payable was paid in full and the personal guarantees
 were cancelled. 

5. 
 
 Related
 Party Transactions 

In
 connection with the personal guaranty of its note payable, the Partnership
 paid
 guaranty fees of 26,550 to the members of Fairways Equities and other limited
 partners who had indemnified Fairways Equities for a portion of the guaranty.
 This guaranty was cancelled upon payment of the note payable in December 2005,
 and no further guaranty fees were owed as of December 31, 2005. 

6. 
 
 Commitments
 Contingencies 

In
 January 2006, the Partnership secured a letter of credit with a bank as security
 for the performance of its representations and warranties in connection with
 the
 sale of the single tenant commercial real estate building in which it held
 an
 indirect investment interest. The letter of credit is collateralized by a cash
 certificate of deposit which bears interest at a rate of 3.94 per annum. The
 Partnership paid a fee of 7,500 to the bank in connection with the granting
 of
 the letter of credit.
