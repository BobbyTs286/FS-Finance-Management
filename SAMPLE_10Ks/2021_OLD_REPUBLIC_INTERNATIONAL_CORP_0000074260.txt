PART I 

Item 1 - Business 

(a) General Description of Business. Old Republic International Corporation is a Chicago based holding company engaged in the single business of insurance underwriting and related services. It conducts its operations through a number of regulated insurance company subsidiaries organized into three major segments, namely, it's General Insurance (property and liability insurance), Title Insurance, and the Republic Financial Indemnity Group ("RFIG") Run-off Business. References herein to such groups apply to the Company's subsidiaries engaged in these respective segments of business. The results of a small life and accident insurance business are included within the corporate and other caption of this report. "Old Republic" or "the Company" refers to Old Republic International Corporation and its subsidiaries as the context requires. 
 
 The insurance business is distinguished from most others in that the prices (premiums) charged for various insurance products are set without certainty of the ultimate benefit and claim costs that will emerge, often many years after issuance and expiration of a policy. This basic fact casts Old Republic as a risk-taking enterprise managed for the long run. Management therefore conducts the business with a primary focus on achieving favorable underwriting results over cycles, and on the maintenance of financial soundness in support of the insurance subsidiaries' long-term obligations to policyholders and their beneficiaries. To achieve these objectives, adherence to insurance risk management principles is stressed, and asset diversification and quality are emphasized. The underwriting principles encompass: 
 
 Disciplined risk selection, evaluation, and pricing to reduce uncertainty and adverse selection; 
 
 Enhancing the predictability of expected outcomes through insurance of the largest number of homogeneous risks as to each type of coverage; 
 
 Reducing the insurance portfolio risk profile through: 
 diversification and spread of insured risks; and 
 assimilation of uncorrelated asset and liability exposures across economic sectors that tend to offset or counterbalance one another; and 
 
 Effective management of gross and net limits of liability through appropriate use of reinsurance. 
 
 In addition to income arising from Old Republic's basic underwriting and related services functions, significant investment income is earned from invested funds generated by those functions and from capital resources. Investment management aims for stability of income from interest and dividends, protection of capital, and for sufficiency of liquidity to meet insurance underwriting and other obligations as they become payable in the future. Securities trading and the realization of capital gains are not primary objectives. The investment philosophy is therefore best characterized as emphasizing value, credit quality, and relatively long-term holding periods. The Company's ability to hold both fixed maturity and equity securities for long periods of time is in turn enabled by the scheduling of maturities in contemplation of an appropriate matching of assets and liabilities, and by investments in large capitalization, highly liquid equity securities. 
 
 In light of the above factors, the Company's affairs are managed for the long run and without significant regard to the arbitrary strictures of quarterly or even annual reporting periods that American industry must observe. In Old Republic's view, such short reporting time frames do not comport well with the long-term nature of much of its business. Management therefore believes that the Company's operating results and financial condition can best be evaluated by observing underwriting and overall operating performance trends over succeeding five- or preferably ten-year intervals. A ten-year period in particular can likely encompass at least one economic and/or underwriting cycle and thereby provide an appropriate time frame for such cycle to run its course, and for premium rate changes and reserved claim costs to be quantified and emerge in financial results with greater finality and effect. 
 
 The contributions to consolidated revenues and pretax income, and the assets and shareholders' equity of each Old Republic segment are set forth in the following table. This information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto, and the "Management Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations" appearing elsewhere in this report.

General Insurance Group 
 Old Republic's General Insurance segment is best characterized as a commercial lines insurance business with a strong focus on liability insurance coverages. Most of these coverages are provided to businesses, government, and other institutions. The Company does not have a meaningful exposure to personal lines insurance such as homeowners and private automobile coverages, nor does it insure significant amounts of commercial or other real property. In continuance of its commercial lines orientation, Old Republic also focuses on specific sectors of the North American economy, most prominently the transportation (trucking and general aviation), commercial construction, healthcare, education, retail and wholesale trade, forest products, energy, general manufacturing, and financial services industries. In managing the insurance risks it undertakes, the Company employs various underwriting and loss mitigation techniques such as utilization of policy deductibles, captive insurance risk-sharing arrangements, and retrospective rating and policyholder dividend plans. These underwriting techniques are intended to better correlate premium charges with the ultimate claims experience of individual or groups of assureds. 
 Over the years, the General Insurance Group's operations have been developed steadily through a combination of internal growth, the establishment of additional subsidiaries focused on new types of coverages and/or industry sectors, and through several mergers of smaller companies. As a result, this segment has become widely diversified with a business base encompassing the following major coverages: 
 Automobile Extended Warranty Insurance (1992): Coverage is provided to the vehicle owner for certain mechanical or electrical repair or replacement costs after the manufacturer's warranty has expired. 
 Aviation (1983): Insurance policies protect the value of aircraft hulls and afford liability coverage for acts that result in injury, loss of life, and property damage to passengers and others on the ground or in the air. 
 Commercial Automobile Insurance (1930's): Covers vehicles (mostly trucks) used principally in commercial pursuits. Policies cover damage to insured vehicles and liabilities incurred by an assured for bodily injury and property damage sustained by third parties. 
 Commercial Multi-Peril ("CMP")(1920's): Policies afford liability coverage for claims arising from the acts of owners or employees, and protection for the physical assets of businesses. 
 Financial Indemnity: Multiple types of specialty coverages, including most prominently the following four, are underwritten by Old Republic within this financial indemnity products classification. 
 Errors Omissions("E O")/Directors Officers ("D O")(1983): E O liability policies are written for non-medical professional service providers such as lawyers, architects, and consultants, and provide coverage for legal expenses, and indemnity settlements for claims alleging breaches of professional standards. D O coverage provides for the payment of legal expenses, and indemnity settlements for claims made against the directors and officers of corporations from a variety of sources, most typically shareholders. 
 Fidelity (1981): Bonds cover the exposures of financial institutions and commercial and other enterprises for losses of monies or debt and equity securities due to acts of employee dishonesty. 
 Guaranteed Asset Protection ("GAP")(2003): This insurance indemnifies an automobile loan borrower for the dollar value difference between an insurance company's liability for the total loss (remaining cash value) of an insured vehicle and the amount still owed on an automobile loan. 
 Surety (1981): Bonds are insurance company guarantees of performance by a corporate principal or individual such as for the completion of a building or road project, or payment on various types of contracts. 
 General Liability (1920's): Protects against liability of an assured which stems from carelessness, negligence, or failure to act, and results in property damage or personal injury to others. 
 Home Warranty Insurance (1981): This product provides repair and/or replacement coverage for home systems (e.g. plumbing, heating, and electrical) and designated appliances. 
 Inland Marine (1920's): Coverage pertains to the insurance of property in transit over land and of property which is mobile by nature. 
 Travel Accident (1970): Coverages provided under these policies, some of which are also underwritten by the Company's Canadian life insurance affiliate, cover monetary losses arising from trip delay and cancellation for individual insureds. 
 Workers' Compensation (1910's): This coverage is purchased by employers to provide insurance for employees' lost wages and medical benefits in the event of work-related injury, disability, or death.

 (Parenthetical dates refer to the year(s) when Old Republic's Companies began underwriting the coverages)

Commercial automobile, general liability and workers' compensation insurance policy coverages are typically produced in tandem for many assureds. For 2020, production of commercial automobile direct insurance premiums accounted for approximately 37.7 of consolidated General Insurance Group direct premiums written, while workers' compensation and general liability direct premium production amounted to approximately 25.0 and 14.2 , respectively, of such consolidated totals. 
 
 Approximately 92 of general insurance premiums are produced through independent agency or brokerage channels, while the remaining 8 is obtained through direct production facilities. 

Title Insurance Group 
 
 Old Republic's flagship title insurance company was founded in 1907. The Title Insurance Group's business consists primarily of the issuance of policies to real estate purchasers and investors based upon searches of the public records which contain information concerning interests in real property. The policies insure against losses arising out of defects, liens and encumbrances affecting the insured title and not excluded or excepted from the coverage of the policy. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 25 of the Company's consolidated title premium and related fee income stemmed from direct operations (which include branch offices of its title insurers and wholly owned agency subsidiaries of the Company), while the remaining 75 emanated from independent title agents and underwritten title companies. 
 
 There are two basic types of title insurance policies: lenders' policies and owners' policies. Both are issued for a one-time premium. Most mortgages made in the United States are extended by mortgage bankers, savings and commercial banks, state and federal agencies, and life insurance companies. These financial institutions secure title insurance policies to protect their mortgagees' interest in the real property. This protection remains in effect for as long as the mortgagee has an interest in the property. A separate title insurance policy may be issued to the owner of the real estate. An owner's policy of title insurance protects an owner's interest in the title to the property. 
 
 The premiums charged for the issuance of title insurance policies vary with the policy amount and the type of policy issued. The premium is collected in full when the real estate transaction is closed, there being no recurring fee thereafter. In many areas, premiums charged on subsequent policies on the same property may be reduced depending generally upon the time elapsed between issuance of the previous policies and the nature of the transactions for which the policies are issued. Most of the charge to the customer relates to title services rendered in conjunction with the issuance of a policy rather than to the possibility of loss due to risks insured against. Accordingly, the cost of services performed by a title insurer relates for the most part to the prevention of loss rather than to the assumption of the risk of loss. Claim costs that do occur result primarily from title search and examination mistakes, fraud, forgery, incapacity, missing heirs and escrow processing errors. 
 
 In connection with its title insurance operations, Old Republic also provides escrow closing and construction disbursement services, as well as real estate information products, national default management services, and a variety of other services pertaining to real estate transfers and loan transactions. As lenders and the title insurance industry transition into the evolving digital landscape of eClosings and eMortgages, Old Republic believes it is well positioned with technology and business process innovations to remain competitive in the market. 

Republic Financial Indemnity Group (RFIG) Run-off Business 
 Historically, Old Republic's RFIG run-off business consisted of its mortgage guaranty and consumer credit indemnity ("CCI") operations. 
 Private mortgage insurance protects mortgage lenders and investors from default related losses on residential mortgage loans made primarily to homebuyers who make down payments of less than 20 of the home's purchase price. The mortgage guaranty operation insures only first mortgage loans, primarily on residential properties incorporating one-to-four family dwelling units. Old Republic's mortgage guaranty business was started in 1973. 
 
 There are two principal types of private mortgage insurance coverage: "primary" and "pool". 
 
 Primary mortgage insurance provides mortgage default protection on individual loans and covers a stated percentage of the unpaid loan principal, delinquent interest, and certain expenses associated with the default and subsequent foreclosure. Traditional primary insurance was issued on an individual loan basis to mortgage bankers, brokers, commercial banks and savings institutions through a network of Company-managed underwriting sites located throughout the country. Traditional primary loans were individually reviewed (except for loans insured under delegated underwriting programs) and priced according to filed premium rates. In underwriting traditional primary business, the Company generally adhered to the underwriting guidelines published by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac both of which were purchasers of many of the loans the Company insured. Delegated underwriting programs allowed approved lenders to commit the Company to insure loans provided they adhered to predetermined underwriting guidelines. In lieu of paying the stated coverage percentage, the Company may pay the entire claim amount, take title to the mortgaged property, and subsequently sell the property to mitigate its loss. 
 
 Bulk and other insurance was issued on groups of loans to mortgage banking customers through a centralized risk assessment and underwriting department. These groups of loans were priced in the aggregate on a bid or negotiated basis. Coverage for insurance issued in this manner was provided through primary insurance policies (loan 
 5 

level coverage) or pool insurance policies (aggregate coverage). The outstanding amount of in-force policies attributable to bulk business is no longer considered material. 
 
 Pool insurance, which is written on a group of loans in negotiated transactions, provides coverage that ranges up to 100 of the net loss on each individual loan included in the pool, subject to provisions regarding deductibles, caps on individual exposures, and aggregate stop loss provisions which limit aggregate losses to a specified percentage of the total original balances of all loans in the pool. 
 
 Before insuring any loans, the Company issued to each approved customer a master policy outlining the terms and conditions under which coverage would be provided. Primary business was then produced via the issuance of a commitment/certificate for each loan submitted and approved for insurance. In the case of business providing pool coverage, a separate pool insurance policy was issued covering the particular loans applicable to each transaction. 
 
 As to all types of mortgage insurance products, the amount of premium charge depended on various underwriting criteria such as loan-to-value ratios, the level of coverage being provided, the borrower's credit history, the type of loan instrument (whether fixed rate/fixed payment or an adjustable rate/adjustable payment), documentation type, and whether or not the insured property is categorized as an investment or owner occupied property. Coverage is non-cancelable by the Company (except in the case of non-payment of premium or certain master policy violations) and premiums are paid under single, annual, or monthly payment plans. Single premiums are paid at the inception of coverage and provide coverage for the entire policy term. Annual and monthly premiums are renewable on their anniversary dates with the premium charge determined on the basis of the original or outstanding loan amount. The majority of the Company's direct premiums were written under monthly premium plans. Premiums may be paid by borrowers as part of their monthly mortgage payment and passed through to the Company by the servicer of the loan, or paid directly by the originator of, or investor in the mortgage loan. 
 
 During 2011, the Company's flagship mortgage guaranty insurance carrier, Republic Mortgage Insurance Company ("RMIC") and its sister company Republic Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation ("RMGIC"), discontinued writing new business in all states and limited themselves to servicing the run-off of their existing business. RMIC has continually evaluated the potential long-term underwriting performance of the run-off book of business based on various modeling techniques. The resulting models take into account actual premium and paid claim experience of prior periods, together with a large number of assumptions and judgments about future outcomes that are highly sensitive to a wide range of estimates. Many of these estimates and underlying assumptions relate to matters over which the Company has no control, including: 1) The conflicted interests, as well as the varying mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices of a large number of insured lending institutions; 2) General economic and industry-specific trends and events; and 3) The evolving or future social and economic policies of the U.S. Government vis- -vis such critical sectors as the banking, mortgage lending, and housing industries, as well as its policies for resolving the insolvencies and assigning a possible future role to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These matters notwithstanding, a long-used standard model of forecasted results indicates that underwriting performance of the book of business is not expected to have a material impact on Old Republic's consolidated results during the remaining run-off period. 
 
 As of December 31, 2020, RFIG's mortgage insurance subsidiaries had total statutory capital, inclusive of a contingency reserve of 316.7 million, of 435.2 million. 
 
 CCI policies, which have been issued by the Company since 1954, provide limited indemnity coverage to lenders and other financial intermediaries. The coverage is for the risk of non-payment of loan balances by individual buyers and borrowers. Claim costs are typically affected by unemployment, bankruptcy, and other issues leading to failures to pay. During 2008, the Company ceased the underwriting of new policies and the existing book of business was placed in run-off operating mode. Results for the CCI coverages are expected to be immaterial in the remaining run off periods and effective July 1, 2019, these results have been reclassified to the General Insurance segment for all future periods. 

Corporate and Other Operations 
 
 Corporate and other operations include the accounts of a small life and accident insurance business as well as those of the parent holding company and its internal corporate services subsidiaries that perform cash and investment management, payroll, administrative and marketing services. The life and accident business registered net premium revenues of 12.0 million, 13.4 million, and 14.6 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Life and accident business is conducted in both the United States and Canada and consists mostly of limited product offerings sold through financial intermediaries such as automobile dealers, travel agents, and marketing channels that are also utilized in some of Old Republic's general insurance operations. Production of term life insurance, accounting for net premiums earned of 5.3 million, 5.7 million, and 6.8 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was terminated and placed in run off as of year-end 2004.

 Net Premiums Earned 
 
 General insurance net premiums earned were down slightly for 2020. The economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and tightened underwriting standards were mitigated by strong premium rate increases for most insurance products. Declining workers' compensation and general liability premiums were largely offset by rising premiums in commercial auto, financial indemnity and property coverages. With few exceptions, 2019 premiums grew for most types of coverages and markets served. The largest contributions principally stemmed from commercial automobile (trucking), national accounts and executive indemnity coverages. 
 
 The Title insurance segment experienced strong growth in premium and fee revenues in 2020 and 2019. This performance was driven by a robust real estate market supported by a continued low interest rate environment, resulting in an increase in home sales and refinance activity. 
 
 RFIG Run-off earned premium volume has reflected a continuing decline due to the natural outcome of a run-off book of business devoid of new premium production since 2011. 
 
 Claim Ratios 
 
 Variations in claim ratios are typically caused by changes in the frequency and severity of claims incurred, changes in premium rates and the level of premium refunds, and periodic changes in claim and claim expense reserve estimates resulting from ongoing reevaluations of reported and incurred but not reported claims and claim expenses. As demonstrated in the table on the previous page, the Company can therefore experience period-to-period volatility in the underwriting results posted for individual coverages. In light of Old Republic's basic underwriting focus in managing its business, a long-term objective has been to dampen this volatility by diversifying coverages offered and industries served. 
 
 The claim ratios include loss adjustment expenses where appropriate. Policyholders' dividends, which apply principally to workers' compensation insurance, are a reflection of changes in loss experience for individual or groups of policies, rather than overall results, and should be viewed in conjunction with claim ratio trends. 
 
 The general insurance claim ratios are summarized as follows: 
 Effect of Prior Periods' (Favorable)/ Claim Ratio Excluding Reported Unfavorable Claim Prior Periods' Claim Claim Ratio Reserves Development Reserves Development 2016 73.0 0.3 72.7 2017 71.8 0.7 71.1 2018 72.2 72.2 2019 71.8 0.4 71.4 2020 69.9 (0.8) 70.7 
 
 The Company generally underwrites concurrently workers' compensation, commercial automobile (liability and physical damage), and general liability insurance coverages for a large number of customers. Given this concurrent underwriting approach, an evaluation of trends in premiums, claim and dividend ratios for these individual coverages is more appropriately considered for the aggregate of these coverages. As the table above indicates, claim ratios have been on a fairly consistent downtrend during the past five years. The improvement has arisen from slightly lower estimates of current accident years' claim provisions, and in 2020, by the impacts from developments of prior years' reserve estimates. 
 
 Claims are a major cost factor and changes in them reflect continually evolving pricing and risk selection together with variability in loss severity and frequency trends caused by fortuitous and other events. Changes in commercial automobile claim ratios are primarily due to fluctuations in claim severity. Claim ratios for workers' compensation and liability insurance can reflect greater variability due to chance events in any one year, changes in loss costs emanating from participation in involuntary markets (i.e. insurance assigned risk pools and associations in which participation is basically mandatory), and estimated provisions for loss costs not recoverable from assuming reinsurers which may experience financial difficulties from time to time. Additionally, workers' compensation claim costs in particular are affected by a variety of underwriting techniques such as the use of captive reinsurance retentions, retrospective premium plans, and self-insured or deductible insurance programs that are intended to mitigate claim costs over time. Claim ratios for a relatively small book of general liability coverages tend to be highly volatile year to year due to the impact of changes in claim emergence and severity of legacy asbestos and environmental claims exposures. 
 8 

Title insurance claim ratios have remained in the single digits for a number of years due to a continuation of favorable trends in claims frequency and severity. Favorable developments of reserves established in prior years continued to reduce the claim ratios for the periods shown in the following table: 
 Effect of Prior Periods' (Favorable)/ Claim Ratio Excluding Reported Unfavorable Claim Prior Periods' Claim Claim Ratio ) Reserves Development ) Reserves Development ) 2016 3.5 (1.0) 4.5 2017 0.8 (3.0) 3.8 2018 1.9 (1.8) 3.7 2019 2.5 (1.2) 3.7 2020 2.3 (1.3) 3.6 
 _________ 
 
 ) Reclassification adjustments were made to certain Title segment revenues and expenses in prior periods to conform to the presentation adopted in 2020. See Note 1(c) to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The RFIG Run-off 2020 claim ratio reflects greater reserve provisions necessitated by elevated delinquencies and the evolving economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior period favorable development is primarily the result of improving trends in claim severity. 
 
 Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as indicated in the far right column of the following table, the RFIG Run-off claim ratios had experienced a fairly consistent decline in recent annual periods largely due to a combination of declining new loan defaults and stable-to-improving cure rates for outstanding delinquent loans. 
 Effect of Prior Periods' (Favorable)/ Claim Ratio Excluding Reported Unfavorable Claim Prior Periods' Claim Claim Ratio Reserves Development Reserves Development 2016 34.1 (39.8) 73.9 2017 57.6 (38.3) 95.9 2018 43.2 (27.0) 70.2 2019 55.0 (12.5) 67.5 2020 81.7 (26.5) 108.2 
 
 The consolidated claim, expense, and combined ratios reflect all the above factors and the changing period-to-period contributions of each segment to consolidated results. 

General Insurance Claim Reserves 
 
 The Company's property and liability insurance subsidiaries establish claim reserves which consist of estimates to settle: a) reported claims; b) claims which have been incurred as of each balance sheet date but have not as yet been reported ("IBNR") to the insurance subsidiaries; and c) the direct costs, (fees and costs which are allocable to individual claims) and indirect costs (such as salaries and rent applicable to the overall management of claim departments) to administer known and IBNR claims. Such claim reserves, except as to classification in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as to gross and reinsured portions and purchase accounting adjustments, are reported for financial and regulatory reporting purposes at amounts that are substantially the same. 
 
 The establishment of claim reserves by the Company's insurance subsidiaries is a reasonably complex and dynamic process influenced by a large variety of factors. These factors principally include past experience applicable to the anticipated costs of various types of claims, continually evolving and changing legal theories emanating from the judicial system, recurring accounting, statistical, and actuarial studies, the professional experience and expertise of the Company's claim departments' personnel or attorneys and independent claim adjusters, ongoing changes in claim frequency or severity patterns such as those caused by natural disasters, illnesses, accidents, work-related injuries, and changes in general and industry-specific economic conditions. Consequently, the reserves established are a reflection of the opinions of a large number of persons, of the application and interpretation of historical precedent and trends, of expectations as to future developments, and of management's judgment in interpreting all such factors. At any point in time, the Company is exposed to the possibility of higher or lower than anticipated claim costs due to all of these factors, and to the evolution, interpretation, and expansion of tort law, as well as the effects of unexpected jury verdicts. 
 
 In establishing claim reserves, the potential increase in future loss settlement costs caused by inflation is considered implicitly, along with the many other factors cited above. Reserves are generally set to provide for the ultimate cost of all claims. With regard to workers' compensation reserves, however, the ultimate cost of long-term disability or pension type claims is discounted to present value based on interest rates generally ranging from 3.0 to 
 9 

4.0 . Where applicable, the Company only uses such discounted reserves in evaluating the results of its operations, in pricing its products and settling retrospective and reinsured accounts, in evaluating policy terms and experience, and for other general business purposes. Solely to comply with reporting rules mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, however, Old Republic has made statistical studies of applicable workers' compensation reserves to obtain estimates of the amounts by which claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of reinsurance, have been discounted. These studies have resulted in estimates of such amounts at 196.9 million, 209.6 million and 216.5 million, as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. It should be noted, however, that these differences between discounted and non-discounted (terminal) reserves are fundamentally of an informational nature, and are not indicative of an effect on operating results for any one or series of years for the above noted reasons. 
 
 Early in 2001, the Federal Department of Labor revised the Federal Black Lung Program regulations. The revisions basically require a reevaluation of previously settled, denied, or new occupational disease claims in the context of newly devised, more lenient standards when such claims are resubmitted. Following a number of challenges and appeals by the insurance and coal mining industries, the revised regulations were, for the most part, upheld in June, 2002 and are to be applied prospectively. Since the final quarter of 2001, black lung claims filed or refiled pursuant to these revised regulations have increased, though the volume of new claim reports has abated in recent years. 
 
 In March 2010, federal regulations were revised once again as part of the Patient Protection and Affordability Act that reinstates two provisions that can potentially benefit claimants. In response to this most recent legislation and the above noted 2001 change, black lung claims filed or refiled have risen once again. The vast majority of claims filed to date against Old Republic pertain to business underwritten through loss sensitive programs that permit the charge of additional or refund of return premiums to wholly or partially offset changes in estimated claim costs, or to business underwritten as a service carrier on behalf of various industry-wide involuntary market (i.e. assigned risk) pools. A much smaller portion pertains to business produced on a traditional risk transfer basis. The Company has established applicable reserves for claims as they have been reported and for claims not as yet reported on the basis of its historical experience as well as assumptions relative to the effect of the revised regulations. 
 
 Old Republic's reserve estimates also include provisions for indemnity and settlement costs for various asbestosis and environmental impairment ("A E") claims that have been filed in the normal course of business against a number of its insurance subsidiaries. Many such claims relate to policies incepting prior to 1985, including many issued during a short period between 1981 and 1982 pursuant to an agency agreement canceled in 1982. Over the years, the Company's property and liability insurance subsidiaries have typically issued general liability insurance policies with face amounts ranging between 1.0 million and 2.0 million and rarely exceeding 10.0 million. Such policies have, in turn, been subject to reinsurance cessions which have typically reduced the subsidiaries' net retentions to .5 million or less as to each claim. 
 
 Old Republic's exposure to A E claims cannot be calculated by conventional insurance reserving methods for a variety of reasons, including: a) the absence of statistically valid data inasmuch as such claims typically involve long reporting delays and very often uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds against whom such claims have arisen or will arise; and b) the litigation history of such or similar claims for insurance industry members which has produced inconsistent court decisions with regard to such questions as to when an alleged loss occurred, which policies provide coverage, how a loss is to be allocated among potentially responsible insureds and/or their insurance carriers, how policy coverage exclusions are to be interpreted, what types of environmental impairment or toxic tort claims are covered, when the insurer's duty to defend is triggered, how policy limits are to be calculated, and whether clean-up costs constitute property damage. 
 
 Over time, the Executive Branch and/or the Congress of the United States have proposed or considered changes in the legislation and rules affecting the determination of liability for environmental and asbestosis claims. As of December 31, 2020, however, there is no solid evidence to suggest that possible future changes might mitigate or reduce some or all of these claim exposures. Because of the above issues and uncertainties, estimation of reserves for losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses for A E claims in particular is much more difficult or impossible to quantify with a high degree of precision. Accordingly, no representation can be made that the Company's reserves for such claims and related costs will not prove to be overstated or understated in the future. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Old Republic's aggregate indemnity and loss adjustment expense reserves specifically identified with A E exposures amounted to approximately 127.6 million and 126.8 million gross, respectively, and 82.4 million and 83.3 million net of reinsurance, respectively. Based on average annual claims payments during the five most recent calendar years, such reserves represented a paid loss survival ratio of 6.3 years (gross) and 7.1 years (net of reinsurance) as of December 31, 2020 and 6.3 years (gross) and 7.2 years (net of reinsurance) as of December 31, 2019. Fluctuations in this ratio between years can be caused by the inconsistent pay out patterns associated with these types of claims. For the five years ended December 31, 2020, incurred A E claim and related loss settlement costs have averaged .3 of average annual General Insurance Group claims and related settlement costs. 
 
 Over the years, the subject of property and liability insurance claim reserves has been written about and analyzed extensively by a large number of professionals and regulators. Accordingly, the above discussion should be regarded as a basic outline of the subject and not as a definitive presentation. The Company believes that its overall reserving practices have been consistently applied over many years, and that its aggregate reserves have generally resulted in reasonable approximations of the ultimate net costs of claims incurred. However, no representation is made nor is any guaranty given that ultimate net claim and related costs will not develop in future years to be greater or lower than currently established reserve estimates.

(b) Investments. In common with other insurance organizations, Old Republic invests most of its capital and operating funds in income producing securities. Investments must comply with applicable insurance laws and regulations which prescribe the nature, form, quality, and relative amounts of investments which may be made by insurance companies. Generally, these laws and regulations permit insurance companies to invest within varying limitations in state, municipal and federal government obligations, corporate debt, preferred and common stocks, certain types of real estate, and first mortgage loans. For many years, Old Republic's investment policy has therefore been to acquire and retain primarily investment grade, publicly traded, fixed maturity securities, and in more recent years, a greater amount of high yielding publicly traded large capitalization equity securities. The investment policy is also influenced by the terms of the insurance coverages written, by its expectations as to the timing of claim and benefit payments, and by income tax considerations. As a consequence of all these factors, the Company's invested assets portfolio is directed in consideration of enterprise-wide risk management objectives. Most importantly, these are intended to ensure solid funding of insurance subsidiaries' long-term obligations to policyholders and other beneficiaries, as well as the long-term stability of the subsidiaries' capital accounts. To this end, the investment portfolio contains no significant insurance risk-correlated asset exposures to real estate, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations ("CDO's"), derivatives, hybrid securities, or illiquid private equity and hedge fund investments. Moreover, the Company does not engage in hedging or securities lending transactions, nor does it invest in securities whose values are predicated on non-regulated financial instruments exhibiting amorphous or unfunded counter-party risk attributes. 
 
 Management considers investment grade fixed maturity securities to be those rated by major credit rating agencies that fall within the top four rating categories, or securities which are not rated but have characteristics similar to securities so rated. The Company had no fixed maturity investments in default as to principal and/or interest at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The status and fair value changes of each of the fixed maturity investments are reviewed at least once per quarter during the year, and estimates of other-than-temporary impairments ("OTTI") and resulting allowances for credit losses in the portfolio's value are evaluated and established at each quarterly balance sheet date. 
 
 The realization of investment gains or losses can be highly discretionary and can be affected by such randomly occurring factors as the timing of individual securities sales, the recording of estimated losses from write-downs of impaired securities, tax-planning and tax-rate change considerations, and modifications of investment management judgments regarding the direction of securities markets or the future prospects of individual investees or industry sectors.

(c) Marketing. Commercial automobile (trucking), workers' compensation and general liability insurance underwritten for business enterprises and public entities is marketed primarily through independent insurance agents and brokers with the assistance of Old Republic's trained sales, underwriting, actuarial, and loss control personnel. The remaining property and liability commercial insurance written by Old Republic is obtained through insurance agents or brokers 
 12 

who are independent contractors and by direct sales. No single source accounted for over 10 of Old Republic's premium volume in 2020. 
 
 A substantial portion of the Company's title insurance business is referred to it by title insurance agents, builders, lending institutions, real estate developers, realtors, and lawyers. Title insurance and related real estate settlement products are sold through 274 Company offices and through agencies and underwritten title companies in the District of Columbia and all 50 states. The issuing agents are authorized to issue commitments and title insurance policies based on their own search and examination, or on the basis of abstracts and opinions of approved attorneys. Policies are also issued through independent title companies (not themselves title insurers) pursuant to underwriting agreements. These agreements generally provide that the agency or underwritten company may cause title policies of the Company to be issued, and the latter is responsible under such policies for any payments to the insured. Typically, the agency or underwritten title company deducts the major portion of the title insurance charge to the customer as its commission for services. During 2020, approximately 75 of title insurance premiums and fees were accounted for by policies issued by agents and underwritten title companies. 
 
 Title insurance premium and fee revenue is closely related to the level of activity in the real estate market. The volume of real estate activity is affected by the availability and cost of financing, population growth, family movements and other socio-economic factors. Also, the title insurance business is seasonal. During the winter months, new building activity is reduced and, accordingly, the Company produces less title insurance business relative to new construction during such months than during the rest of the year. The most important factors, insofar as Old Republic's title business is concerned, however, are the rates of activity in the resale and refinance markets for residential properties and more recently, growth in commercial title business. 
 
 The Company's flagship mortgage guaranty insurance carrier ceased underwriting new policies and the existing book of business was placed in run-off operating mode effective August 31, 2011. Prior to that date, traditional primary mortgage insurance was marketed principally through a direct sales force which called on mortgage bankers, brokers, commercial banks, savings institutions and other mortgage originators. No sales commissions or other forms of remuneration were paid to the lending institutions or others for the procurement or development of business. 
 
 The personal contacts, relationships, reputations, and intellectual capital of Old Republic's key executives and other associates responsible for the production of business are a vital element in obtaining and retaining much of its business. Many of the Company's customers produce large amounts of premiums and fees and therefore warrant substantial levels of attention and involvement by these persons. In this respect, Old Republic's mode of operation is similar to that of professional reinsurers and commercial insurance brokers, and relies on the marketing, underwriting, and management skills of relatively few key people for large parts of its business. 
 
 Historically, several types of insurance coverages underwritten by Old Republic, such as consumer credit indemnity, title, and mortgage guaranty insurance, have been affected in varying degrees by changes in national economic conditions. During periods when housing activity or mortgage lending are constrained by any combination of rising interest rates, tighter mortgage underwriting guidelines, falling home prices, excess housing supply and/or economic recession, operating and/or claim costs pertaining to such coverages tend to rise disproportionately to revenues and can result in underwriting losses and reduced levels of profitability. 
 
 At least one Old Republic general insurance subsidiary is licensed to do business in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, and each of the Canadian provinces. Title insurance operations are licensed to do business in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Guam. Although not currently writing new business, the mortgage insurance subsidiaries are licensed in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Consolidated direct premium volume distributed among the various geographical regions shown was as follows for the past three years:

(d) Reserves, Reinsurance, and Retrospective Adjustments. Old Republic's insurance subsidiaries establish reserves for unearned premiums, reported claims, IBNR claims, and claim adjustment expenses, as required in the circumstances. See "General Insurance Claim Reserves" herein. 
 
 In order to maintain premium production within its capacity and limit maximum losses for which it might become liable under its policies, Old Republic, as is the common practice in the insurance industry, may cede all or a portion of its premiums and related liabilities on certain classes of insurance, individual policies, or blocks of business to other insurers and reinsurers. Although the ceding of insurance does not ordinarily discharge an insurer from its direct liability to a policyholder, it is industry practice to establish the reinsured part of risks as the liability of the reinsurer. Old Republic also employs retrospective premium and a large variety of risk-sharing procedures and arrangements for parts of its business in order to reduce underwriting losses for which it might become liable under insurance policies it issues, and to afford its customers or producers a degree of participation in the risks and rewards associated with such business. Under retrospective arrangements, Old Republic collects additional premiums if losses are greater than originally anticipated and refunds a portion of original premiums if loss costs are lower. Pursuant to risk sharing arrangements, the Company adjusts production costs or premiums retroactively to likewise reflect deviations from originally expected loss costs. The amount of premium, production costs and other retrospective adjustments which may be made is either limited or unlimited depending on the Company's evaluation of risks and related contractual arrangements.

 Reinsured liabilities of the Title Insurance Group, RFIG Run-off Group and small life and accident insurance operations are not material. 
 
 Reinsurance recoverable asset balances represent amounts due from or credited by assuming reinsurers for paid and unpaid claims and policy reserves. Such reinsurance balances that are recoverable from non-admitted foreign and certain other reinsurers such as captive insurance companies owned by assureds or business producers, as well as similar balances or credits arising from policies that are retrospectively rated or subject to assureds' high deductible retentions are substantially collateralized by irrevocable letters of credit, securities, and other financial instruments. Old Republic evaluates on a regular basis the financial condition of its assuming reinsurers and assureds who purchase its retrospectively rated or high deductible policies. Estimates of credit losses are included in the Company's net claim and claim expense reserves since reinsurance, retrospectively rated and self-insured deductible policies and contracts do not relieve Old Republic from its direct obligations to assureds or their beneficiaries. 
 
 Old Republic's reinsurance practices with respect to portions of its business also result from its desire to bring its sponsoring organizations and customers into some degree of joint venture or risk sharing relationship. The Company may, in exchange for a ceding commission, reinsure up to 100 of the underwriting risk, and the premium applicable to such risk, to commercial institutions generally whose customers are insured by Old Republic, or individual customers who have formed captive insurance companies. The ceding commissions received compensate Old Republic for performing the direct insurer's functions of underwriting, actuarial, claim settlement, loss control, legal, reinsurance, and administrative services to comply with local and federal regulations, and for providing appropriate risk management services. 
 
 Remaining portions of Old Republic's business are reinsured in most instances with independent insurance or reinsurance companies pursuant to excess of loss agreements. Except as noted in the following paragraph, reinsurance protection on property and liability coverages generally limits the net loss on most individual claims to a maximum of: 5.2 million for workers' compensation; 6.4 million for commercial automobile (trucking) liability; 6.4 million for general liability; 12.0 million for executive protection (directors officers and errors omissions); 2.0 
 14 

million for aviation; and 5.0 million for property coverages. Title insurance risk assumptions are generally limited to a maximum of 500.0 million as to any one policy. The vast majority of title policies issued, however, carry exposures of less than 1.0 million. The average direct primary mortgage guaranty exposure is (in whole dollars) 37,000 per insured loan. 
 
 Since January 1, 2005, the Company has had maximum treaty reinsurance coverage of up to 200.0 million for its workers' compensation exposures. Pursuant to regulatory requirements, however, all workers' compensation primary insurers such as the Company remain liable for unlimited amounts in excess of reinsured limits. Other than the substantial concentration of workers' compensation losses caused by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on America, to the best of the Company's knowledge there had not been a similar accumulation of claims in a single location from a single occurrence prior to that event. Nevertheless, the possibility continues to exist that non-reinsured losses could, depending on a wide range of severity and frequency assumptions, aggregate several hundred million dollars to an insurer such as the Company. Such aggregation of losses could occur in the event of a catastrophe such as an earthquake that could lead to the death or injury of a large number of persons concentrated in a single facility such as a high rise building. 
 
 As a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on America, the reinsurance industry eliminated coverage from substantially all contracts for claims arising from acts of terrorism. Primary insurers like the Company thus became fully exposed to such claims. Late in 2002, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the "TRIA") was signed into law, immediately establishing a temporary federal reinsurance program administered by the Secretary of the Treasury. The program applied to insured commercial property and casualty losses resulting from an act of terrorism, as defined in the TRIA. Congress extended and modified the program in late 2005 through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2005 (the "TRIREA"). TRIREA expired on December 31, 2007. Congress enacted a revised program in December 2007 through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (the "TRIPRA") of 2007. The TRIPRA has been extended on several occasions, most recently on December 20, 2019 for seven years. 
 
 The TRIA automatically voided all policy exclusions which were in effect for terrorism related losses and obligated insurers to offer terrorism coverage with most commercial property and casualty insurance lines. The TRIREA revised the definition of "property and casualty insurance" to exclude commercial automobile, burglary and theft, surety, professional liability and farm owners multi-peril insurance. TRIPRA did not make any further changes to the definition of property and casualty insurance, however, it did include domestic acts of terrorism within the scope of the program. Although insurers are permitted to charge an additional premium for terrorism coverage, insureds may reject the coverage. Under TRIPRA, the program's protection is not triggered for losses arising from an act of terrorism until the industry first suffers losses in excess of a prescribed aggregate deductible during any one year. The program deductible trigger was 200 million for 2020. Once the program trigger is met, the program will be responsible for a fixed percentage of the Company's terrorism losses that exceed its deductible which ranges from 85 for 2015 and declines by one percentage point per year until it reached 80 in 2020. The Company's deductible amounts to 20 of direct earned premium on eligible property and casualty insurance coverages. The Company currently reinsures limits on a treaty basis of 195.0 million in excess of 5.0 million for claims arising from certain acts of terrorism for casualty clash and catastrophe workers' compensation liability insurance coverages. The Company also purchases facultative reinsurance on certain accounts in excess of 200.0 million to manage the Company's net exposures. 

(e) Competition. The insurance business is highly competitive and Old Republic competes with many stockholder-owned and mutual insurance companies. Many of these competitors offer more insurance coverages and have substantially greater financial resources than the Company. The rates charged for many of the insurance coverages in which the Company specializes, such as workers' compensation insurance, other property and liability insurance and title insurance, are primarily regulated by the states. The basic methods of competition available to Old Republic, aside from rates, are service to customers, expertise in tailoring insurance programs to the specific needs of its clients, efficiency and flexibility of operations, personal involvement by its key executives, and, as to title insurance, accuracy and timely delivery of evidences of title issued. 
 
 The Company believes its experience and expertise have enabled it to develop a variety of specialized insurance programs and related services for its customers, and to secure state insurance departments' approval of these programs. 

(f) Government Regulation. In common with all insurance companies, Old Republic's insurance subsidiaries are subject to the regulation and supervision of the jurisdictions in which they do business. The method of such regulation varies, but, generally, regulation has been delegated to state insurance commissioners who are granted broad administrative powers relating to: the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; approval of policy forms; reserve requirements; and trade practices. In addition to these types of regulation, many classes of insurance, including most of the Company's insurance coverages, are subject to rate regulations which require that rates be reasonable, adequate, and not unfairly discriminatory. 
 
 The majority of states have also enacted insurance holding company laws which require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies controlled by other corporations licensed to transact business within their respective jurisdictions. Old Republic's insurance subsidiaries are subject to such legislation and are registered as controlled insurers in those jurisdictions in which such registration is required. Such legislation varies from state to state but typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation which controls the registered insurers, or ultimate holding company, and all subsidiaries of the ultimate holding company, and prior approval of certain intercorporate transfers of assets (including payments of dividends in excess of specified amounts by the insurance subsidiary) within the holding company system. Each state has established minimum capital and surplus requirements 
 15 

to conduct an insurance business. At December 31, 2020 each of the Company s General, Title, Mortgage Guaranty and Life and Accident insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements. 
 
 Data Protection and Cybersecurity 
 
 The Company is subject to U.S. laws and regulations that require financial institutions, insurance companies and other businesses to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information and provide notice of their practices relating to the collection and disclosure of personal information. The Company is also subject to laws and regulations requiring notification to affected individuals and regulators of security breaches. 
 
 Effective March 1, 2017, the New York Department of Financial Services issued a landmark cybersecurity regulation requiring covered financial services institutions to implement a cybersecurity program designed to protect customer information as well as information technology systems. The regulation imposes specific safeguards as well as governance, risk assessment, monitoring and testing, third party service provider management, incident response and reporting and other requirements. 
 
 In October 2017, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law, which requires insurers, insurance producers and other entities licensed under state insurance laws to develop and maintain a written information security program, conduct risk assessments, oversee the data security practices of third-party service providers and other related requirements. Since the model law s adoption, numerous states in which the Company operates have approved legislation incorporating the model into statute. 
 
 In June 2018, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act. This law provides California residents with broad personal data protections and rights related to the use and collection of their personal information. Additional states have adopted similar security and privacy laws and the Company anticipates additional information security and privacy laws and regulations to be forthcoming. 

(g) Employees. Old Republic s approximately 9,000 associates the Company s human and intellectual capital form a key stakeholder group and a most important resource for managing the Company's business. Creating the most appropriate culture and offering professional opportunities are the primary goals of Old Republic s human capital management. There is significant competition for talent in the insurance industry and the Company s ability to recruit, retain and develop its associates is a key driver for its long-term success. 
 
 As with many elements of the Company s business, the first and primary level of human capital management occurs in the Company s operating subsidiaries. This approach reflects the different needs and expectations of each operating subsidiary based on the industry specialization, lines of business, and location of each. In addition, the flexibility of this approach to human capital management benefits the entire enterprise and leads to the identification of methods and solutions that can eventually be used across the entire business. 
 
 At the holding company level, Old Republic emphasizes its corporate culture and coordinates the compensation and benefits philosophy that applies to all operating subsidiaries. Old Republic's culture is one that focuses on managing the business in the best interest of its shareholders and key stakeholders, including associates. The long-term success of Old Republic s associates means: 
 
 Training Development Investment in associates means investment in the business. Old Republic offers many training opportunities, including professional certifications, mentoring programs and leadership training. 
 Engagement Old Republic believes that an engaged workforce will be a successful workforce. The Company seeks to create and maintain engaged associates by offering opportunities to interact with industry, professional and charitable community organizations. 
 Planning Ahead Offering the right compensation and benefit packages and meaningful opportunities to invest in retirement gives Old Republic associates the opportunity to plan ahead. 
 
 The importance of Old Republic s human capital to the Company s success was never more clearly demonstrated than during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this challenging environment, Old Republic associates continued to serve customers and operate the Company s businesses with no meaningful interruption in service. This level of performance was the result of both their dedication and loyalty to the business, as well as the investments made by the Company in information technology, employee training and working arrangements sufficiently flexible for conditions. 

(h) Website access. The Company files various reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company's reports are available by visiting the SEC's website (http://www.sec.gov) and accessing its EDGAR database to view or print copies of the electronic versions of the Company's reports. Additionally, the Company's reports can be obtained, free of charge, by visiting its website (http://www.oldrepublic.com), selecting Investors then Financials to view or print copies of the electronic versions of the Company's SEC and other reports. The contents of the Company's website are not intended to be, nor should they be considered incorporated by reference in any of the reports the Company files with the SEC.

Item 1A - Risk Factors 

In evaluating the Company, the factors described below should be considered carefully. The occurrence of one or more of these events could significantly and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO OLD REPUBLIC AND ITS BUSINESSES 
 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the associated governmental responses could materially adversely affect Old Republic s business. 
 
 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant uncertainty, volatility and disruption in the U.S. economy and financial markets. Governmental responses to the pandemic have included shelter-in-place orders, directing many businesses to cease operations and individuals to restrict their movements. These actions have resulted in rapid decreases in economic activity, an increase in unemployment and pressures on the commercial real estate market. For a further discussion of the impact of the pandemic on Old Republic s business for the year ended December 31, 2020, see Management Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations-COVID-19 Pandemic and Old Republic s Business. 
 
 In addition, the pandemic caused significant financial market disruptions, most particularly in the first and second quarters of 2020. This had an adverse impact on the Company s investment portfolio and stock price. While many sectors in which the Company invests have recovered or partially recovered, should the COVID-19 pandemic continue to cause economic disruption, the Company s investment portfolio could experience continued volatility. For more information on the Company s investment portfolio performance, see Management Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations-Financial Position. 
 
 While the duration and ultimate effects of the pandemic remain highly uncertain, COVID-19 continues to have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy, which led to increased or continuing restrictions on business activity. A continuing or worsening reduction in economic activity could lead to a meaningful decline in the demand for the Company s products. The pandemic could also have a more significant impact on Old Republic s claims experience in future periods, resulting in a decrease in profitability. 
 
 Legislative and regulatory responses to COVID-19 could adversely affect Old Republic's business. 
 
 Federal, state and local government authorities, including state insurance departments, have taken various actions in response to the pandemic. For example, certain states are considering legislation that would retroactively mandate coverage for losses that are not covered under the terms of insurance policies. Certain state insurance departments are taking regulatory action that creates a presumption of compensability for workers in certain industries. Other regulatory initiatives include requirements to return premium, prevent the collection of premium, and/or prohibit the cancellation or non-renewal of policies. These legislative and regulatory actions, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect Old Republic s business. 
 
 Old Republic s loss reserves are based on estimates and if these prove to be inadequate to cover its actual insured losses, Old Republic s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 
 To recognize liabilities for anticipated policy losses, the Company establishes reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing its best estimate of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported losses and the related loss adjustment expenses. It is not possible to calculate precisely what these liabilities will amount to in advance and, accordingly, the reserves represent a best estimate at a point in time. Estimating loss reserves is a difficult, complex and inherently uncertain process involving many variables and subjective judgments. These estimates are based upon known historical loss data, assumptions and expectations of future trends in claim frequency and severity, changes in legal, regulatory and litigation environments, and inflation and other economic considerations. 
 
 Moreover, for long-tail coverages, which generally include workers' compensation, commercial automobile (trucking) liability, general liability, errors and omissions and directors and officers' liability, as well as title insurance, significant periods of time often elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to the Company and the payment of that loss. The length of time required to ultimately settle long-tailed claims and the costs associated with resolving these claims, coupled with uncertain and sometimes variable judicial rulings on coverage and policy allocation issues along with the possibility of legislative actions, makes reserving for these exposures highly uncertain and creates a risk of possibly adverse developments in both known and as-yet-unknown claims. 
 
 As a result of these uncertainties, the ultimate paid loss and loss adjustment expense may deviate, perhaps substantially, from the point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in the Company s financial statements. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company experienced consolidated favorable development of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in prior years of 83.8 million, 30.9 million and 77.8 million, respectively which had a positive effect on results of operations in those periods. To the extent that loss and loss adjustment expenses exceed initial estimates, the Company will be required to immediately recognize the less favorable experience and increase loss reserves, with a corresponding reduction in net income in the period in which the unfavorable development is identified. 
 17 

If the Company is unable to accurately underwrite risks and charge competitive yet profitable rates to its policyholders and customers, the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 In general, the premiums for the Company s insurance policies are established at the time a policy is issued and, therefore, before all of the underlying costs are known. Like other insurance companies, Old Republic relies on estimates and assumptions in setting premium rates. Establishing adequate premiums is necessary to generate sufficient revenue to offset losses, loss adjustment expenses and other underwriting costs and to earn an underwriting profit. If the Company does not accurately assess and underwrite the risks that it assumes, it may not charge adequate premiums to cover its losses and expenses, which would negatively affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations. Alternatively, the Company could set its premiums too high, which could reduce its competitiveness and lead to lower revenues. 
 
 Pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical loss data, and the projection of future trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of the Company s products. In order to accurately price its policies, the Company: 
 
 collects and analyzes a substantial volume of data from its insureds; 
 develops, tests and applies appropriate projections and rating formulas; 
 closely monitors and timely recognizes changes in trends; and; 
 seeks to project expected losses for its insureds with reasonable accuracy. 
 
 The Company seeks to implement its pricing accurately in accordance with its assumptions, data available to it and its analysis of that data. Given the uncertainties generally inherent in estimates and assumptions, the Company s ability to undertake these efforts successfully and, as a result, accurately price its policies, is not free from risk. 
 
 If the Company is unable to realize its investment objectives, its financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 
 Investment income is an important component of the Company s net income and one of its primary sources of cash flow to support operations. As of December 31, 2020, the consolidated investment portfolio reflected an allocation of approximately 74 to fixed-maturity (bonds and notes) and short-term investments, and 26 to equity securities (common stock). For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company reported 438.9 million, 450.7 million and 431.8 million of net investment income, respectively. 
 
 The Company s investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. Changing or unprecedented market conditions, such as experienced in the first half of the year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could decrease liquidity and materially impact the future valuation of fixed maturity and equity securities in the investment portfolio. 
 
 In structuring its investment portfolio, the Company seeks to align its policyholder obligations and the maturity of its fixed maturity portfolio. As a result of either an unexpected increase in policyholder obligations (e.g., because of an underestimate in reserves) or a short fall in funds available (e.g., because of a default in a fixed maturity investment), the Company could have difficulty in meeting its obligations. In this case, the Company could be forced to liquidate its investments before their maturity or under adverse securities market conditions to obtain the funds necessary to meet its obligations. This could result in unexpected losses in the portfolio. Additionally, the Company may be forced to change its investments or investment policies depending upon regulatory, economic and market conditions, thus affecting the existing or anticipated financial condition and operating needs, including the tax position, of its business. In such circumstances, the Company s investment objectives may not be achieved, and its financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 
 Losses due to nonperformance or defaults by counterparties can have a material adverse effect on the Company s profitability or sources of liquidity. 
 
 The Company has credit risk with counterparties associated with investments, premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverables. The Company s subsidiaries have significant business relationships with financial institutions, particularly national banks. These subsidiaries are the beneficiaries of a significant amount of security in the form of letters of credit, trust funds and investments which certain banks hold as collateral securing the obligations of insureds and certain reinsurers. Other banks are depositories holding large sums of money in escrow accounts established by the Company's title subsidiaries. There is thus a risk of concentrated financial exposures in one or more such banking institutions. These counterparties may default on their obligations to the Company due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, government intervention and other reasons. If any of these institutions fail or are unable to honor their credit obligations, or if escrowed funds become lost or tied up due to the failure of a bank, the result could have a materially adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The Company is also exposed to credit risk with its reinsurers. Reinsurance does not discharge the Company s insurance subsidiaries of their obligations under their insurance policies. The Company s insurance subsidiaries remain liable to policyholders even if they are unable to make recoveries that they believe they are entitled to receive under their reinsurance contracts. With respect to long-tail coverages, the creditworthiness of the Company s reinsurers may change before it can recover amounts to which it is entitled. If a reinsurer is unable to meet any of its 
 18 

obligations to the Company, it would be responsible for all claims and claim settlement expenses for which it would have otherwise received payment from the reinsurer. If the Company is unable to collect amounts recoverable from reinsurers, its business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. 
 
 The Company s status as a holding company with no direct operations could adversely affect its liquidity and its ability to service debt and pay dividends. 
 
 Old Republic is an insurance holding company with no operations of its own that transacts business through its operating subsidiaries. Old Republic s primary assets are the investments in these operating subsidiaries, and substantially all of the Company s assets consist of those used for the business conducted by its insurance subsidiaries. Old Republic relies upon dividends and interest from these subsidiaries in order to pay the interest and principal on its debt obligations, dividends to shareholders, and corporate expenses. 
 
 The payment of dividends by the Company s insurance subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance laws or subject to approval of the insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled. These authorities recognize only statutory accounting practices for determining financial position, results of operations and the ability of an insurer to pay dividends to its shareholders. The specific rules governing the payment of dividends by the Company s insurance subsidiaries vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The Company s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in many different jurisdictions. Generally, the insurance subsidiaries are prohibited from paying dividends to the holding company in excess of either the greater or lesser of (depending upon the state involved) 10 of statutory surplus or a portion of statutory net income, without the prior approval of the applicable insurance regulatory authority. Dividends declared during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 to the holding company by its subsidiaries amounted to 472.4 million, 399.5 million and 412.3 million, respectively. There can be no assurance that the Company s subsidiaries will be able to continue to pay such dividends to us in the future. If the Company s subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends to the holding company in amounts necessary to satisfy existing obligations, the Company s ability to service its debt and pay dividends to its shareholders would be adversely affected. 
 
 Old Republic may not be able to maintain paying dividends at current rates, or at all. 
 
 Old Republic has a long history of paying regular quarterly dividends and in recent years has paid special dividends. Any determination to pay either type of dividend to the Company s stockholders in the future will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors. Old Republic s ability to pay dividends depends largely on the Company s subsidiaries earnings and operating capital requirements, and is subject to regulatory and other constraints of the subsidiaries, including the effect of any such dividends or distributions on the AM Best rating or other ratings of the insurance subsidiaries. In addition, the Company may choose to retain capital to support growth or further mitigate risk, instead of returning excess capital to its shareholders. As a result, there can be no assurance that Old Republic will be able to maintain paying dividends as it has in the past. 
 
 Technology breaches or failures, including cybersecurity incidents, could disrupt the Company s operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information and expose the Company to additional liabilities, which could adversely affect its reputation and results of operations. 
 
 To perform day to day operations as well as communicate with customers, business partners and other stakeholders, the Company depends upon an array of digital technologies. The Company s business depends on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data its information systems use to run its business. The Company uses computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and make use of customer, employee, and company data and information. Some internal processes, in turn, rely upon third-party systems and tools. This combination of resources allow business units to provide insurance quotes, process premium payments, make changes to existing policies, file and pay claims, provide customer support, execute transactions and manage investment portfolios. In addition, the Company routinely transmits, receives and stores personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. Although the Company attempts to keep this information confidential, it may be unable to do so in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, and other third parties. 
 
 The Company s systems have in the past been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to cyber threats and other computer related intrusions. Like other large companies, Old Republic is a target of potential cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of threats to data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, ransomware, unauthorized access, misuse, denial-of-service attacks, system failures and disruptions. In some cases, such unauthorized access may not be immediately detected and can remain undetected for some time, increasing the severity of the incident. There is no assurance that the Company s security measures, including information security policies, will provide fully effective protection from such events. Any such cyber incident could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Any information security breach of systems or services or breach of a third-party vendor or services provider that results in the loss or unauthorized access of sensitive data could disrupt the Company s ability to conduct business operations during recovery and any remediation period. In the event of a cyber-attack or other information security incident, systems may be inaccessible to employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time and employees may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if data or systems are disabled or 
 19 

destroyed. In addition, a successful cyber-attack or similar information security incident could expose the Company to substantial costs and negative consequences including remediation costs, lost revenues and reputational damage. 
 
 Furthermore, Old Republic s businesses must comply with laws and regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments, as well as laws enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy and security of the information of clients, employees or others. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict. The compromise of personal, confidential or proprietary information could expose the Company to liability under federal and state laws, and subject it to litigation and investigations and result in reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Company may suffer losses from litigation, which could materially and adversely affect its financial condition and business operations. 
 
 Like other large insurance companies, Old Republic continually faces risks associated with litigation of various types, including claims litigation arising in the ordinary course, corporate litigation, and disputes relating to bad faith allegations that could result in the Company incurring losses in excess of policy limits. The Company typically is a party to a variety of litigation matters throughout the year. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and if there were an outcome unfavorable to the Company, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on its results of operations and financial position in the period in which the outcome occurs. Even if an unfavorable outcome does not materialize, the Company still may face substantial expense and disruption associated with the litigation. 
 
 The Company competes with a large number of companies in the insurance industry for premium revenues. 
 
 Each of the Company's lines of continuing insurance business is highly competitive and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. The Company faces competition from specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies and intermediaries, as well as diversified financial services companies that are significantly larger than it is and that have significantly greater financial, marketing, management and other resources. The Company may also face competition from new sources of capital such as institutional investors seeking access to the insurance market, sometimes referred to as alternative capital, which may depress pricing or limit the Company s opportunities to write business. The emergence of insurtech companies and other companies that may seek to write business without the appropriate regard for risk and profitability may lead to increased competition for premiums. All of these increases in competition threaten to reduce demand for the Company s insurance products, reduce its market share and growth prospects, and potentially reduce the Company s premium revenues and profitability. 
 
 If the Company is unable to keep pace with the technological advancements in the insurance industry, its ability to compete effectively could be impaired. 
 
 The Company s operations rely upon complex and expensive information technology systems for interacting with policyholders, brokers and other business partners. The pace at which information systems must be upgraded is continually increasing, requiring an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade to current standards. Many of the Company s operating subsidiaries maintain separate IT systems. The Company will need to continue to develop and maintain information technology systems that will allow its insurance subsidiaries to compete effectively. The development of new technologies may result in the Company being competitively disadvantaged if it is unable to upgrade its systems in a timely manner. If the Company is unable to keep pace with the advancements being made in technology, the Company s ability to compete with other insurance companies that have more advanced technological capabilities will be negatively affected. Further, if the Company is unable to effectively update or replace its key legacy technology systems as they become obsolete or as emerging technology renders them competitively inefficient, the Company s competitive position and its cost structure could be adversely affected. 
 
 Old Republic is subject to extensive governmental regulation, and if the Company fails to comply with these regulations, it can be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may adversely affect the Company s realization of its business objectives as well as its financial condition, results of operations and reputation. 
 
 Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than shareholders and other investors. These regulations, generally administered by a department of insurance in each state and territory in which the Company does business, relate to, among other things, policy forms, premium rates, capital requirements, licensing, investments, policy limits, accounting methods and reserving. 
 
 State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the conduct and affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual, quarterly and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. At any given time, governmental agencies are examining or investigating certain of the Company s operations. These include examinations or investigations of market conduct, competitive practices and other regulatory compliance matters. Changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities could adversely affect the Company s ability to operate its business as currently conducted and adversely affect or inhibit Old Republic s ability to achieve some or all of its business objectives. 
 
 Regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including 
 20 

the violation of regulations. In some instances, the Company follows practices based on its interpretations of regulations or practices that it believes may be generally followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If the Company does not have the requisite licenses and approvals or does not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities could initiate investigations or other proceedings, fine the Company, preclude or temporarily suspend the Company from carrying on some or all of its activities or otherwise penalize the Company. This could adversely affect the Company s ability to operate its business. 
 
 In addition to regulations specific to the insurance industry, as a public company, Old Republic is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), each of which regulate many areas such as financial and business disclosures, corporate governance and shareholder matters. Old Republic is also subject to the corporation laws of Delaware, its state of incorporation. At the federal level, among other laws, the Company is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, each of which regulate corporate governance, executive compensation and other areas, as well as laws relating to federal trade restrictions, privacy/data security and terrorism risk insurance laws. The Company monitors these laws, regulations and rules to assess the Company s compliance and make appropriate changes as necessary. Implementing such changes may require adjustments to the Company s business methods, increases to its costs and other changes that could cause the Company to be less competitive in the industry. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO GENERAL INSURANCE 
 
 Catastrophic losses, including those caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes or man-made events such as terrorist attacks, are inherently unpredictable and could cause the Company to suffer material financial losses. 
 
 While the General Insurance segment does not have a meaningful exposure to homeowners or other real property coverages, the casualty or liability insurance it underwrites creates exposure to claims arising out of catastrophes. The two principal catastrophe exposures are earthquakes and acts of terrorism in areas where there are large concentrations of employees of an insured employer or other individuals who could potentially be injured and assert claims against an insured under workers' compensation policies. Collateral damage to property or persons from acts of terrorism and other calamities could also expose general liability policies. 
 
 Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, the reinsurance industry eliminated coverage from substantially all reinsurance contracts for claims arising from acts of terrorism. As discussed elsewhere in this report, the U.S. Congress subsequently passed TRIA, TRIREA, and TRIPRA legislation that required primary insurers to offer coverage for certified acts of terrorism under most commercial property and casualty insurance policies. Although these programs established a temporary federal reinsurance program through December 31, 2027, primary insurers like the Company s general insurance subsidiaries retain significant exposure for terrorist act-related losses. 
 
 Since January 1, 2005, the Company has maintained maximum treaty reinsurance coverage of up to 200 million for workers' compensation exposures. Pursuant to regulatory requirements, however, all workers' compensation primary insurers such as the Company remain liable for unlimited amounts in excess of reinsured limits. Therefore, it is possible that in the event of a catastrophe such as an earthquake that could lead to the death or injury of a large number of persons concentrated in a single place, the Company could experience significant non-reinsured losses if the losses exceeded its reinsurance coverage, which could materially and adversely affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 In addition, natural events such as the COVID-19 pandemic can have a particular impact on certain business lines. For example, the General Insurance segment writes workers compensation business covering the continuing care industry, which has been adversely affected by the pandemic. The impact of the pandemic on covered individuals in this sector could cause the Company to experience increased claims and losses, which could also materially and adversely affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Current economic conditions could adversely affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Negative trends in employment rates can adversely affect Old Republic s workers compensation business. If the Company s customers reduce their workforce levels, the level of workers compensation insurance coverage they require and, as a result the premiums that the Company charges, would be reduced, and if the customer ceases operations, it will not renew its policy. For example, the pandemic's impact on employment levels, businesses, and other economic activities contributed to a reduction in net written and earned premium and fee revenues in the General Insurance segment for the year ended December 31, 2020. If the pandemic continues unabated, or current economic conditions do not improve, Old Republic could experience future decreases in business activity, which could have an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operation. 
 
 If the Company is not able to obtain reinsurance on favorable terms, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 
 Reinsurance is a contractual arrangement whereby one insurer (the reinsurer) assumes some or all of the risk exposure written by another insurer (the reinsured). The Company depends on reinsurance to manage its risks both in 
 21 

terms of the amount of coverage it is able to write, the amount it is able to retain for its own account, and the price at which the Company is able to write it. The availability of reinsurance and its price, however, are generally determined in the reinsurance market by conditions beyond the Company s control. 
 
 Because reinsurance does not relieve the Company of its primary liability to insureds in the event of a loss, the ability of reinsurers to honor their counterparty obligations to the Company represents credit risk. The Company attempts to mitigate this risk by limiting reinsurance placements to those reinsurers it considers the best credit risks. In recent years, however, there has been an ever decreasing number of acceptable reinsurers. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to find the desired or even adequate amounts of reinsurance at favorable rates from acceptable reinsurers in the future. If unable to do so, the Company would have greater exposure to catastrophic losses and be forced to reduce the volume of business written or retain increased amounts of liability exposure. In either case, any reduction or other changes in the Company s reinsurance could adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Losses due to defaults by insureds with which the Company has entered into risk sharing arrangements could adversely affect its profitability. 
 
 A significant amount of Old Republic's liability and workers' compensation business, particularly for large commercial insureds, is written on the basis of risk sharing underwriting methods. These methods may include the use of large deductibles, captive insurance risk retentions, or other arrangements by which the insureds effectively retain and fund all or a portion of the losses experience. An insured s financial strength and ability to pay are carefully evaluated as part of the underwriting process and monitored periodically thereafter. In addition, the exposure retained by an insured is estimated and collateralized based on a credit analysis and evaluation. Because the Company is primarily liable for losses incurred under its policies, the failure or inability of insureds to honor their retained liability represents a credit risk. If the Company incorrectly estimates the proper amount of collateral or if there is an impediment to the Company accessing that collateral, it could have a material adverse effect on the General Insurance segment s profitability, results of operation and financial condition. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO TITLE INSURANCE 
 
 The Title segment s products and services and claims experience may suffer as a result of deteriorations in the real estate market. 
 
 Demand for the products and services provided by the Title segment is generally dependent on the strength of the real estate market and the frequency of real estate transactions. If real estate market conditions and real estate values decline, the number of real estate transactions may decrease, as a result of high or increasing mortgage interest rates and limited or decreasing availability of credit, including commercial and residential mortgage funding. Historically, increasing foreclosure activity has led to an increase in claims. These factors may adversely affect both net premiums and fees earned and profitability in the segment. 
 
 A significant portion of the Title segment s business is generated by independent title agents and underwritten insurance companies. If this segment s products and services become less attractive to these independent title agents, or if there is a decrease in the amount of title industry business placed by independent title agents, it could have a material adverse impact on this segment. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 2.4 billion or 75 of the Title segment s consolidated premium and related fee income was produced by independent title agents. The other three large national title insurers generate a higher percentage of their business through employees or owned insurance agencies. Independent title agents can direct business to any title insurer, whereas owned agencies will typically direct business solely to their parent or affiliated title insurers. If the products and services provided by competitors are more attractive to independent title agents, or if the number of, or amount of business produced by, independent title agents decreases, the segment s business may be adversely affected. 
 
 Because independent title agents issue a significant portion of the Title segments policies and operate with substantial independence from the business, the independent operations of these title agents could adversely affect the financial condition and profitability of this segment. 
 
 The Title segment issues a significant portion of its policies through title agents that operate largely independently and without direct supervision. The independent agents typically perform title searches and examinations and make underwriting decisions for which the Title segment bears the risk. The activities of these independent title agents are governed by contract. While the Title business has policies to audit and monitor their activities, there is no guarantee that these title agents will fulfill their contractual obligations. For example, an independent agent may issue a policy that is in excess of contractual limits or the independent title agent may not adhere to required underwriting standards. The Title segment s contracts with agents generally limit an agent s liability for losses. However, under certain circumstances, the segment may be liable to third parties for actions (including defalcations) or omissions of these agents. In certain states a title insurer may be held liable for the actions or omissions of its agents in those states, regardless of contractual limitations imposed on an agent s activities. As a result, the use of independent title agents could result in increased claims and an increase in other costs and expenses. 
 22 

Regulation of title insurance rates could adversely affect the Title segment. 
 
 Title insurance rates are subject to extensive regulation, which varies from state to state. In many states the approval of the applicable state insurance regulator is required prior to implementing a rate change. These regulations could hinder the Title segment s ability to promptly adapt to changing market dynamics through price adjustments, which could adversely affect its results of operations, particularly in a rapidly declining market. 
 
 Florida represents approximately 19 of the Title segment consolidated premium and related fee income, respectively. The Title segment s business may be adversely affected by business or regulatory conditions that disproportionately affect Florida. 
 
 Florida is the largest source of revenue for the Title segment. In the aggregate in 2020, Florida accounted for approximately 19 of total segment consolidated premium and related fee income. As a result of the significant income associated with this state, the Title segment is exposed to adverse business or regulatory conditions that significantly or disproportionally affect this state. For example, a declining business climate or real estate market that is localized in this state could have an adverse effect on the segment s results of operations. Adverse regulatory developments, including reductions in rates or increased regulatory or capital requirements in this state could similarly adversely affect the segment s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Because the Company does not obtain reinsurance on certain large commercial title policies, a title failure or other claim on such a policy could adversely affect the Title segment and the Company. 
 
 The Title segment s commercial business involves the issuance of title policies on commercial properties. Policies insuring title on large commercial properties (or aggregations of many smaller properties) may have policy exposure extending into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Historically, the segment has not obtained reinsurance on its large commercial policies. Given the large policy limits, a significant loss on one of these policies would have a material adverse effect on the Title segment and the Company. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO THE RFIG-RUNOFF SEGMENT 
 
 A failure to adequately reserve for losses could materially adversely affect the RFIG Run-off segment. 
 
 The Company establishes reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for its RFIG Run-off segment based upon loans reported by mortgage servicers to be in default, as well as estimates of those in default but not yet reported. The reserves are best estimates by management and take into consideration many variables including the number of reported defaults, the payment status of those defaults, the segment s historical loss data and management s assumptions and expectations regarding future trends in housing and mortgage markets, unemployment rates and the economy in general. 
 
 Estimating reserves for mortgage guaranty exposures is an inherently uncertain process insofar as it is based on information reported by third parties and is subject to changes in economic conditions which could have a material impact on ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. See Old Republic s loss reserves are based on estimates and if its loss reserves prove to be inadequate to cover its actual insured losses, Old Republic s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected above. 
 
 Claim reserve estimates for the RFIG Run-off segment rely on the accuracy and timeliness of information provided by mortgage servicers with regards to the number and payment status of mortgage loans in default. Inaccuracies or delays in the reporting of default information could adversely affect the level of carried reserves or the timing in which such reserves or changes therein are recorded. With regard to changes in economic trends and conditions, periods of sustained economic distress such as those experienced during the Great Recession of 2007-2012 or, more recently, by the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, subject estimates of loss reserves to an even greater degree of uncertainty and volatility. 
 
 The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the CARES Act) introduced foreclosure moratoriums and established a forbearance option for borrowers suffering hardships induced by the pandemic. The RFIG Run-off segment loss reserves take into account expectations regarding the potential mitigating effects of the foreclosure moratoriums and loan forbearance provisions of the CARES Act and other loss mitigation programs implemented by mortgage servicers and governmental agencies which have oversight over mortgage servicing. The impact of the CARES Act or similar loss mitigation programs and efforts on the segment s ultimate claim costs is unknown and will likely depend on the duration and severity of the pandemic. 
 
 As a result of these risk factors the rate and severity of actual losses could prove to be greater than expected and could require the Company to effect substantial increases in its loss reserves. Depending upon the magnitude, such increases could have a material adverse impact on the segment s capital position and the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the actual losses for the RFIG segment will not be materially greater than previously established loss reserves.

Item 7 - Management Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations 
 in Millions, Except Share Data) 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 This management analysis of financial position and results of operations pertains to the consolidated accounts of Old Republic International Corporation ("Old Republic", "ORI" or "the Company"). The Company conducts its operations principally through three major regulatory segments, namely, its General (property and liability), Title, and the RFIG Run-off Business. A small life and accident insurance business, accounting for .2 of consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and .6 of consolidated assets as of that date, is included within the corporate and other caption of this report. 
 
 The consolidated accounts are presented in conformity with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). As a publicly held company, Old Republic utilizes GAAP largely to comply with the financial reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). From time to time the FASB and the SEC issue various releases, most of which require additional financial statement disclosures and provide related application guidance. Of particular relevance to the Company's financial statements is guidance recently issued by the FASB relative to recognition and measurement of financial instruments including the addition of equity security unrealized gains and losses in periodic income statements, lease accounting, and accounting for credit losses on financial instruments, all of which are discussed further in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 As a state regulated financial institution vested with the public interest, however, business of the Company's insurance subsidiaries is managed pursuant to the laws, regulations, and accounting practices of the various states in the U.S. and those of a small number of other jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which they operate. In comparison with GAAP, the statutory accounting practices reflect greater conservatism and comparability among insurers, and are intended to address the primary financial security interests of policyholders and their beneficiaries. Additionally, these practices also affect a significant number of important factors such as product pricing, risk bearing capacity and capital adequacy, the determination of Federal income taxes payable currently among ORI's tax-consolidated entities, and the upstreaming of dividends by insurance subsidiaries to the parent holding company. The major differences between these statutory financial accounting practices and GAAP are summarized in Note 1(a) to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 
 The insurance business is distinguished from most others in that the prices (premiums) charged for various insurance products are set without certainty of the ultimate benefit and claim costs that will emerge, often many years after issuance and expiration of a policy. This basic fact casts Old Republic as a risk-taking enterprise managed for the long run. Management therefore conducts the business with a primary focus on achieving favorable underwriting results over cycles, and on the maintenance of financial soundness in support of the insurance subsidiaries' long-term obligations to policyholders and their beneficiaries. To achieve these objectives, adherence to insurance risk management principles is stressed, and asset diversification and quality are emphasized. In addition, Management engages in an ongoing assessment of operating risks, such as cybersecurity risks, that could adversely affect the Company's business and reputation. 
 
 In addition to income arising from Old Republic's basic underwriting and related services functions, significant investment income is earned from invested funds generated by those functions and from capital resources. Investment management aims for stability of income from interest and dividends, protection of capital, and for sufficiency of liquidity to meet insurance underwriting and other obligations as they become payable in the future. Securities trading and the realization of capital gains are not primary objectives. The investment philosophy is therefore best characterized as emphasizing value, credit quality, and relatively long-term holding periods. The Company's ability to hold both fixed maturity and equity securities for long periods of time is in turn enabled by the scheduling of maturities in contemplation of an appropriate matching of assets and liabilities, and by investments in large capitalization, highly liquid equity securities. 
 
 In light of the above factors, the Company's affairs are managed for the long run and without significant regard to the arbitrary strictures of quarterly or even annual reporting periods that American industry must observe. In Old Republic's view, such short reporting time frames do not comport well with the long-term nature of much of its business. Management therefore believes that the Company's operating results and financial condition can best be evaluated by observing underwriting and overall operating performance trends over succeeding five- or preferably ten-year intervals. A ten-year period in particular can likely encompass at least one economic and/or underwriting cycle and thereby provide an appropriate time frame for such cycle to run its course, and for premium rate changes and reserved claim costs to be quantified and emerge in financial results with greater finality and effect. 
 
 This management analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the footnotes appended to them.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 Old Republic International Corporation reported the following consolidated results: 
 OVERALL RESULTS Years Ended December 31: 2020 2019 2018 Pretax income (loss) 688.4 1,322.4 438.1 Pretax investment gains (losses) (142.0) 636.1 (235.6) Pretax income (loss) excluding investment gains (losses) 830.4 686.2 673.7 Net income (loss) 558.6 1,056.4 370.5 Net of tax investment gains (losses) (112.1) 502.2 (185.9) Net income (loss) excluding investment gains (losses) 670.8 554.2 556.4 PER DILUTED SHARE Years Ended December 31: 2020 2019 2018 Net income (loss) 1.87 3.51 1.24 Net of tax investment gains (losses) (.37) 1.67 (.62) Net income (loss) excluding investment gains (losses) 2.24 1.84 1.86 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY December 31: 2020 2019 Shareholders' equity: Total 6,186.6 6,000.1 Per Common Share 20.75 19.98 
 
 Growth in 2020's net income, exclusive of all investment gains and (losses) was driven by greater profitability in both the General and Title Insurance segments. Overall, the business produced a consolidated combined ratio of 93.3 , improved from 95.3 and 94.9 registered in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Total and per share net income continue to be significantly impacted by changes in the fair value of equity securities. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated governmental responses continued to have a widespread impact on the U.S. economy. A majority of Old Republic's approximately 9,000 associates are working remotely. The pandemic's impact on employment levels, businesses, and other economic activities contributed to a slight reduction in earned premiums in the General Insurance segment. The Title Insurance segment experienced strong growth in premium and fee revenues. The RFIG Run-off business produced a small underwriting loss due to elevated delinquencies and the continuing decline in net earned premiums. 
 
 Net investment income decreased in 2020 as the ongoing moderate growth in the invested asset base was more than offset by lower investment yields whereas 2019 investment income growth was fueled by higher dividends on equity securities. Financial market performance experienced significant volatility and reductions in market values in the last several weeks of 2020's first quarter, but continued to improve throughout the remainder of the year. The favorable valuation of the investment portfolio, coupled with positive earnings, outpaced cash dividends to shareholders, resulting in book value per share rising to 20.75 at December 31, 2020 compared to 19.98 at December 31, 2019. 
 
 The economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic could affect future premium and fee revenues in the General Insurance and Title Insurance segments, and conversely underwriting expense ratios could rise. In the RFIG Run-off business, future claims experience could depend upon the continued, mitigating effects of loan forbearance programs mandated by the Federal government, and the rate at which employment levels recover. These outcomes notwithstanding, management firmly believes that the Company s strong financial condition will enable it to weather these challenges, and most importantly allow its insurance subsidiaries to meet their obligations to customers, policyholders and their beneficiaries. 

28 

Old Republic's business is necessarily managed for the long run. In this context management's key objectives are to achieve a continuous, long-term improvement in operating results, and to ensure balance sheet strength for the primary needs of the insurance subsidiaries' underwriting and related services business. In this view, the evaluation of periodic and long-term results excludes consideration of all investment gains and (losses). Under GAAP, however, net income (loss), which includes all specifically defined realized and unrealized investment gains and (losses), is the measure of total profitability. 
 
 In management's opinion, the focus on income (loss) excluding all investment gains and losses provides a better way to realistically analyze, evaluate, and establish accountability for the results and benefits that arise from the basic operations of the business. The inclusion of realized investment gains and (losses) in net income (loss) can mask the reality and trends in the fundamental operating results of the insurance business. That is because their realization is, more often than not, highly discretionary. It is usually affected by such randomly occurring factors as the timing of individual securities sales, tax-planning considerations, and modifications of investment management judgments about the direction of securities markets or the prospects of individual investees or industry sectors. Moreover, the inclusion of unrealized investment gains and (losses) in equity securities can further distort such operating results and trends therein and thus lead to even greater period-to-period fluctuations in reported net income (loss). The impact of the continuous volatility in stock market valuations is most evident in its net of tax effect on net income (loss) for the periods reported upon.

 __________________ 
 Effective July 1, 2019, the results of the CCI run-off business are being classified in the General Insurance Segment for and all future periods. 
 
 General Insurance net premiums earned were down slightly for 2020. The economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and tightened underwriting standards were mitigated by strong premium rate increases for most insurance products. Declining workers' compensation and general liability premiums were largely offset by rising premiums in commercial auto, financial indemnity and property coverages. With few exceptions, 2019 premiums grew for most types of coverages and markets served. The largest contributions principally stemmed from commercial automobile (trucking), national accounts, and executive indemnity coverages. Net investment income decreased by 1.2 for 2020 and increased by 4.5 in 2019. 
 
 The consolidated General Insurance claim ratio generally trended down in all periods presented and for 2020 was primarily driven by better performance in most coverages, primarily due to prior periods' favorable reserve developments. Expense ratios remained relatively consistent with the comparable 2019 and 2018 periods and are generally reflective of ongoing coverage mix dynamics and the variability of sales and general expenses among such coverages. Together, these factors produced significantly greater pretax operating income for 2020. 
 
 The following table shows recent annual claim ratios and the effects of claim development trends: 
 
 Effect of Prior Periods' (Favorable)/ Claim Ratio Excluding Reported Unfavorable Claim Prior Periods' Claim Claim Ratio Reserves Development Reserves Development 2016 73.0 0.3 72.7 2017 71.8 0.7 71.1 2018 72.2 72.2 2019 71.8 0.4 71.4 2020 69.9 (0.8) 70.7 

Annual claim ratios and trends may not be particularly meaningful indicators of future outcomes for an insurance company with a liability-oriented coverage mix and its relatively long claim payment patterns. Management's long-term targets, assuming the current coverage mix, are for annually reported claim ratio averages in the high 60 to low 70 range, expense ratio averages of 25 or below, and a combined ratio ranging between 90 and 95 .

 (a) Certain reclassification adjustments were made to increase net premiums and fees earned with a corresponding increase to sales and general expenses of 246.8 and 237.0 in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These adjustments were made to conform all prior periods to the presentation adopted in 2020 to reflect such revenues gross of applicable commission expense and had no impact on segmented pretax operating income (loss) in any period presented. See Note 1(c) to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Title Insurance operating revenues were up 19.8 and 6.3 for 2020 and 2019, respectively. This performance was driven by a robust real estate market supported by a continued low interest rate environment, resulting in an increase in home sales and refinance activity. Net investment income increased slightly for 2020 and 6.6 for 2019. 
 
 The Title Insurance claim ratio trends reflect the varying effects of favorable development of prior years' claim reserve estimates. Underwriting expense ratios improved in 2020 resulting from greater leverage of this segment's expense structure on significantly higher premium and fee volume. Title Insurance produced significantly greater pretax operating income for 2020.

 (a) Results for the CCI run-off are expected to be immaterial in the remaining run-off periods. Effective July 1, 2019, these results have been re-classified to General Insurance for all future periods. 
 
 Pretax operating results of RFIG Run-off reflect the expected, continuing drop in net earned premiums from declining risk in force. Claim costs for 2020 reflect greater reserve provisions necessitated by elevated delinquencies and the evolving economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Investment income declined primarily as a result of a lower invested asset base and lower investment yields. 
 
 As shown in the accompanying tables, the 2020 claim ratio reflects the aforementioned increase in reported delinquencies, a declining proportion of which remain under forbearance as compared to earlier 2020 periods. Prior period favorable development is primarily the result of improving trends in claim severity. 
 
 Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as indicated in the far right column of the following table, the RFIG Run-off claim ratios had experienced a fairly consistent decline in recent annual periods largely due to a combination of declining new loan defaults and stable-to-improving cure rates for outstanding delinquent loans.

 This segment includes the combination of a small life and accident insurance business and the net costs associated with the parent holding company and its internal corporate services subsidiaries. The segment tends to produce highly variable results stemming from volatility inherent to the small scale of the life and accident insurance line, net investment income, and net interest charges (credits) pertaining to external and intra-system financing arrangements.

 Old Republic's invested assets portfolio is directed in consideration of enterprise-wide risk management objectives. Most importantly, these are intended to ensure solid funding of the insurance subsidiaries' long-term obligations to policyholders and other beneficiaries, as well as the long-term stability of the subsidiaries capital accounts. To this end, the investment portfolio contains no significant insurance risk-correlated asset exposures to real estate, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations ("CDO's"), derivatives, hybrid securities, or illiquid private equity and hedge fund investments. Moreover, the Company does not engage in hedging or securities lending transactions, nor does it invest in securities whose values are predicated on non-regulated financial instruments exhibiting amorphous or unfunded counter-party risk attributes. 
 
 As of December 31, 2020, the consolidated investment portfolio reflected an allocation of approximately 74 to fixed-maturity (bonds and notes) and short-term investments, and 26 to equity securities (common stock). The fixed-maturity portfolio continues to be the basic anchor for the insurance underwriting subsidiaries' obligations. The maturities are stratified and conservatively matched to the expected timing of future years' payments of those obligations. The quality of the investment portfolio has remained at high levels. 
 
 For the past several years, a significant portion of ORI's investable funds have been directed toward purchasing high-quality common stocks of U.S. companies (currently limited to fewer than 100 issues). We favor those with long-term records of reasonable earnings growth and steadily increasing dividends. Periodic stress tests of this portfolio are made pursuant to enterprise risk management guidelines and controls. Their purpose is to gain reasonable assurance that periodic downdrafts in market prices would not seriously undermine ORI's financial strength and the long-term continuity and prospects of the business.

DETAILED MANAGEMENT ANALYSIS 
 
 This section of the Management Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations is additive to and should be read in conjunction with the Executive Summary which precedes it. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The Company's annual financial statements incorporate a large number and types of estimates relative to matters which are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made. The estimation process required of an insurance enterprise such as Old Republic is by its very nature highly dynamic inasmuch as it necessitates a continuous evaluation, analysis, and quantification of factual data as it becomes known to the Company. As a result, actual experienced outcomes can differ from the estimates made at any point in time and thus affect future periods' reported revenues, expenses, net income or loss, and financial condition. 
 
 Old Republic believes that its most critical accounting estimates relate to: a) the determination of other-than-temporary impairments ("OTTI") in the value of fixed maturity investments; b) the recoverability of reinsured outstanding losses; and c) the establishment of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses. The major assumptions and methods used in setting these estimates are discussed in the pertinent sections of this Management Analysis and are summarized as follows: 
 
 (a) Other-than-temporary impairments in the value of fixed maturity investments: 
 
 The Company completes a detailed analysis each quarter to assess whether the decline in the value of any fixed maturity investment below its cost basis is deemed other-than-temporary. This assessment is subject to a great deal of judgment and all securities in an unrealized loss position are reviewed. The decline in value of a security deemed OTTI is included as a realized investment loss in the determination of net income and effective January 1, 2020 is established as an allowance for credit loss for financial reporting purposes. 
 
 The Company recognized no OTTI adjustments or allowances for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020. OTTI adjustments of 2.0 and were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
 
 (b) The recoverability of reinsured outstanding losses 
 
 Assets consisting of balance sheet date reserve estimates recoverable from assuming reinsurers in future periods as gross losses are settled and paid, are established at the same time as the gross losses are recorded as reserves. Accordingly, these assets are subject to the same estimation processes and valuations as the related gross amounts as is discussed below. As of the three most recent year ends, outstanding reinsurance recoverable balances ranged between 31.7 and 34.2 and averaged 32.9 of the related gross reserves. See Part I, Item 1(d) for further discussion regarding recoverability of the Company's reinsurance balances. 
 
 (c) The reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
 
 As discussed in pertinent sections of this management analysis, the reserves for losses and related loss adjustment expenses are based on a wide variety of factors and calculations. Among these the Company believes the most critical are: 
 
 The establishment of expected claim ratios for at least the two to five most recent accident years, particularly for so-called long-tail coverages as to which information about covered losses emerges and becomes more accurately quantifiable over long periods of time. Long-tail coverages generally include workers' compensation, commercial automobile (trucking) liability, general liability, errors and omissions and directors and officers' liability, as well as title insurance. Gross loss reserves related to such long-tail coverages ranged between 94.6 and 95.2 , and averaged 95.0 of gross consolidated claim reserves as of the three most recent year ends. Net of reinsurance recoverables, such reserves ranged between 94.4 and 95.0 and averaged 94.7 as of the same dates. 
 
 Loss trends that are considered when establishing the above noted expected claim ratios which take into account such variables as: judgments and estimates relative to premium rate trends and adequacy, current and expected interest rates, current and expected social and economic inflation trends, and insurance industry statistical claim trends. The Company applies these expected claim ratios to earned premiums when estimating the periodic reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses. 
 
 Loss development factors, expected claim rates and average claim costs, all of which are based on Company and/or industry statistics may also be used to project reported and unreported losses for each accounting period. 
 
 Consolidated claim costs developed favorably in the three most recent calendar years. This development had the consequent effect of reducing consolidated annual loss costs for the three most recent years within a range of 1.2 and 3.3 , or by an average of approximately 2.5 per annum. As a percentage of each of these years' consolidated 
 37 

earned premiums and fees, the favorable developments have ranged between .5 and 1.3 , and have averaged 1.0 . The variances in prior years' positive or negative claim developments are further discussed within the Incurred Loss Experience section of this document. 
 
 In all the above regards the Company anticipates that future periods' financial statements will continue to reflect changes in estimates. As in the past such changes generally result from altered circumstances, the continuum of newly emerging information and its effect on past assumptions and judgments, the effects of securities markets valuations, and changes in inflation rates and future economic conditions beyond the Company's control. As a result, Old Republic cannot predict, quantify, or guaranty the likely impact that probable changes in estimates will have on its future financial condition or results of operations. 

COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND OLD REPUBLIC'S BUSINESS 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated governmental responses COVID-19 or the pandemic had a widespread impact on the U.S. economy beginning in the final weeks of March 2020. While that impact continued throughout the year, economic activity increased as activity restrictions intended to reduce or slow the spread of COVID-19 relaxed to a degree. However, recent increases in COVID-19 infection rates illustrate the persistent nature of the pandemic and the likelihood that it will continue to have a significant economic impact in future periods until widespread vaccinations occur. 
 
 Old Republic s continuing response to the pandemic includes many of the significant operational changes instituted earlier this year. A majority of Old Republic's approximately 9,000 associates are working remotely. 
 
 The pandemic's impact on employment levels, businesses and other economic activities contributed to a slight reduction in earned premiums in the General Insurance segment. The Title Insurance segment experienced strong growth in premium and fee revenues. The RFIG Run-off business produced a small underwriting loss due to elevated levels of reported delinquencies. 
 
 Financial market performance experienced significant volatility and reductions in market values in the last several weeks of 2020's first quarter, but continued to improve throughout the remainder of the year. The favorable valuation of the investment portfolio, coupled with positive earnings, outpaced cash dividends to shareholders, resulting in book value per share rising to 20.75 at December 31, 2020 compared to 19.98 at December 31, 2019. 
 
 The economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic could affect future premium and fee revenues in the General Insurance and Title Insurance segments, and conversely underwriting expense ratios could rise. In the RFIG Run-off business, future claims experience could depend upon the continued, mitigating effects of loan forbearance programs mandated by the Federal government, and the rate at which employment levels recover as well as trends in home prices and mortgage interest rates. These outcomes notwithstanding, management firmly believes that the Company s strong financial condition will enable it to weather these challenges, and most importantly allow its insurance subsidiaries to meet their obligations to customers, policyholders and their beneficiaries. 
 
 Old Republic - Consolidated 
 
 Impact on business operations . Old Republic s concern for the health of its associates continues to result in the reduction in activity at many of the Company s offices. Throughout the second half of the year, relaxed governmental restrictions meant that several of Old Republic s business operations were permitting more associates to return to the office. Even so, most of Old Republic s associates continue to work remotely. Old Republic experienced no meaningful interruption in its ability to continue to service the needs of customers. 
 
 Cash and Invested Assets . Old Republic s investment portfolio is managed in consideration of its enterprise-wide risk management objectives. The portfolio emphasis has been on selecting high quality issuers and to ensure the reliable funding of the insurance subsidiaries obligations to policyholders and the long-term stability of the subsidiaries capital accounts. Old Republic does not have any material investments in illiquid alternative or real estate investments. 
 
 Influenced by concerns around COVID-19, U.S. equity markets experienced significant volatility and reductions in market values in the last several weeks of the first quarter. Since then, financial markets have partially rebounded. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the equity portfolio has recognized a 156.2 unrealized loss. Old Republic s fixed maturity securities portfolio experienced an increase in fair value of 342.7 during the year and no other-than-temporary impairments were identified as of December 31, 2020. 
 
 Even with the broad improvement in financial markets, volatility could continue as long as the economy is impacted by COVID-19 and major sectors of the U.S. economy remain under significant pressure. The Company continues to review its fixed maturity investments to monitor the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is especially important in the current environment, where even highly rated issuers are subject to unprecedented stress and certain sectors may be more impacted than others. Old Republic s portfolio includes exposure to the energy sector, and as a result of reduced energy demand arising from COVID-19, many issuers in this sector are experiencing financial and operating stresses. While these investments remain consistent with the Company s investment philosophy, they are subject to regular and on-going review. 
 
 38 

Old Republic has historically performed stress-testing of the investment portfolio, modeling the impact of significant declines in overall market values on the capital and surplus of its insurance subsidiaries. The investment portfolio s performance through the pandemic has been largely in-line with the results of these stress tests, and surplus levels remain strong. Old Republic does not contemplate any changes to its investment strategy as a result of COVID-19 and expects the composition of its investment portfolio to remain consistent with the long-term needs of the business. 
 
 Capital and Liquidity . Old Republic believes that its current liquidity position is sufficient to meet its obligations, including claim payments, operating expenses, interest and scheduled repayments on outstanding indebtedness and expected cash dividend payments. The Company s ability to meet ongoing obligations is supported not only by premium revenue, but also by the expected interest and dividend income associated with Old Republic s fixed maturity and equity investments. While dividends associated with certain equity investments have been reduced or eliminated as a result of the pandemic, the Company s investment income was not materially affected. 
 
 Given Old Republic s current capital and liquidity position, the Company does not currently expect to need to raise additional capital, in the form of either debt or equity, to meet expected future obligations. The Company s nearest debt maturity is 400.0 of senior notes maturing in October 2024. Old Republic believes that it could access debt capital markets in the present environment on reasonable terms, given the Company s current debt to total capitalization ratio of 13.5 and expected levels of operating income. 
 
 Internal Controls . Old Republic maintains a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. While certain updates have been made to reflect a primarily remote work environment, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting have not materially changed. 
 
 General Insurance 
 
 Operating environment and product demand . The primary coverages in the General Insurance segment, as measured on year-to-date 2020 net premiums earned, are commercial auto (38.4 ), workers compensation (25.4 ), inland marine and property (8.7 ), financial indemnity (8.0 and general liability (6.0 ). 
 
 Demand for each of these coverages is related to overall economic conditions and this macroeconomic effect can be compounded (or mitigated) by exposure to sectors that are more (or less) affected by the particular economic environment. For example, premiums associated with workers' compensation coverage typically fall with reductions in payroll. However, the Company s exposure to many of the most significantly affected sectors, such as small business, hospitality, restaurants and travel, is limited, which reduces to a degree Old Republic s COVID-19 exposure. During 2020, the impact of COVID-19 on demand for General Insurance products continued to be relatively modest. However, the full impact of the pandemic will not be known until all policy premiums are audited in connection with the annual policy term expiration. The magnitude of the effect of COVID-19 on demand in future periods will continue to depend on the duration and severity of the pandemic. 
 
 Claims . Claims experience reflects changes in pricing and risk selection together with variability in loss severity and frequency trends. The overall impact of COVID-19 on 2020 claims experience was not significant as increased workers compensation claims were largely offset by reduced frequency and severity of non-COVID related claims. 
 
 Claims activity for certain coverages is correlated with U.S. economic activity, therefore claims frequency and severity for these coverages could both be affected by COVID-19. However, as noted below, Old Republic s risk sharing arrangements should mitigate the negative effects of increases in frequency and severity. 
 
 Reserves . Establishing claims reserves for the General Insurance business is a complex and dynamic process that requires a significant amount of judgment in an ordinary operating environment. That process and the judgment involved are made more complicated by the disruptions caused by COVID-19. Old Republic has not made significant changes to reserves or reserving practices during the year. That approach may change as clarity emerges over time about the actual effects of COVID-19 on the various businesses. The Company may adjust its expected claims rates, loss development factors and average claim costs for certain products if those factors look to be significantly impacted by COVID-19. To the extent any such loss development factor adjustments cause a change to reserves, earnings could be impacted in the period of such change. 
 
 Reinsurance and Retention Limits . Old Republic uses external reinsurance and other risk-sharing arrangements to limit the maximum losses for which it may be liable under its policies. Old Republic has risk-sharing arrangements in place for many of the coverages that have been impacted by COVID-19. In addition, Old Republic s reinsurance arrangements may limit the negative impact of the pandemic for certain other coverages. 
 
 Consistent with its existing practices, Old Republic monitors on an on-going basis the financial condition of its assuming reinsurers and assureds who purchase its retrospectively rated or self-insured deductible policies and obtains sufficient collateral in the form of letters of credit, securities and other financial instruments. Old Republic continuously monitors the sufficiency of this collateral and the credit risk of its counterparties. 
 
 Regulation . Old Republic s insurance company subsidiaries are subject to on-going regulation by state insurance departments. In response to COVID-19, insurance departments have been active in publishing additional guidance and other regulatory actions that impact the business. This regulatory guidance primarily relates to the collection of 
 39 

premium, the cancellation or non-renewal of policies, presumption of coverage and notice periods relating to claims. These regulatory initiatives did not have a significant impact on Old Republic during 2020. 
 
 Title Insurance 
 
 Operating environment and product demand. In 2020, net premium and fees earned in the Title segment reached all-time full year highs. Notwithstanding the severe impact on the U.S. economy caused by COVID-19, the demand for title insurance coverage was strong during the year. 
 
 The demand for title insurance products is correlated with the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets. While COVID-19 and the resulting restrictions on in-person gatherings and reduction in business activity had a negative impact on the broader U.S. economy, the residential real estate markets, and thus the demand for title insurance, remained robust during 2020. The impact continues to be felt however in the commercial real estate markets with COVID-19 uncertainties creating a reduction in business activity. Many of the key indicators used to evaluate the Title business, such as open orders, were at elevated levels at December 31, 2020. However, if COVID-19 continues to have a negative effect on the U.S. economy, it could lead to an eventual reduction in demand for our products and lower operating revenues. 
 
 Regulation . The housing market and the real estate lending industry are heavily regulated and there have been regulatory responses to the pandemic. These regulatory initiatives include those targeted at aiding consumers, which may ultimately have a significant impact on mortgage lenders and investors in pooled mortgage products. This could decrease the availability of mortgage funding, negatively impacting the housing market and thus the demand for Title insurance. While these initiatives have not had a significant effect on the Title business at December 31, 2020, they may have an increasing effect in subsequent quarters. 
 
 Claims . The effects of COVID-19 on the U.S. real estate market did not materially affect claims experience for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 
 RFIG Run-Off Business 
 
 Operating environment and product demand. As noted elsewhere, Old Republic s RFIG run-off business, led by its principal insurance carriers Republic Mortgage Insurance Company ("RMIC") and Republic Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation ("RMGIC"), ceased writing new mortgage guaranty insurance in 2011. The operating results for all periods presented reflect the expected, continuing drop in net earned premiums from declining risk in force. 
 
 Regulation . The North Carolina Department of Insurance ("NCDOI") performs regulatory oversight of RMIC and RMGIC. Based on their capital position as of December 31, 2019 and on updated projections as to future operating results and capital levels, RMIC and RMGIC sought and received approval from the NCDOI to pay extraordinary dividends amounting to 37.5 to ORI, its ultimate parent, during the first quarter of 2020. Neither company has paid dividends subsequent to the first quarter of 2020. 
 
 Capital. As of December 31, 2020, total statutory capital for the group, inclusive of a contingency reserve, totaled 435.2. Old Republic continually monitors its capital position based on financial estimates of operating results over the remaining run-off period. Given the adverse effects of COVID-19 on the U.S. economy, unemployment levels, and housing markets, it could be necessary to retain more capital in the mortgage insurance business than previously thought until the true effects on operations and capital become more apparent. In any event, the payment of future extraordinary dividends will require regulatory approval from the NCDOI. 
 
 Claims . The economic impact of COVID-19 led to an increase in the number of reported delinquencies resulting in higher claim reserves and incurred losses, although such trends stabilized in the latter half of the year. Changes in U.S. employment levels and in the residential real estate markets could affect mortgage insurance claims. Future claim experience will depend on factors such as, among others, the mitigating effects of extensive loan forbearance programs mandated by the Federal government under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, future governmental stimulus initiatives, and the rate at which the overall economy, and in particular employment levels, recover once extensive mandates intended to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19 are revised or lifted. 
 
 FINANCIAL POSITION 
 
 The Company's financial position at December 31, 2020 reflected increases in assets, liabilities and common shareholders' equity of 8.3 , 10.3 and 3.1 , respectively, when compared to the immediately preceding year-end. Cash and invested assets represented 68.1 and 68.9 of consolidated assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of year-end 2020, the cash and invested asset base increased by 6.9 to 15,535.3. 
 
 Investments - During 2020 and 2019, the Company committed the majority of investable funds to short to intermediate-term fixed maturity securities and higher yielding publicly traded large capitalization equity securities. Old Republic continues to adhere to its long-term policy of investing primarily in investment grade, marketable securities. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, nearly all of the Company's investments consisted of marketable securities. The investment portfolio contains no significant insurance risk-correlated asset exposures to real estate, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations ("CDO's"), derivatives, hybrid securities, or illiquid private equity and hedge fund investments. Moreover, the Company does not engage in hedging or securities lending transactions, nor 
 40 

does it invest in securities whose values are predicated on non-regulated financial instruments exhibiting amorphous or unfunded counter-party risk attributes. At December 31, 2020, the Company had no fixed maturity investments in default as to principal and/or interest. 
 
 Short-term maturity investment positions reflect a large variety of seasonal and intermediate-term factors including current operating needs, expected operating cash flows, seasonality of quarterly cash flow, debt maturities, and investment strategy considerations. Accordingly, the future level of short-term investments will vary and respond to the interplay of these factors and may, as a result, increase or decrease from current levels. 
 
 The Company does not own or utilize derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging, enhancing the overall return of its investment portfolio, or reducing the cost of its debt obligations. With regard to its equity portfolio, the Company does not own any options nor does it engage in any type of option writing. Traditional investment management tools and techniques are employed to address the yield and valuation exposures of the invested assets base. The long-term fixed maturity investment portfolio is managed so as to limit various risks inherent in the bond market. Credit risk is addressed through asset diversification and the purchase of investment grade securities. Reinvestment rate risk is reduced by concentrating on non-callable issues, and by taking asset-liability matching considerations into account. Purchases of mortgage and asset backed securities, which have variable principal prepayment options, are generally avoided. Market value risk is limited through the purchase of bonds of intermediate maturity. The combination of these investment management practices is expected to produce a more stable long-term fixed maturity investment portfolio that is not subject to extreme interest rate sensitivity and principal deterioration. 
 
 The fair value of the Company's long-term fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive, however, to fluctuations in the level of interest rates, but not materially affected by changes in anticipated cash flows caused by any prepayments. The impact of interest rate movements on the long-term fixed maturity investment portfolio generally affects net unrealized gains or losses. As a general rule, rising interest rates enhance currently available yields but typically lead to a reduction in the fair value of existing fixed maturity investments. By contrast, a decline in such rates reduces currently available yields but usually serves to increase the fair value of the existing fixed maturity investment portfolio. All such changes in fair value of available for sale securities are reflected, net of deferred income taxes, directly in the shareholders' equity account, and as a separate component of the statement of comprehensive income. Fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost, and therefore, fluctuations in unrealized gains and losses do not impact shareholders' equity. Given the Company's inability to forecast or control the movement of interest rates, Old Republic sets the maturity spectrum of its fixed maturity securities portfolio within parameters of estimated liability payouts, and focuses the overall portfolio on high quality investments. By so doing, Old Republic believes it is reasonably assured of its ability to hold securities to maturity as it may deem necessary in changing environments, and of ultimately recovering their aggregate cost. 
 
 Possible future declines in fair values for Old Republic's available for sale fixed maturity portfolio would negatively affect the common shareholders' equity account at any point in time, but would not necessarily result in the recognition of realized investment losses. The status and fair value changes of each of the fixed maturity investments are reviewed at least once per quarter during the year, and estimates of other-than-temporary impairments in the portfolio's value are evaluated and established at each quarterly balance sheet date. In reviewing investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company, in addition to a security's market price history, considers the totality of such factors as the issuer's operating results, financial condition and liquidity, its ability to access capital markets, credit rating trends, most current audited financial statements, industry and securities markets conditions, and analyst expectations to reach its conclusions. Sudden fair value declines caused by such adverse developments as newly emerged or imminent bankruptcy filings, issuer default on significant obligations, or reports of financial accounting developments that bring into question the validity of the issuer's previously reported earnings or financial condition, are recognized as realized losses as soon as credible publicly available information emerges to confirm such developments. In the event the Company's estimate of other-than-temporary impairments is insufficient at any point in time, future periods' net income (loss) would be affected adversely by the recognition of additional impairment losses, but its financial condition would not necessarily be affected adversely inasmuch as such losses, or a portion of them, could have been recognized previously as unrealized losses in shareholders' equity.

 (g) At December 31, 2020 the number of issues in an unrealized loss position represent 4.1 of the total number of such fixed maturity issues held by the Company. 
 43 

The aging of issues with unrealized losses employs balance sheet date fair value comparisons with an issue's cost. The percentage reduction from such cost reflects the decline as of a specific point in time (December 31, 2020 in the above table) and, accordingly, is not indicative of a security's value having been consistently below its cost at the percentages shown nor throughout the periods shown. 
 Age Distribution of Fixed Maturity Securities December 31: 2020 2019 Maturity Ranges: Due in one year or less 9.8 10.7 Due after one year through five years 57.0 55.6 Due after five years through ten years 31.4 33.4 Due after ten years through fifteen years 1.7 .3 Due after fifteen years .1 Total 100.0 100.0 Average Maturity in Years 4.3 4.1 Duration (h) 3.8 3.7 
 ___________ 
 
 (h) Duration is used as a measure of bond price sensitivity to interest rate changes. A duration of 3.8 as of December 31, 2020 implies that a 100 basis point parallel increase in interest rates from current levels would result in a possible decline in the fair value of the long-term fixed maturity investment portfolio of approximately 3.8 .

 ___________ 
 
 (i) Unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of equity securities are included in total realized and unrealized investment gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of income. 
 
 Other Assets - Among other major assets, substantially all of the Company's receivables are not past due. Reinsurance recoverable balances on paid or estimated unpaid losses are deemed recoverable from solvent reinsurers or have otherwise been reduced by allowances for estimated credit losses. Deferred policy acquisition costs are estimated by taking into account the direct costs relating to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts and evaluating their recoverability on the basis of recent trends in claims costs. The Company's deferred policy acquisition cost balances have not fluctuated substantially from period-to-period, and do not represent significant percentages of assets or shareholders' equity. 
 
 Liquidity - The parent holding company meets its liquidity and capital needs principally through dividends and interest on intercompany financing arrangements paid by its subsidiaries. The insurance subsidiaries' ability to pay 
 44 

cash dividends to the parent company is generally restricted by law or subject to approval of the insurance regulatory authorities. The Company can receive up to 699.3 in dividends from its subsidiaries in 2021 without the prior approval of regulatory authorities. The liquidity achievable through such permitted dividend payments is considered sufficient to cover the parent holding company's currently expected cash outflows represented mostly by interest and scheduled repayments on outstanding debt, reasonably anticipated cash dividend payments to shareholders, modest operating expenses, and the near-term capital needs of its operating subsidiaries. 
 
 Capitalization - Old Republic's total capitalization of 7,153.1 at December 31, 2020 consisted of debt of 966.4 and common shareholders' equity of 6,186.6. Changes in the common shareholders' equity account reflect primarily net income excluding net investment gains (losses), realized and unrealized gains (losses), and dividend payments to shareholders for the year then ended. 
 
 Old Republic has paid a cash dividend without interruption since 1942 (79 years), and it has raised the annual cash dividend payment for each of the past 39 years. The dividend rate is reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis each year. In establishing each year's cash dividend rate the Company does not follow a strict formulaic approach. Rather, it favors a gradual rise in the annual dividend rate that is largely reflective of long-term consolidated operating earnings trends. Accordingly, each year's dividend rate is set judgmentally in consideration of such key factors as the dividend paying capacity of the Company's insurance subsidiaries, the trends in average annual statutory and GAAP earnings for the five to ten most recent calendar years, and management's long-term expectations for the Company's consolidated business and its individual operating subsidiaries. The Company's Board of Directors declared special cash dividends of 1.00 per share in December 2020 (payable on January 15, 2021), September 2019 and December 2017 (paid on January 31, 2018). 
 
 Under state insurance regulations, the Company's three mortgage guaranty insurance subsidiaries are required to hold minimum amounts of capital based on specified formulas. Since the Company's mortgage insurance subsidiaries have discontinued writing new business the risk-to-capital ratio considerations are therefore no longer of consequence. 
 
 Contractual Obligations - The following table shows certain information relating to the required reporting of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020: 
 2021 2022 and 2023 2024 and 2025 2026 and After Total Contractual Obligations: Debt 21.7 400.0 550.0 971.7 Interest on Debt 40.8 81.6 62.1 21.3 205.9 Operating Leases 61.3 97.8 61.2 96.4 316.8 Pension Benefits Contributions (a) 17.8 27.2 26.3 71.3 Claim Claim Expense Reserves (b) 2,813.1 2,468.0 1,430.8 3,959.0 10,671.0 Total 2,937.1 2,665.2 1,981.4 4,653.1 12,236.9 
 __________ 
 
 (a) Represents estimated minimum funding of contributions for the Old Republic International Salaried Employees Retirement Plan. Funding of the plan is dependent on a number of factors including actual performance versus actuarial assumptions made at the time of the actuarial valuation, as well as the maintenance of certain funding levels relative to regulatory requirements. 
 (b) Amounts are reported gross of reinsurance. As discussed herein with respect to the nature of loss reserves and the estimating process utilized in their establishment, the Company's loss reserves do not have a contractual maturity date. Estimated gross loss payments are based primarily on historical claim payment patterns, are subject to change due to a wide variety of factors, do not reflect anticipated recoveries under the terms of reinsurance contracts, and cannot be predicted with certainty. Actual future loss payments may differ materially from the current estimates shown in the table above. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Revenues: Premiums Fees 
 
 Pursuant to GAAP applicable to the insurance industry, revenues are recognized as follows: 
 
 Substantially all general insurance premiums pertain to annual policies and are reflected in income on a pro-rata basis in association with the related benefits, claims and expenses. Earned but unbilled premiums are generally taken into income on the billing date, while adjustments for retrospective premiums, commissions and similar charges or credits are accrued on the basis of periodic evaluations of current underwriting experience and contractual obligations. 
 
 45 

Title premium and fee revenues stemming from the Company's direct operations (which include branch offices of its title insurers and wholly owned agency subsidiaries) represent approximately 25 of 2020 consolidated title business revenues. Such premiums are generally recognized as income at the escrow closing date which approximates the policy effective date. Fee income related to escrow and other closing services is recognized when the related services have been performed and completed. The remaining 75 of consolidated title premium and fee revenues is produced by independent title agents and underwritten title companies. Rather than making estimates that could be subject to significant variance from actual premium and fee production, the Company recognizes revenues from those sources upon receipt. Such receipts can reflect a three to four month lag relative to the effective date of the underlying title policy, and are offset concurrently by production expenses and claim reserve provisions. 
 
 The Company's mortgage guaranty premiums primarily stem from monthly installments paid on long-duration, guaranteed renewable insurance policies. Such premiums are written and earned in the month coverage is effective. With respect to relatively few annual or single premium policies, earned premiums are largely recognized on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies. 
 
 The major sources of Old Republic's consolidated earned premiums and fees for the periods shown were as follows: 
 Earned Premiums and Fees General Title ) RFIG Run-off Other Total ) Change from prior period ) Years Ended December 31: 2018 3,277.1 2,573.1 75.9 14.6 5,940.9 3.0 2019 3,432.4 2,736.0 59.2 13.4 6,241.1 5.1 2020 3,394.2 3,286.3 45.1 12.0 6,737.8 8.0

 ) Reclassification adjustments were made to certain Title segment revenues and expenses in prior periods to conform to the presentation adopted in 2020. See Note 1(c) to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 General insurance net premiums earned were down slightly for 2020. The economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and tightened underwriting standards were mitigated by strong premium rate increases for most insurance products. Declining workers' compensation and general liability premiums were largely offset by rising premiums in commercial auto, financial indemnity and property coverages. With few exceptions, 2019 premiums grew for most types of coverages and markets served. The largest contributions principally stemmed from commercial automobile (trucking), national accounts and executive indemnity coverages. 
 
 Title Group premium and fee revenues grew by 20.1 and 6.3 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. This performance was driven by a robust real estate market supported by a continued low interest rate environment, resulting in an increase in home sales and refinancing activity. 
 
 RFIG Run-off earned premium volume has reflected a continuing decline due to the natural outcome of a run-off book of business devoid of new premium production since 2011. 
 
 The percentage allocation of net premiums earned for major insurance coverages in the General Insurance Group was as follows: 
 General Insurance Earned Premiums by Type of Coverage Commercial Automobile (mostly trucking) Workers' Compensation Financial Indemnity Inland Marine and Property General Liability Other Years Ended December 31: 2018 36.8 31.1 5.3 7.7 6.2 12.9 2019 37.2 29.1 6.4 7.6 6.6 13.1 2020 38.4 25.4 8.0 8.7 6.0 13.5

 The following tables provide information on production and related risk exposure trends for Old Republic's mortgage guaranty insurance operation: 
 Persistency Premium and Persistency Trends by Type: Net Earned Premiums Traditional Primary Bulk Years Ended December 31: 2018 74.4 79.7 76.3 2019 58.8 77.1 84.5 2020 45.1 77.1 84.1 
 
 The Company's flagship mortgage guaranty insurance carrier ceased the underwriting of new policies effective August 31, 2011 and the existing book of business was placed in run-off operating mode. 
 
 While there is no consensus in the marketplace as to the precise definition of "sub-prime", Old Republic generally views loans with credit (FICO) scores less than 620, loans underwritten with reduced levels of documentation and loans with loan to value ratios in excess of 95 as having a higher risk of default. Risk in force concentrations by these attributes are disclosed in the following tables for both traditional primary and bulk production. Premium rates for loans exhibiting greater risk attributes are typically higher in anticipation of potentially greater defaults and claim costs. Additionally, bulk insurance policies, which represent 8.2 of total net risk in force as of year-end 2020, are frequently subject to deductibles and aggregate stop losses which serve to limit the overall risk on a pool of insured loans.

Revenues: Net Investment Income 
 
 Net investment income is affected by trends in interest and dividend yields for the types of securities in which the Company's funds are invested during each reporting period. The following tables reflect the segmented and consolidated invested asset bases as of the indicated dates, and the investment income earned and resulting yields on such assets. Since the Company can exercise little control over fair values, yields are evaluated on the basis of investment income earned in relation to the cost of the underlying invested assets, though yields based on the fair values of such assets are also shown in the statistics below.

 Consolidated net investment income decreased by 2.6 in 2020 and increased 4.4 in 2019. This revenue source is affected by changes in the invested asset base which are mainly driven by consolidated operating cash flows, by a concentration of investable assets in interest-bearing securities, and by changes in market rates of return. The yields for 2020 reflect a lower interest rate environment whereas previous years' reflect an increasingly greater commitment to high quality dividend paying equity securities. 

Revenues: Net Investment Gains (Losses) 
 
 The Company's investment policies are not designed to maximize or emphasize the realization of investment gains. Rather, these policies aim for a stable source of income from interest and dividends, protection of capital, and the providing of sufficient liquidity to meet insurance underwriting and other obligations as they become payable in the future. Dispositions of fixed maturity securities generally arise from scheduled maturities and early calls; in 2020, 2019, and 2018, 76.2 , 54.0 and 76.3 , respectively, of all such dispositions resulted from these occurrences. The realization of investment gains or losses can be highly discretionary and can be affected by such randomly occurring factors as the timing of individual securities sales, the recording of estimated losses from write-downs of impaired securities, tax-planning and tax-rate change considerations, and modifications of investment management judgments regarding the direction of securities markets or the future prospects of individual investees or industry sectors. 
 
 The following table reflects the composition of net investment gains or losses for the periods shown.

Expenses: Benefits and Claims 
 
 The Company records the benefits, claims and related settlement costs that have been incurred during each accounting period. Total claim costs are affected by the amount of paid claims and the adequacy of reserve estimates established for current and prior years' claim occurrences at each balance sheet date. 
 
 The following table shows a breakdown of gross and net of reinsurance claim reserve estimates for major types of insurance coverages as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:

 The Company's reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses represents the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses payable, including incurred but not reported losses and loss adjustment expenses. The establishment of claim reserves by the Company's insurance subsidiaries is a reasonably complex and dynamic process influenced by a large variety of factors as further discussed below. Consequently, reserves established are a reflection of the opinions of a large number of persons, of the application and interpretation of historical precedent and trends, of expectations as to future developments, and of management's judgment in interpreting all such factors. At any point in time, the Company is exposed to the possibility of higher or lower than anticipated claim costs and the resulting changes in estimates are recorded in operations of the periods during which they are made. Increases to prior reserve estimates are often referred to as unfavorable development whereas any changes that decrease previous estimates of the Company's ultimate liability are referred to as favorable development. 

Overview of Loss Reserving Process 
 
 Most of Old Republic's consolidated claim and related expense reserves stem from its general insurance business. At December 31, 2020, such reserves accounted for 93.5 and 90.1 of consolidated gross and net of reinsurance reserves, respectively, while similar reserves at December 31, 2019 represented 93.3 and 90.1 of the respective consolidated amounts. 
 
 The Company's reserve setting process reflects the nature of its insurance business and the operationally decentralized basis upon which it is conducted. Old Republic's general insurance operations encompasses a large variety of coverages or classes of commercial insurance; it has negligible exposure to personal insurance coverages such as homeowners or private passenger automobile insurance that exhibit wide diversification of risks, significant frequency of claim occurrences, and high degrees of statistical credibility. Additionally, the Company's insurance subsidiaries do not provide significant amounts of insurance protection for premises; most of its property insurance exposures relate to cargo, incidental property, and insureds' inland marine assets. Consequently, the wide variety of policies issued and commercial insurance customers served require that loss reserves be analyzed and established in the context of the unique or different attributes of each block or class of business produced by the Company. For example, accident liability claims emanating from insured trucking companies or from general aviation customers become known relatively quickly, whereas claims of a general liability nature arising from the building activities of a construction company may emerge over extended periods of time. Similarly, claims filed pursuant to errors and omissions or directors and officers' liability coverages are usually not prone to immediate evaluation or quantification inasmuch as many such claims may be litigated over several years and their ultimate costs may be affected by the vagaries of judge or jury verdicts. Approximately 91 of the general insurance group's claim reserves stem from liability insurance coverages for commercial customers which typically require more extended periods of investigation and at times protracted litigation before they are finally settled. As a consequence of these and other factors, Old Republic does not utilize a single, overarching loss reserving approach. 
 
 The Company prepares periodic analyses of its loss reserve estimates for its significant insurance coverages. It establishes point estimates for most losses on an insurance coverage line-by-line basis for individual subsidiaries, sub-classes, individual accounts, blocks of business or other unique concentrations of insurance risks such as directors and officers' liability, that have similar attributes. Actuarially or otherwise derived ranges of reserve levels are not utilized as such in setting these reserves. Instead the reported reserves encompass the Company's best point estimates at each reporting date and the overall reserve level at any point in time therefore represents the compilation of a very large number of reported reserve estimates and the results of a variety of formula calculations largely driven by analysis of historical data. Favorable or unfavorable developments of prior year reserves are implicitly covered by the point estimates incorporated in total reserves at each balance sheet date. The Company does not project future variability or make an explicit provision for uncertainty when determining its best estimate of loss reserves. Over the most recent decade actual incurred losses have developed within a reasonable range of their original estimates. 
 51 

Aggregate loss reserves consist of liability estimates for claims that have been reported ("case") to the Company's insurance subsidiaries and reserves for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported ("IBNR") or whose ultimate costs may not become fully apparent until a future time. Additionally, the Company establishes unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves for loss settlement costs that are not directly related to individual claims. Such reserves are based on prior years' cost experience and trends, and are intended to cover the unallocated costs of claim departments' administration of case and IBNR claims over time. Long-term, disability-type workers' compensation reserves are discounted to present value based on interest rates that generally range from 3.0 to 4.0 . The amount of discount reflected in the year-end net reserves totaled 196.9, 209.6 and 216.5 as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Interest accretion of 35.7, 34.5, and 49.0 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, was recognized as unfavorable development of prior year reserves within benefits, claims and settlement expenses in the consolidated statements of income. 
 
 A large variety of statistical analyses and formula calculations are utilized to provide for IBNR claim costs as well as additional costs that can arise from such factors as monetary and social inflation, changes in claims administration processes, changes in reinsurance ceded and recoverability levels, and expected trends in claim costs and related ratios. Typically, such formulas take into account so-called link ratios that represent prior years' patterns of incurred or paid loss trends between succeeding years, or past experience relative to progressions of the number of claims reported over time and ultimate average costs per claim. 
 
 Overall, reserves pertaining to several hundred large individual commercial insurance accounts that exhibit sufficient statistical credibility, and at times may be subject to retrospective premium rating plans or the utilization of varying levels or types of self-insured retentions through captive insurers and similar risk management mechanisms are established on an account by account basis using case reserves and applicable formula-driven methods. Large account reserves are usually set and analyzed for groups of coverages such as workers' compensation, commercial automobile (trucking) and general liability that are typically underwritten jointly for many customers. For certain so-called long-tail categories of insurance such as retained or assumed excess liability or excess workers' compensation, officers and directors' liability, and commercial umbrella liability relative to which claim development patterns are particularly long, more volatile, and immature in their early stages of development, the Company judgmentally establishes the most current accident years' loss reserves on the basis of expected claim ratios. Such expected claim ratios typically reflect currently estimated claim ratios from prior accident years, adjusted for the effect of actual and anticipated rate changes, actual and anticipated changes in coverage, reinsurance, mix of business, and other anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs or the legal and claims environment. Expected claim ratios are generally used for the two to three most recent accident years depending on the individual class or category of business. As actual claims data emerges in succeeding interim and annual periods, the original accident year claim ratio assumptions are validated or otherwise adjusted sequentially through the application of statistical projection techniques such as the Bornhuetter/Ferguson method which utilizes data from the more mature experience of prior years to arrive at a likely indication of more recent years' loss trends and costs. 
 
 Title insurance and related escrow services loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are established as point estimates to cover the projected settlement costs of known as well as IBNR losses related to premium and escrow service revenues of each reporting period. Reserves for known claims are based on an assessment of the facts available to the Company during the settlement process. The point estimates covering all claim reserves take into account IBNR claims based on past experience and evaluations of such variables as changing trends in the types of policies issued, changes in real estate markets and interest rate environments, and changing levels of loan refinancing, all of which can have a bearing on the emergence, number, and ultimate costs of claims. 
 
 RFIG Run-off mortgage guaranty insurance reserves for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses are recognized only upon an instance of default, defined as an insured mortgage loan for which two or more consecutive monthly payments have been missed. Loss reserves are based on statistical calculations that take into account the number of reported insured mortgage loan defaults as of each balance sheet date, as well as experience-based estimates of loan defaults that have occurred but have not as yet been reported. Further, the loss reserve estimating process takes into account a large number of variables including trends in claim severity, potential salvage recoveries, expected cure rates for reported loan delinquencies at various stages of default, the level of coverage rescissions and claims denials due to material misrepresentation in key underwriting information or non-compliance with prescribed underwriting guidelines, and management judgments relative to future employment levels, housing market activity, and mortgage loan interest costs, demand, and extensions. 
 
 The Company has the legal right to rescind mortgage insurance coverage unilaterally as expressly stated in its policy. Moreover, two federal courts that have considered that policy wording have each affirmed that right (See First Tennessee Bank N.A. v. Republic Mortg. Ins. Co. , Case No. 2:10-cv-02513-JPM-cgc (W.D. Tenn., Feb. 25, 2011) and JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. v. Republic Mortg. Ins. Co. , Civil Action No. 10-06141 (SRC) (D. NJ, May 4, 2011), each decision citing supporting state law legal precedent). RMIC's mortgage insurance policy provides that the insured represents that a ll statements made and information provided to it in an application for coverage for a loan, without regard to who made the statements or provided the information, have been made and presented for and on behalf of the insured; and that s uch statements and information are neither false nor misleading in any material respect, nor omit any fact necessary to make such statements and information not false or misleading in any material respect. According to the policy, if any of those representations are materially false or misleading with respect to a loan, the Company has the right to cancel or rescind coverage for that loan retroactively to commencement of the coverage. Whenever the Company determines that an application contains a material misrepresentation, it either advises the insured in writing of its findings prior to rescinding coverage or exercises its unilateral right to rescind coverage for that loan, stating the reasons for that action in writing and returning the applicable premium. The rescission of coverage in instances of materially faulty representations or warranties provided in applications for insurance is a necessary and 
 52 

prevailing practice throughout the insurance industry. In the case of mortgage guaranty insurance, rescissions have occurred regularly over the years but have been generally immaterial. During the period of the great recession, the Company experienced a much greater incidence of rescissions due to increased levels of observed fraud and misrepresentations in insurance applications pertaining to business underwritten between 2004 and the first half of 2008. As a result, the Company has incorporated certain assumptions regarding the expected levels of coverage rescissions and claim denials in its reserving methodology since 2008. Such estimates, which are evaluated at each balance sheet date, take into account observed as well as historical trends in rescission and denial rates. The table below shows the estimated effects of coverage rescissions and claim denials on loss reserves and settled and incurred losses. 
 2020 2019 2018 Estimated reduction in beginning reserve 1.6 3.2 19.0 Total incurred claims and settlement expenses reduced (increased) by changes in estimated rescissions: Current year .4 .6 .9 Prior year (.9) (12.3) Sub-total .3 (.3) (11.4) Estimated rescission reduction in paid claims (.7) (1.3) (4.4) Estimated reduction in ending reserve 1.2 1.6 3.2 
 
 As noted above, the estimated reduction in ending loss reserves reflects, in large measure, a variety of judgments relative to the level of expected coverage rescissions and claim denials on loans that are in default as of each balance sheet date. The provision for insured events of the current year resulted from actual and anticipated rescissions and claim denials attributable to newly reported delinquencies in each respective year. The provision for insured events of prior years resulted from actual rescission and claim denial activity, reinstatement of previously rescinded or denied claims, or revisions in assumptions regarding expected rescission or claim denial rates on outstanding prior year delinquencies. The trends since 2010 reflect a continuing reduction in the level of actual and anticipated rescission and claim denial rates on total outstanding delinquencies. Claims not paid by virtue of rescission or denial represent the Company's estimated contractual risk, before consideration of the impacts of any reinsurance and deductibles or aggregate loss limits, on cases that are settled by the issuance of a rescission or denial notification. Variances between the estimated rescission and actual claim denial rate are reflected in the periods during which they occur. 
 
 Although the insured has no right under the policy to appeal a Company claim decision, the insured may, at any time, contest in writing the Company's findings or action with respect to a loan or a claim. In such cases, the Company considers any additional information supplied by the insured. This consideration may lead to further investigation, retraction or confirmation of the initial determination. If the Company concludes that it will reinstate coverage, it advises the insured in writing that it will do so immediately upon receipt of the premium previously returned. Reserves are not adjusted for potential reversals of rescissions or adverse rulings for loans under dispute since such reversals of claim rescissions and denials have historically been immaterial to the reserve estimation process. 

Incurred Loss Experience 
 
 Management believes that the Company's overall reserving practices have been consistently applied over many years. For at least the past ten years, previously established aggregate reserves have produced reasonable estimates of the cumulative ultimate net costs of claims incurred. However, there are no guarantees that such outcomes will continue, and, accordingly, no representation is made that ultimate net claim and related costs will not develop in future years to be greater or lower than currently established reserve estimates. In management's opinion, however, such potential development is not likely to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, although it could affect materially its consolidated results of operations for any one annual or interim reporting period. See further discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 1A - Risk Factors. 
 
 A summary of changes in aggregate reserves for claims and related costs is included in Note 1(h) of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The percentage of net claims, benefits and related settlement expenses incurred as a percentage of premiums and related fee revenues of the Company's three major operating segments and for consolidated operations were as follows:

 __________ 
 
 ) Reclassification adjustments were made to certain Title segment revenues and expenses in prior periods to conform to the presentation adopted in 2020. See Note 1(c) to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The consolidated claim ratio reflects the changing effects of period-to-period contributions of each segment to consolidated results, and this ratio's variances within each segment. For the three most recent calendar years, the above table indicates that the one-year development of consolidated reserves at the beginning of each year produced favorable developments in 2020, 2019, and 2018 which on average decreased the consolidated claim ratio by 1.0 . 
 
 The percentage of net claims, benefits and related settlement expenses measured against premiums earned by major types of general insurance coverage were as follows: 
 General Insurance Claim Ratios by Type of Coverage All Coverages Commercial Automobile (mostly trucking) Workers' Compen-sation Inland Marine and Property Financial Indemnity General Liability Other Years Ended December 31: 2018 72.2 79.3 70.7 62.8 73.8 68.9 60.1 2019 71.8 84.0 63.2 62.6 64.0 77.8 61.4 2020 69.9 80.8 60.8 58.3 57.1 73.6 67.2 
 
 The general insurance claim ratio trended down in both periods presented and for 2020 was primarily driven by better performance in most coverages, primarily due to prior periods' favorable reserve developments as more fully described in the Executive Summary of the Management Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations. 
 
 Unfavorable asbestosis and environmental ("A E") claim developments, although not material in any of the periods presented, are typically attributable to periodic re-evaluations of such reserves as well as subsequent reclassifications of other coverages' reserves, most often workers' compensation, deemed assignable to A E category of losses. Except for a small portion that emanates from ongoing primary insurance operations, a large majority of the A E claim reserves posted by Old Republic stem mainly from its participations in assumed reinsurance treaties and insurance pools which were discontinued during the 1980's and have since been in run-off status. With respect to the primary portion of gross A E reserves, Old Republic administers the related claims through its claims personnel as well as outside attorneys, and posted reserves reflect its best estimates of ultimate claim costs. Claims administration for the assumed portion of the Company's A E exposures is handled by the claims departments of unrelated primary or ceding reinsurance companies. While the Company performs periodic reviews of certain claim files managed by third parties, the overall A E reserves it establishes respond to the paid claim and case reserve activity reported to the Company as well as available industry statistical data such as so-called survival ratios. Such ratios represent the number of years' average paid losses for the three or five most recent calendar years that are encompassed by an insurer's A E reserve level at any point in time. According to this simplistic appraisal of an insurer's A E loss reserve level, Old Republic's average five year paid loss survival ratios stood at 6.3 years (gross) and 7.1 years (net of reinsurance) as of December 31, 2020 and 6.3 years (gross) and 7.2 years (net of reinsurance) as of December 31, 2019. Fluctuations in this ratio between years can be caused by the inconsistent pay out patterns associated with these types of claims. Incurred net losses for A E claims have averaged .3 of general insurance group net incurred losses for the five years ended December 31, 2020. 
 
 A summary of reserve activity, including estimates for IBNR, relating to A E claims at December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows: 
 54 

December 31: 2020 2019 Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos: Reserves at beginning of year 79.2 58.5 75.4 55.6 Loss and loss expenses incurred 17.7 8.2 14.1 6.3 Claims and claim adjustment expenses paid 12.1 7.5 10.3 3.4 Reserves at end of year 84.7 59.1 79.2 58.5 Environmental: Reserves at beginning of year 47.6 24.8 30.3 18.8 Loss and loss expenses incurred .8 1.7 22.3 8.1 Claims and claim adjustment expenses paid 5.6 3.2 5.0 2.2 Reserves at end of year 42.8 23.2 47.6 24.8 Total asbestos and environmental reserves 127.6 82.4 126.8 83.3 
 
 Title insurance claim ratios have remained in the single digits for a number of years due to a continuation of favorable trends in claims frequency and severity. Favorable developments of reserves established in prior years continued to reduce the claim ratios as more fully described in the Executive Summary of the Management Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations. 
 
 The RFIG Run-off 2020 claim ratio reflects greater reserve provisions necessitated by elevated delinquencies and the evolving economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior period favorable development is primarily the result of improving trends in claim severity as further discussed in the Executive Summary of the Management Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations.

Volatility of Reserve Estimates and Sensitivity 
 
 There is a great deal of uncertainty in the estimates of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, and unanticipated events can have both a favorable or unfavorable impact on such estimates. The Company believes that the factors most responsible, in varying and continually changing degrees, for such favorable or unfavorable development are as follows: 
 
 General insurance net claim reserves can be affected by lower than expected frequencies of claims incurred but not reported, the effect of reserve discounts applicable to workers' compensation claims, higher than expected severity of litigated claims in particular, governmental or judicially imposed retroactive conditions in the settlement of claims such as noted elsewhere in this document in regard to black lung disease claims, greater than anticipated inflation rates applicable to repairs and the medical benefits portion of claims, and higher than expected IBNR due to 
 55 

the slower and highly volatile emergence patterns applicable to certain types of claims such as those stemming from litigated, assumed reinsurance, or the A E types of claims noted above. 
 
 Title insurance loss reserve levels can be impacted adversely by such developments as reduced loan refinancing activity, the effect of which can be to lengthen the period during which title policies remain exposed to loss emergence. Such reserve levels can also be affected by reductions in either property values or the volume of transactions which, by virtue of the speculative nature of some real estate developments, can lead to increased occurrences of fraud, defalcations or mechanics' liens. 
 
 RFIG Run-off net claim reserve levels can be influenced adversely by several factors. These include changes in the mix of insured business toward loans that have a higher probability of default, increases in the average risk per insured loan, the levels of estimated rescission and claim denial activity, the deterioration of regional or national economic conditions leading to a reduction in borrowers' income and thus their ability to make payments on outstanding loans, and reductions in housing values and/or increases in housing supply that can raise the rate at which defaults evolve into claims and affect their overall severity. 
 
 With respect to Old Republic's small life and accident insurance operations, reserve adequacy may be impacted adversely by greater than anticipated medical care cost inflation as well as greater than expected frequency and severity of claims. In life insurance, as in general insurance, concentrations of insured lives coupled with a catastrophic event would represent the Company's largest exposure. 
 
 On a consolidated basis, which includes all coverages provided by the Company, the cumulative development on prior year loss reserves over the past ten years through December 31, 2020 has ranged from 8.5 unfavorable in 2010 to 8.4 favorable in 2015 and averaged 3.1 favorable. Although management does not have a practical business reason for making projections of likely outcomes of future loss developments, its analysis and evaluation of Old Republic's existing business mix, current aggregate loss reserve levels, and loss development patterns suggests a reasonable likelihood that 2020 year-end loss reserves could ultimately develop within a range of +/- 5 . The most significant factors impacting the potential reserve development for each of the Company's insurance segments is discussed above. Old Republic has generally experienced favorable overall loss developments for the latest ten-year period. While General Insurance has experienced unfavorable developments of previously established reserves during four of the last five years, the current analysis of loss development factors and economic conditions influencing the Company's insurance coverages point to a position of reserve adequacy. In management's opinion, the other segments' loss reserve development patterns (most notably those associated with title and mortgage insurance) show greater variability due to changes in economic conditions which cannot be reasonably anticipated. Consequently, management believes that using a 5 potential range of reserve development provides a reasonable benchmark for a sensitivity analysis of the Company's consolidated reserves as of December 31, 2020. 

Reinsurance Programs 
 
 To maintain premium production within its capacity and limit maximum losses and risks for which it might become liable under its policies, Old Republic may cede a portion or all of its premiums and liabilities on certain classes of insurance, individual policies, or blocks of business to other insurers and reinsurers. Further discussion of the Company's reinsurance programs can be found in Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Subsidiaries within the general insurance segment have generally obtained reinsurance coverage from independent insurance or reinsurance companies pursuant to excess of loss agreements. Under excess of loss reinsurance agreements the Company is generally reimbursed for claim costs exceeding contractually agreed-upon levels. During the three year period ended December 31, 2020, the Company's net retentions have risen gradually within the general insurance segment; however, such changes have not had a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Except for relatively few facultative reinsurance cessions covering large risks, the title insurance segment does not utilize a significant amount of reinsurance to manage its insurance risk. 
 
 RFIG Run-off insurance risk was historically reinsured through excess of loss contracts with insurers owned by or affiliated with lending institutions and financial and other intermediaries whose customers are insured by Old Republic's mortgage insurance subsidiaries. Effective December 31, 2008, the Company discontinued excess of loss reinsurance cessions to lenders' captive insurance companies for all new production originated subsequent to the effective date. 
 
 The Company does not anticipate any significant changes in its reinsurance programs during 2021.

 ) Reclassification adjustments were made to certain Title segment revenues and expenses in prior periods to conform to the presentation adopted in 2020. See Note 1(c) to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Variations in the Company's consolidated expense ratios reflect a continually changing mix of coverages sold and attendant costs of producing business in the Company's three largest operating segments. To a significant degree, expense ratios for both the general and title insurance segments are mostly reflective of variable costs, such as commissions or similar charges, that rise or decline along with corresponding changes in premium and fee income. Moreover, general operating expenses can contract or expand in differing proportions due to varying levels of operating efficiencies and expense management opportunities in the face of changing market conditions.

 The combined ratios of the above summarized net claims, benefits and underwriting expenses that reflect the sum total of all the factors enumerated above have been as follows:

Expenses: Income Taxes 
 
 The effective consolidated income tax rates were 18.9 , 20.1 , and 15.4 in 2020 , 2019, and 2018, respectively. The rates for each year reflect primarily the varying proportions of pretax operating income (loss) derived from partially tax sheltered investment income (principally tax-exempt interest and dividend income), the combination of fully taxable investment income, investment gains or losses, underwriting and service income and adjustments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Reference is here made to "Information About Segments of Business" appearing elsewhere herein. 
 
 Historical data pertaining to the operating results, liquidity, and other performance indicators applicable to an insurance enterprise such as Old Republic are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in succeeding years. In addition to the factors cited below, the long-term nature of the insurance business, seasonal and annual patterns in premium production and incidence of claims, changes in yields obtained on invested assets, changes in government policies and free markets affecting inflation rates and general economic conditions, and changes in legal precedents or the application of law affecting the settlement of disputed and other claims can have a bearing on period-to-period comparisons and future operating results. Furthermore, due to the financial market and economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated governmental responses, it is therefore possible that Old Republic's operating results, business and financial condition could be adversely affected in subsequent periods depending on the length and severity of these disruptions. 
 
 Some of the oral or written statements made in the Company's reports, press releases, and conference calls following earnings releases, can constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Of necessity, any such forward-looking statements involve assumptions, uncertainties, and risks that may affect the Company's future performance. With regard to Old Republic's General Insurance segment, its results can be particularly affected by the level of market competition, which is typically a function of available capital and expected returns on such capital among competitors, the levels of investment yields and inflation rates, and periodic changes in claim frequency and severity patterns caused by natural disasters, weather conditions, accidents, illnesses, work-related injuries, and unanticipated external events. Title Insurance and RFIG Run-off results can be affected by similar factors and by changes in national and regional housing demand and values, the availability and cost of mortgage loans, employment trends, and default rates on mortgage loans. Life and accident insurance earnings are exposed to the variability of employment and consumer spending, changes in mortality and health trends, and alterations in policy lapsation rates. At the parent holding company level, operating earnings or losses are generally reflective of the amount of debt outstanding and its cost, interest income on temporary holdings of short-term investments, and period-to-period variations in the costs of administering the Company's widespread operations. 
 
 The General Insurance, Title Insurance and Corporate and Other Segments and the RFIG Run-off business maintain customer information and rely upon technology platforms to conduct their business. As a result, each of them and the Company are exposed to cyber risk. Many of the Company's operating subsidiaries, maintain separate IT systems which are deemed to reduce enterprise-wide risks of potential cybersecurity incidents. However, given the potential magnitude of a significant breach, the Company continually evaluates on an enterprise-wide basis its IT hardware, security infrastructure and business practices to respond to these risks and to detect and remediate in a timely manner significant cybersecurity incidents or business process interruptions. 
 
 A more detailed listing and discussion of the risks and other factors which affect the Company's risk-taking insurance business are included in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors, of this Annual Report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which Item is specifically incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Any forward-looking statements or commentaries speak only as of their dates. Old Republic undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any and all such comments, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, and accordingly they may not be unduly relied upon.

Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 
 in Millions) 

Market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Old Republic's primary market risks consist of interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturities and equity price risk associated with investments in equity securities. The Company has no material foreign exchange or commodity risk. 
 
 The Company does not own or utilize derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging, enhancing the overall return of its investment portfolio, or reducing the cost of its debt obligations. With regard to its equity portfolio, the Company does not own any options nor does it engage in any type of option writing. Traditional investment management tools and techniques are employed to address the yield and valuation exposures of the invested assets base. The long-term fixed maturity investment portfolio is managed so as to limit various risks inherent in the bond market. Credit risk is addressed through asset diversification and the purchase of investment grade securities. Reinvestment rate risk is reduced by concentrating on non-callable issues, and by taking asset-liability matching considerations into account. Purchases of mortgage and asset backed securities, which have variable principal prepayment options, are generally avoided. Market value risk is limited through the purchase of bonds of intermediate maturity. The combination of these investment management practices is expected to produce a more stable long-term fixed maturity investment portfolio that is not subject to extreme interest rate sensitivity and principal deterioration. 
 
 The fair value of the Company's long-term fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive, however, to fluctuations in the level of interest rates, but not materially affected by changes in anticipated cash flows caused by any prepayments. The impact of interest rate movements on the long-term fixed maturity investment portfolio generally affects net unrealized gains or losses. As a general rule, rising interest rates enhance currently available yields but typically lead to a reduction in the fair value of existing fixed maturity investments. By contrast, a decline in such rates reduces currently available yields but usually serves to increase the fair value of the existing fixed maturity investment portfolio. All such changes in fair value of available for sale securities are reflected, net of deferred income taxes, directly in the shareholders' equity account, and as a separate component of the statement of comprehensive income. Given the Company's inability to forecast or control the movement of interest rates, Old Republic sets the maturity spectrum of its fixed maturity securities portfolio within parameters of estimated liability payouts, and focuses the overall portfolio on high quality investments. By so doing, Old Republic believes it is reasonably assured of its ability to hold securities to maturity as it may deem necessary in changing environments, and of ultimately recovering their aggregate cost. 
 
 The following table illustrates the hypothetical effect on the fixed maturity and equity investment portfolios resulting from movements in interest rates and fluctuations in the equity securities markets, using the S P 500 index as a proxy, at December 31, 2020: 
 Estimated Fair Value Hypothetical Change in Interest Rates or S P 500 Estimated Fair Value After Hypothetical Change in Interest Rates or S P 500 Interest Rate Risk: Fixed Maturities 10,496.8 100 basis point rate increase 10,094.8 200 basis point rate increase 9,692.7 100 basis point rate decrease 10,898.8 200 basis point rate decrease 11,300.9 Equity Price Risk: Equity Securities 4,054.8 10 increase in the S P 500 4,464.3 20 increase in the S P 500 4,873.9 10 decline in the S P 500 3,645.3 20 decline in the S P 500 3,235.7

 The following table reflects the Company's gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by category and length of time that individual available for sale and held to maturity fixed maturity securities have been in an unrealized loss position. Fair value and issuer's cost comparisons follow:

 In the above tables the unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities are primarily deemed to reflect changes in the interest rate environment. As part of its assessment of other-than-temporary impairments, the Company considers its intent to continue to hold the securities, and the likelihood that it will not be required to sell investment securities in an unrealized loss position until cost recovery, principally in consideration of its asset and liability maturity matching objectives.

 Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted a new accounting standard which requires the recognition of changes in fair value of equity securities in net income. The effect is shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The cumulative-effect adjustment resulting from the adoption of the new standard was to reclassify from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings; total shareholders' equity remained unchanged. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized pretax unrealized investment gains (losses) of ), and ), respectively, emanating from changes in the fair value of equity securities in the consolidated statements of income.

 As described in Note 1(t), the Company adopted the FASB's accounting guidance on current expected credit losses ("CECL") effective January 1, 2020. The allowance for credit losses for the Company's held to maturity fixed maturity securities was evaluated using a probability-of-default methodology and due to the high credit quality of the portfolio, the resulting allowance established was not material upon adoption. As previously noted, the Company no longer classifies these fixed maturity securities as held to maturity and accordingly the allowance was released. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements - Fair value is defined as the estimated price that is likely to be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants (an exit price) at the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy is established that prioritizes the sources ("inputs") used to measure fair value into three broad levels: Level 1 inputs are based on quoted market prices in active markets; Level 2 observable inputs are based on corroboration with available market data; and Level 3 unobservable inputs are based on uncorroborated market data or a reporting entity's own assumptions. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies and general classification used for financial instruments measured at fair value. 
 
 The Company uses quoted values and other data provided by a nationally recognized independent pricing source as inputs into its quarterly process for determining fair values of fixed maturity and equity securities. To validate the techniques or models used by pricing sources, the Company's review process includes, but is not limited to: (i) initial and ongoing evaluation of methodologies used by outside parties to calculate fair value; and (ii) comparisons with other sources including the fair value estimates based on current market quotations, and with independent fair value estimates provided by the independent investment custodian. The independent pricing source obtains market quotations and actual transaction prices for securities that have quoted prices in active markets and uses their own proprietary method for determining the fair value of securities that are not actively traded. In general, these methods involve the use of "matrix pricing" in which the independent pricing source uses observable market inputs including, but not limited to, investment yields, credit risks and spreads, benchmarking of like securities, broker-dealer quotes, reported trades and sector groupings to determine a reasonable fair value. 
 
 Level 1 securities include U.S. and Canadian Treasury notes, publicly traded common stocks, mutual funds, and short-term investments in highly liquid money market instruments. Level 2 securities generally include corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and certain U.S. and Canadian government agency securities. Securities classified within Level 3 include non-publicly traded bonds and equity securities. There were no significant changes in the fair value of Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 
 
 The following tables show a summary of the fair value of financial assets segregated among the various input levels described above:

of 2020, of 2019 and of 2018 consolidated title business revenues. Such premiums are generally recognized as income at the escrow closing date which approximates the policy effective date. Fee income related to escrow and other closing services is recognized when the related services have been performed and completed. The remaining title premium and fee revenues are produced by independent title agents and underwritten title companies. Rather than making estimates that could be subject to significant variance from actual premium and fee production, the Company recognizes revenues from those sources upon receipt. Such receipts can reflect a three to four month lag relative to the effective date of the underlying title policy, and are offset concurrently by production expenses and claim reserve provisions. 
 
 The Company's mortgage guaranty premiums primarily stem from monthly installments paid on long-duration, guaranteed renewable insurance policies. Such premiums are written and earned in the month coverage is effective. With respect to relatively few annual or single premium policies, earned premiums are largely recognized on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies. Recognition of normal or catastrophic claim costs, however, occurs only upon an instance of default, defined as the occurrence of two or more consecutively missed monthly payments. Accordingly, GAAP revenue recognition for insured loans is not appropriately matched to the risk exposure and the consequent recognition of both normal and most significantly, future catastrophic loss occurrences for which current reserve provisions are not permitted. As a result, mortgage guaranty GAAP earnings for any individual year or series of years may be materially adversely affected, particularly by cyclical catastrophic loss events such as the mortgage insurance industry experienced between 2007 and 2012. Reported GAAP earnings and financial condition form, in part, the basis for significant judgments and strategic evaluations made by management, analysts, investors, and other users of the financial statements issued by mortgage guaranty companies. The risk exists that such judgments and evaluations are at least partially based on GAAP financial information that does not match revenues and expenses and is therefore not reflective of the long-term normal and catastrophic risk exposures assumed by mortgage guaranty insurers at any point in time. 
 
 The Company recognized total contract revenue from customers of , and during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Of these amounts, approximately ), and were generated from claims handling and related ancillary services (i.e. risk control services) provided to customers within the Company s General Insurance segment.

Interest accretion of , and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, was recognized as unfavorable development of prior year reserves within benefits, claims and settlement expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Losses and claims incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), as well as expenses required to settle losses and claims are established on the basis of a large number of formulas that take into account various criteria, including historical cost experience and anticipated costs of servicing reinsured and other risks. As applicable, estimates of possible recoveries from salvage or subrogation opportunities are considered in the establishment of such reserves. Overall claim and claim expense reserves incorporate amounts covering net estimates of unusual claims such as those emanating from asbestosis and environmental ("A E") exposures as discussed below. Such reserves can affect claim costs and related claim ratios for such insurance coverages as general liability, commercial automobile (truck), workers' compensation, and property. 
 
 Early in 2001, the Federal Department of Labor revised the Federal Black Lung Program regulations. The revisions basically require a reevaluation of previously settled, denied, or new occupational disease claims in the context of newly devised, more lenient standards when such claims are resubmitted. Following a number of challenges and appeals by the insurance and coal mining industries, the revised regulations were, for the most part, upheld in June, 2002 and are to be applied prospectively. Since the final quarter of 2001 black lung claims filed or refiled pursuant to these revised regulations have increased, though the volume of new claim reports has abated in recent years. 
 
 In March 2010, federal regulations were revised once again as part of the Patient Protection and Affordability Act that reinstates two provisions that can potentially benefit claimants. In response to this most recent legislation and the above noted 2001 change, black lung claims filed or refiled have risen once increased. The vast majority of claims filed to date against Old Republic pertain to business underwritten through loss sensitive programs that permit the charge of additional or refund of return premiums to wholly or partially offset changes in estimated claim costs, or to business underwritten as a service carrier on behalf of various industry-wide involuntary market (i.e. assigned risk) pools. A much smaller portion pertains to business produced on a traditional risk transfer basis. The Company has established applicable reserves for claims as they have been reported and for claims not as yet reported on the basis of its historical experience as well as assumptions relative to the effect of the revised regulations. 
 
 Old Republic's reserve estimates also include provisions for indemnity and settlement costs for various asbestosis and environmental impairment ("A E") claims that have been filed in the normal course of business against a number of its insurance subsidiaries. Many such claims relate to policies incepting prior to 1985, including many issued during 
 73 

and and rarely exceeding . Such policies have, in turn, been subject to reinsurance cessions which have typically reduced the subsidiaries' net retentions to or less as to each claim. Old Republic's exposure to A E claims cannot, however, be calculated by conventional insurance reserving methods for a variety of reasons, including: a) the absence of statistically valid data inasmuch as such claims generally involve long reporting delays and very often uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds against whom such claims have arisen or will arise; and b) the litigation history of such or similar claims for insurance industry members which has produced inconsistent court decisions with regard to such questions as when an alleged loss occurred, which policies provide coverage, how a loss is to be allocated among potentially responsible insureds and/or their insurance carriers, how policy coverage exclusions are to be interpreted, what types of environmental impairment or toxic tort claims are covered, when the insurer's duty to defend is triggered, how policy limits are to be calculated, and whether clean-up costs constitute property damage. Over time, the Executive Branch and/or the Congress of the United States have proposed or considered changes in the legislation and rules affecting the determination of liability for environmental and asbestosis claims. As of December 31, 2020, however, there is no solid evidence to suggest that possible future changes might mitigate or reduce some or all of these claim exposures. Because of the above issues and uncertainties, estimation of reserves for losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses for A E claims in particular is much more difficult or impossible to quantify with a high degree of precision. Accordingly, no representation can be made that the Company's reserves for such claims and related costs will not prove to be overstated or understated in the future. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Old Republic's aggregate indemnity and loss adjustment expense reserves specifically identified with A E exposures amounted to and gross, respectively, and and net of reinsurance, respectively. Old Republic's average five year paid loss survival ratios stood at years (gross) and years (net of reinsurance) as of December 31, 2020 and years (gross) and years (net of reinsurance) as of December 31, 2019. Fluctuations in this ratio between years can be caused by the inconsistent pay out patterns associated with these types of claims.

Total incurred claims and settlement expenses reduced (increased) by changes in estimated rescissions: 
 Current year Prior year ) ) Sub-total ) ) Estimated rescission reduction in paid claims ) ) ) Estimated reduction in ending reserve 
 
 As above-noted, the estimated reduction in ending loss reserves reflects, in large measure, a variety of judgments relative to the level of expected coverage rescissions and claim denials on loans that are in default as of each balance sheet date. The provision for insured events of the current year resulted from actual and anticipated rescissions and claim denials attributable to newly reported delinquencies in each respective year. The provision for insured events of prior years resulted from actual rescission and claim denial activity, reinstatement of previously rescinded or denied claims, or revisions in assumptions regarding expected rescission or claim denial rates on outstanding prior year delinquencies. The trends since 2010 reflect a continuing reduction in the level of actual and anticipated rescission and claim denial rates on total outstanding delinquencies. Claims not paid by virtue of rescission or denial represent the Company's estimated contractual risk, before consideration of the impacts of any reinsurance and deductibles or aggregate loss limits, on cases that are settled by the issuance of a rescission or denial notification. Variances between the estimated rescission and actual claim denial rate are reflected in the periods during which they occur. 
 
 Although the insured has no right under the policy to appeal a Company claim decision, the insured may, at any time, contest in writing the Company's findings or action with respect to a loan or a claim. In such cases, the Company considers any additional information supplied by the insured. This consideration may lead to further investigation, retraction or confirmation of the initial determination. If the Company concludes that it will reinstate coverage, it advises the insured in writing that it will do so immediately upon receipt of the premium previously returned. Reserves are not adjusted for potential reversals of rescissions or adverse rulings for loans under dispute since such reversals of claim rescissions and denials have historically been immaterial to the reserve estimation process.

, , and for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with average favorable annual developments of . The Company believes that the factors most responsible, in varying and continually changing degrees, for favorable or unfavorable reserve developments include, as to many general insurance coverages, the effect of reserve discounts applicable to workers' compensation claims, changes in severity of litigated claims in particular, governmental or judicially imposed retroactive conditions in the settlement of claims such as noted above in regard to black lung disease claims, changes in inflation rates applicable to repairs and the medical portion of claims in particular, and changes in claims incurred but not reported due to the slower and highly volatile emergence patterns applicable to certain types of claims such as those stemming from litigated, assumed reinsurance, or the A E types of claims noted above. Title claim costs were lower in the face of declining claims activity since the Great Recession years. As to mortgage guaranty and the CCI coverage, changes in favorable or unfavorable reserve development result from differences in originally estimated salvage and subrogation recoveries, sales and prices of homes that can impact claim costs upon the disposition of foreclosed properties, changes in regional or local economic conditions and employment levels, the number of coverage rescissions and claims denials due to material misrepresentation in key underwriting information or non-compliance with prescribed underwriting guidelines, the extent of loan refinancing activity that can reduce the period of time over which a policy remains at risk, and lower than expected frequencies of claims incurred but not reported.

 At December 31, 2020, the Company had available net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards of which will expire in years 2023 through 2029, and a alternative minimum tax ("AMT") credit carryforward. The NOL carryforward is subject to the limitations set by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and is available to reduce future years' taxable income by a maximum of each year until expiration. 
 
 In valuing the deferred tax assets, the Company considered certain factors including primarily the scheduled reversals of certain deferred tax liabilities, estimates of future taxable income, the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods, as well as the availability of certain tax planning strategies. The Company estimates that all gross deferred tax assets at year-end 2020 will more likely than not be fully realized. 
 
 Insurance regulations require mortgage guaranty insurance companies to establish a statutory contingency reserve designed to protect policyholders against extraordinary volumes of claims. Pursuant to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code a mortgage guaranty insurance company may, at its discretion, take a current deduction for amounts added to the statutory contingency reserve in an amount not to exceed taxable income in any given tax year or, cumulatively, the total amount of contingency reserves carried under the aforementioned insurance regulations. The deduction is allowed only to the extent that U.S. government non-interest bearing tax and loss bonds are purchased and held in an amount equal to the tax benefit attributable to such deduction. For Federal income tax purposes, amounts deducted from the contingency reserve are taken into gross statutory taxable income in the period in which they are released. During 2019, the Company released from the tax basis contingency reserve account and redeemed all outstanding U.S. Treasury Tax and Loss Bonds. 
 
 Tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by the Company are recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. To the best of management's knowledge there are no tax uncertainties that are expected to result in significant increases or decreases to unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve month period. The Company views its income tax exposures as primarily consisting of timing differences whereby the ultimate deductibility of a taxable amount is highly certain but the timing of its deductibility is uncertain. Such differences relate principally to the timing of deductions for loss and premium reserves. As in prior examinations, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could assert that claim

 The assumed settlement discount rates were determined by matching the current estimate of the Plan's projected cash outflows against spot rate yields on a portfolio of high quality bonds as of the measurement date. To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, historical returns and the future return expectations for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio were considered.

jurisdictions, including RMIC's and its sister company, Republic Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation ("RMGIC s") domiciliary state of North Carolina, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to risk in force (or a similar measure) in order to continue to write new business. The formulations currently allow for a maximum risk-to-capital ratio of to 1, or alternatively stated, a minimum policyholder position MPP of one-twenty-fifth of the total risk in force. The failure to maintain the prescribed minimum capital level in a particular state generally requires a mortgage insurer to immediately stop writing new business until it reestablishes the required level of capital or receives a waiver of the requirement from a state's insurance regulatory authority. RMIC breached the minimum capital requirement during the third quarter of 2010. RMIC and its sister company RMGIC were placed under administrative supervision by the North Carolina Department of Insurance ("NCDOI") in 2012 and ultimately ordered to defer the payment of of all settled claims as a deferred payment obligation ("DPO").

for workers' compensation; for commercial automobile (trucking) liability; for general liability; for executive protection (directors officers and errors omissions); for aviation; and for property coverages. Title insurance risk assumptions are generally limited to a maximum of as to any one policy. The vast majority of title policies issued, however, carry exposures of less than . The average direct primary mortgage guaranty exposure is (in whole dollars) per insured loan. 
 
 Since January 1, 2005, the Company has had maximum treaty reinsurance coverage of up to for its workers' compensation exposures. Pursuant to regulatory requirements, however, all workers' compensation primary insurers such as the Company remain liable for unlimited amounts in excess of reinsured limits. Other than the substantial concentration of workers' compensation losses caused by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on America, to the best of the Company's knowledge there had not been a similar accumulation of claims in a single location from a single occurrence prior to that event. Nevertheless, the possibility continues to exist that non-reinsured losses could, depending on a wide range of severity and frequency assumptions, aggregate several hundred million dollars to an insurer such as the Company. Such aggregation of losses could occur in the event of a catastrophe such as an earthquake that could lead to the death or injury of a large number of persons concentrated in a single facility such as a high rise building. 
 
 As a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on America, the reinsurance industry eliminated coverage from substantially all contracts for claims arising from acts of terrorism. Primary insurers like the Company thus became fully exposed to such claims. Late in 2002, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the "TRIA") was signed into law, immediately establishing a temporary federal reinsurance program administered by the Secretary of the Treasury. The program applied to insured commercial property and casualty losses resulting from an act of terrorism, as defined in the TRIA. Congress extended and modified the program in late 2005 through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2005 (the "TRIREA"). TRIREA expired on December 31, 2007. Congress enacted a revised program in December 2007 through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (the "TRIPRA") of 2007. The TRIPRA has been extended on several occasions, most recently on December 20, 2019 for seven years. 
 
 The TRIA automatically voided all policy exclusions which were in effect for terrorism related losses and obligated insurers to offer terrorism coverage with most commercial property and casualty insurance lines. The TRIREA revised the definition of "property and casualty insurance" to exclude commercial automobile, burglary and theft, surety, professional liability and farm owners multi-peril insurance. TRIPRA did not make any further changes to the definition of property and casualty insurance, however, it did include domestic acts of terrorism within the scope of the program. Although insurers are permitted to charge an additional premium for terrorism coverage, insureds may reject the coverage. Under TRIPRA, the program's protection is not triggered for losses arising from an act of terrorism until the industry first suffers losses in excess of a prescribed aggregate deductible during any one year. The program deductible trigger was 200 for 2020. Once the program trigger is met, the program will be responsible for a fixed percentage of the Company's terrorism losses that exceed its deductible which ranges from 85 in 2015 and declines by one percentage point per year until it reached 80 in 2020. The Company's deductible amounts to 20 of direct earned premium on eligible property and casualty insurance coverages. The Company currently reinsures limits on a treaty basis of in excess of for claims arising from certain acts of terrorism for casualty clash and catastrophe workers' compensation liability insurance coverages. The Company also purchases facultative reinsurance on certain accounts in excess of to manage the Company's net exposure. 
 
 Reinsurance ceded by the Company's insurance subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business is typically placed on an excess of loss basis. Under excess of loss reinsurance agreements, the companies are generally reimbursed for losses exceeding contractually agreed upon levels. Quota share reinsurance is most often effected between the Company's insurance subsidiaries and industry-wide assigned risk plans or captive insurers owned by assureds. Under quota share reinsurance, the Company remits to the assuming entity an agreed-upon percentage of premiums written and is reimbursed for underwriting expenses and proportionately related claims costs.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 
 Old Republic International Corporation: 
 
 Opinions on the consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Old Republic International Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, preferred stock and common shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedules I to VI (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
 Change in Accounting Principle 
 
 As discussed in Note 1(d) to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for equity securities measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through income as of January 1, 2018 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, Financial Instruments . 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
 96 

inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgment. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Estimation of liability for losses, claims, and settlement expenses 
 
 As discussed in Note 1(h) to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates the liability for losses, claims, and settlement expenses using a number of considerations to determine its best estimate of the cost of settling claims reported and claims incurred but not reported. The Company estimates the liability by applying expected claim ratios by line of business to the related earned premium revenue. The Company s liability for losses, claims, and settlement expenses (reserves) at December 31, 2020 was 10,671.0 million. 
 
 We identified the estimation of the liability for losses, claims, and settlement expenses as a critical audit matter. The assessment of the estimates of the reserves involved a high degree of judgment due to the inherent uncertainty in determining certain assumptions, including expected claim ratios. The expected claim ratios used in the estimate may be affected by various internal and external considerations, including loss trends, premium rate trends and adequacy, interest rates, and social and economic trends. Specialized skills and knowledge were required to assess the Company s estimate of the reserves. 
 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company s process for estimating the liability for losses, claims, and settlement expense. This included controls related to the development of the expected claim ratios as well as comparison of the recorded reserves based on expected claim ratios to the Company s actuarially derived reserves. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: 
 
 Assessing the Company s reserving methodologies by comparing to methods consistent with actuarial standards of practice 
 Evaluating the Company s estimates by developing independent analyses for certain reserve groups using the Company s underlying historical claims data 
 Assessing the Company s internally prepared actuarial analyses for other reserve groups by inspecting the assumptions and actuarial methods utilized in comparison to internal experience and related industry trends 
 Developing an independent consolidated range of reserves based on actuarial methodologies and comparing to the Company s recorded reserves 
 Assessing year-over-year movements of the Company s recorded reserves within the independently developed actuarial range.

Item 9A - Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company's principal executive officer and its principal accounting officer have evaluated the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal accounting officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective for the above referenced evaluation period. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 
 During the three month period ended December 31, 2020, there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
 The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. Their report is shown on page 96 in this Annual Report.
