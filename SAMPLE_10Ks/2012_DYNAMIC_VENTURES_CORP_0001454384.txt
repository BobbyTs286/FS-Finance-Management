ITEM 1. 

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 

Corporate History 

We were incorporated in Delaware on December 22, 2008. We initially intended to engage in the manufacturing and distribution of a toothbrush with longitudinal to lateral motion conversion, and in September 2009, entered into an exclusive worldwide patent sale agreement (the "Patent Agreement") with Appelfeld Zer Fisher law firm AZF ), in relation to a patent (Patent Number: 6,918,154) for a specialized toothbrush with longitudinal and lateral motion conversions. 

On August 2, 2010, the Company and its controlling shareholders entered into a share exchange agreement (the "Share Exchange Agreement") with Bundled Builder Solutions Inc. BBSI and its shareholders whereby the Company obtained all of the issued and outstanding shares of BBSI, in exchange for the issuance of 22,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company (originally 4,500,000 shares adjusted for a 5:1 stock split). The transaction resulted in BBSI becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the share exchange, the Company now carries on the business of BBSI as its primary business. Unless otherwise indicated, the following information relates
specifically to the business and operations of BBSI. 

BBSI was incorporated on August 29, 2008 under the laws of the state of Delaware. BBSI provides construction services through the combination of trade contractors and management integrated into one consolidated organization. On March 31, 2010, BBSI acquired Floor Art, LLC Floor Art") and Builder Design Center, LLC BDC in an asset purchase transaction. These companies have common ownership. Floor Art has been an ongoing company for sixteen years and its primary business is focused on the interior finishes of a building such as installation of flooring and countertops. BDC develops software for use by builders and designers and has been
in business for over five years. 

Description of Our Business 

Through our subsidiaries we provide construction and related services in North America. Our revenue has been derived from the following five different services we offer: (i) general contracting and management solutions for residential and commercial land owners; (ii) sales and installation of engineered building systems (structured insulated panels SIPs )) for commercial projects; (iii) installation of finishes, such as finishes for houses and commercial buildings, which include flooring, tile, counter tops, and bath surroundings; (iv) construction management and general contracting services to Native American communities in the Southwestern United States; and (v) supply of software for use by
builders and designers. For the year ended December 31, 2011, a substantial portion of our revenue (approximately 90.9 was derived from our general contracting services for residential and commercial landowners, approximately 4.5 of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 was derivedfrom our sales and installation of engineered building systems; approximately four percent (4.2 of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 was derived from our installation of flooring and we obtained less than 1 of our revenue from our Native American housing and less than 1 of our revenue from software services. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we derived a substantial portion of our revenue (approximately 73 from our installation of flooring, approximately 26 of our revenue from our Native American housing and a nominal amount of revenue from our software services. In
2011, we formed a joint venture with an independent third party for the purpose of holding, maintaining, developing, rehabilitating and selling residential real estate. To date, we have not derived any revenue from the joint venture.

General Contracting and Management Solutions 

A large portion of our general contracting revenue was derived from our agreement with Annabelle Homes LLC Annabelle ). On May 28, 2011, BBSI entered into an Agreement with Annabelle (the Annabelle Agreement ), pursuant to which BBSI has commenced providing services as a contractor for the construction of twenty-eight (28) single family homes, six buildings containing townhomes, a commercial office building, a commercial convenience store and residential and commercial land development, collectively known as the Stanley North Dakota project, in exchange for the cost of the work necessarily incurred plus a contractor s fee. BBSI has also commenced work on six buildings
containing townhomes and land development for Annabelle Tioga, LLC on the project collectively know as Tioga. The Annabelle Agreement further provides that BBSI will be the contractor of choice by Annabelle for additional work including projects known as the Kenmare Project, Stanley Pasture Project, and Columbus Project. 

BBSI also provides construction management for companies that wish to outsource activities previously performed by full time construction departments. This applies to building companies who have reduced their staff and developers who need projects built out. BBSI also partners with general contractors to provide complete build outs for commercial buildings 

Engineered Building Systems 

Our second largest revenue generating source for the year ended December 31, 2011 was BBSI s sales and installation of engineered building systems for the construction of green light commercial buildings using SIPs. The 2011 revenues attributed to these services were derived from services provided to a pre-school, Children s Learning Adventure in Pearland, Texas. Prior to this project we had a boutique hotel project in Bossier, Louisiana, in the planning stage; however, this project was abandoned during the third quarter of 2011. We also use SIPS in the North Dakota project on the residential as well as the commercial buildings. Light commercial buildings by
definition are buildings that have five stories or less. We offer this product throughout the United States only through BBSI. SIPs are high performance building panels used in floors, walls and roofs that are extremely strong, energy efficient and cost effective. Based on our experience, the primary marketing advantage of SIPs is its reduction in construction time combined with green energy efficient materials at comparable costs of conventional building. SIPs are eco-friendly, recyclable building products that offer high energy efficiency and less waste. The Leadership in Energy Environmental Design LEED system is an internationally recognized green building certification system that provides a set of standards for the environmentally sustainable design, construction and operation of buildings and
neighborhoods. All of our future SIPs system projects will be designed for certification under the LEED system. As part of our services, we work with the engineer, architect and customer to design the most appropriate building shell based on the customer s needs. Then, we order the panels from the manufacturer, work with the supplier on receiving the panels, deliver the panels to the construction site and oversee installation of the SIPs by the general contractor. 

Bundled Building 

Bundled building means combining several construction trade activities into one group based on interrelated functions and installation sequences. Our Floor Art subsidiary provides construction management services for a bundle of related trade activities for both residential and commercial buildings and is currently our only trade bundle in operation. Floor Art provides finishes for houses and commercial buildings including flooring, tile, counter tops, and bath surroundings. We believe that by using our business model which bundles various related trade activities together, management can eliminate scheduling delays and personnel inefficiencies caused by segregation of building
activities. Since all trades are working for the same company, we believe that communications are improved, and cross-training of personnel increases efficiencies among trade activities and reduces overall construction time. Our bundle can operate in both residential and commercial construction and is capable of doing remodels or new builds. We believe that this flexibility reduces market risk caused by different activity levels of different construction sectors. 

Native American Housing 

Our subsidiary, BBSI, also provides construction management services to Native American communities in the Southwestern United States. Prior to November of 2011, we provided these services through a contract with a Native American owned company, Tribal Building Solutions, LLC TBS ), which began in September, 2009. There is no common ownership between the Company and TBS. TBS procured construction contracts with the tribes. BBSI provided project management services including design, construction, land development and training of local labor. BBSI now works directly with the tribes to bid for new projects. 

Page - 5 

Currently, we provide construction management services primarily for residential homes within these Native American communities. Operating results from the Native American product did not begin until August of 2010 when we commenced the construction of six homes on the Jicarilla Nation in New Mexico and was completed in January 2011. This project was completed under budget and under schedule in the harsh winter months in northern New Mexico. 

Further, BBSI s construction management services help conserve energy in these Native American homes which are located in inclement winter weather areas. The Native American homes are built with metal roofs and insulated with icynene which is a high-powered renewable-based material made from castor oil which insulates the home, prevents snow buildup and increases the energy efficiency of the house. 

We believe that our experience on the Jicarilla project gives us entry into the Native American housing market which is a significant housing market that has always been underserved. There are dozens of tribes in the Southwest in need of 25 to 75 houses per year. Traditional building by local labor, in our experience, is too slow and involves too many quality control issues; attempts to have non-Native American builders construct houses has been inconsistent due to communication problems. 

Additionally, we believe that this market has the following distinct advantages over traditional housing markets: 

Tribes are the only clients for each community which eliminates usual buyer risks like mortgage qualifications, cancellations, and specifications. 

Little or no cash is required as building funds are pre-committed by tribes. 

Pent up demand for housing is strong. 

Software for Builders and Designers 

BDC provides software solutions for builders and designers. This product is less than 1 of the Company s revenue and is not expected to increase in the near future. 

Strategic Synergies 

Our experience has shown that the combination of bundled trades with SIPs increases business in both commercial and residential contracting through several synergies: 

BBSI becomes the general contractor on build out projects using the SIPs system which allows us to keep margins currently paid to outside contractors. 

BBSI trade contractors can work on commercial and residential projects which we expect, based on past experience, to add additional profit that was previously paid to outside trade contractors. 

BBSI can use the SIPs system on housing projects. We feel that the SIPs system will allow housing projects to be built in more remote areas which will serve the North Dakota and the Native American markets. Many communities are located in remote areas without ready access to contractors. By delivering ready-to-install manufactured SIPs panels to the construction site, more of the finished home can be delivered to the site, the home can be built faster and in less time, and there is less need for trades to be onsite to construct the building. Many construction trades would have to pay for out of town costs to build in these areas, however, under our system all trades are working
for the same company which reduces the overall costs and makes the building costs more feasible. 

We believe that using one central corporate support team allows the BBSI and SIPs marketing teams to focus attention on sales and results in significantly higher sales prospects.

Industry and Market Data 

We believe that the green home builders industry will experience growth in the future. This is based in part upon a green home building study recently produced by McGraw-Hill Construction, a part of The McGraw-Hill Companies, in conjunction with the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). According to such study, green homes comprised 17 of the overall residential construction market in 2011 and are expected to grow to between 29 and 38 of the market by 2016. By value, this equates to a five-fold increase, growing from 17 billion in 2011 to 87- 114 billion in 2016, based on the five-year forecast for overall residential construction. 

According to McGraw-Hill Construction, the study found that construction industry professionals reported an even steeper increase in green home remodeling; 34 of remodelers expect to be doing mostly green work by 2016, a 150 increase over 2011 activity levels, and that many home builders have shifted to the remodeling market due to the drastic drop in new home construction. In fact, according to McGraw-Hill Construction, 62 of the builders who do both new and remodeling work verified that the economy has increased their renovation work. 

The study reveals business benefits afforded by green building, such as a competitive marketing advantage: 46 of builders and remodelers find that "building green" makes it easier to market themselves in a down economy, and an overwhelming 71 of firms that are dedicated to green home building report the same. 

Many factors are driving the green homes market, with "higher quality" and "increases in energy costs" topping the list, indicating that today s green homebuyer is not just a green consumer. The reported costs of building a green home have also gone down significantly. Builders report that the cost to go green is now 7 , as compared to 10 in 2008 and 11 in 2006. 

According to the study, three U.S. regions are seeing higher than average growth: The West Coast has seen the highest green growth; the Midwest s northern region, west of the Mississippi, is second highest; and New England ranks third. 

According to McGraw-Hill Construction s Dodge 2012 Construction Outlook, a detailed forecast of the industry's economic environment and market trends, 

(i) single family housing in 2012 will improve 10 in dollars, corresponding to a 7 increase in the number of units to 435,000 (this is still a low amount, as the excess supply of homes due to foreclosures continues to depress the market); 

(ii) multifamily housing will rise 18 in dollars and 17 in units, continuing its moderate, upward trend; and 

(iii)commercial building will grow 8 . McGraw-Hill Construction also predicts that warehouses and hotels will see the largest percentage increases, but improvement for offices and stores will be modest.

The foregoing information regarding industry and market data is current as of the date indicated and is widely available to the public. The Company is not funded or affiliated with any of the sources cited herein. 

Employees 

BBSI has twelve full time employees. 

Corporate Offices 

The Company s corporate offices are located at 8776 East Shea Blvd., Suite B3A-615, Scottsdale, Arizona. 

Competition 

The competition in the construction management services industry is very high. We are one of thousands of companies competing in this industry across the United States. The Company is based in Scottsdale, Arizona, where competition is also very high. We are in direct competition with other construction management companies as all of BBSI s projects are obtained through a proposal and bid process. We believe that our success depends in large part upon our ability to bring a broader solution to the construction management process. Our business is different from our competitors because we work with our customers from the beginning stages of designing the
project and assisting our customers with obtaining financing through the later stages of engineering the project, developing the construction site and overseeing the building construction. Our new approach to construction management offers a more complete solution to meet our customers needs and makes us more than just a construction company. Further, we strive to provide our services in the most cost efficient and energy saving ways. 

Raw Materials and Suppliers 

The Company obtains all of its raw materials through sub-contractors who contract with various manufacturers, lumberyards, etc. across the United States. Raw materials for our bundle and Native American housing products are in ready supply. On the contrary, suppliers of SIPs panels within the U.S. are limited. Our principal suppliers of SIPs panels include: Extreme Panel Technologies, Inc located in Cottonwood, MN, Insulspan, located in Delta, British Columbia and Blissfield, Michigan; Premier Building Systems, located in Phoenix, Arizona and Fife, Washington; and SIPs Team USA based in Bainbridge, Georgia. We obtain SIPs panels on a job by job basis by
submitting a purchase order to the supplier. Although the number of SIPs suppliers is limited, the number of actual SIPs panels that each supplier is able to provide is not limited and therefore, we have a ready supply of SIPs panels to address our needs. 

Customers 

The Company's customers are U.S. customers. General Contracting has one customer which began operations in March of 2011. This customer accounted for 91 of the total Company revenue in 2011. Floor Art, the Company s only operating bundle , has three major customers. These three customers accounted for 49 and 78 of Floor Art s revenues and 2 and 57 of the total Company revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Currently, there is no Native American housing customer and only one Engineered Building Systems customer, the
Children s Learning Center. Although we have a limited number of customers, we have expanded our operations to include General Contracting and Management Solutions, the Native American housing, Engineered Building Systems and bundle of trade activities. By expanding our operations, we have expanded our customer base and have thereby reduced the risk of losing any one of our current customers. 

Government Regulation and Environmental Matters 

The Company is subject to various federal, state, and local laws regulating the construction industry and compliance with environmental standards. Specifically, the Company is subject to Title 32 of the Arizona Revised Statutes ARS ), Chapter 10, the Professions and Occupations Code, and Title 49 of the ARS pertaining to environmental safety and protection. Further, the Company is subject to government laws and regulations governing health, safety, working conditions, employee relations, wrongful termination, wages, taxes and
other matters applicable to businesses in general. The Company s services and products are currently not subject to government approval. The costs of compliance with these laws are built in with the construction costs. Although significant capital expenditures may be required in the future to comply with such laws and regulations, to date, such compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on the earnings or competitive position of the Company. In addition, the Company s operations may be vulnerable to risks arising from the numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection.

Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, Centurion committed to purchase up to 7,500,000 of our common stock, over a period of time terminating upon 36 months from the date of the Investment Agreement, subject to an effective registration statement covering the resale of the common stock and subject to certain conditions and limitations set forth in the Investment Agreement, including limitations based upon the trading volume of the Company s common stock. The maximum aggregate number of shares issuable by us and purchasable by Centurion under the Investment
Agreement is that number of shares of common stock having an aggregate purchase price of 7,500,000. We may draw on the facility from time to time, as and when we determine appropriate subject to an effective registration statement covering the resale of the shares to be put to Centurion and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Investment Agreement. The maximum amount that we are entitled to put in any one notice is such number of shares of common stock as equals 500,000 provided that the number of shares sold in each put shall not exceed a share volume limitation equal to the lesser of: (i) 500,000 divided by a Company designated minimum purchase price per put share at which Centurion may purchase shares of common stock pursuant to such put notice which price shall be no greater than 80 and no less than 50 of the closing bid price of the Company s
common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the notice or (ii) 17.5 of the aggregate trading volume (the Volume Limitation of the common stock traded on our primary exchange during any pricing period for such put excluding any days where the lowest intra-day trade price is less than the trigger price (which is the greater of: (a) the floor price plus a fixed discount of 0.01, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances; (b) the floor price if any set by us divided by 0.98; or (c) 0.01, the greater of all three clauses being referred to as the Trigger Price ). The offering price of the securities to Centurion will equal the lesser of: (i) 98 of the average of the lowest three daily volume weighted average price, or VWAPs, of our common stock during the fifteen trading day period beginning on the trading day immediately
following the date Centurion receives our put notice (the Market Price or (ii) the Market Price minus 0.01. However, if, on any trading day during a pricing period, the lowest intra-day trading price of the common stock is lower than the Trigger Price, then that day s trading volume is excluded from the calculation of the Volume Limitation on the number of shares that we are entitled to sell in that put. There are put restrictions applied on days between the put notice date and the closing date with respect to that particular put. During such time, we are not entitled to deliver another put notice. In connection with the preparation of the Investment Agreement and the registration rights agreement, we issued Centurion 171,233 shares of common stock as a document preparation fee having a value of 10,000 and 2,568,492 shares of common
stock (of which 1,284,246 are being placed in escrow to be released in accordance with the terms of an escrow agreement), having a value of 150,000 (2 of the Maximum Offering Amount) as a commitment fee. We also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with Centurion pursuant to which we granted Centurion certain registration rights with respect to the shares issued to Centurion accordance with the terms of the Investment Agreement as a commitment fee and document preparation fee as well as the shares to be issued in connection with a put. We also agreed to register certain placement agent shares.

Common Stock 

Our common stock has been quoted on the OTCBB since June 10, 2010, and trades under the symbol DYNV.OB. Because we are quoted on OTCBB, our securities may be less liquid, receive less coverage by security analysts and news media, and generate lower prices than might otherwise be obtained if they were listed on a national securities exchange. 

The following table sets forth the high and low bid prices for our common stock per quarter as reported by the OTCBB for the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011. These prices represent quotations between dealers without adjustment for retail mark-up, markdown or commission and may not represent actual transactions. These prices have been adjusted for the 5:1 stock split.

Our common stock is subject to rules adopted by the Commission regulating broker dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Those disclosure rules applicable to penny stocks require a broker dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized list disclosure document prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission. That disclosure document advises an investor that investment in penny stocks can be very risky and that the investor s salesperson or broker is not an impartial advisor but rather paid to sell the shares. The disclosure contains further warnings
for the investor to exercise caution in connection with an investment in penny stocks, to independently investigate the security, as well as the salesperson with whom the investor is working and to understand the risky nature of an investment in this security. The broker dealer must also provide the customer with certain other information and must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. Further, the rules require that, following the proposed transaction, the broker provide the customer with monthly account statements containing market information about the prices of the securities.

These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock. Many brokers may be unwilling to engage in transactions in our common stock because of the added disclosure requirements, thereby making it more difficult for stockholders to dispose of their shares. 

Record Holders 

As of March 22, 2012, an aggregate of 56,622,117 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding and were owned by approximately 24 holders of record. 

Dividends 

The Company declared a 5:1 stock dividend on October 14, 2010 to stockholders of record on November 9, 2010. The issuance date for each share issued as a stock dividend was deemed to be the same as the issuance date of their counterpart shares in respect of which they were issued. Likewise, the shares issued as a stock dividend carried the same restrictions as to trading, if any, as their counterpart shares in respect of which they were issued. All per share amounts have been restated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect stock for the dividends. 

We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date, and we have no intention of paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Whether we declare and pay dividends is determined by our board of directors at their discretion, subject to certain limitations imposed under Delaware corporate law. The timing, amount and form of dividends, if any, will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.

The Company entered into three convertible notes with Asher Enterprises, Inc. Asher on January 7, 2011, February 24, 2011 and April 27, 2011, respectively. The principal of each of the January and February note was 35,000 and the April note was 50,000 with an annual interest rate of 8 . The maturity dates were October 11, 2011, November 28, 2011 and January 30, 2012, respectively. The Company repaid all three notes prior to maturity. The issuances were not public offerings as defined in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 because the issuances were made to an insubstantial number of persons and because
of the manner of the offerings. In addition, the investor had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since it agreed to, and received, securities bearing a legend stating that such securities are restricted. This restriction ensured that these securities will not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore be part of a public offering. These issuances were done with no general solicitation or advertising by the Company. Based on an analysis of the above factors, the Company met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 for these transactions.

Overview 

On August 2, 2010, BBSI entered into a Share Exchange Agreement whereby the Company obtained all of the issued and outstanding shares of its common stock in exchange for the issuance of 22,500,000 shares of common stock the Company (4,500,000 shares pre 5:1 dividend). The transaction resulted in BBSI becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. After the Share Exchange Agreement, BBSI became the primary operating company. 

Through our subsidiaries we provide construction and related services in North America. Our revenue has been derived from the following five different services we offer: (i) general construction for residential and commercial land owners; (ii) construction of engineered building systems (structured insulated panels SIPs )) for commercial projects; (iii) installation of finishes, such as finishes for houses and commercial buildings, which include flooring, tile, counter tops, and bath surroundings; (iv) construction management and general contracting services to Native American communities in the Southwestern United States;
and (v) project management services comprising design, construction, land development, and training of local labor. For the year ended December 31, 2011, a substantial portion of our revenue (approximately 90.9 was derived from our general contracting services for residential and commercial landowners, approximately 4.5 of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 was derived from our construction of our engineered building systems; approximately four percent (4.2 of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 was derived from our installation of flooring and we obtained less than 1 of our from our Native American housing and project management services. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we derived a substantial portion of our revenue (approximately 73 from our installation of flooring, approximately 26 of our revenue from our Native American housing and a
nominal amount of revenue from our project management services. We also develop software that allows builders and designers to plan their projects and to choose products and designs. In 2011, we formed a joint venture with an independent third party for the purpose of holding, maintaining, developing, rehabilitating and selling residential real estate. To date, we have not derived any revenue from the joint venture. 

Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2011 versus December 31, 2010 

Upon the consummation or our share exchange in August 2010, we changed our primary line of business and commenced operations as a public company engaged in the provision of construction management solutions and related services. While legally the Company acquired BBSI, for financial presentation purposes this is considered a "reverse acquisition" where BBSI is considered the acquirer. Therefore the accompanying financial statements include the activity for BBSI on a combined basis prior to March 31, 2010 and on a consolidated basis after that date. Operations of the Company are included from August 2, 2010, as a result of its acquisition for financial reporting purposes. 

Total sales increased 260 for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The fourth quarter 2011, was the first quarter in the Company s history that it achieved profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we had sales of 12,794,654 as follows: General Contracting 11,625,986 representing approximately 90.9 of the revenue, Engineered Building Systems 570,970 representing approximately 4.5 of the revenue, Floor Art 541,048 representing approximately 4.2 of the revenue, Native American Housing 41,250 representing less than 1 of the revenue and BDC 15,400 representing less than 1 of the revenue. There was a gross
margin of 939,397 (7.3 as follows: General Contracting 757,010 (6.5 ), Engineered Building Systems (16,878) (-3.0 ), Floor Art 142,615 (26.4 ), Native American Housing 41,250 (100 and BDC 15,400 (100 ). There were expenses of 1,603,710 and a net loss of 664,313 for the year ended December 31, 2011, which included a one- time expense of 127,928 incurred in third quarter of 2011 in connection with our abandonment of the Bossier hotel project. Third quarter 2011 results filed with the 10Q reported a loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 of 668,926, as compared to a loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 of 664,313. This decrease in loss was due to our profitable operations in the fourth quarter 2011. 

Page - 14 

Results for the comparable year ended December 31, 2010 were sales as follows: Floor Art - 2,600,737, representing approximately 73 of the revenue, Native American housing - 941,996, representing approximately 26 of the revenue, and BDC - 12,000, representing less than 1 of the revenue. There was a gross margin of 609,523 (17.1 as follows: Floor Art - 552,073 (21.2 ), Native American housing - 45,450 (4.8 ), and BDC - 12,000 (100 ). There were expenses of 766,425 and a net loss of 156,902. General Contracting and Engineered Systems activity had not yet begun at December 31, 2010. 

General Contracting sales during the year ended December 31, 2011 were generated by the North Dakota project. Sales by quarter were 1 st quarter 35,000, 2 nd quarter 910,747, 3 rd quarter 4,347,570, and 4 th quarter 6,332,669. Activity began in March of 2011. A portion of the second quarter was used for start-up time. Weather conditions in North Dakota have a limiting effect on
construction capacity during 1 st and 4 th quarters of the year. The year 2012 will be the first full year of general contracting activity on the North Dakota project. 

Both Floor Art and BDC are focused in the homebuilding market. Floor Art s decrease in sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, is due to the decline in the homebuilding market for this time period. The small increase in sales in BDC for the comparable periods is not indicative of an upward trend in BDC s sales. BDC sales are trending down as a result of the decline in the homebuilding market. Until the homebuilding market improves, additional sales for Floor Art will come primarily from installing finishes for BBSI s General Contracting projects. 

Floor Art s margins increased from 21.2 in the year ended December 31, 2010, to 26.4 in the year ended December 31, 2011 Revenues attributable to insurance company projects and custom projects which generate higher margins increased while revenues from homebuilder clients which generate lower margins decreased. The gross profit for General Contracting comes from the cost plus contract for the North Dakota project. 

Engineered Systems completed its first project in 2011 at a loss of 16,878. The loss is the result of first time project operating inefficiencies which are not anticipated to be ongoing and the fact that the project was abandoned. 

Expenses, including other income and expenses, increased approximately 109 for the year ended December 31, 2011 versus the year ended December 31, 2010 to 1,603,710 from 766,425 due to increased payroll costs for the start up and ongoing operations of the North Dakota project, increased sales and marketing expenses and increased financing expenses. Our general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related payroll taxes, employer s portion of employee health insurance costs, legal and accounting fees, bank charges, travel, meals and entertainment, office rent and maintenance, communication expenses (internet, fax, and telephone), courier, postage costs, and office
supplies. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our balance sheet as of December 31, 2011 reflects cash in the amount of 539,933. As of March 1, 2012 we had a cash balance of 340,448. Cash from operations, issuance of stock and borrowings from inception to date have been sufficient to provide necessary operating capital to date. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 amounted to 664,313. As of December 31, 2011 our accumulated deficit was 837,215 and we had a working capital deficit of 857,436. 

Cash increased for the year ended December 31, 2011 by 384,420 as a result of cash provided by operating activities of 177,065, offset by cash used in investing activities of 84,312, and increased by cash provided by financing activities of 291,667 from net proceeds of the debenture. (See Note 6 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011). The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 of 664,313 was covered by activity on the North Dakota project which generated an increase in customer deposits and an increase in accounts payable in excess of the increase in accounts receivable and financing proceeds. 

Cash decreased in 2010 by 125,136 as a result of cash used by operating activities. Cash used in investing activities of 150,000 was offset by cash provided by financing activities of 150,000. The 2010 net loss of 156,902, offset by non-cash items included in the loss of 12,749 accounted for most of the cash reduction. Reductions in accounts receivable and contracts in process due to the decline in Floor Art s business volume discussed above were offset by an increase in prepaid job costs for the planning of commercial projects.

We intend to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months through operations and external sources: a combination of debt financing and equity financing through private placements. We are currently not in good short-term financial standing. We will not have enough positive internal operating cash flow until we can generate substantial revenues, which may take the next year to fully realize. Although the Company must ultimately re-achieve profitable operations and periodically adjust its business plan based on cash on hand during the coming year, the Company projects cash from existing projects in process along with cash infused through debt and equity will provide adequate funding throughout 2012.
There is no assurance we will achieve profitable operations or obtain the debt and equity funding necessary. 

We have historically financed our operations primarily by cash flows generated through operations and cash infusions from officers and outside investors in exchange for debt and/or common stock. In January, February, and April of 2011 we obtained a total of 120,000 in convertible debt financing which was paid in full during 2011. (See Note 6 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011). In July of 2011, we entered into a 1,000,000 Securities Purchase Agreement for debenture financing. To date, we have issued 500,000 of debentures applicable to this agreement. (See Note 6 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011).
The debentures are secured by a lien on all of our assets and guaranteed by BBSI. In December of 2011, we entered into a 7,500,000 equity financing agreement. (See Note 2 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011). However, prior to making any draw down on the equity line we must meet certain conditions and there is no assurance that any such conditions will be met. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in raising any additional capital. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise these funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 

Related Party Transactions 

As a result of BBSI s buyout of Floor Art and BDC in March of 2010, there was a net deemed distribution to the majority owner of 448,173. This deemed distribution was the result of BBSI not buying all the assets of Floor Art and BDC. In addition, the majority owner took a cash distribution of approximately 150,000 and the remaining balance due, pursuant to the reorganization, to the owner was recorded as a note payable of 303,442. 

The majority owner then contributed inventory back to BBSI for equity at the book value of 120,027. The net deemed distribution was recorded as a reduction in equity. The balance due the Director as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 is 303,442. This amount is unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due upon demand. 

In August of 2010, the Company hired JENAL Consulting, Inc. to provide the Company with marketing of the engineered construction system. The owner of JENAL is the wife of Al Cain, a stockholder. The Company has paid JENAL 187,997 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 62,461 for the year ended December 31, 2010.

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. 

Future Financings 

We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common stock and issuance of debt in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 

We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, information from third party professionals, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2011-11, Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities to facilitate comparisons between entities preparing financial statements on the basis of U.S.GAAP and entities preparing financial statements on the basis of IFRS. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The Company does not have derivatives, financial assets, and financial liabilities that are covered by this update and the adoption of this update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2011-09, Compensation- Retirement Benefits Multiemployer Plans to increase disclosures about an employer s participation in a multiemployer plan. The amendments in this update are effective for annual fiscal years ending after December 15, 2011. The Company does not have a multiemployer plan and the adoption of this update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Presentation of Comprehensive Income to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and to eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. 

The amendments require that all non-owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate, but consecutive statements. The amendments in this update were to be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2011-12 deferring the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income. Management believes that the adoption of these amendments will not have any impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements.

In May 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, to clarify previously issued amendments to require reporting entities to separately disclose the amounts and business rationale for significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and separately present information regarding purchase, sale, issuance, and settlement of Level 3 fair value measures on a gross basis. This standard, for which the Company is currently assessing the impact, is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial
statements. 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that are applicable. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and 

Stockholders of Dynamic Ventures Corp.: 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Dynamic Ventures Corp. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. Dynamic Ventures Corp. s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Dynamic Ventures Corp. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

DYNAMIC VENTURES CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Organization - Dynamic Ventures Corp. (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 22, 2008. The Company initially intended to engage in the manufacturing and distribution of a non-powered toothbrush with longitudinal to lateral motion conversion. This never materialized and the Company became a shell public company. 

Bundled Builder Solutions Inc. ("Bundled Builder" also "BBSI") was incorporated on August 29, 2008 under the laws of the state of Delaware. Bundled Builder was formed to provide construction services through the combination of trade contractors and management integrated into one organization. It acquired Floor Art, LLC ("Floor Art") and Builder Design Center, LLC ("BDC") in an asset purchase transaction effective March 31, 2010. These companies had common ownership and all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in presenting the combined results prior to the acquisition on March 31, 2010 and consolidated results. after the
acquisition on March 31, 2010. Floor Art's primary business is installation of flooring. BDC develops software for use by builders and designers. Both subsidiaries have been in business for over five years. 

Additionally, Bundled Builder provides construction management services and general contracting for residential and commercial construction for land owners throughout the United States and Native American communities. These services for Native American communities in the Southwestern United States were provided through a contract with a native owned company, Tribal Building Solutions, LLC. There is no common ownership between the Company and Tribal Building Solutions, LLC. This contract relationship began in September of 2009 and was terminated in November of 2011. 

Bundled Builder also provides construction management for engineered systems including structured insulated panels' construction (SIPS) for commercial projects throughout the United States. In August of 2010, Bundled Builder formed a subsidiary, EZ Build Systems, LLC, to conduct the engineered systems portion of the business. During 2011, EZ Build Systems, LLC was dissolved and all engineered systems business was conducted by Bundled Builder. There were no transactions in EZ Build Systems, LLC in 2011 or 2010. 

On October 25, 2011, the Company through its wholly owned subsidiary Bundled Builder Solutions, Inc. (BBSI) together with its unaffiliated joint venture partner, Builders Investment Group, LLC (BIG I), formed Builders Investment Group II, LLC (BIG II), an Arizona limited liability company for the purposes of holding, owning, protecting, maintaining, developing, enhancing, rehabilitating, and selling residential real estate. Each member of the LLC receives 50 of the profits or losses. There were no purchases or sales in 2011. 

On August 2, 2010, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with BBSI whereby the Company obtained all of the issued and outstanding shares of BBSI, in exchange for the issuance of 22,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company (originally 4,500,000 shares adjusted for a 5:1 stock split). The transaction resulted in BBSI becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the share exchange, the Company intends to carry on the business of BBSI as the primary
business. 

Prior to the closing of the share exchange, there were no options or warrants to purchase shares of capital stock of the Company or BBSI outstanding and as of December 31, 2011, the Company has not adopted an equity incentive plan or otherwise reserved shares for issuance as incentive awards to officers, directors, employees and other qualified persons in the future. See Note 2 and Note 13 regarding adoption of an equity plan to reserve shares for issuance as incentive awards to officers, directors, employees and other qualified persons in the future. That plan was adopted in January of 2012. 

The Company declared a 5:1 stock dividend on October 14, 2010 to stockholders of record on November 9, 2010. The issuance date for each share issued as a stock dividend will be deemed to be the same as the issuance date of their counterpart shares consistent with how they were issued. Likewise, the shares issued as a stock dividend will carry the same restrictions as to trading, if any, as their counterpart shares consistent with how they were issued. As a result, the outstanding shares of the Company have been restated from
4,500,000 to 22,500,000 similar to a stock split. 

Basis of Presentation - While legally the Company acquired BBSI, for financial presentation purposes this is considered a "reverse acquisition" where BBSI is considered the acquirer. Therefore the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
activity for BBSI on a combined basis prior to March 31, 2010 and on a consolidated basis after that date. Operations of the Company are included from August 2, 2010, as a result of its acquisition for financial reporting purposes. 

F - 6 

In March 20 I 0, Floor Art and BDC were acquired by BBSI. All of the entities had common ownership. The transaction resulted in a recapitalization of Floor Art and BDC with no cost involved. BBSI also did not acquire certain insignificant assets or pay all agreed-upon cash distributions in
exchange for a note payable to the major shareholder, which resulted in a deemed distribution of 448,173. Therefore, for financial presentation purposes, the accumulated deficits of Floor Art and BDC prior to the reorganization are being reflected as distributed capital. Due to common ownership, this transaction resulted in the transfer of assets and liabilities to BBSI at carrying value. 

The 2010 and the 2011 financial information including BIG II is reflected as consolidated. 

Principles of Combination - The annual consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiaries and BIG II. There was no activity in BIG II in 2011. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company
considers all highly-liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less on the purchase date to be cash equivalents. Deposits at each institution are insured in limited amounts by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). At times, cash and cash equivalents may exceed amounts insured by the FDIC 

Valuation of Accounts Receivable -The Company
accrues for revenue based on the completion of work. Billings are due within 30 days. Accounts receivable are reviewed to determine which are doubtful of collection. In making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company considers specific accounts, analysis of accounts receivable agings, changes in customer payment terms, historical write-offs, changes in customer demand and relationships, concentrations of credit risk and customer credit worthiness. The allowance for doubtful accounts totaled 8,250 at December 31, 2011 and 35,000 at December 31, 2010. Accounts totaling 26,750 were written off against
the allowance for doubtful accounts in 2011. 

Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of three to seven
years. Upon retirement or sale, the costs of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized. Repairs and maintenance charges are expensed as incurred. The Company recorded 4,164 and 8,340 of depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 

Inventory - Inventory consists of carpet and carpet pad which are valued at the lower of cost or market. There was no allowance for inventory obsolescence at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. 

Long-Lived Assets - The Company evaluates potential impairment of long-lived assets, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360-10,
 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets , which requires the Company to (a) recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and (b) measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. No impairment was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. 

Revenue Recognition - The Company derives revenue from BBSI and its subsidiaries for their specific line of business. 

The Company recognizes revenue for Floor Art in accordance with ASU 605-35-50, Accounting for Performance
of Construction-Type and Certain Product-Type Contracts. Under this rule, the Company can perform work under a fixed-price contract or a time-and-materials contract. As these jobs are short in nature, revenue is recognized
at the completion of the project. For contracts in progress but not completed, costs incurred are accumulated until completion of the contract. These costs consist of labor and materials At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, costs incurred on projects in progress were 0 and 15,393, respectively. 

BDC is providing a software resource for builders and designers to use in the design center selection process. To access the software, there is a fee billed at the beginning of the contract period which extends, generally, a period of six months. As the billing and collection of fees are collected up front, the Company has deferred revenue for the portion of revenue received, but not earned, at year end. Revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. For the years ended December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the Company had deferred revenue of 0 and 5,400, respectively. 

The Company recognizes revenue for BBSI construction management projects in Native American communities and for general contracting in accordance with ASU 605-35-50, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type
 and Certain Product-Type Contracts. Under this rule, the Company can perform work under a fixed-price contract or a time-and-materials contract. As these jobs are longer in nature, revenue is recognized as a percentage of completion based on the percentage of costs paid on the total cost of the project. For contracts in
progress but not completed, costs incurred are charged to costs of contract revenues at the same time the revenues are recognized. The BBSI contract for the North Dakota project is a cost plus contract. Revenue is recognized equal to the costs incurred plus the related fee as the costs are incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company had recorded revenues of 11,625,986 and costs of contract revenues of 10,868,976 for general contracting. There was no activity in general contracting for 2010.

 Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Product-Type Contracts. Under this rule, the Company can perform work under a fixed-price contract or a time-and-materials contract. As these jobs are longer in nature, revenue is recognized as a percentage of completion based on the percentage of costs paid on the total cost of the project. For contracts in progress, costs incurred but not yet expensed to cost of sales are reflected as contracts in progress. These costs consist of labor and materials which was 0 at
December 31, 2011 and 0 at December 31, 2010, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company had recorded revenues of 570,970 and costs of contract revenues of 587,848 for engineered building systems' projects.

Income (Loss) per Common Share - Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The 22,500,000 (adjusted for the 5:1 stock split) shares issued for the August 2, 2010 stock exchange described in note 1 are considered outstanding for the entire years ending December 31, 2011 and 2010. Dynamic Ventures Corp shares issued prior to the stock exchange agreement totaling 27,500,000
(adjusted for the 5:1 stock split) are considered outstanding from August 2, 2010, the effective date of the stock exchange agreement. Fully diluted loss per share is computed similarto basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional shares of common stock were dilutive. There are 1,000,000 shares in the Restrictive Stock Award (See Note 2) that are dilutive shares at December 31, 2011. These shares are antidilutive due to the net loss in 2011 and as such their effect has not been included in the calculation of diluted net loss per
share. There were no dilutive financial instruments issued or outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2010. 

Income Taxes -Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax
and financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating the differences. 

The Company maintains a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets. The Company establishes a valuation allowance based upon the potential likelihood of realizing the deferred tax asset and taking into consideration the Company's financial position and results of operations for the current period. Future realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period under the Federal tax laws. 

Changes in circumstances, such as the Company generating taxable income, could cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset. Any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of the change in estimate. 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, effective for the year ended December 31, 2009. Management evaluated the Company's tax positions and concluded that the Company had taken no uncertain tax positions that require adjustment to the consolidated financial statements to comply with the provisions of this guidance. The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in
income tax expense. As of December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the Company made no provision for interest or penalties related to uncertain tax provisions. 

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and Arizona. There are currently no federal or state income tax examinations underway for these jurisdictions. Given that the Company was newly formed in 2008, the Company is not subject to income tax examinations by the U.S. federal, state or local tax authorities for years before 2008. Open years subject to examination are 2008 thru 2011. 

Advertising Costs - Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs in 2011 and 2010 were 0 in each year..

2. COMMON STOCK AND EQUITY 

Common Stock - On March 29, 2010, the Company completed an offering of 2,500,000 shares of newly
issued common stock at an offering price of 0.03 per share for proceeds of 75,000 by filing a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

In March 2010, Floor Art and BDC were acquired by BBSI in an asset purchase transaction effective March 31, 2010. All of the entities had common ownership. The transaction resulted in a recapitalization of Floor Art and BDC with no cost involved. BBSI also did not acquire certain insignificant assets or pay all agreed-upon cash distributions in exchange for a note payable to the major shareholder, which resulted in a deemed distribution of 448,173. See Note 3. The accumulated deficit of 1,176,001 of Floor Art and BDC prior to the reorganization was reflected as distributed capital. 

On August 2, 2010, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with BBSI whereby the Company obtained all of the issued and outstanding shares of BBSI, in exchange for the issuance of 22,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company (originally 4,500,000 shares adjusted for a 5:1 stock split). The transaction resulted in BBSI becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

Shares issued by the Company prior to the share exchange agreement totaling 27,500,000 (adjusted for the 5:1 stock split) were considered outstanding from August 2, 2010, the effective date of the stock exchange agreement. 

For financial reporting presentation purposes, BBSI issued 22,500,000 (4,500,000 shares adjusted for the 5: I stock dividend) shares of its common stock to acquire the Company. Therefore the operations of the Company are not reflected within these financial statements until after August 2, 2010, and the financial statements before this date are of BBSI. 

The Company declared a 5: 1 stock dividend on October 14, 2010 to stockholders of record on November 9, 2010. The issuance date for each share issued as a stock dividend will be deemed to be the same as the issuance date of their counterpart shares in respect of which they were issued. Likewise, the shares issued as a stock dividend will carry the same restrictions as to trading, if any, as their counterpart shares in respect of which they were issued. Due to the size of the stock dividend, it has been accounted for as a stock split and the effect of this stock dividend has been reflected in the financial statements for years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31,
2010. 

On July 31, 2011, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with TCA Global MasterCredit Fund.

Terms of the agreement require the Company to issue additional shares on April 30, 2012, such that the total market value of the shares issued for the loan fee equals 125,000 on April 30, 2012, or pay TCA the difference between the April 30,
2012 value of the 2,717,392 shares and 125,000 in cash. Terms of the agreement also require TCA to return shares to the Company if the value of shares issued to TCA exceeds 125,000 on April 30, 2012 such that the total value of shares retained by TCA at April 30, 2012 is 125,000. The share price at December 31, 2011 was .055. As a result of unknown value of this future valuation, the issued shares are reflected as issued and outstanding; however, the Company has reflected the 125,000 as a liability and not equity on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2011. Additionally, the statement of changes in equity does not reflect the 2,717,392 shares issued related to this transaction.

having a value of 75,000 have been placed in escrow. Terms of the escrow agreement require the Company to issue additional shares during the 36 month term such that the total market value of the shares issued for the loan fee equals 75,000 when the shares are required to be issued or pay Centurion the difference between issued 1,284,246 shares and 75,000 in cash As a result of unknown value of these shares at the future release, the 1,284,246 shares are reflected as issued and outstanding; however, the Company has reflected the 75,000 as a liability and not equity on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2011. Additionally, the statement of changes in equity does not reflect the 1,284,246 shares issued related to this transaction. The Deferred Equity Costs consisting of total preparation fee of 10,000 and commitment fee of 150,000
will be deferred until the put is exercised and then offset against the stock in equity on a pro rata basis. There was no expense recorded in 2011.

10. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011-11 , Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities to facilitate comparisons between entities preparing financial statements on the basis of U.S.GAAP and entities preparing financial statements on the basis of IFRS. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The Company does not
have derivatives, financial assets, and financial liabilities that are covered by this update and the adoption of this update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011-09, Compensation Retirement Benefits- Multiemployer Plans to increase disclosures about an employer's participation in a multiemployer plan. The amendments in this update are effective for annual fiscal years ending after December 15, 2011. The Company does not have a multiemployer plan and the adoption of this update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements

In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011-05, "Comprehensive Income" (Topic 220), Presentation of Comprehensive Income to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and to eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity. 

The amendments require that all non-owner changes in stockholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The amendments in this update were to be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011-12 deferring the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income. Management believes that the adoption of these amendments will not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial
statements. 

In May 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, to clarify previously issued amendments to require reporting entities to separately disclose the amounts and business rationale for significant transfers in and out of Level I and Level 2 fair value measurements and separately present information regarding purchase, sale, issuance, and settlement of Level 3 fair value measures on a gross basis. This standard, for which the Company is currently assessing the impact, is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a
significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect that are applicable. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

The Company has received a deposit from this customer of 350,000. This customer accounted for 91 of the total Company revenue in
2011. Floor Art has three major customers which accounted for 49 of Floor Art's revenues for the year ended December 31,2011 and 78 of Floor Art's revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010. Accounts receivable for Floor Art's three major customers was 4,225 and 163,769 at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Native American housing has only one customer whose accounts receivable was 0 and 1,450 at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Engineered Building Systems, which began operations in July of 2011, has one customer. Accounts receivable for this customer was 57,097 at December 31, 2011. Although the Company has a limited number of customers, operations were expanded in 2011 to add General
Contracting and Engineered Building Systems and to add the Native American housing in 2010. 

We are subject to concentrations of credit risk from our cash and cash equivalents. Our cash in bank deposit accounts from time to time may exceed federally insured limits.

ITEM 9. 

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. 

On June 7, 2011, Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C. Mayer was engaged as the registered independent public accountant for the Company and Hein Associates LLP Hein was terminated as the registered independent public accountant for the Company. The decisions to appoint Mayer and end the engagement of Hein were approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on June 7, 2011. 

Hein's reports on the financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. 

In connection with the audit and review of the financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the interim period through June 7, 2011, there were no disagreements on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosures, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements if not resolved to their satisfaction would have caused them to make reference in connection with Hein's opinion to the subject matter of the disagreement. 

In connection with the audited financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, and interim unaudited financial statements through June 7, 2011, there have been no reportable events with the Company as set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 

Prior to June 7, 2011, the Company did not consult with Mayer regarding (1) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, (2) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company s financial statements, (3) written or oral advice provided by Mayer that would be an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issues, or (4) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement between the Company and its predecessor auditor as described in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) or a reportable event as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 

The Company provided a copy of the foregoing disclosures to Hein prior to the date of the filing of this report and requested that Hein furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the statements in this Report. A copy of the letter furnished in response to that request is filed as Exhibit 16.1 our Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 20, 2011 and is incorporated herein by reference. 

ITEM 9A. 

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-K, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including our CEO and CFO , as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Management conducted an assessment of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on the assessment, management
concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 

The Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of error or fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that the breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Compensation Committee 

We currently do not have a compensation committee of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors as a whole determines executive compensation. 

Compensation of Directors 

We do not pay members of the Board of Directors any set fees for attendance at the Board meetings or similar remuneration or reimburse them for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with our business. On December 22, 2011 we entered into a restricted stock award agreement with Laurence Luke pursuant to which we agreed to issue to him 1,000,000 shares of restricted stock as compensation for his services as a director and chairman of the audit committee. One third of the shares of common stock vest on each anniversary date of the date of grant provided that he remains as a director on such anniversary date. The fair market value of the shares on the date of grant was .05
per share. If Mr. Luke is convicted of a felony, act of embezzlement, misappropriation of fund or fraud, will fully and intentionally has a dereliction of fiduciary duty then he will be terminated for cause and forfeit the unvested shares. If he should die, there should be a change of control or his services are terminated for any other reason other than those previously listed then the shares vest immediately. 

The table below summarizes all compensation of our directors as of December 31, 2011.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS. 

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners 

The following table sets forth certain information concerning the number of shares of our common stock owned beneficially based on 56,622,117 issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of March 22, 2012 by: (i) each of our directors; (ii) each of our named executive officers; and (iii) each person or group known by us to beneficially own more than 5 of our outstanding shares of common stock.

All share ownership figures include shares issuable upon exercise of options or warrants exercisable within 60 days of March 22, 2012, which are deemed outstanding and beneficially owned by such person for purposes of computing his or her percentage ownership, but not for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

Changes in Control 

On August 2, 2010, the Company and its controlling shareholders entered into a share exchange agreement (the "Share Exchange Agreement") with BBSI and its shareholders whereby the Company obtained all of the issued and outstanding shares of BBSI, in exchange for the issuance of 22,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company to BBSI shareholders (originally 4,500,000 shares adjusted for a 5:1 stock split). The transaction resulted in BBSI becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the BBSI shareholders holding approximately 45 of the Company's outstanding capital stock. 

Other than the foregoing, there are no present arrangements or pledges of the Company s securities which may result in a change in control of the Company.

In August of 2010, the Company hired JENAL Consulting, Inc. to provide the Company with marketing of the SIPS panel construction system. The owner of JENAL is the wife of Al Cain, a stockholder. The Company has paid JENAL 62,461 as of December 31, 2010 and 187,997 as of December 31, 2011. 

Other than the foregoing transactions, none of the directors or executive officers of the Company, nor any person who owned of record or was known to own beneficially more than 5 of the Company s outstanding shares of its Common Stock, nor any associate or affiliate of such persons or companies, has any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction that has occurred during the past fiscal year, or in any proposed transaction, which has materially affected or will affect the Company.

The Audit Committee has adopted procedures for pre-approving all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, including the fees and terms of such services. These procedures include reviewing the scope of the independent auditor s audit examination, including their engagement letter, prior to the annual audit and reviewing and approving the audit fees agreed upon by management. Any additional audit services or permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditors must also be approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also considers whether the
independent registered public accounting firm is best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient service, based on such reasons as the auditor s familiarity with our business, people, culture, accounting systems, risk profile, and whether the services enhance our ability to manage or control risks and improve audit quality. All of the services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
