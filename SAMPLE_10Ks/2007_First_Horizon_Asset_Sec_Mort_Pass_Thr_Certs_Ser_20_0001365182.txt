Exhibit 34.1 

Report
 of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The
 Board
 of Directors 

 First
 Horizon Home Loan Corporation: 

We
 have
 examined management s assessment, included in the accompanying Report on
 Assessment of Compliance with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria - First
 Horizon Asset Securities Inc. 1st Lien Mortgage Securitizations, that First
 Horizon Home Loan Corporation, including its wholly owned subsidiary, First
 Tennessee Mortgage Services Inc. (collectively, the Asserting Party), have
 complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the
 Securities and Exchange Commission s (SEC) Regulation AB for all
 mortgage loans sold on a servicing-retained basis during 2006 and mortgage
 loans
 held as of December 31, 2006 for which servicing commenced in 2006, in all
 cases excluding mortgage loans sold to Federal National Mortgage Association,
 Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage
 Association, and non-prime loans (the Platform), except for servicing
 criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii), and
 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Asserting Party has determined are either not
 applicable to the activities it performs or are activities only performed by
 asserting subcontractors with respect to the Platform, as of and for the year
 ended December 31, 2006. Management is responsible for the Asserting
 Party s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
 express an opinion on management s assessment about the Asserting Party s
 compliance based on our examination. 

Our
 examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
 Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
 examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Asserting Party s compliance with
 the servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures
 as
 we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
 of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities
 that
 comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities
 related to the Platform, and determining whether the Asserting Party processed
 those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in
 compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited
 to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Asserting
 Party during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed
 to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent
 to
 our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported
 by the Asserting Party during the period covered by this report for the selected
 transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides
 a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal
 determination on the Asserting Party s compliance with the servicing
 criteria. 

As
 described in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Regulation
 AB Servicing Criteria - First Horizon Asset Securities Inc. 1st Lien Mortgage
 Securitizations, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(2)(vii)(A),
 1122(d)(2)(vii)(B), 1122(d)(2)(vii)(D), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xiii),
 the Asserting Party has engaged various vendors to perform the activities
 required by these servicing criteria. The Asserting Party has determined that
 these vendors are not considered a servicer , as defined in Item 1101(j)
 of Regulation AB, and the Asserting Party has elected to take responsibility
 for
 assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor
 as
 permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation
 Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations
 (Interpretation 17.06). As permitted by Interpretation 17.06, the
 Asserting Party has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place
 designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in
 all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor.
 The
 Asserting Party is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
 requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendors and related criteria
 as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect
 to
 the Asserting Party s eligibility to apply
 Interpretation 17.06. 

In
 our
 opinion, management s assessment that the Asserting Party complied with the
 aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing
 criteria 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(2)(vii)(A), 1122(d(2)(vii)(B),
 1122(d)(2)(vii)(D), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xiii) for which compliance
 is
 determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described above, as of and for
 the year ended December 31, 2006 is fairly stated in all material
 respects.

 Bank of New York and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., (collectively,
 the Company ), complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d)
 of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the publicly
 issued (i.e. transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities
 and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) residential mortgage-backed securities
 and
 other mortgage-related asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1,
 2006 (and like-kind transactions issued prior to January 1, 2006) for which
 the
 Company provides trustee, securities administration, paying agent, or custodial
 services (the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 except
 for criteria 1122 (d)(1)(ii)-(iv), and 1122 (d)(4)(iv)-(xiii), which the Company
 has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by them with
 respect to the servicing Platform covered by this report. The Platform includes
 like-kind transactions for which the Company provided trustee, securities
 administration, paying agent or custodial services as a result of the Company s
 acquisition as of October 1, 2006 of portions of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. s
 corporate trust business, including structured finance agency and trust
 transactions. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those
 servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
 assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on
 our examination. 

Our
 examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established
 by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as adopted by the
 Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly,
 included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance
 with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures
 as
 we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
 of less than all of the individual transactions and securities that comprise
 the
 platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the
 Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected
 transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the
 servicing criteria and as permitted by the Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC
 Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone
 Interpretations Interpretation 17.06 ). Furthermore, our procedures were
 limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by
 the
 Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not
 designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or
 subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts
 calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report
 for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our
 examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does
 not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing
 criteria. 

In
 our
 opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
 aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria for which
 compliance is determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described above,
 as
 applicable, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 for the Platform,
 is
 fairly stated, in all material respects.
