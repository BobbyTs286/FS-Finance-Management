STATEMENTS 

Certain
statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking
statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995) regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations.
Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors
that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of SRKP 29, Inc. (the
 Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The
forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations
that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company's plans and
objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the continued expansion
of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with
respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market
conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or
impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the
Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying the
forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove
inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking
statements included in this Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the
significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included
herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a
representation by the Company or any other person that the objectives and plans
of the Company will be achieved.

PART I 

Item 1. Description of Business. 

SRKP 29,
Inc. we , us , our , the "Company") was incorporated in the State of
Delaware on December 17, 2007. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in
organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company
was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination and has made no efforts
to identify a possible business combination. As a result, the Company
has not conducted negotiations or entered into a letter of intent concerning any
target business. The business purpose of the Company is to seek the acquisition
of, or merger with, an existing company. The Company selected
December 31 as its fiscal year end. 

The
Company, based on proposed business activities, is a blank check company. The
SEC defines those companies as "any development stage company that is issuing a
penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Exchange Act, and
that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its
business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies." Many
states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of
securities of "blank check" companies in their respective jurisdictions. The
Company is also a shell company, defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act
as a company with no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal
operations. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a
market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have
successfully concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply
with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we
are subject to those requirements. 

The
Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation
warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages
of being a publicly held corporation. The Company s principal business objective
for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth
potential through a combination with an operating business. The Company will not
restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business,
industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of
business. 

The analysis of new business
opportunities is undertaken by or under the supervision of Richard A. Rappaport
and Anthony C. Pintsopoulos, the officers and directors of the
Company. As of this date the Company has not entered into any
definitive agreement with any party. Although the Company has limited
funds available, the Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing
and participating in potential business opportunities in that it may seek a
business combination target located in any industry or location. In its efforts
to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Company will consider the
following kinds of factors: 

(a) Potential
for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new
products; 

(b) 
Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience
within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a
whole; 

(c) Strength
and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for
recruitment; 

(d) 
Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be
provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional
securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other
sources; 

(e) 
 The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived
tangible and intangible values and potentials; 

(f) 
The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; and 

3 

(g) 
 The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw
materials, services, professional assistance and other required
items. 

In
applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management
will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination
based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially
available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at
various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative
investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult
and complex. Due to the Company's limited capital available for investigation,
the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the
opportunity to be acquired. In evaluating a prospective business combination, we
will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as
possible given the lack of information which may be available regarding private
companies, our limited personnel and financial resources and the inexperience of
our management with respect to such activities. We expect that our due diligence
will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business s
incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as
a review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This
due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by
unaffiliated third parties we may engage, including but not limited to
attorneys, accountants, consultants or such other professionals. At this time
the Company has not specifically identified any third parties that it may
engage, except that WestPark Capital, Inc., WestPark a registered
broker-dealer and FINRA member, may assist the Company with due diligence in
identifying a business combination target. The costs associated with hiring
third parties to complete a business combination target may be significant and
are difficult to determine as such costs may vary depending on a variety of
factors, including the amount of time it takes to complete a business
combination, the location of the target company and the size and the complexity
of the target company. Our limited funds and the lack of full-time management
will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive
investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business
combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without
detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like
which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be
particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the
promoters, owners, sponsors or other associated with the target business seeking
our participation. 

The time
and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and
complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree
of certainty. The amount of time it takes to complete a business combination,
the location of the target company and the size and complexity of the business
of the target company are all factors that determine the costs associated with
completing a business combination transaction. The time and costs required to
complete a business combination transaction can be ascertained once a business
combination target has been identified. Any costs incurred with respect to
evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately
completed will result in a loss to us. 

COMPETITION 

In
identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter
intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to
ours. There are numerous public shell companies either actively or passively
seeking operating businesses with which to merge in addition to a large number
of blank check companies formed and capitalized specifically to acquire
operating businesses. Additionally, we are subject to competition from other
companies looking to expand their operations through the acquisition of a target
business. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive
experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through
affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other
resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when
contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Our ability to compete in
acquiring certain sizable target businesses is limited by our available
financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an
advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Further, our
outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not
be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. 

4 

Any of
these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully
negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our
status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public
equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities
with a business objective similar to ours to acquire a target business on
favorable terms. 

If we succeed in effecting a business
combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from
competitors of the target business. Many of our target business competitors are
likely to be significantly larger and have far greater financial and other
resources than we will. Some of these competitors may be divisions or
subsidiaries of large, diversified companies that have access to financial
resources of their respective parent companies. Our target business may not be
able to compete effectively with these companies or maintain them as customers
while competing with them on other projects. In addition, it is likely that our
target business will face significant competition from smaller companies that
have specialized capabilities in similar areas. We cannot accurately predict how
our target business competitive position may be affected by changing economic
conditions, customer requirements or technical developments. We cannot assure
you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources to
compete effectively. 

FORM OF
ACQUISITION 

The
manner in which the Company participates in an opportunity will depend upon the
nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of the Company and
the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of the
Company and such promoters. 

It is
likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity
through the issuance of common stock or other securities of the Company.
Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be
noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not
an acquisition is a so-called "tax free" reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") depends upon
whether the owners of the acquired business own 80 or more of the voting stock
of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of
these provisions rather than other "tax free" provisions provided under the
Code, all stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20 or less of the
total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Under other
circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties,
stockholders may retain substantially less than 20 of the total issued and
outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial
additional dilution to the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company
prior to such reorganization. 

The
present stockholders of the Company will likely not have control of a majority
of the voting securities of the Company following a reorganization transaction.
As part of such a transaction, all or a majority of the Company's directors may
resign and one or more new directors may be appointed without any vote by
stockholders. 

In the
case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole
determination of management without any vote or approval by stockholders. In the
case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the Company, it
will likely be necessary to call a stockholders' meeting and obtain the approval
of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities. The necessity to
obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in
the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain
appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek
to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder
approval. 

It is
anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the
negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents
and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and
substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made
not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore
incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore,
even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business
opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss
to the Registrant of the related costs incurred. 

5 

We
presently have no employees apart from our management. Our officers and
directors are engaged in outside business activities and anticipate that they
will devote to our business very limited time until the acquisition of a
successful business opportunity has been identified. We expect no significant
changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident
to a business combination.

Item
6. Selected Financial Data. 

As a
 smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company
is not required to provide this information. 

Item
7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operation 

The
Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation
warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages
of being a publicly held corporation. The Company s principal business objective
for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth
potential through a combination with an operating business. The Company will not
restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business,
industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of
business. 

The Company currently does not engage
in any business activities that provide cash flow. During the next
twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to: 

(i) filing
Exchange Act reports, and 

 (ii) investigating,
analyzing and consummating an acquisition. 

7 

We
believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our
treasury, through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional
amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders,
management or other investors. As of the date of the period covered by this
report, the Company has 9,834 in its treasury. There are no assurances that the
Company will be able to secure any additional funding as needed. Currently,
however our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability
to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary
financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal
business operations when they come due. Our ability to continue as a going
concern is also dependant on our ability to find a suitable target company and
enter into a possible reverse merger with such company. Management s plan
includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger
transaction and/or related party advances, however there is no assurance of
additional funding being available. 

The Company may consider acquiring a
business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in
need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking
to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be
experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional
capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition
of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital
but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while
avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of
voting control which may occur in a public offering. 

Our
management has not had any contact or discussions with representatives of other
entities regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is
selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages
of development or growth, including entities without established records of
sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent
in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or
potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business
combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk,
and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a
particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly
ascertain or assess all significant risks. Our management anticipates that it
will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to
our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective
stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management s plan to
offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free
reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial
risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential
losses from one venture against gains from another. 

The Company anticipates that the
selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Through
information received from industry professionals and publications such as the
Reverse Merger Report, our management believes that there are numerous firms
seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such
perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among
other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity
financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and
investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options
or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in
structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of
stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different
industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task
of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities
extremely difficult and complex. 

We do not
currently intend to retain any entity to act as a finder to identify and
analyze the merits of potential target businesses. However, if we do,
at present, we contemplate that at least one of the third parties who may
introduce business combinations to us may be WestPark. Richard A. Rappaport, our
President, director and one of our controlling stockholders, indirectly holds a
100 interest in, and is the Chief Executive Officer of, WestPark, a FINRA
member. Anthony C. Pintsopoulos, our Secretary, Chief Financial Officer,
director and one of our principal stockholders, is the President and Chief
Financial Officer of WestPark. There is currently no signed agreement
or preliminary agreements or understandings between us and WestPark. Any finders
fees paid to WestPark will be comparable with unaffiliated third party
fees.

stockholders. This compares with liabilities of 97,500 comprised exclusively of
monies due to stockholders, as of December 31, 2009. The Company can provide
no assurance that it can continue to satisfy its cash requirements for at least
the next twelve months. 

The following is a summary of the
Company's cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing

The
Company has nominal assets and has generated no revenues since inception. The
Company is also dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other
financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of
seeking a combination with a private operating company. In addition, the Company
is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and
capital resources. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at
reasonable terms, the Company may not be able to implement its plan of
operations. 

Results
of Operations 

The
Company has not conducted any active operations since inception, except for its
efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates. No revenue has been
generated by the Company from December 17, 2007 (Inception) to December 31,
2010. It is unlikely the Company will have any revenues unless it is
able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company, of which
there can be no assurance. It is management's assertion that these
circumstances may hinder the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern. The Company s plan of operation for the next twelve months shall
be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition
candidates. 

For the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, the Company had a net loss of 36,397,
consisting of legal, accounting, audit, and other professional service fees
incurred in relation to the preparation and filing of the Company s periodic
reports. 

For the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, the Company had a net loss of 32,351,
consisting of legal, accounting, audit, and other professional service fees
incurred in relation to the preparation and filing of the Company s periodic
reports. 

For the
cumulative period from December 17, 2007 (Inception) to December 31, 2010, the
Company had a net loss of 120,166 comprised exclusively of legal, accounting,
audit, and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the formation
of the Company, the filing of the Company s Registration Statement on Form 10-SB
in January of 2008 and Quarterly Reports and Annual Reports on Form 10-Q and
Form 10-K, respectively.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the
Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders
of SRKP 29, Inc. 

 Lauderdale
by the Sea, FL 

We have
audited the accompanying balance sheets of SRKP 29, Inc. (a development stage
company) ("Company") as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related
statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficit) and cash
flows for the years then ended, and for the period from December 17, 2007
(inception) to December 31, 2010. SRKP 29, Inc. s management is responsible for
these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our
opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of SRKP 29, Inc. as of December 31,
2010 and 2009, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
years then ended, and for the period from December 17, 2007 (inception) to
December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company
will continue as a going-concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the
financial statements, the Company is in the development stage and has not
commenced operations. Its ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent upon its ability to develop additional sources of capital, locate and
complete a merger with another company and ultimately achieve profitable
operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding
these matters are also discussed in Note 1 to the financial
statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

History 

 SRKP 29,
Inc. (the Company), a development stage company, was incorporated under the laws
of the State of Delaware on December 17, 2007. The Company is in the
development stage as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting
Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 915 "Development Stage
Entities". The fiscal year end is December 31. 

The
Company filed a Form 10-SB registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. The registration statement has been declared effective as of
March 17, 2008. 

Going Concern and Plan of
Operation 

 The
Company's financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a
going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is in the
development stage and has negative working capital, negative stockholders 
equity and has not earned any revenues from operations to date. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. 

The
Company is currently devoting its efforts to locating merger candidates. The
Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability
to develop additional sources of capital, locate and complete a merger with
another company, and ultimately, achieve profitable operations. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of these uncertainties. 

Income
Taxes 

 In
accordance with ASC Topic 740, "Accounting for Income Taxes", the Company
accounts for income taxes under the liability method of accounting for income
taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect
the tax consequences in future years of temporary differences between the tax
basis of the assets and liabilities and their financial amounts at year-end.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. 

For
federal income tax purposes, substantially all startup and organizational
expenses must be deferred until the Company commences business. The
Company may elect a limited deduction of up to 10,000 in the taxable year in
which the trade or business begins. The 10,000 must be reduced by the
amount of startup costs in excess of 60,000. The remainder of the
expenses not deductible must be amortized over a 180-month period beginning with
the month in which the active trade or business begins. These expenses
will not be deducted for tax purposes and will represent a deferred tax
asset. The Company will provide a valuation allowance in the full amount
of the deferred tax asset since there is no assurance of future taxable
income. Tax deductible losses can be carried forward for 20 years until
utilized.

 NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

Income Taxes
(Continued) 

 The
Company has adopted ASC Topic 740, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes"
- - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 FIN 48 as of December 17,
2007. ASC Topic 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in companies financial statements in accordance with ASC Topic 740,
"Accounting for Income Taxes". As a result, the Company applies a
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties. ASC Topic
740 only allows the recognition of those tax benefits that have a greater than
fifty percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing
authorities. As a result of implementing ASC Topic 740, the Company s management
has reviewed the Company s tax positions and determined there were no
outstanding, or retroactive tax positions with less than a 50 likelihood of
being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, therefore the
implementation of this standard has not had a material affect on the
Company. 

Based on
its evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant
uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in its financial statements. The
Company s evaluation was performed for the tax periods ended December 31, 2007
through December 31, 2010 for U.S. Federal Income Tax and for the tax periods
ended December 31, 2007 through December 31, 2010 for the State of Florida
Income Tax, the tax years which remain subject to examination by major tax
jurisdictions as of December 31, 2010. 

The
Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2010 and
2009 which if recognized would affect the Company s effective income tax
rate. 

The
Company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax
issues as components of income tax expense. The Company did not recognize or
incur any accrual for interest and penalties relating to income taxes as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009. 

Deferred Offering
Costs 

 Deferred
offering costs, consisting of legal, accounting and filing fees relating to an
offering will be capitalized. The deferred offering costs will be offset against
offering proceeds in the event the offering is successful. In the event the
offering is unsuccessful or is abandoned, the deferred offering costs will be
expensed. 

Cash and Cash
Equivalents 

 Cash and
cash equivalents consist primarily of cash in banks and highly liquid
investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. 

Concentrations of Credit
Risk 

 The
Company maintains all cash in deposit accounts, which at times may exceed
federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced a loss in such
accounts.

 NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

Earnings per Common
Share 

 Basic
earnings per common share are computed based upon the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
share consists of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus
the dilutive effects of options and warrants calculated using the treasury stock
method. In loss periods, dilutive common equivalent shares are
excluded as the effect would be anti-dilutive. At December 31, 2010 and 2009,
the only potential dilutive securities were 7,096,390 common stock
warrants. Due to the net loss, none of the potentially dilutive securities were
included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share since their effect
would be anti-dilutive. 

Use of Estimates in the
Preparation of Financial Statements 

 The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 

Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements 

 The
Company has adopted all recently issued accounting pronouncements. The adoption
of the accounting pronouncements, including those not yet effective, is not
anticipated to have a material effect on the financial position or results of
operations of the Company. 

During
December 2007, the Company sold for 5,000 cash 7,096,390 shares of its .0001
par value common stock to various investors. In addition, the Company also sold
to these investors for 2,500 cash warrants to purchase 7,096,390 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of .0001. These warrants expire at
the earlier date of 10 years from date of purchase or 5 years from the date the
Company consummates a merger or other business combination with an operating
business or any other event to which the Company ceases to be a shell
company. 

NOTE
3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

The
Company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property. Most office
services are provided at a charge by WestPark Capital. The Company s
President is also the Chief Executive Officer of WestPark Capital. For the years
ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company incurred costs of 12,000 and
 7,000, respectively for these services. The officers and directors of the
Company are involved in other business activities and may, in the future, become
involved in other business opportunities that become available. Such
persons may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and their other
business interests. The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution
of such conflicts. 

NOTE
4 - DUE TO STOCKHOLDERS 

Since
inception certain stockholders have advanced the Company 122,500 to pay for
operating expenses. These funds have been advanced interest free, are unsecured,
and are due on demand.

Item
9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial
Disclosure. 

There are
not and have not been any disagreements between the Company and its accountants
on any matter of accounting principles, practices or financial statement
disclosure. 

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial
officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In
accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was
completed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s
management, including the Company s President, Principal Financial Officer and
Secretary, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management
including the President, Principal Financial Officer and Secretary, concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in
providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the
Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the
Commission s rules and forms. 

Evaluation of Internal
Controls and Procedures 

Our management is also responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Our
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
 fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
 Company; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
 preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
 accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being
 made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company s management
 and directors; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
 unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have
 a material effect on the financial
statements. 

As of December 31, 2010, we carried out

Officers, directors and greater than 10 stockholders are required by SEC
regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms
they file.

similar programs have been adopted by the Company for the benefit of its
