REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Board of Directors 

Ally Financial Inc 

Ally Credit Canada, Limited 

We have examined Ally Financial Inc s (the "Company s") compliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB ("Regulation AB") for the Commercial Automotive Receivables Platform (the Commercial Platform") described in the accompanying Management's Certification Regarding Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Commercial Platform. The Commercial Platform consists of the activities involved in the
performance of servicing functions for all publicly and privately issued wholesale dealer floor-plan asset-backed transactions. Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Commercial Platform, determining whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly,
such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction included in the Commercial Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. 

As described in management's assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform certain activities required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a "servicer" as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). As permitted by Interpretation 17.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's activities comply in all material respects with the servicing
criteria applicable to this vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 17.06. 

In our opinion, the Company complied, in all material respects, with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria for the Commercial Automotive Receivables Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, or for the periods from the respective dates of sale for each trust or sale to December 31, 2010.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors 

The Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association: 

We have examined management s assessment, included in the accompanying Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that The Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commissions Regulation AB for publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and certain privately-issued (i.e., for which transaction-level reporting is required pursuant to contractual obligation) residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities for which the Company provides master servicing, trustee, securities administration or paying agent

services, excluding any such securities issued by an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government (other than the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any government sponsored entity and further excluding the transactions issued prior to 2006 for which Wells Fargo outsources all material servicing activities (as defined by Regulation AB) (the Platform), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assessment about the Company s compliance based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period

covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

As described in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Compliance With Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations Interpretation 17.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 17.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply Interpretation 17.06. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) for which compliance is determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 fairly stated, in all material respects.
