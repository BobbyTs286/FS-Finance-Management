General 

We
 are a
 leading global manufacturer, marketer and installer of a broad array of
 geosynthetic lining products. Geosynthetic lining products are used in
 containment systems for environmental protection and for the confinement of
 solids, liquids and gases in the waste management, liquid containment and mining
 industries. We offer a full range of high quality products, including
 geomembranes, drainage products, geosynthetic clay liners, nonwoven geotextiles
 and other products. We also offer installation services, focused on large
 projects for key customers in the United States and Germany through an internal
 installation staff. We formerly offered installation services in the United
 Kingdom through an internal installation staff through December 22, 2006. We
 believe that our market share, broad product offering, installation
 capabilities, strong customer relationships, diverse end markets and global
 presence provide us with key competitive advantages in the geosynthetic products
 industry. 

We
 believe we are the world s largest manufacturer of polyethylene sheet
 geomembranes and that we were responsible for a significant portion of the
 world s production in 2006. Our principal products, flexible geomembrane liners,
 are manufactured from polyethylene and polypropylene resins with chemical
 additives designed to resist weathering, ultraviolet degradation and chemical
 exposure for extended time in exposed applications. We manufacture our products
 at facilities located in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany,
 Thailand, Chile and Egypt. These facilities are strategically located in close
 proximity to our customers and resin suppliers. Our products are marketed
 through a worldwide distribution organization made up of internal sales people,
 independent dealers, agents and distributors. We serve leading waste management
 and mining companies, independent dealers, general contractors, agents,
 distributors and government agencies. In 2006, we sold more than 1.1 billion
 square feet of products to customers in 93 countries. 

We
 added
 new products with the purchase on October 13, 2006, of the operating assets,
 patent and other intangible assets of ProGreen Sport Surfaces, LLC ProGreen ).
 This business primarily involves marketing, selling and installing synthetic
 turf for athletic fields for governmental and quasi-governmental authorities
 and
 educational institutions. The acquisition of the replicated grass technology
 complements with GSE s geomembranes, drainage geocomposites, nonwoven geotextile
 liner products and installation techniques for the sports field and landscaping
 markets. While our goal is to expand revenues over time, our replicated grass
 business is anticipated to increase 2007 consolidated revenues by less than
 5 . 

Corporate
 Developments 

We
 were
 founded in 1981 by Clifford Gundle in Texas with a single high density
 polyethylene production line. In 1986, Odyssey Partners acquired a majority
 ownership interest in us, and we completed an initial public offering. In 1995,
 we merged with SLT Environmental, Inc. and changed our name to Gundle/SLT
 Environmental, Inc. (the Company or GSE ). This merger added flat cast
 manufacturing capabilities in Europe and the United States along
 with an enhanced distribution network. Our chief executive officer, Samir
 Badawi, joined us from SLT. In February 2002, we purchased Serrot International,
 Inc., an international provider of geosynthetic lining products and services
 for
 environmental protection and other uses, from Waste Management Holdings, Inc.
 We
 generated consistent growth in the ensuing years, adding capacity in the United
 Kingdom, Germany, Thailand, Egypt and Kingstree, South Carolina. 

On
 May
 18, 2004, GEO Sub Corp., a newly formed entity controlled by Code Hennessy
 
Simmons IV CHS IV ), merged with and into GSE, with GSE surviving the merger
 (the Merger ), in a transaction valued at approximately 242.1 million. As a
 result of the Merger, GSE became a wholly-owned subsidiary of GEO Holdings
 Corp., which is controlled by CHS IV, an entity controlled by Code Hennessy
 Simmons CHS ). 

In
 connection with the Merger, we entered into a 65.0 million senior secured
 credit facility with UBS Loan Finance LLC and certain other lenders. The senior
 credit facility provides for a 25.0 million term loan facility and a revolving
 credit facility up to 40.0 million. In addition, we issued 150.0 million
 of
 publicly registered 11 senior notes due in 2012. The senior notes are
 guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct or indirect domestic
 subsidiaries other than Bentofix Technologies (USA), Inc., a dormant subsidiary
 of our 75.5 -owned Canadian subsidiary, Bentofix Technologies, Inc.
 BTI ). 

3 

On
 December 30, 2005, we completed the acquisition of the operating assets of
 SL
 Limitada, (SL), a privately owned company located in Santiago and Antofagasta,
 Chile. The acquisition was completed pursuant to an asset purchase agreement
 for
 a total purchase price of 15.5 million plus a separate agreement for the
 purchase of the raw material and finished goods inventory which we valued at
 2.1 million. The transaction was financed with cash and a 4.5 million seller
 note payable over a five-year period. 

On
 January 18, 2006, GSE International (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company)
 entered into a share purchase agreement with Naue GmbH CO KG Naue to
 acquire all the issued and outstanding shares Naue held in the capital of
 Bentofix Technologies, Inc. for 2,400,000 CDN 2,066,649 US). The purchase
 of
 these shares increased the Company s ownership percentage in Bentofix
 Technologies from 51 to 75.5 . 

On
 August
 31, 2006, we acquired the rights to commercialize the storm water detention
 system owned by GeoStorage Corporation under an assignment of U.S. Patent
 Application Serial No. 11/190.629. We entered into a Technology and Patent
 Rights Agreement, along with an Employment Agreement, with Terrance G. Sheridan,
 President of GeoStorage Corporation. The Technology and Patent Rights Agreement
 requires the payment of a per cubic foot royalty payment for any covered
 system as defined in the agreement. 

On
 October 13, 2006, we completed an acquisition of the operating assets, patent
 and other intangible assets of ProGreen. The acquisition was completed pursuant
 to an asset purchase agreement for a total purchase price of 4,7122,000, which
 included transaction costs of 151,000. The transaction was payable in cash
 and
 a 2.7 million three-year unsecured promissory note. 

The
 historical financial information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K
 includes the results of operations and financial position of our current
 business from the date of acquisition. 

Products 

We
 offer
 a broad selection of products and services required in geosynthetic lining
 systems. Our products perform essential functions in a number of applications
 including: (1) solid waste, liquid and gas containment; (2) drainage
 and conveyance of liquids; and (3) corrosion protection. Our products can
 be used on a stand-alone basis or can be combined with each other to serve
 a
 range of applications. In addition, with the acquisition of ProGreen, we also
 offer products and services for synthetic turf athletic and recreational
 fields. 

Geosynthetic
 Products 

Geomembrane
 Liners 

Our
 principal products, flexible geomembrane liners, are synthetic polymeric lining
 materials that are used as barriers in geotechnical engineering applications
 such as lining landfills. Geomembranes are manufactured from polyethylene and
 polypropylene resins with chemical additives designed to resist weathering,
 ultraviolet degradation and chemical exposure for extended time in exposed
 applications. Geomembranes have a number of end market applications that allow
 them to meet the containment needs of a variety of industrial operations. Some
 of our most popular geomembranes include: 

GSE
 HDPE. High
 density polyethylene HDPE liners are the most widely used material for
 lining applications, such as landfills, tanks, and ponds. Our HDPE liners
 provide chemical resistance, relative impermeability, resistance to ultraviolet
 light and durability under high levels of tension. Our HDPE liner products
 range
 in thickness from 20 to 240 mil (one mil equals 1/1000th of an inch) and
 seamless widths up to 34.5 feet. Liner width dictates how many seams are
 required during installation, and seaming represents the major technical
 difficulty for liner installers. The fewer the number of seams, the less labor
 involved, and the less testing required. 

GSE
 LLDPE. Linear
 low density polyethylene LLDPE liners offer greater flexibility than HDPE
 liners, allowing increased conformity to an uneven ground surface. High
 elongation properties allow these liners to conform to irregularities in the
 sub
 grade that may cause punctures and tears in other liners. Common applications
 for flexible liners include landfill caps, mining heap leach pads and floating
 covers. 

4 

GSE
 Textured. The
 texturing of liners creates increased friction resistance between layers of
 the
 liner system. This texturing allows the liner system to maintain its integrity
 on steep slopes and under harsh conditions. 

GSE
 White. This
 patented, co-extruded, HDPE or LLDPE geomembrane liner reduces heat build-up
 through its ability to reflect light. By reflecting light and thereby reducing
 heat, the liner expands and contracts less during installation, reducing the
 likelihood of tears. In addition, the lower temperatures on the surface of
 the
 liner enable installers to work more effectively. The liner s reflective nature
 protects subgrade soils from drying out and cracking. The white surface greatly
 improves detection of installation damage by revealing scoring and abrasions
 as
 black marks exposed against the white surface. 

GSE
 Conductive. This
 patented, premium grade, HDPE geomembrane liner allows for easy and efficient
 spark testing of the installed material to detect post-installation damage
 and
 locate potential leaks. This product is used in applications that have a high
 risk of containment failure. 

Drainage
 Products 

Drainage
 products, such as geonets and geocomposites, typically are installed along
 with
 geomembranes in a liner system to keep liquids from accumulating on the liners.
 These drainage products provide the transmission avenues for liquid and gas
 collection and leak detection systems. Our drainage products consist primarily
 of: 

GSE
 HyperNet. 
 Our
 geonet product consists of two sets of HDPE strands intertwined to form a
 channel along which fluid is conveyed for drainage. This drainage capability
 has
 traditionally been provided by thick layers of aggregates, such as sand or
 gravel. 

GSE
 FabriNet. 
 Our
 geocomposite product is produced by heat bonding nonwoven geotextiles to one
 or
 both surfaces of the GSE HyperNet. The permeable textile serves as a separator
 and a filter, keeping soils out of the GSE HyperNet drainage layer, which allows
 for the product to perform its functions of transmitting liquids and
 gasses. 

Geosynthetic
 Clay Liners 

Geosynthetic
 clay liners GCLs are synthetic clay liners that typically are installed as
 the bottom layer of a liner system. They are constructed with sodium bentonite
 clay as a critical component, which, when hydrated, is a highly impermeable
 substance and often replaces thick layers of compacted natural clay ordinarily
 required as a subgrade layer. We offer the following two GCLs: 

GSE
 GundSeal. 
 This GCL
 combines HDPE liners with highly expansive sodium bentonite clay. The sodium
 bentonite clay is adhered directly to the liner, and serves as a support layer
 to the liner, with an ability to seal small punctures in the overlaying liner.
 GundSeal is a patented product manufactured under license. 

Bentofix 
 Thermal Loc. 
 This GCL
 combines durable geotextile outer layers with an inner layer of low permeability
 sodium bentonite clay. The geotextile s thermally bonded fibers reinforce and
 protect the bentonite layer, providing high internal strength. 

Nonwoven
 Geotextiles 

Nonwoven
 geotextiles are polypropylene, staple fiber, nonwoven needle-punched fabrics
 used in environmental, civil and industrial applications. We sell our nonwoven
 geotextile product to customers in various end markets and use it in the
 production of our drainage products. 

5 

Specialty
 Products 

We
 offer
 other polysynthetic products not included in the above categories. Examples
 include: 

GSE
 CurtainWall and GSE GundWall. 
 These
 specialty products are vertical barrier systems that block the lateral migration
 of subsurface fluids. 

GSE
 StudLiner. 
 GSE
 StudLiner is a studded geomembrane that protects against corrosion and
 deterioration of concrete structures, including tanks, pipes, drainage channels
 and tunnels. 

Pre-Fabricated
 Products. 
 These
 products include pipe boots, corners, sumps, or other ancillary parts that
 are
 fit to the liner in order to reduce installation time and simplify
 installation. 

GSE
 GeoStorage 

We
 are
 currently in the final development, or prototype, stage of a system for storm
 water retention and management. Storm water management is an issue that affects
 everyone. Land development seals the earth and disrupts the natural course
 of
 storm water. Rainfall flows across impermeable surfaces picking up oil,
 trash and other pollutants, then quickly discharges into low-lying areas, lakes
 and rivers. To control the flooding and pollution issues that are inherent
 in storm water, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA and other
 regulatory agencies have developed regulations that require all or a portion
 of
 storm water to be managed on site. Above-ground detention ponds are the
 common solution, but underground structures are a more convenient and economical
 solution because water can be temporarily stored underground before being
 released to a storm sewer or back into the surrounding soil to recharge the
 groundwater. The GeoStorage Storm Water Detention System GSE GeoStorage is
 a below grade chamber with a stabilized porous perimeter and a pre-stressed
 concrete roof which is supported by both the perimeter and supports in the
 chamber. A geosynthetic liner prevents the passage of particulate matter
 into the porous perimeter and the chamber. The GSE GeoStorage is a cost
 effective way to manage storm water. The
 first
 prototype of the system was constructed in February 2007, and we plan to market
 the system by both selling and installing the system with our personnel and
 entering into commercial representative agreements with third-party design/build
 general contractors. We initially plan to market and sell the system in the
 U.S.
 market .

Replicated
 Grass Products 

With
 the
 ProGreen asset acquisition on October 13, 2006, we began marketing, selling
 and
 installing the replicated grass technology products used in the artificial
 turf
 industry. The technology is a sandless, replicated grass that offers the
 structure of natural grass. The replicated grass can be used as a multipurpose
 athletic surface. 

Installation
 Services 

Geosynthetic
 Products 

We
 provide our customers of geosynthetic products a variety of installation
 services and have approximately 35 full installation crews available throughout
 the United States, along with an installation office in Germany. Our
 professionals work closely with customers, engineers and contractors to
 determine efficient, cost-effective and safe methods by which to install our
 liner system. Through both infusion wedge welding and extrusion welding, we
 are
 able to effectively integrate geomembranes and other system parts to create
 a
 continuous, seamless liner system. Through our quality assurance program, our
 installation personnel test all installed products for leaks along the seams
 and
 for strength of the liner under tensile stress tests. 

A
 network
 of distributors and independent installers around the world also install our
 geosynthetic products. Upon request from a customer using third-party
 installers, we may furnish a technical supervisor to monitor installation
 activities and provide quality assurance. 

6 

On
 December 22, 2006, we ceased installing our liner systems in the United Kingdom
 due to competitive pressures on margins and the actions of national waste
 companies in contracting for installation services. 

Replicated
 Grass Products 

We
 further provide our sport turf customers with installation services for our
 replicated grass technology products. We are able to provide complete
 installation services from site preparation, sub-grade construction and storm
 water drainage construction to placement of the artificial replicated grass
 products.

Solid
 Waste Containment 

The
 waste
 management industry is our largest end market. It uses geomembranes to prevent
 landfill runoff from entering the surrounding environment and as caps to prevent
 the escape of greenhouse gases, to control odors and to limit rainwater
 infiltration. In the United States, growth of municipal solid waste generation
 has increased demand for landfill capacity. This trend has contributed to
 increased demand for our products, as regulations under the Resource
 Conservation and Recovery Act have required landfills to be equipped with a
 liner system. Similar legislation has been implemented in Europe, including
 the
 European Landfill Directive, which has introduced requirements for waste and
 landfills designed to protect the environment. Other regions, such as
 Asia/Pacific, represent significant growth opportunities as local governments
 in
 these regions continue to introduce regulations regarding landfill construction
 and performance requirements. 

The
 primary purpose of a liner in a landfill is to protect the soil and groundwater
 from being contaminated. Beginning at the top of the liner system, drainage
 products, such as geonets or geocomposites, sit below the waste and on top
 of
 the liner in order to sweep waste water and leachate off of the liner and into
 a
 storage or treatment pond or tank. Below the drainage products, the primary
 geomembrane is installed as the first protection layer. While the geomembranes
 are relatively impermeable, secondary layers of drainage products and
 geomembranes are typically installed as safeguards against tears or punctures
 that may occur in the primary layer. The secondary layer of drainage products
 also serves as a leak detection system by sweeping out any fluids that penetrate
 the primary geomembrane. Beneath the secondary geomembrane, installers will
 sometimes include a layer of nonwoven geotextile that serves as a cushion to
 protect the liner from the ground. GCLs are 
 typically installed as the bottom layer of the system, providing impermeability
 equivalent to that of thick layers of compacted natural clay. 

In
 the
 United States, Europe, Australia/New Zealand and developing Asian countries,
 upon closing of the landfill, a landfill cap is installed over the top of the
 waste to prevent gas from the degrading waste from escaping into the atmosphere.
 A typical cap consists of two layers. The geomembrane liner, which is relatively
 impermeable to gas, forms the top layer and prevents the escape of the methane
 gas. A drainage product, such as geonet or geocomposite, forms the second layer
 and controls the flow of the gas. The geonet or geocomposite enables the methane
 gas to escape up to the top layer, collects the gas just below the surface,
 and
 transmits it to a storage or treatment system through a methane gas collection
 system.

Liquid
 Containment 

Geosynthetic
 products such as geomembranes are used in a wide variety of liquid containment
 and other applications in the United States and around the world. Water
 treatment facilities, canals, irrigation waterways, reservoirs, dams, tunnels
 and other civil engineering and non-building construction projects use
 geosynthetic products for their containment and confinement needs. Geosynthetic
 products are used in agricultural applications to line irrigation waterways
 and
 waste ponds and to provide protection against soil erosion and weed growth.
 In
 aquaculture construction or rehabilitation projects, geomembranes are used
 as
 liners. We believe growth across these end markets will continue to be driven
 by
 increased infrastructure spending resulting from the growth and urbanization
 of
 the world s population as well as the environmental and safety legislation that
 we anticipate will continue to be implemented by governments and regulatory
 agencies around the world. 

Mining 

The
 mining industry uses our products for the containment of chemicals used in
 mining gold, copper and phosphate. Mining activity and the use of more
 innovative mining techniques have resulted in the increased use of geosynthetic
 lining materials. Mining processes that utilize chemical solutions use
 geomembrane materials to prevent soil contamination by the leachate chemicals.
 Geomembranes, drainage products and geosynthetic clay liners are used to line
 the soil, drain the leachate and recapture and recycle the solutions along
 with
 the extracted precious metals. The size of the geosynthetic market opportunity
 in the mining industry is directly related to the amount of mining activity,
 which is driven by the world prices of precious metals and minerals such as
 gold
 and copper. 

Manufacturing
 and Quality Control 

We
 manufacture our geosynthetic products through six different processes, resulting
 in a broad array of products for liner systems. We use (i) round die production
 lines for geomembranes, (ii) flat cast production lines for geomembranes, (iii)
 geonet and geocomposite lines for drainage products, (iv) a GundSeal GCL line
 for GCLs, (v) needle-punched blanket GCL lines for GCLs, and (vi) a
 needle-punched nonwoven line for nonwoven geotextiles. The following table
 summarizes the different processes used:

Our
 capabilities in both round die and flat cast manufacturing allow us to offer
 a
 broad geomembrane product line. With round die manufacturing, we can produce
 liners with multiple layers, which is necessary in the production of certain
 specialized products, such as GSE White. Additionally, the round die process
 offers co-extrusion capabilities that allow for simultaneous texturing and
 production of the liner as well as thinner material. The flat cast manufacturing
 process allows us to precisely control the thickness of the geomembranes. In
 Germany, the flat cast machine can produce liners with multiple layers. In
 addition, we are able to produce smooth HDPE and LLDPE geomembranes at a low
 cost through flat cast manufacturing. 

Our
 global manufacturing quality assurance program establishes quality control
 standards for the manufacture of geosynthetic products. Quality assurance
 laboratories at each facility oversee all quality 
 control
 initiatives. Raw materials, such as a polyethylene resin and master batch,
 are
 subject to tests that must comply with our specifications before entering the
 manufacturing process. A strip is taken from a finished product based on test
 frequencies and a laboratory tests the strip to ensure that it complies with
 product specifications. The laboratories catalog every strip in case the
 integrity of a product in the field is ever questioned. In addition, thickness
 readings are taken continuously on most geomembrane lines over the length and
 width of the roll to check for product consistency. 

Raw
 Materials and Supplier Relationships 

Geosynthetic
 Products 

We
 have
 developed close relationships with a group of suppliers with whom we have a
 long
 history of doing business. Our purchases from suppliers are based on purchase
 orders, rather than long-term contracts. High-grade polyethylene resins are
 the
 most significant raw material we purchase. These resins are primarily purchased
 from at least two primary suppliers at each manufacturing location. We purchased
 approximately 19 of our raw materials during 2006 from our largest
 supplier. 

Given
 the
 size and weight of our products, managing freight costs is a significant factor
 in our operating results. In the U.S. and Canada, we distribute our products
 from four facilities through contractual relationships. With manufacturing
 facilities on five continents and a global network of approved distributors,
 we
 seek to manage freight costs by reducing shipping distances and negotiating
 rates through local distributors. 

Replicated
 Grass Products 

We
 are
 developing working agreements with a small group of specialized manufacturers
 and suppliers of artificial turf and the drainage components used in our
 replicated grass business. Our purchases from manufacturers and suppliers are
 based on purchase orders versus long term contracts.

Sales
 and Marketing 

Geosynthetic
 Products and Services 

Our
 sales
 and marketing efforts for our geosynthetic products and related services are
 conducted on a worldwide basis and are generally coordinated by regional
 managers. These positions include one manager in the United States responsible
 for sales in North and Central America, one manager in South America, one
 manager in Germany responsible for Europe and Africa, one manager in Thailand
 responsible for Asia and one manager in Egypt responsible for the Middle East.
 Due to the technical nature of our sales, we support our sales force with an
 internal group of engineers that also serve as a direct resource for our
 customers engineers who require technical assistance. 

Our
 sales
 efforts generally include: (1) installation sales, consisting of products
 and installation services sold primarily to national accounts and general
 contractors, and (2) direct sales, consisting of product only (no
 installation services) sold primarily to non-national accounts and independent
 dealers. We sell primarily to general contractors, independent installers and
 facility owners who are responsible for product specifications and the design
 and awarding of contracts. 

We
 sell
 our products in a very competitive marketplace. Substantial quantities of our
 products are sold through the competitive bidding process, whether in the United
 States or in foreign countries. We bid directly to the general contractor or
 owner or to one of our independent distributors or independent installers.
 The
 customers bid proposals establish the design and performance criteria for the
 products. We negotiate the remainder of the contract terms where possible.
 In
 most cases, we agree to indemnify the site owner, general contractor and others
 for certain damages resulting from our negligence and that of our employees.
 When we install products, we are sometimes required to post bid and performance
 bonds or bank guarantees. In all cases, we provide our customers with limited
 material warranties on our products and limited installation warranties for
 our
 workmanship. Our limited installation warranties are typically one to five
 years
 but occasionally extend up to 20 years. These limited warranties are
 generally limited to repair or replacement of defective liners or workmanship,
 often on a prorated basis, up to the dollar amount of the original
 contract. 

In
 some
 foreign contracts, we may be required to provide the customer with specified
 contractual limited warranties as to material quality. Our product warranty
 liability in many foreign countries is dictated by local laws in addition to
 the
 warranty specified in the contracts. Several of our foreign subsidiaries sell
 products and installation services under competitively bid construction
 contracts. 

We
 participate in trade shows, conduct industry seminars and make presentations
 to
 governmental administrators. We strive to inform engineers and regulators of
 the
 benefits of using our products. Advertisements
 of our products appear regularly in specialized trade publications and on our
 website www.gseworld.com. 

Replicated
 Grass Products 

Our
 sales
 and marketing efforts for our replicated grass products and services are
 coordinated by our management team headquartered in Houston, Texas. This sales
 effort is supported by regional sales personnel located across the country.
 In
 addition, we use an external engineering firm to design the artificial sport
 surfaces and logo layouts and as a direct resource for our customers engineers
 who require technical assistance. 

We
 sell
 primarily to owners and general contractors and facility owners who are
 responsible for product specifications, design and awarding of contracts. In
 all
 cases, we provide our customers with limited warranties on installed products
 and workmanship. Our limited warranties are typically six (6) years but
 occasionally extend up to eight years. The limited warranties are generally
 limited to repair or replacement of defective artificial turf or workmanship,
 but sometimes sub-grade stability, on a prorated basis, up to the amount of
 the
 original contract. On occasion, the limited warranties are written on a
 non-prorated basis for a period of eight years. 

Environmental
 Legislation 

The
 enactment of numerous environmental laws and corresponding regulations has
 enhanced the market for our geosynthetic products. 

10 

In
 the
 United States, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended
 RCRA ), provides the legal framework for the storage, treatment and disposal
 of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Of particular importance to us has been
 the impact of Subtitle D of RCRA, which regulates the disposal of municipal
 solid waste MSW at roughly 2,300 U.S. landfills. State regulations adopted
 under this title impose stringent compliance standards with regard to
 groundwater protections, which is what our products are designed to provide.
 Subtitle D regulations specify the use of a composite liner system consisting
 of
 highly impermeable clay and a geomembrane liner. The liner must be at least
 30
 millimeters mils thick. In addition, amendments to RCRA require all new
 hazardous waste landfills to use liner systems composed of two or more liners,
 with leachate collection and drainage systems above and between the liners.
 These same amendments require double liners for surface impoundments or ponds
 used in the containment of certain hazardous liquids. 

Also
 of
 importance to our business, the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
 Compensation and Liability Act Superfund ), enacted in 1980, governs cleanup
 of abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. Our products are used in
 cleanup work at these sites. For example, the EPA has published a presumptive
 remedy requiring the use of a liner cap in closed municipal solid waste
 landfills. This liner cap is designed to prevent groundwater contamination
 and
 assist in the containment of subterranean liquid waste plumes. Our products
 have
 been installed in both applications in landfills located throughout the United
 States. 

On
 February 12, 2003, the EPA issued a final rule controlling wastewater discharges
 from Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations CAFOs under the Clean Water Act.
 The final rule amends federal regulations concerning the management of manure
 from these operations, which can cause serious acute and chronic water quality
 problems. There are an estimated 15,500 CAFOs producing 300 million tons of
 waste annually. Our liners may be used by CAFOs to come into compliance with
 wastewater requirements under state and federal law. 

In
 1993,
 the State of Florida published regulations requiring gypsum waste generated
 as a
 by-product of phosphate mining to be stored on composite liners with a synthetic
 component. Our liners meet the specifications set forth in the Florida
 regulations. 

Environmental
 laws and regulations in the United States, and in other countries, particularly
 in the European Community, Japan and the other North American and South American
 countries have increased the demand for our geosynthetic products. In
 particular, activities that have an impact on groundwater quality have been
 the
 subject of increasing scrutiny by regulators, and may be the subject of future
 changes to existing laws and regulations. These activities include agricultural
 irrigation, animal feedlots and compounds, aquaculture facilities, industrial
 storm water runoff containment areas, canals, mining leach pads and
 tunnels. 

Employees 

GSE
 had a
 total of 928 employees at December 31, 2006, with 558 employed in the United
 States. The size of the workforce increases during peak construction periods
 and
 decreases during the off-season construction periods. None of our regular
 year-round employees are unionized. From time to time, however, we have entered
 into site-specific collective bargaining agreements with unions that apply
 to
 specific projects. We believe our employee relations are
 satisfactory. 

Patents
 and Proprietary Information 

We
 have
 received patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office US PTO for our
 GSE White, GSE Conductive and GSE CurtainWall products, as well as our
 FrictionFlex texturing process. Some of these patents are either registered
 or
 in the process of being registered in select foreign countries. We have
 registered our trademark and logo with the US PTO and have registered this
 trademark in select foreign countries. We have other patents, pending
 applications, and license rights involved with storm water detention systems
 and
 artificial turf for sport fields, including patent applications and
 continuations in part for artificial turf systems. We manufacture GundSeal,
 Bentofix and smooth-edged textured sheet pursuant to patent license agreements.
 We construct and install GeoStorage storm water detention systems pursuant
 to a
 patent license agreement. Although in the aggregate our patents are important
 in
 the operation of our businesses, we do not believe the loss, by expiration
 or
 otherwise, of any one patent or group of patents would materially affect our
 business. 

11 

Customers 

Geosynthetic
 Products and Related Services 

The
 primary customers for the Company s geosynthetic products are domestic and
 international, municipal and private companies engaged in waste management,
 mining, water control and wastewater treatment, aquaculture and agriculture,
 and
 other industrial activities, including the engineering and civil works
 construction companies serving these customers. The Company is a full service
 organization that strives to provide its customers with a single source of
 geomembrane liners, related products and services for environmental protection
 and other uses. 

In
 connection with the acquisition of Serrot International, Inc., we entered into
 a
 Supply Commitment Agreement (the Supply Agreement with Waste Management Inc.
 on February 4, 2002. The Supply Agreement terminated on December 31, 2006.
 Under
 the Supply Agreement, Waste Management committed to purchase a minimum
 dollar amount of geosynthetic lining systems from the Company. If Waste
 Management failed to purchase its minimum amount in a given year, the
 shortfall would carry forward to the next calendar year. The Supply Agreement
 shortfall amounts from all years including the final year, 2006, have been
 agreed between the two parties. 

In
 February 2007, the Supply Agreement was replaced with a Master Geosynthetic
 Purchase Agreement and a Master Geosynthetic Construction Agreement (the Master
 Agreements ), with Waste Management National Services Inc. WMNSI both of
 which are for terms of two years and will terminate on December 31, 2008,
 subject to the option by WMNSI and us by mutual agreement to extend either
 of
 the Master Agreements for a one-year period with 90 days written notice prior
 to
 the expiration of the current term, up to a maximum of three times. The Master
 Agreements provide that either party may terminate either of the Master
 Agreements on 90 days written notice, with or without cause, with each party
 committed to fulfilling existing purchase orders. The reasons for termination
 of
 the Master Agreements for cause include the failure to supply enough properly
 skilled workers or the quantity of products required in a timely manner. We
 have
 30 days to cure any breach of the Master Agreements prior to termination. The
 Master Agreements do not provide for a commitment to purchase a minimum dollar
 amount of geosynthetic lining systems from us. 

For
 the
 years 2006, 2005, and 2004, Waste Management accounted for 13 , 13 and 20 ,
 respectively, of our sales and operating revenues. Under the Master Agreements,
 we expect to receive significantly less revenues and gross profit for 2007
 as
 compared to 2006. To mitigate the impact of this change in business with Waste
 Management, we are pursuing other business, including our newly acquired
 replicated grass technology business and storm water retention business, as
 well
 as reducing the current cost structure. Based on the terms of the new business
 relationship with Waste Management, we believe that the loss of Waste Management
 as a customer under the Master Agreements would not have a material adverse
 effect on our expected results of operations for 2007. 

Replicated
 Grass Products 

The
 primary customers for replicated grass sport fields are municipal, schools,
 colleges and private owners and operators of soccer and football field
 complexes. We strive to provide these customers with a single source of
 artificial turf, related products and installation services. 

Backlog 

As
 of
 December 31, 2006, our backlog was 68.0 million compared to 51.9 million
 at
 December 31, 2005. We anticipate that the majority of the value of construction
 contracts and customer purchase orders included in backlog at December 31,
 2006
 is expected to be completed or filled prior to the end of 2007, subject to
 weather and other construction related delays. Contracts and commitments for
 products and services are occasionally varied, modified, or cancelled by mutual
 consent. 

12 

Seasonality
 and Other Business Conditions 

Geosynthetic
 Products 

The
 greatest volume of geosynthetic product deliveries and installations typically
 occur during the summer and fall, which results in seasonal fluctuations of
 revenue. Often, scheduled deliveries are subject to delays at the customers 
requests to correspond with customers annual budgetary and permitting cycles.
 We use our manufacturing capacity at our various locations in an attempt to
 mitigate the impact of seasonal fluctuation on its manufacturing, delivery,
 and
 installation schedules. 

Replicated
 Grass Products 

We
 provide the greatest volume of our replicated grass products and services
 in the
 summer months because adverse weather conditions in the northern states
 negatively impact our ability to provide products and services with respect
 to
 outdoor fields in those states. In addition, our customers, which include
 municipalities, schools and colleges, typically use the fields for athletic
 events in the fall and spring. 

Competition 

Geosynthetic
 Products and Services 

We
 believe there are approximately 30 companies engaged in the production of
 various synthetic geomembranes worldwide. These companies offer the same or
 similar wide range of products that we offer .
 Our
 competition is not limited to those companies that manufacture polyethylene
 and
 polypropylene lining products, but also encompasses companies offering polyvinyl
 chloride PVC ), scrim-reinforced chlorosulphonated polyethylene Hypalon products and ethylene propylene diene terpolymer EPDM geomembranes. The
 principal resin types used in our products sold are high-density polyethylene
 and linear low density polyethylene. At least three other companies
 manufacturing HDPE liners compete directly with us in North
 America. 

We
 encounter competition in our other product lines in the United States with
 one
 company competing in the sale of geosynthetic clay liners. In the drainage
 net
 market, six companies offer products that directly compete with our geonet
 product line. 

Competition
 is based on the performance of the lining systems, installation capabilities,
 quality and pricing. Pricing remains very competitive with excess capacity
 in
 the industry impacting margins. We believe we compete successfully because
 we
 manufacture, sell and install a wide range of high quality, cost effective
 products and services, and because of our strategically located manufacturing
 facilities. 

Forward-Looking
 Information 

This
 Form
 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private
 Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and information relating to us and
 our
 subsidiaries that are based on beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions
 made by and information currently available to our management. When used in
 this
 report, the words, anticipate , believe , estimate , expect , intend and
 words of similar importance, as they relate to us or our subsidiaries or our

13 

Available
 Information 

We,
 through our website www.gseworld.com ,
 make
 available free of charge our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K (and amendments
 to these reports) filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(c) or 15(d) of
 the
 Exchange Act. These reports are available on our website as soon as reasonably
 practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the U.S.
 Securities and Exchange Commission. 

ITEM
 1A. Risk Factors. 

Holders
 and potential investors in our securities should carefully consider the
 following risk factors in addition to other information in this Form 10-K.
 We
 are identifying these risk factors as important factors that could cause our
 actual results to differ materially from those contained in any written or
 oral
 forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us. We are relying upon
 the
 safe-harbor for forward-looking statements and any such statements made by
 or on
 behalf of us are qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements,
 as well as those set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 

If
 we are unable to obtain our raw materials at favorable prices, it could
 adversely impact our financial condition. 

Pricing
 for our products and services is primarily driven by worldwide manufacturing
 capacity in the industry and by raw material costs. The price of raw materials
 is important to our operating results. In 2006, materials expense represented
 approximately 81 of our cost of sales. Our principal raw material, polyethylene
 resins, is occasionally in short supply and subject to substantial price
 fluctuation in response to market demand and the price of feed stocks, including
 natural gas. Generally, we do not enter into purchase contracts for the future
 delivery of raw materials, and, accordingly, our suppliers may change their
 prices and other purchase terms at any time. If raw materials prices increase,
 we may not be able to pass on such increases to our customers under our
 contracts. Also, as discussed elsewhere in this "Risk Factors" section, we
 compete with companies that manufacture products using raw materials different
 from ours and if we experience an increase in the price of our raw materials
 or
 an interruption in the supply of our raw materials, our competitors would not
 necessarily suffer the same price increases or supply interruption. A
 significant increase in the industry's worldwide manufacturing capacity,
 material interruption in raw material supply or electricity supply, or raw
 material price increases could have a material adverse effect upon our financial
 position, results of operations and/or cash flows. 

We
 may experience material decline in volumes and gross margins from the largest
 customer, Waste Management. 

In
 2006,
 Waste Management was our largest customer, accounting for approximately 13 
 of
 sales and operating revenue. As discussed in Item 1. Business-Customers, the
 Supply Contract expired on December 31, 2006, and we entered into the Master
 Agreements with WMNSI, which will reduce the volume of business as well as
 the
 profitability of Waste Management commitments in 2007. We believe that the
 significant reduction in revenue and gross margin from Waste Management will
 have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
 and/or cash flows if not offset by other new business opportunities or organic
 growth. To mitigate the impact of this change in business with Waste Management,
 we are pursuing other business, including our newly acquired replicated grass
 technology business and storm water retention business, as well as reducing
 the
 current cost structure. 

We
 generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers, and our customers
 generally may terminate their relationship with us at any
 time. 

Except
 for the Master Agreements with WMNSI, our contracts are entered into on a
 project-by-project basis, and our customers do not have ongoing contractual
 obligations to purchase anything from us. If a significant number of our
 customers choose to terminate their contracts or to not enter into new contracts
 with us, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
 position, results of operations and/or cash flows. In addition, for similar
 reasons, our contract backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales,
 and
 the estimated size of any contract is not necessarily indicative of the
 profitability of that contract. 

14 

Our
 profitability is subject to inherent risks because of the fixed nature of almost
 all of our contracts. 

Substantially
 all of our customer contracts, particularly our installation contracts, are
 fixed-price contracts with commencement of performance dates spread throughout
 the year. Under a fixed-price contract, the customer agrees to pay a specified
 price for our performance of the entire contract. Fixed-price contracts carry
 inherent risks, including risks of losses from underestimating costs,
 operational difficulties and other changes that may occur over the contract
 period. Also, inclement or hazardous weather conditions can result in
 substantial delays in installation and additional expenses. Due to these
 factors, it is possible that we will not be able to perform our obligations
 under fixed price contracts without incurring additional expenses that we are
 unable to pass through to our customers. If we were to significantly
 underestimate the cost of one or more significant contracts (including as a
 result of subsequent increases in resin prices) or experience greater expenses
 than anticipated at the time of contracting, the resulting losses could have
 a
 material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or
 cash flows. 

We
 operate in a highly competitive industry. 

We
 sell
 our products in a very competitive marketplace. The principal resin types that
 we use in our products are high-density polyethylene and linear low density
 polyethylene. We compete both with companies that use the same raw materials
 that we do and with companies that use different raw materials. Additionally,
 companies that manufacture geosynthetic products who are not currently competing
 with us may decide to do so in the future. Competition is based on product
 performance, installation capability, quality and pricing. Pricing remains
 very
 competitive with excess capacity in the industry impacting margins. Moreover,
 our current and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial
 resources, name recognition, research and development, marketing and human
 resources than we have. In addition, our competitors may succeed in developing
 new or enhanced products that are better than our products. These companies
 may
 also prove to be more successful than we are in marketing and selling these
 products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully
 with
 any of these companies. Increased competition as to any of our products could
 result in price reduction, reduced margins and loss of market share, which
 could
 negatively affect our business, prospects, financial position, results of
 operations and/or cash flows. 

We
 are subject to certain risks associated with our foreign operations that could
 harm our revenues and profitability. 

We
 have
 significant operations in Europe, Canada, Thailand, Chile and Egypt. Certain
 risks are inherent in international operations, including: 

-> difficulty
 of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign
 legal
 systems; 

-> foreign
 customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the United
 States; 

-> tax
 rates
 in certain foreign countries may exceed those in the United States and foreign
 earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of
 tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; 

-> general
 economic conditions, political unrest and terrorist s attacks in countries where
 we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those
 countries; 

-> exposure
 to possible expropriation or other governmental actions; 

-> difficulties
 associated with managing a large organization spread throughout various
 countries; 

-> import
 and export license requirements; 

-> changes
 in tariffs and taxes; 

-> restrictions
 on repatriating foreign profits back to the United States; 

-> intellectual
 property protection difficulties; and 

-> complications
 in complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, many of which
 conflict with U.S. laws. 

15 

In
 addition, foreign operations involve uncertainties arising from local business
 practices, cultural considerations and international political and trade
 tensions. As we continue to expand our business globally, our success will
 be
 dependent, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these
 and other risks. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage effectively
 these risks or that these and other factors will not have a material adverse
 effect on our international operations or our business, financial position,
 results of operations and/or cash flows. 

Currency
 exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our revenues and
 financial results. 

We
 generate a significant portion of our revenues, and incur a significant portion
 of our expenses, in currencies other than U.S. dollars. To the extent that
 we
 are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid
 in
 the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have
 an
 adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. During times of
 a
 strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported sales from the international operations
 will be reduced because the applicable local currency will be translated into
 fewer U.S. dollars. 

The
 costs and difficulties of acquiring and integrating complementary businesses
 and
 technologies could impede our future growth and adversely affect our
 competitiveness. 

As
 part
 of our growth strategy, we intend to consider acquiring complementary
 businesses. Our ProGreen asset acquisition in October 2006 was consistent with
 this growth strategy. Currently, we do not have any other commitments or
 agreements relating to any material acquisitions. Future acquisitions could
 result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, which could have
 a
 material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results
 of
 operations. Risks we could face with respect to acquisitions
 include: 

-> greater
 than expected costs and management time and effort involved in identifying,
 completing and integrating acquisitions; 

-> risks
 associated with unanticipated events or liabilities; 

-> potential
 disruption of our ongoing business and difficulty in maintaining our standards,
 controls, information systems and procedures; 

-> entering
 into markets and acquiring technologies in areas in which we have little
 experience; 

-> the
 inability to successfully integrate the services, products and personnel of
 any
 acquisition into our operations; 

-> a
 need to
 incur debt, which may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses;
 and 

-> realizing
 little, if any, return on our investment. 

If
 we are unable to retain key executives and other personnel, our growth may
 be
 hindered. 

Our
 success will largely depend on maintaining our staff of qualified professionals.
 The market for qualified professionals is competitive, and we may not continue
 to be successful in our efforts to attract and retain these professionals.
 In
 particular, our senior executives have considerable industry experience and
 would be difficult to replace. Our future operations therefore could be harmed
 if any of our senior executives or other key personnel ceased working for us.
 Our future operations could also be harmed if we are unable to attract, hire,
 train and retain qualified managerial, sales, installation and marketing
 personnel. 

Our
 product deliveries and installations may fluctuate due to seasonality and other
 factors that may adversely affect the financial results and cash
 flows. 

The
 greatest volume of geosynthetic product deliveries and installations typically
 occur during the summer and fall, which results in seasonal fluctuations of
 revenue. Often, scheduled deliveries are subject to delays at the customers'
 requests to correspond with customers' annual budgetary and permitting cycles.
 We may not be able to use our manufacturing capacity at our various locations
 to
 mitigate the impact of seasonal fluctuation on our manufacturing, delivery
 and
 installation schedules. Substantial fluctuations in our operations could
 significantly limit our cash flow and therefore our ability to service our debt,
 including the senior notes. 

16 

Product
 liability and indemnification claims could have a material adverse effect on
 our
 operating results. Our ability to maintain insurance may be limited, and our
 coverage limits may not be sufficient for all claims. 

Our
 products are used in, among other things, containment systems for the prevention
 of groundwater contamination. Our products are also used in significant public
 works projects. Accordingly, we face an inherent business risk of exposure
 to
 product liability claims (including claims for strict liability and negligence)
 and claims for breach of contract in the event that the failure of our products
 or our installation services results, or is alleged to result, in property
 damage, damage to the environment and/or personal injury. We agree in most
 cases
 to indemnify the site owner, general contractor and others for certain damages
 resulting from our negligence and that of our employees. We cannot assure you
 that we will not incur significant costs to defend product liability and breach
 of contract claims or that we will not experience any material product liability
 losses or indemnification obligations in the future. Such costs, losses and
 obligations may have a material adverse impact on our financial position,
 results of operations and/or cash flows. 

Although
 we maintain insurance within ranges of coverage consistent with industry
 practice, this insurance may not be available at economically feasible premiums
 and may not be sufficient to cover all such losses. Our insurance policies
 are
 subject to large deductibles. The outcome of legal actions and claims against
 us
 or that are otherwise incidental to our business may have a material adverse
 impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
 flows. 

We
 may experience significant warranty claims. 

We
 provide our customers of our geosynthetic products and related services with
 limited material warranties on our products and limited installation warranties
 for our workmanship. Our
 limited installation warranties are typically 1 to 5 years but occasionally
 extend up to 20 years. Our product warranties are typically 5 years
 but occasionally extend up to 20 years. These limited warranties are
 generally limited to repair or replacement of defective products or workmanship,
 often on a prorated basis, up to the dollar amount of the original contract.
 In
 some foreign contracts, we may be required to provide the customer with
 specified contractual limited warranties as to material quality. Our product
 warranty liability in many foreign countries is dictated by local laws in
 addition to the warranty specified in the contracts. Several of our foreign
 subsidiaries sell products and installation services under competitively bid
 construction contracts. 
 Significant warranty claims could have a material adverse effect on our
 financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. 

A
 downturn in either the economy generally or the development of landfills in
 particular would negatively impact our business. 

Our
 primary business depends on a growing economy to stimulate demand for the types
 of projects in which our products are installed. In particular, a substantial
 portion of our business depends on the continued development of landfills.
 Landfill development could slow due to a general economic downturn, a change
 in
 laws and regulations regarding the development of landfills or from other
 factors. A downturn in the economy or any other development that adversely
 impacts the development of landfills could adversely impact our financial
 position, results of operations and/or cash flows. 

Regulatory
 and technological changes may adversely affect us. 

Changes
 in legislative, regulatory or industry requirements or competitive technologies
 may render certain of our products obsolete. Our ability to anticipate changes
 in regulatory and technology standards and to develop and introduce new and
 enhanced products in response to these changes may significantly impact our
 ability to grow and to remain competitive. For example, certain existing laws
 and regulations in the United States and foreign countries require developers
 of
 landfills and other handlers of certain waste to prevent groundwater
 contamination in a manner that our products are currently designed to provide.
 Changes in such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on
 our
 financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows if new requirements
 were not satisfied by our products. Also, a reduction in the enforcement of
 such
 laws and regulations could also materially adversely affect our financial
 position, results of operations and/or cash flows. We are also subject to the
 risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications,
 including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development and failure
 of products to operate properly. We cannot assure you that we will be able
 to
 achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain
 competitive or that certain of our products will not become
 obsolete. 

17 

We
 may be adversely affected by environmental and safety regulations to which
 we
 are subject. 

We
 are
 required to comply with federal, state, local and foreign laws governing the
 protection of the environment, the exposure of persons and property to hazardous
 substances and occupational health and safety. These laws regulate, among other
 things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous
 materials; the disposal of wastes and other substances into soil, air or water;
 and our obligations relating to the health and safety of our workers and the
 public. We are also required to obtain and comply with environmental permits
 for
 certain operations. We cannot assure you that we are at all times in complete
 compliance with all environmental laws and permits. If we violate or fail to
 comply with these requirements, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned.
 In
 some instances, such a fine or sanction could be material and could include
 monetary penalties or the shut-down of a facility. Certain environmental
 requirements, and the interpretation of those requirements by regulators and
 courts, might also become more stringent over time. We therefore cannot assure
 you that we will not incur material environmental costs or liabilities in the
 future. We have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures
 to
 comply with environmental requirements. Because of the nature of our business,
 changes in environmental laws could have a material detrimental effect on our
 business. 

We
 are
 also subject to laws governing the cleanup of contaminated property. Under
 these
 laws, we could be held liable for costs and damages relating to contamination
 of
 our past or present facilities and at third party sites to which our facilities
 sent wastes or hazardous substances. The amount of such liability could be
 material. We cannot assure you that we will not have liability for such
 contamination, nor can we assure you that we will not experience an accident
 or
 become liable for any other contamination that may have occurred in the past
 (including such liability to buyers of properties or businesses that we have
 sold). 

Our
 substantial level of indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our
 financial condition. 

We
 have a
 substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding
 approximately 179.9 million of total indebtedness, including approximately
 29.6 million of secured indebtedness. The high level of indebtedness could
 have
 important consequences to you, including the following: 

-> it
 may be
 more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the senior
 notes; 

-> our
 ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital
 expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be
 impaired; 

-> we
 must
 use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest
 and
 principal on the senior notes and other indebtedness, which will reduce the
 funds available to us for other purposes such as capital
 expenditures; 

-> we
 may be
 limited in our ability to borrow additional funds; 

-> we
 may be
 limited in our ability to obtain bonds needed to bid on or perform certain
 installation contracts; 

-> we
 may
 have a higher level of indebtedness than some of our competitors, which may
 put
 us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in planning for,
 or
 responding to, changing conditions in our industry, including increased
 competition; and 

-> we
 may be
 more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our
 business. 

We
 expect
 to utilize cash flow from our operations to pay our expenses and to pay the
 principal and interest on our debt. Our ability to meet our expenses thus
 depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial,
 business, economic and other factors. We will not be able to control many of
 these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate
 and
 pressure from competitors. We cannot be certain that our cash flow will be
 sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness,
 including the senior notes, and meet our other obligations. If we do not have
 enough liquidity, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing
 debt, including the senior notes, sell assets or borrow more money. We cannot
 guarantee that we will be able to do so on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
 In
 addition, the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our
 senior credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes, may
 restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives. 

18 

The
 indenture governing the senior notes and the agreements governing our other
 indebtedness, including our senior credit facility, impose significant operating
 and financial restrictions, which may limit our ability to make payments on
 the
 senior notes or prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and
 taking certain corporate actions. 

The
 indenture governing the senior notes and the agreements governing our other
 indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us.
 These restrictions limit our ability to take certain actions including our
 ability to: 

-> incur
 additional indebtedness; 

-> create
 liens or other encumbrances; 

-> pay
 dividends or make certain other payments, investments, loans and guarantees;
 and 

-> sell
 or
 otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with another
 entity. 

In
 addition, our senior credit facility requires us to meet certain financial
 ratios and financial condition tests. For more information, see Item 7. -
 Liquidity and Capital Resources - Borrowing Arrangements . Events beyond our
 control can affect our ability to meet these financial ratios and financial
 condition tests. Our failure to comply with these obligations could cause an
 event of default under our senior credit facility. If an event of default
 occurs, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding, including
 accrued and unpaid interest, under our senior credit facility to be immediately
 due, and the lenders could foreclose upon the assets securing our senior credit
 facility. In that event, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient
 assets to repay all of our obligations, including the senior notes.

We
 may not be able to satisfy our obligations to the holders of the senior notes
 upon a change of control. 

Upon
 the
 occurrence of a "change of control" (as defined in the indenture governing
 the
 senior notes) each holder of the senior notes will have the right to require
 us
 to repurchase the outstanding senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the
 principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated
 damages, if any, to the date of repurchase. Our failure to purchase, or give
 notice of purchase of, the senior notes would be a default under the indenture
 governing the senior notes, which would in turn be a default under our senior
 credit facility. 

If
 a
 change of control occurs, it is possible that we may not have sufficient assets
 at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of senior
 notes or to satisfy all obligations under our senior credit facility and the
 indenture governing the senior notes. In order to satisfy our obligations,
 we
 could seek to refinance the indebtedness under our senior credit facility and
 the indenture governing the senior notes or obtain a waiver from the lenders
 or
 holders of the senior notes. We cannot assure you that we would be able to
 obtain a waiver or refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, if
 at
 all. 

The
 principal stockholder of GEO Holdings controls us and could delay, deter or
 prevent a change of control or other business combination or otherwise cause
 us
 to take actions with which you as a holder of senior notes may disagree or
 which
 might not be in your best interests. 

We
 are a
 wholly-owned subsidiary of GEO Holdings. CHS IV owns substantially all of the
 issued and outstanding common stock of GEO Holdings, and members of our senior
 management hold options exercisable for approximately 10 of the common stock
 of
 GEO Holdings, determined on a fully-diluted basis. Pursuant to the Stockholders
 Agreement that GEO Holdings entered into with CHS IV, certain co-investors
 and
 certain members of our senior management, CHS IV has the right to appoint up
 to
 three of GEO Holdings' four directors. GEO Holdings has the ability to elect
 all
 of the members of our board of directors, appoint new management and approve
 any
 action requiring the approval of our stockholders. The directors have the
 authority to make decisions affecting our capital structure, including the
 issuance of additional indebtedness and the declaration of dividends. In
 addition, transactions may be pursued that could enhance the investment of
 the
 holders of GEO Holdings equity while involving risks to your interests. It
 is
 possible that the holders of GEO Holdings equity will exercise control over
 us
 in a manner that is adverse to the interests of the holders of the senior notes.

 3. Legal Proceedings. 

The
 Company was a third-party defendant in a lawsuit that was filed in September
 1997 in the Supreme Court of New York, County of Richmond (Mario Cicala v.
 Interstate Industrial Corporation, Stearns, Conrad and Schmidt Consulting
 Engineers, Inc., Interstate Industrial Corporation v. Gundle Lining Construction
 Corp. and Gundle Lining Construction Corp. v. The City of New York; Case No.
 13076/97). The plaintiff, Mario Cicala, was a Company employee who slipped
 and
 fell at a job site and brought a claim against the primary defendants for
 20,000,000. On July 19, 2006, the defendants compromised and settled the
 plaintiff s personal injury damage claim for 1.4 million and waiver of worker s
 compensation subrogation rights. The Company paid 900,000 of the settlement
 cost, none of which was reimbursed by its insurance carrier, Reliance National
 Insurance in Liquidation. The Texas Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty
 Association and New York Liquidation Bureau contributed 350,000 to the
 settlement, along with 150,000 from Interstate Industrial Corp. The Company
 recorded a charge of 900,000 in the second quarter of 2006 to reflect the
 settlement of the Cicala lawsuit. 

On
 January 14, 2004, the Company received a letter from Shire Equipment Leasing
 Corporation Shire (Defendant, along with Robert Steinberg, as trustee for
 the bankruptcy estate of Pro Air, Inc.) relating to litigation instituted by
 Wembley Ltd., the Company s largest stockholder prior to the Merger. In the
 litigation, Wembley is seeking a declaratory judgment that neither Pro Air,
 Inc., nor Shire, Pro Air s Assignee, ever acquired an ownership interest in
 1,100,000 shares of the Company owned by Wembley. The dispute relates to
 Wembley s delivery to Pro Air in 1997 of a stock certificate representing the
 disputed shares along with an assignment of stock, or stock power, which
 provided that the assignment of the Company s shares was valid only if done in
 compliance with certain specified conditions. The parties disagree as to whether
 those conditions were met. In April 1998, Pro Air asked the Company to reflect
 Pro Air on the Company s books as the holder of record of the disputed shares,
 but the Company declined to do so, informing Pro Air that it had no record
 of
 Pro Air being a Company shareholder. Shire indicated in its January 2004 letter
 that it would pursue claims against the Company if testimony revealed that
 the
 Company acted in concert with Wembley to prevent the transfer of the disputed
 shares. 

21 

On
 December 16, 2004, Wembley prevailed in its declaratory judgment action with
 the
 issuance of a judgment that neither Pro Air nor Shire, Pro Air s assignee, ever
 acquired an ownership interest in the 1,100,000 shares. Shire has filed an
 appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and Wembley has filed a cross
 appeal. On April 20, 2005, the trial court granted Shire s motion to stay
 execution of the judgment. 

On
 March
 1, 2007, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court s
 declaration that International Technology Investment Group, LTD., whose
 shareholders also own Wembley, is the rightful owner of the
 1,100,000 shares of Gundle/SLT Environmental, Inc. common stock under the
 1997
 Stock Subscription Agreement. The appellants have 90 days from the date of
 entry
 of the judgment to appeal the appellate court s judgment. 

The
 Company believes that this dispute is between Wembley and Shire. Accordingly,
 if
 a claim is asserted against the Company, the Company intends to defend itself
 vigorously. 

We
 are
 also a party to various other legal actions arising in the ordinary course
 of
 our business. These legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning
 our
 entire business. As of the date of this filing, we believe it is not reasonably
 possible that resolution of these legal actions will, individually or in the
 aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results
 of operations.

 In connection with the Merger, we became a wholly owned subsidiary of GEO
 Holdings, which is controlled by CHS IV, an entity controlled by CHS, in a
 transaction valued at approximately 242.1 million. (See Item 1. Business-
 Corporate Developments .) As a result of the Merger, our common stock is no
 longer publicly traded. 

We
 do not
 currently intend to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. Further,
 our
 ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain covenants contained in our
 senior credit facility, as well as certain restrictions contained in the
 indenture governing our senior notes. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and
 Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and

 6. Selected Financial Data. 

The
 acquisition of GSE by CHS IV on May 18, 2004 was accounted for as a purchase
 in
 accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 141,
 Business
 Combinations , 
 resulting in a new basis of accounting subsequent to the transaction. Therefore,
 for the presentation in the following table and in the remainder of this report,
 financial information relating to GSE prior to Merger is denoted as Predecessor

ITEM
 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
 Operations . 

The
 following discussion of the historical financial condition and results of
 operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
 statements and the notes thereto which appear in this report. 

Overview 

We
 are a
 leading manufacturer, marketer and installer of a broad array of geosynthetic
 lining products and a high volume producer of resin-based products made
 primarily from polyethylene resins. Our primary products consist of geosynthetic
 lining materials of membranes, drainage nets and composites, textiles, and
 clay
 liners. We sell installation of our products in the United States and Germany.
 We discontinued installation of our products in the United Kingdom as of
 December 22, 2006 due to competitive pressures on margins and the actions of
 national waste companies in contracting for installation services. Approximately
 21 of our geosynthetic products are installed by us with the balance installed
 by independent installers. 

The
 demand for our geosynthetic products is driven by municipal and private solid
 waste landfill development where environmental regulations require our liner
 products. Solid waste containment represented 53 of the Company s revenues in
 2006 and 56 of revenues in 2005. Factors influencing these regulations include
 population growth, migration trends, solid waste per capita, environmental
 concerns of developing countries, and disposing methods. The solid waste
 containment market (in the geographic areas of our business) continues to grow
 approximately 2 to 4 per year. Other demands for our products are heap leach
 mining of metals, water management, agriculture, aquaculture, and other
 industrial applications. Growth in these markets is more cyclical to their
 industry. 

Raw
 material cost of our products makes up approximately 81 of our product cost.
 The cost of these raw materials change due to factors outside our control,
 including worldwide capacity, market demand, and the price of feed stocks such
 as natural gas and oil. Our profitability depends on our ability to change
 our
 product prices as raw material costs change, which we have historically been
 able to do. Our profitability is also influenced by competitive pressures.
 While
 we supply 40 to 50 of the world s geosynthetic products, most of our
 competitors are regional, family-owned businesses that bid for business along
 with us in their areas. 

23 

We
 faced
 many challenges in 2006, but despite those challenges we were successful in
 modestly increasing 2006 gross profit compared with 2005. Continued competitive
 pressures due to worldwide over capacity were felt in the European markets.
 Raw
 material costs were volatile throughout the year, with a slight decrease in
 resin prices in the fourth quarter. Increased volumes resulting from major
 projects in international markets improved the utilization of our production
 facilities compared with the prior year. Gross margins also improved in
 international markets from mining projects in South America, aquaculture
 projects in Asia and improved margins on European installation services. The
 U.S. also had increased shipments and installation services for national solid
 waste customers. 

The
 Merger 

Code
 Hennessy Simmons IV LP CHS IV formed GEO Holdings Corp. GEO
 Holdings to acquire all of the equity interests of the Company. On May 18,
 2004, GEO Sub Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of GEO Holdings, merged with
 and
 into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger (the Merger ). Each
 share of the Company common stock converted into the right to receive 18.50,
 in
 cash, in a transaction valued at approximately 242.1 million. As a result
 of
 the Merger, all of the outstanding capital stock of the Company is owned by
 GEO
 Holdings. CHS IV is an entity controlled by Code Hennessy Simmons LLC
 CHS ). 

In
 connection with the Merger, we entered into a 65.0 million senior secured
 credit facility with UBS Loan Finance LLC and certain other lenders. The senior
 credit facility provides for a 25.0 million term loan facility and a revolving
 credit facility up to 40.0 million. In addition, we issued 150.0 million
 of
 publicly registered 11 senior notes due in 2012. The senior notes are
 guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct or indirect domestic
 subsidiaries other than Bentofix Technologies (USA), Inc., a dormant subsidiary
 of our 75.5 -owned Canadian subsidiary, Bentofix Technologies,
 Inc. 

On
 December 30, 2005, we completed the acquisition of the operating assets of
 SL
 Limitada, (SL), a privately owned company located in Santiago and Antofagasta,
 Chile. The acquisition was completed pursuant to an asset purchase agreement
 for
 a total purchase price of 15.5 million plus a separate agreement for the
 purchase of the raw material and finished goods inventory which we valued at
 2.1 million. The transaction was financed with cash and a 4.5 million seller
 note payable over a five-year period. 

On
 January 18, 2006, GSE International (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company)
 entered into a share purchase agreement with Naue GmbH CO KG Naue to
 acquire all the issued and outstanding shares Naue held in the capital of
 Bentofix Technologies, Inc. for 2,400,000 CDN 2,066,649 US). The purchase
 of
 these shares increased the Company s ownership percentage in Bentofix
 Technologies from 51 to 75.5 . 

On
 August
 31, 2006, we acquired the rights to commercialize the storm water detention
 system owned by GeoStorage Corporation under an assignment of U.S. Patent
 Application Serial No. 11/190.629. We entered into a Technology and Patent
 Rights Agreement, along with an Employment Agreement, with Terrance G. Sheridan,
 President of GeoStorage Corporation. The Technology and Patent Rights Agreement
 requires the payment of a per cubic foot royalty payment for any covered
 system as defined in the agreement. 

On
 October 13, 2006, we completed an acquisition of the operation assets, patent
 and other intangible assets of ProGreen. The acquisition was completed pursuant
 to an asset purchase agreement for a total purchase price of 4,712,000,
 which
 included transaction costs of 151,000. The transaction was payable in cash
 and
 a 2.7 million three-year unsecured promissory note. 

The
 Merger and SL and ProGreen asset acquisitions were accounted for under the
 purchase method of accounting. Under purchase accounting, the purchase price
 was
 allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and
 liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, with the remainder
 allocated to goodwill. The increase in basis of the assets will result in
 non-cash charges in future periods, principally related to the step-up in the
 value of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets. The results
 of operations from the businesses acquired in the SL and ProGreen transactions
 are included in our historical financial information contained herein from
 their
 respective dates of acquisition.

The
 Company s worldwide sales and operating revenue of 373,318,000 increased by
 55,700,000, or 17.5 in 2006 from 317,618,000 reported in 2005. Product prices
 were up 9.2 and units shipped were up 7.7 . Units installed decreased 4.2 
 from
 the 2005 year. At December 31, 2006, the backlog of 68.0 million was 31.1 
 higher than at December 31, 2005. 

U.S.
 sales and operating revenue of 184,350,000 for 2006 was 14.3 higher than
 the
 previous year. The increase in revenues was due to a 12.4 increase in sales
 prices, resulting from higher raw material costs, while shipments were 1.6 
 higher compared with 2005. U.S. installation revenue, recognized on a cost
 percentage-of-completion basis, in 2006 was 8.3 higher than the prior year
 while installed units were down 2.7 from the prior year. 

Foreign
 sales and operating revenue were 188,968,000 in 2006, a 20.9 increase from
 the
 prior year. This increase included revenues from the Chilean acquisition of
 23,785,000. Excluding the Chilean acquisition, foreign revenues increased
 5.7 
 over the prior year Foreign units shipped increased by 12.7 and units installed
 decreased by 14.1 in 2006 over 2005. The UK installation services
 were discontinued as of December 22, 2006 due to competitive pressures on
 margins and the actions of national waste companies in contracting for
 installation services. Foreign installation revenue in Europe, recognized on
 a
 cost percentage-of-completion basis, increased 22.5 in 2006 due to an increase
 of 42.6 in sales per unit. The change in the U.S. dollar value of the Company s
 foreign entity functional currencies also increased 2006 foreign sales and
 operating revenue by approximately 2,504,000. 

Gross
 profit in 2006 was 56,902,000 compared with 56,351,000 in 2005. Gross profit
 as a percentage of sales and operating revenue declined to 15.2 from 17.7 
 last
 year. U.S. gross profit for 2006 was 4.8 lower than 2005 primarily due to
 lower
 dollar per unit margins. Despite lower shipments in Europe, gross profit from
 foreign operations in 2006 was 6.5 higher than 2005. Lower shipments in Europe
 were partially offset by gross profit from the acquired Chilean operations.
 During the summer of 2006, raw material cost increased significantly and because
 of the world-wide competitive environment, the Company was unable to raise
 sales
 prices soon enough to match the increase in raw material cost. Change in U.S.
 dollar value of functional currencies increased 2006 gross profit by
 approximately 618,000. 

Selling,
 general and administrative SG A expenses of 31,313,000 in 2006
 increased 1,740,000 over the 2005 year. Contributing to the increase was
 1,714,000 of expenses related to the acquired Chilean operations, a 900,000
 legal charge in connection with the settlement of the Cicala lawsuit, a one-time
 stock option compensation charge and severance expenses. These increases were
 partially offset by other expenses including other legal costs, bad debt
 expense, and incentive plan costs. Changes in the U.S. dollar value of the
 Company s foreign entity functional currencies also increased SG A by
 approximately 163,000. 

25 

Amortization
 of intangible expense increased 23 to 5,837,000 primarily due to intangible
 assets acquired in the Chilean acquisition. Minority interest expense decreased
 by 310,000 to 187,000 as a result of the Company s increased ownership in the
 Canadian subsidiary, Bentofix Technologies, Inc. 

Interest
 expense of 22,088,000 for the 2006 year was higher than 2005 s interest expense
 of 19,386,000. This increase was primarily due to increased interest rates,
 higher levels of debt and the accretion of the fair market value adjustment
 recorded when the Company elected to no longer apply hedge accounting. As of
 January 1, 2006, the Company was no longer able to apply the short cut method
 of
 accounting for its interest rate swap and, therefore, elected to no longer
 apply
 hedge accounting. 

Other
 income was 189,000 for the 2006 year compared to other income of 643,000
 in
 2005. The 2006 amount included gains/(losses) on the sales of assets being
 offset by the change in the value of the interest rate swap. Other income in
 2005 was primarily related to gains on the sale of assets. 

The
 Company s provision for income taxes is recorded at statutory rates for each tax
 jurisdiction based on fiscal year to date results, adjusted for certain
 permanent differences. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company
 recorded tax expense of 1,343,000 with a pre-tax book loss of 1,170,000).
 Tax
 expense for 2006 included approximately 540,000 for prior years state
 and foreign
 taxes. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 14 - Income
 taxes, for additional information.

The
 Company s sales and operating revenue of 317,618,000 increased by 29,712,000,
 or 10.3 in 2005 from the 287,906,000 reported in 2004. Product prices were
 up
 8.7 , in line with higher raw material costs. Units shipped were up 1.5 while
 units installed were down 16.8 . At December 31, 2005, backlog of 51.9 million
 was 20.0 lower than at December 31, 2004. The decline in backlog was primarily
 due to the timing of bid activity. 

26 

U.S.
 sales and operating revenue of 161,355,000 in 2005 was 1.1 lower than the
 previous year. This decline was mainly due to lower units shipped and square
 feet installed, partially offset by the increase in sales prices. Average per
 unit sales price increased 6.1 in 2005 compared to 2004. U.S. units shipped
 were down 6.7 , while installed units were down approximately 22.6 in 2005.
 Both of these decreases were primarily caused by less business with national
 solid waste customers. 

Foreign
 sales and operating revenue was 156,263,000 in 2005, a 25.2 increase from
 the
 previous year. Average unit sales price increased 14.7 in 2005 compared to
 the
 prior year. Foreign units shipped increased by 9.1 and installed units
 increased by 63.8 in 2005 over 2004. The increase in shipments was primarily
 from continued growth in Asia and Africa, principally in the aquaculture,
 agriculture and water containment markets. The growth in installed units in
 2005
 was from a concentrated effort to increase market share within the German and
 United Kingdom solid waste industry. A change in the U.S. dollar value of the
 Company s foreign entity functional currencies increased 2005 foreign sales and
 operating revenue by approximately 279,000. 

Gross
 profit in 2005 was 56,351,000, 2.3 higher than the 55,103,000 in 2004. Gross
 profit as a percent of sales and operating revenues declined to 17.7 from
 19.1 
 last year, but was up 1 on a dollar per unit basis. Gross profits as a
 percentage of sales declined mainly due to the rise in resin prices. In
 addition, the decline in margins was impacted by a full year s depreciation and
 amortization in 2005 at the stepped up basis of manufacturing assets (as a
 result of the Merger) as opposed to only a partial year of stepped up
 depreciation and amortization in 2004. The increase in dollar per unit gross
 profit resulted from an increase in profits in the foreign markets which offset
 the decrease in profits from U. S. markets. 

International
 markets experienced an 18.2 increase in gross profit mainly due to the increase
 in sales volumes. Also contributing to gross profit was higher margins from
 the
 mining industry in Latin America, primarily serviced by U.S. operations, and
 improved gross profit from installation services in Germany. Change in U.S.
 dollar value of functional currencies decreased 2005 gross profit by
 approximately 174,000. 

Gross
 profit in the domestic markets in 2005 decreased 10.4 , but was essentially
 flat
 on a dollar per unit basis with 2004. The decline was mainly due to the drop
 in
 sales volumes and a drop in installation services. The Company was able to
 offset the steep rise in resin prices with product price increases. 

Selling,
 general and administrative (SG A) expenses of 29,573,000 in 2005 were
 1,197,000 lower than in 2004. The decrease in SG A is primarily related to
 approximately 1,690,000 of cost reductions implemented in the U.S. and Europe
 in 2004 and 600,000 of lower bad debt expense. Partially offsetting this
 decrease was 728,000 of higher management fees paid to CHS. SG A, as a
 percent of sales, was 9.3 for year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 10.7 
 the previous year. 

Amortization
 of intangibles increased by 1,701,000 in 2005 compared to the prior year
 period. The increase reflects a full year of amortization expense related to
 Successor Company intangible assets recorded in connection with the
 Merger. 

During
 2005, the Company vigorously pursued two acquisition candidates in competition
 with other buyers, which proved unsuccessful. The Company performed extensive
 due diligence activities and was in negotiation with sellers over several
 months. Expenses totaling 1,018,000 were primarily from fees incurred for
 legal, accounting and professional services assisting with due diligence efforts
 and contract negotiations. 

Expenses
 related to the Merger of 5,863,000 in 2004 were comprised of costs the Company
 incurred to execute the Merger, including 3,204,000 for investment banker
 fees
 and expenses, 1,169,000 for legal, accounting and professional expenses, and
 1,490,000 non-cash expense created by the extension and acceleration of
 Predecessor Company stock option vesting dates as a result of the Merger and
 required by FAS 123. 

Interest
 expense of 19,386,000 during 2005 was higher than the previous year s
 14,359,000 reflecting a full year of interest expense on the 11 senior notes
 and the term loan issued in connection with the Merger. The cost in 2004
 includes a prepayment fee of 691,000 relating to the early retirement of the
 debt of the Predecessor. 

Other
 income of 643,000 in 2005 and other income of 556,000 in 2004 were primarily
 from gains on routine sales of assets. 

27 

The
 Company s provision for income taxes for 2005 was 1,735,000 compared to a
 benefit of 304,000 the previous year. The tax provision was determined at
 the
 statutory rates adjusted for certain permanent differences on an
 entity-by-entity basis. The effective rate for 2005 was 71.4 compared to
 (18.0 last year. Income tax expense for 2005 was increased by 1,360,000
 to
 reinstate a deferred tax valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits
 generated prior to the May 18, 2004 Merger transaction and recorded as an income
 tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2004. The Company received 17,015,000
 of
 dividends from foreign subsidiaries in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation
 Act
 and determined that U.S. income taxes will be offset by a corresponding foreign
 tax credit. 

Outlook 

With
 the
 opportunities that we anticipate from the two new business ventures in the
 synthetic turf and storm water markets, along with the anticipated growth that
 we see in the international markets, management is confident we will be able
 to
 meet the challenges in 2007. 

Sales
 and
 operating revenue are anticipated to be higher than in 2006, primarily from
 increased sales, improvement in performance in the international markets and
 the
 impact of the new growth opportunities that we expect from the synthetic turf
 and storm water business ventures. 

We
 anticipate volume levels from the 2007 national account programs will be lower
 than in the previous year. We also anticipate a strong demand in most of our
 international markets which will result from resumption in some major projects
 in the mining sector that were delayed in 2006. 

Overall
 installation activity in the U.S. and Europe is expected to increase as a result
 of a favorable backlog position and expected demand from large mining and power
 projects during 2007. We discontinued installation operations in the UK
 reflecting higher price competition for these services. Even though we expect
 to
 see some increase in overall installation activity, it will not be sufficient
 to
 offset the decline in US installation profitability resulting from the change
 in
 our business relationship with Waste Management. 

Resin
 costs at the beginning of 2007 are approximately ten cents per pound lower
 than
 the average cost per pound in 2006, due to the large drop in oil prices.
 Increases in resin prices were announced for the first quarter of 2007 and
 we
 expect that these prices will remain volatile for the remaining part of the
 year
 which may contribute to lower gross profit. 

We
 anticipate that the industry will continue having capacity in excess of the
 market growth, thus contributing to a continuance of competitive bid pricing
 pressure. Our intent is to maintain the 2006 margin spread over resin costs
 in
 2007. However, maintaining that spread with higher selling prices is expected
 to
 result in gross profit margins declining as a percentage of sales. For the
 year
 2007, we anticipate a decline in our gross profit as a percentage of sales,
 by
 approximately one percent. 

Exclusive
 of non-cash amortization costs, we expect to have lower selling and
 administrative costs resulting from actions taken in 2006 and the current year,
 primarily personnel related. 

In
 conclusion, we expect to meet our restrictive debt covenant measurements during
 2007. Meeting the covenants will be dependent on achieving growth targets in
 new
 businesses and cost containment. We anticipate 2007 EBITDA, as defined by the
 debt covenants, to remain comparable to 2006. 

Liquidity
 and Capital Resources 

Sources
 of Liquidity 

The
 Company s primary sources of liquidity in 2006 were cash generated from
 operations and its revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2006, the Company
 had working capital of 69,264,000 of which 13,691,000 was cash and cash
 equivalents. The Company s operating results and liquidity are normally reduced
 in the first quarter as both product deliveries and installations are at their
 lowest levels due to inclement weather experienced in the Northern Hemisphere.
 The Company believes that it has sufficient funding from cash on hand, cash
 expected to be generated from future operations and existing credit facilities
 to meet its anticipated liquidity needs including anticipated requirements
 for
 working capital, capital expenditures and debt service in 2007. 

28 

Total
 capitalization as of December 31, 2006, was 251,400,000, consisting of
 71,525,000 in stockholder s equity and 179,875,000 of total debt. The total
 debt is reduced by a 2,406,000 non-cash, fair value adjustment for the interest
 rate swap and premium on senior notes. 

Capital
 Expenditures 

Capital
 expenditures in 2006 were 7,037,000. The Company currently anticipates 2007
 capital expenditures to be approximately 3,900,000. The Company expects to
 fund
 capital expenditures with cash on hand. There are currently no contractual
 obligations or commitments related to these planned capital
 expenditures. 

Borrowing
 Arrangements 

We
 entered into a three-year unsecured installment obligation with the seller
 of
 ProGreen for 2.7 million. The installment obligation bears interest at 5.13 
 per annum and is payable in three equal annual principal payments of 900,000
 plus accrued interest commencing October 13, 2007. 

We
 entered into a five year installment obligation with the seller of SL Limitada
 for 4.5 million, secured by a share pledge agreement for 30 of the equity
 of
 GSE Lining Technology Chile, S. A., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
 ours.
 The installment obligation bears interest at 5 for the first two years,
 converting to a variable rate based on the London Interbank Offer Rates (LIBOR)
 for the remaining term. Payments are in five annual principal and interest
 amounts beginning on January 1, 2007. 

In
 connection with the Merger, we issued 150,000,000 of 11 senior notes due
 in
 2012. The senior notes are guaranteed by all of our existing and future direct
 or indirect domestic subsidiaries other than Bentofix Technologies
 (USA), Inc., a dormant subsidiary of our 75.5 -owned Canadian subsidiary,
 Bentofix Technologies, Inc. 

The
 indenture governing the senior notes, among other things: (1) restricts our
 ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness,
 issue shares of preferred stock, incur liens, pay dividends or make certain
 other restricted payments and enter into certain transactions with affiliates;
 (2) places certain restrictions on the ability of certain of our
 subsidiaries to pay dividends or make certain 
 payments
 to us; and (3) places restrictions on our ability and the ability of our
 subsidiaries to merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign,
 transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of our assets. The indenture
 related to the senior notes and our senior credit facility described below
 also
 contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our
 businesses. 

In
 January 2005, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which effectively
 converted 75,000,000 of the indebtedness represented by our 11 fixed rate
 senior notes into variable rates based on six-month LIBOR rates. Under the
 swap
 agreement, payments are made based on a variable rate; currently 11.9994 
 through May 15, 2007, adjusting based on LIBOR rates every six months
 thereafter, and received on a fixed rate of 11 . Differentials to be received
 or
 paid under the agreement are recognized as an offset to interest expense in
 2005. 

At
 the
 time the Company entered into a swap agreement, the terms of the swap agreement
 were such that the swap was considered perfectly effective against changes
 in
 the fair value of the debt due to changes in the benchmark interest rates over
 swap terms. As a result, the shortcut method provided by SFAS No. 133,
 Accounting
 for Derivative Instruments and
 Hedging Activities , 
was
 applied and there was no need to periodically reassess the effectiveness of
 the
 swap during its term. Interest expense on the debt was adjusted to include
 payments made or received under the swap agreements. The fair value of the
 swap
 would be carried as an asset or a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
 and the carrying value of the hedged debt would be adjusted accordingly. The
 fair value of the Company s interest rate swap would be the estimated amounts
 the Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreement as of the reporting
 dates. In 2005, the FASB issued an interpretation to SFAS 133 and, as a result,
 effective January 1, 2006, the Company was no longer able to apply the short-cut
 method of accounting for its interest rate swap. The Company elected to no
 longer use hedge accounting. 

In
 connection with the Merger, we entered into a 65,000,000 senior secured credit
 facility with UBS Loan Finance LLC and certain other lenders. The senior credit
 facility provides a 25,000,000 term loan facility and a revolving credit
 facility of up to 40,000,000. The revolving credit facility includes a letter
 of credit subfacility of 10,000,000 and a swing line subfacility of
 15,000,000. The term loan matures in May 2010 and the revolving credit
 facility matures in May 2009. The term loan facility amortizes on 24
 consecutive equal quarterly installments. Borrowings bear interest, at our
 option, at either a base rate or LIBOR plus, in each case, an applicable
 interest margin. The applicable interest margin for the term loan is 2.00 
 per
 annum for base rate loans or 3.00 per annum for LIBOR loans. The applicable
 interest margin for revolving loans is 1.75 per annum for base rate loans
 or
 2.75 per annum for LIBOR loans. We are also required to pay customary agency
 fees and expenses. The Company paid commitment fees of approximately 121,000
 in
 2006 and 188,000 in 2005. The senior credit facility requires prepayment with
 the net proceeds of certain asset sales, the net proceeds of certain issuances
 of debt or preferred stock, a portion of net proceeds of certain issuances
 of
 common equity, the net proceeds from casualty and condemnation events in excess
 of amounts applied to repair or replace such assets, and an agreed-upon
 percentage of our excess cash flow (subject to certain baskets). 

29 

The
 senior credit facility is guaranteed by GEO Holdings and all of our existing
 and
 future direct or indirect domestic subsidiaries, except our foreign subsidiaries
 or Bentofix Technologies (USA), Inc., a dormant subsidiary of our
 75.5 -owned Canadian subsidiary, Bentofix Technologies, Inc., and except to
 the extent guarantees by such subsidiaries would be prohibited by applicable
 tax
 law or could result in adverse tax consequences. The senior credit facility
 is
 secured by substantially all of our U.S. assets, and by our capital stock and
 the capital stock of substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and 65 
 of
 the capital stock of substantially all of our first-tier foreign
 subsidiaries. 

The
 senior credit facility requires us to meet certain financial tests, including
 but not limited to, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum leverage ratio,
 a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum capital expenditures, which
 become more restrictive over the term of the senior credit facility. In
 addition, the senior credit facility contains restrictive covenants which limit,
 among other things, dispositions of assets, certain business changes, certain
 ownership changes, mergers, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases and
 redemptions, incurrence of indebtedness, issuance of preferred stock,
 investments, liens, transactions with affiliates, sale and leaseback
 transactions, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements.
 The
 senior credit facility provides for customary events of default. At December
 31,
 2006, the Company had an outstanding balance of 13,935,000 on its 25,000,000
 term loan. The Company had available 27,066,000 under its credit facility
 at
 December 31, 2006, net of 1,934,000 of issued letters of credit and 11,000,000
 of outstanding borrowings. 

We
 have
 an EGP 5,000,000 (USD 876,000) term loan with an Egyptian bank, bearing
 interest at 14 , secured by equipment. The promissory note requires quarterly
 payments of EGP 417,000 (USD 73,000) plus interest on July 27,
 October 27, January 27, and April 27, maturing in
 April 2007, and has a balance outstanding at December 31, 2006 of EGP
 833,000 (USD 146,000). 

At
 December 31, 2006, we had five local foreign credit facilities. We had credit
 facilities with two German banks in the amount of EUR 5,100,000 (USD
 6,733,000). These revolving credit facilities are secured by a corporate
 guarantee and bear interest at various market rates. These credit facilities
 are
 used primarily to guarantee the performance of European installation contracts
 and temporary working capital requirements. At December 31, 2006, we had EUR
 4,532,000 (USD 5,983,000) available under these credit facilities with EUR
 1,347,000 (USD 1,778,000) of bank guarantees outstanding and no borrowings
 under the line of credit. 

We
 have
 two credit facilities with Egyptian banks in the amount of EGP 9,167,000 (USD
 1,605,000). These credit facilities bear interest at various market rates
 and
 are primarily for cash management purposes. At December 31, 2006, we had EGP
 7,145,000 (USD 1,251,000) available under these credit facilities. 

We
 have a
 credit facility with a Canadian bank in the amount of Canadian Dollar 500,000
 (USD 429,000) that bears interest at market rate, secured by all assets. At
 December 31, 2006, we had the full amount available under this
 line. 

The
 Company is currently in compliance with all of its debt covenants and expects
 to
 remain in compliance.

Cash
 used
 in operating activities during 2006 was 814,000 compared with cash provided
 by
 operating activities of 8,786,000 in 2005. The difference was primarily due
 to
 the higher receivables and inventory from the Chilean operations and the shift
 from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in the business activity.

Cash
 used
 by investing activities during 2006 was 10,538,000, compared to 12,930,000
 in
 the prior year. Cash used in investing activities in 2006 was primarily due
 to
 capital expenditures of 5,367,000, cash used for the purchase of ProGreen
 of
 4,119,000 and 2,067,000 for the increased ownership in Bentofix Technologies,
 Inc. Cash used by investing activities during 2005 was primarily for the
 acquisition of the operating assets of a geomembrane manufacturer in Chile
 for
 11,188,000. 

Cash
 provided by financing activities during 2006 was due to 8,526,000 of net
 proceeds on credit lines offset by long term debt payments of 4,272,000 and
 a
 dividend payment of 569,000. Cash provided by financing activities for 2005
 was
 primarily a 2,363,000 draw on a credit line in Germany for short-term working
 capital needs that was paid off in February 2006.

Critical
 Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
 discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are
 based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
 in
 accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
 The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make
 estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
 revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and
 liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates estimates, including
 those related to bad debts, inventory obsolescence, investments, intangible
 assets and goodwill, income taxes, financing operations, workers compensation
 insurance, pension benefits and contingent liabilities. Estimates are based
 on
 historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
 be
 reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
 making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
 not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from the
 estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements contained
 herein. 

We
 believe the following are our most critical accounting policies. Our senior
 management has discussed the development and selection of these policies and
 related disclosure with the audit committee. These policies require significant
 judgmental estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
 statements, based on historical experience and assumptions related to certain
 factors including competitive market factors, worldwide manufacturing capacity
 in the industry, general economic conditions around the world and governmental
 regulation and supervision. There have been no significant changes to our
 critical accounting estimates during any of the periods in the three years
 ended
 December 31, 2006. 

31 

Allowance
 for Doubtful Accounts 

We
 establish reserves for doubtful accounts on a case-by-case basis when it is
 believed that the required payment of specific amounts owed to us is unlikely
 to
 occur. We derive a majority of our revenue from sales and services to domestic
 and international, municipal and private companies engaged in waste management,
 mining, water and wastewater treatment, aquaculture and other industrial
 activities. We have receivables from customers in various countries. We
 generally do not require collateral or other security to support customer
 receivables. If the customers financial condition was to deteriorate or their
 access to freely convertible currency was restricted, resulting in impairment
 of
 their ability to make the required payments, additional allowances may be
 required. 

Warranty
 Reserve 

Our
 products carry specified limited warranties as to quality and workmanship.
 We
 established a reserve for potential warranty claims based on history of claims
 experience. We have no assurance that historical trends will continue and if
 trends are different than the estimates used, it could have an effect on our
 results of operations and financial position. 

Revenue
 Recognition and Job Loss Accrual 

For
 products sold directly to customers, we recognize revenues when products are
 shipped, title and risk of loss passes to the buyer, we have no further
 obligation to the buyer, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For
 installation contracts, revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion
 method in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
 Statement of Position (SOP) 81-1 Accounting for Performance of
 Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts. We recognize revenue
 on signed contracts and approved change orders. We do not recognize revenues
 on
 claims until claims are approved in writing and collectibility of such claims
 are assured. Percentage of completion is measured on the 
 percentage of costs incurred to total estimated costs for each contract. Our
 installation projects are reviewed for profitability on a monthly basis. When
 it
 has been determined that a project will generate a loss for us, we estimate
 that
 loss and book a reserve for the total expected loss on the
 job. 

Goodwill
 Impairment 

We
 use
 the purchase method of accounting for business combinations which requires
 us to
 make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for
 acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible
 assets. We perform a goodwill impairment test annually as of December 31.
 Goodwill could be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the
 occurrence of events indicates that a potential impairment exists. The
 impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of business reporting
 units to carrying value including assigned goodwill. We use the present value
 of
 future cash flows to determine fair value. Future cash flows are typically
 based
 upon a ten-year future period for the business and an estimated residual value.
 Management judgment is required in the estimation of future operating results
 and to determine the appropriate residual values. Future operating results
 and
 residual values could reasonably differ from the estimates and could require
 a
 provision for impairment in a future period. 

Property,
 Plant and Equipment 

Costs
 of
 additions and major improvements are capitalized, whereas maintenance and
 repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the asset are charged to
 expense as incurred. When items are retired or otherwise disposed of, other
 (income) expense is charged or credited for the difference between net book
 value and net proceeds realized thereon. Interest costs incurred in construction
 of assets are capitalized and depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
 Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method, based on the estimated
 useful lives of the assets. Total repairs and maintenance during 2006 was
 3,740,000. Total repairs and maintenance during 2005 were 3,558,000. Total
 repairs and maintenance expense during 2004 were 2,287,000 for the Successor
 Company and 1,758,000 for the Predecessor Company. 

32 

We
 make
 estimates in conjunction with property, plant and equipment, including amounts
 to be capitalized, depreciation methods and useful lives. Additionally, carrying
 values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment and whenever
 events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may be impaired.
 The carrying values are compared to the undiscounted anticipated future cash
 flows related to those assets. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset
 exceeds the future undiscounted cash flow, an impairment charge is recorded
 in
 the period in which such review is performed and it is determined that the
 carrying value exceeds fair value. This requires us to make long-term forecasts
 of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review.
 Forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and future
 market conditions. Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could
 require a provision for impairment in a future period. 

Customer
 Lists and Other Intangible Assets 

The
 amounts assigned to customer lists (determined generally based upon appraised
 value) and other intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated
 useful lives and are reviewed for potential impairment whenever events or
 changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may be impaired. The
 estimated useful lives are based on an evaluation of the circumstances
 surrounding each asset, including an evaluation of events that may have occurred
 that would cause the useful life to be decreased. In the event the useful life
 would be considered to be shortened, or if the asset s future value were deemed
 to be impaired, an appropriate amount of the value would be amortized to
 expense. Future operating results and residual values could therefore reasonably
 differ from the estimates and could require a provision for impairment in a
 future period. To date there have been no impairments. 

New
 Accounting Pronouncements 

In
 June
 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting
 for Uncertainty in Income Taxes 
 FIN
 48 ), an interpretation of Statement No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the criteria and
 approach for recognition, derecognition and measurement of uncertain tax
 positions. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material
 impact on the financial position or results of operations. 

ITEM
 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
 Risk 

Interest
 Rate Risk 

Our
 earnings may be affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those
 changes have on our variable rate debt instruments. As of December 31, 2006,
 there was 13,935,000 outstanding under our floating rate credit facilities
 and
 11,000,000 under a revolving credit agreement. 

In
 January 2005, GSE entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which
 effectively converted 75,000,000 of the indebtedness represented by our 11 
 fixed rate senior notes into variable rates based on six-month LIBOR rates.
 Under the swap agreement, payments are made based on a variable rate; currently
 11.9994 through May 15, 2007, adjusting based on LIBOR rates every six months
 thereafter, and received on a fixed rate of 11 . Differentials to be received
 or
 paid under the agreement are recognized as other expense (income) for
 2006. 

Our
 earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those
 changes have on our variable-rate debt and derivative instruments. Holding
 other
 variables constant, including levels of indebtedness, a 50 basis point increase
 or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our interest expense
 by
 437,000 annually. 

Market
 risk for fixed-rate long-term debt is estimated as the potential increase in
 fair value resulting from a hypothetical 25 basis points decrease in interest
 rates and amounts to approximately 1,527,000 million as of December 31, 2006,
 using discounted cash flow analysis. 

33 

Foreign
 Currency Risk 

We
 operate outside of the United States through foreign subsidiaries in Germany,
 England, Australia, Chile and Egypt that use a foreign currency as their
 functional currency. Foreign subsidiaries may enter into sales, installation
 or
 purchase contracts that are denominated in currencies different than the
 subsidiaries functional currency. We recognize that our international
 operations are subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations not present
 in domestic operations. As a result, our financial results could be
 significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange
 rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute
 or install our products. However, 
 currency
 losses from sales, installation or purchase obligations in non functional
 currencies have not been material to our operations as a whole. The impact
 on
 our financial position and results of operations resulting from a hypothetical
 change in exchange rates of the different countries we operate in cannot be
 reasonably estimated. No assurance can be given as to how future movements
 in
 these foreign currencies could affect our future earnings. At December 31,
 2006,
 revenues, operating income and total assets for our foreign subsidiaries who
 do
 not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency were 102.4 million, 7.6
 million, and 68.8 million, respectively. 

We
 do
 financing transactions with and between our foreign subsidiaries from time
 to
 time, and foreign operations pay dividends to their U.S. parent. These
 transactions are normally in the currency of the lending or dividend paying
 entity and involve foreign currency risk. 

We
 have
 not entered into hedging transactions in 2006 to mitigate the effect of changes
 in currency exchange rates on our financial results. 

We
 translate our non U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars
 each month based on the current exchange rates. Any change in the exchange
 rates
 has an impact on our consolidated financial statements. When the U.S. dollar
 strengthens versus the foreign currency being translated the consolidated
 results are negatively impacted, and when the U.S. dollar weakens versus the
 foreign currency our consolidated results are favorably impacted. 

Supply
 Risk 

We
 routinely enter into fixed price contracts with commencement of performance
 dates spread throughout the year. Due to the nature of the construction business
 into which our products are sold, we have limited contractual means of passing
 through resin price increases. We attempted to manage this risk by: 

(1)
 setting expiration dates on bids; 

(2)
 negotiating delays in announced resin price increases from our
 suppliers; 

(3)
 carrying inventory to meet expected demand; and 

(4)
 planning and staying informed on economic factors influencing resin
 prices. 

We
 have
 not entered into purchase contracts for the future delivery of raw materials.
 Holding all other variables constant, a 1 increase in resin prices based on
 our
 2006 volumes sold would have increased cost of products and services by
 approximately 2,500,000.

ITEM
 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

As
 of the
 end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an
 evaluation, with the participation of our principal executive officer (the
 CEO and our principal financial officer (the CFO ), of the effectiveness of
 our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Securities
 Exchange Act of 1934. Based on those evaluations, the CEO and CFO
 believe: 

34 

(i) That
 our
 disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information
 required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under
 the
 Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
 within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such
 information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the
 CEO
 and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure;
 and 

(ii) That
 our
 disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 

There
 were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the
 quarter ended December 31, 2006, that have materially affected, or are
 reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
 reporting.

REPORT
 OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 

 PUBLIC
 ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Board
 of
 Directors and Stockholder 

 Gundle/SLT
 Environmental, Inc. 

We
 have
 audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Gundle/SLT
 Environmental, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the
 related consolidated statements of income (loss), stockholder s equity and cash
 flows for the years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 and for the
 period from May 18, 2004 to December 31, 2004 (Successor Company operations),
 and the period from January 1, 2004 through May 17, 2004, (Predecessor Company
 operations). Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed
 in
 the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
 responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an
 opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
 audits. 

We
 conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
 Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
 plan
 and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
 statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform
 an
 audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits
 included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
 for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
 not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
 Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
 such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
 supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
 the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
 and
 evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
 audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In
 our
 opinion, the Successor company financial statements referred to above present
 fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the
 Company at December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the consolidated results of its
 operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2006 and December
 31, 2005 and for the period from May 18, 2004 to December 31, 2004, in
 conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Further, in
 our
 opinion, the Predecessor Company financial statements referred to above present
 fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated results of its operations
 and
 its cash flows for the period from January 1, 2004 through May 17, 2004, in
 conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our
 opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
 to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
 material respects the information set forth therein. 

As
 noted
 in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its
 method of accounting for stock-based compensation.

NOTES
 TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(1)
 Nature of business 

Organization

Gundle/SLT
 Environmental, Inc. (the Company ), a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in
 August 1986, and through its wholly owned subsidiaries is primarily engaged
 in
 the manufacture, sale and installation of polyethylene lining systems. The
 Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of GEO Holdings Corp. (see Note
 10). 

The
 Company is a leading global manufacturer, marketer and installer of a broad
 array of geosynthetic lining products. Geosynthetic products are used in
 containment systems for environmental protection and for the confinement of
 solids, liquids and gases in the waste management, liquid containment and mining
 industries. The Company offers a full range of high quality products, including
 geomembranes, drainage products, geosynthetic clay liners, nonwoven geotextiles
 and other products. We also offer installation services, focused on large
 projects for key customers in the United States and Germany through an internal
 installation staff. Installation services were offered through an internal
 installation staff in the United Kingdom through December 22, 2006. The Company
 believes that its market share, broad product offering, installation
 capabilities, strong customer relationships, diverse end markets and global
 presence provide us with key competitive advantages in the geosynthetic products
 industry. The Company manufactures its products at facilities located in the
 United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Thailand, Chile and
 Egypt.

 Summary of significant accounting policies 

Consolidation

The
 accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
 Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in partially owned
 entities in which ownership ranges from 20 to 50 percent are accounted for
 using
 the equity method. All material intercompany balances and transactions have
 been
 eliminated. 

Cash
 Equivalents 

The
 Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with an original
 maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Inventory

Inventory
 is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost, which includes material, labor
 and overhead, is determined by the weighted average cost method, which
 approximates the first-in, first-out cost method. 

Property,
 plant and equipment 

Costs
 of
 additions and major improvements are capitalized, whereas maintenance and
 repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the asset are charged to
 expense as incurred. When items are retired or otherwise disposed of, income
 is
 charged or credited for the difference between net book value and net proceeds
 realized thereon. Interest costs incurred in construction of assets are
 capitalized and depreciated over the useful life of the asset. Depreciation
 is
 computed using the straight-line method, based on the estimated useful lives
 of
 the assets. Total repairs and maintenance were 3,740,000 and 3,558,000 during
 2006 and 2005 respectively. Total repairs and maintenance during 2004 were
 2,287,000 for the Successor Company and 1,758,000 for the Predecessor Company.

The
 Company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with property, plant and
 equipment, including amounts to be capitalized, depreciation methods and useful
 lives. Additionally, carrying values of property, plant and equipment are
 reviewed for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
 that carrying value may be impaired. The carrying values are compared to the
 undiscounted anticipated future cash flows related to those assets. If the
 carrying value of a long-lived asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flow,
 an impairment charge is recorded in the period in which such review is performed
 and it is determined that the carrying value exceeds fair value. This requires
 the Company to make long-term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related
 to the assets subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions about demand
 for
 the Company s products and future market conditions. Future events and
 unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment
 in
 a future period. 

47 

GUNDLE/SLT
 ENVIRONMENTAL, INC. 

NOTES
 TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 

Excess
 of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired 

The
 Company uses the purchase method of accounting for business combinations which
 requires the Company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the
 purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible
 and
 identifiable intangible assets. The Company performs a goodwill impairment
 test
 annually as of December 31. Goodwill could be tested more frequently if changes
 in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate that a potential
 impairment exists. The impairment test requires the Company to compare the
 fair
 value of business reporting units to carrying value including assigned goodwill.
 The Company uses the present value of future cash flows to determine fair value
 and validates the results against the cost and market approaches. Future cash
 flows are typically based upon a ten-year future period for the business and
 an
 estimated residual value. Management judgment is required in the estimation
 of
 future operating results and to determine the appropriate residual values.
 Future operating results and residual values could reasonably differ from the
 estimates and could require a provision for impairment in a future period.
 To
 date there have been no impairments. 

Customer
 lists and other intangible assets 

The
 amounts assigned to customer lists (determined generally based upon appraised
 value) and other intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated
 useful lives and are reviewed for potential impairment whenever events or
 changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may be impaired. The
 estimated useful lives are based on an evaluation of the circumstances
 surrounding each asset, including an evaluation of events that may have occurred
 that would cause the useful life to be decreased. In the event the useful life
 would be considered to be shortened, or if the asset s future value were deemed
 to be impaired, an appropriate amount of the value would be amortized to
 expense. Future operating results and residual values could therefore reasonably
 differ from the estimates and could require a provision for impairment in a
 future period. To date there have been no impairments. 

Revenue
 and cost recognition 

For
 products sold directly to customers, the Company recognizes revenues when
 products are shipped, title and risk of loss passes to the buyer, the Company
 has no further obligation to the buyer, and collectibility is reasonably
 assured. For installation contracts, revenues are recognized on the percentage
 of completion method in accordance with the American Institute of Certified
 Public Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) 81-1 Accounting for Performance
 of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts. The Company
 recognizes revenue on signed contracts and approved change orders. The Company
 does not recognize revenues on claims until claims are approved in writing
 and
 collectibility of such claims are assured. Percentage of completion is measured
 on the percentage of costs incurred to total estimated costs for each
 contract. 

Cost
 of
 sales includes all direct material and labor costs, and indirect costs such
 as
 indirect labor, depreciation, insurance, supplies, tools, repairs, and shipping
 and handling. 

Provisions
 for the total estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period
 in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions,
 estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions
 to projected costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the
 revisions are determined. 

The
 Company establishes reserves for doubtful accounts on a case-by-case basis
 when
 it is believed that the required payment of specific amounts owed to the Company
 is unlikely to occur. The Company derives a majority of its revenue from sales
 and services to domestic and international municipal and private companies
 engaged in waste management, mining, water and wastewater treatment, aquaculture
 and other industrial activities. The Company has receivables from customers
 in
 various countries. The Company generally does not require collateral or other
 security to support customer receivables. If the customer s financial condition
 were to deteriorate or their access to freely convertible currency was
 restricted, resulting in impairment of their ability to make the required
 payments, additional allowances may be required.

 ENVIRONMENTAL, INC. 

NOTES
 TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 

Selling,
 general and administrative costs are charged to expense as
 incurred. 

Deferred
 costs 

Debt
 issuance costs are capitalized and amortized to interest expense using the
 effective interest rate method over the period the related debt is anticipated
 to be outstanding. 

Warranty
 costs 

The
 Company s geosynthetic products are sold and installed with specified limited
 warranties as to material quality and workmanship and may extend up to 20 years.
 Provision for warranty costs are made based on the Company s claims experience.
 The reserve for these costs, along with other risk-based reserves, is included
 in the self-insurance reserve (see Note 8). 

Income
 taxes 

Deferred
 income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and
 tax
 basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred income tax provision represents
 the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred
 tax liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions. Deferred
 tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards and are reduced by a
 valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than
 not
 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of
 deductible and taxable items. The Company establishes reserves when, despite
 its
 belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable, the Company believes
 that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed. When facts
 and circumstances change, the Company adjusts these reserves through its
 provision for income taxes. 

Foreign
 currency translation 

Results
 of operations for foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than
 the
 U.S. dollar are translated using average exchange rates during the year. Assets
 and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange
 rates in effect at the balance sheet date and the resulting translation
 adjustments are recognized as a separate component of Stockholder s equity.
 These translation adjustments are the only component of accumulated other
 comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from foreign currency
 transactions are recognized in income as incurred. 

In
 connection with contracts performed outside of the United States, the Company
 routinely bids fixed-price contracts denominated in currencies different than
 the functional currency of the applicable subsidiary performing the work. The
 Company recognizes that such bidding practices, in the context of international
 operations, are subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations not present
 in domestic operations. (Gains)/losses related to these contracts are included
 in cost of sales and have not been significant. 

Use
 of estimates 

The
 preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
 generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
 and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
 and
 accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
 estimates.

Stock-Based
 Compensation 

Effective
 January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, Share-Based
 Payments, using
 the
 modified prospective transition method. Prior to 2006, the Company accounted
 for
 stock awards granted to employees under the recognition and measurement
 principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting
 for Stock issued to Employees, and
 related interpretations .
 The
 adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, did not affect the accounting for
 equity-based compensation awards granted prior to the adoption date.
 At
 the
 time of the Merger, 333,600 fully vested Predecessor Company stock options
 held
 by certain key employees were exchanged for fully vested options to purchase
 333,600 shares of common stock of GEO Holdings. The fair value of the option
 exchange, 5.4 million, was included in determining the aggregate purchase
 price
 paid by GEO Holdings for the Company. From
 the
 time of the Merger until January 1, 2006, no options have been issued. As a
 result, no compensation expense has been recognized by the Company prior to
 its
 adoption of SFAS 123R. Compensation expense recognized in the first quarter
 relates to share-based awards granted by GEO Holdings to employees of the
 Company subsequent to January 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value in
 accordance with SFAS 123R. 

Compensation
 cost arising from stock options granted to employees is recognized as expense
 over the requisite service period. On March 1, 2006, pursuant to the GEO
 Holdings 2004 Stock Option Plan, the Board granted stock options with an
 exercise price of 21.35 per share to key employees of the Company representing
 71,788 shares of GEO Holdings common stock. The options were fully vested on
 the
 grant date and all of the stock based compensation of 228,817 141,687 net
 of
 tax) was recognized during the first quarter of 2006 with a corresponding
 increase of 141,687 to Additional Paid-in Capital. 

The
 fair
 value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
 Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
 assumptions used for grants issued on March 1, 2006.

The
 expected life of the options granted is based on the Company s best estimates
 and expectations related to the exercising of the options issued. 

Since
 GEO
 Holdings is a privately held company, it has no stock trading history to
 estimate volatility. The Company chose to use the volatility of the Dow Jones
 Building and Material Index fund. This index includes public companies that
 the
 Company believes has the most similarity to the Company s business. The Company
 calculated volatility from the historical closing price of this index for the
 three years ended March 31, 2006. 

The
 grant
 date fair value of the options granted during the three months ended March
 31,
 2006 was 3.19.

Senior
 Notes - 

In
 connection with the Merger, the Company issued 150,000,000 of 11 senior notes
 due in 2012. These notes are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
 amended. The senior notes are guaranteed by all of the Company s existing and
 future direct or indirect domestic subsidiaries other than Bentofix Technologies
 (USA), Inc., a dormant subsidiary of the Company s 75.5 -owned Canadian
 subsidiary, Bentofix Technologies, Inc. 

The
 indenture governing the notes, among other things: (1) restricts the Company s
 ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness,
 issue shares of preferred stock, incur liens, pay dividends or make certain
 other restricted payments and enter into certain transactions with affiliates;
 (2) prohibits certain restrictions on the ability of certain of the Company s
 subsidiaries to pay dividends or make certain payments to it; and (3) places
 restrictions on the Company s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to
 merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease,
 convey or otherwise dispose of assets. The indenture related to these notes
 and
 the senior credit facility also contains various covenants that limit the
 Company s discretion in the operation of its businesses. 

Senior
 Credit Facility - 

In
 connection with the Merger, the Company entered into a 65,000,000 senior
 secured credit facility with UBS Loan Finance LLC and certain other lenders.
 The
 senior credit facility provides a 25,000,000 term loan facility and a revolving
 credit facility of up to 40,000,000. The revolving credit facility includes
 a
 letter of credit sub-facility of 10,000,000 and a swing line sub-facility
 of
 15,000,000. The term loan matures in May 2010 and the revolving credit facility
 matures in May 2009. The term loan facility amortizes on 24 consecutive equal
 quarterly installments. Borrowings bear interest, at the Company s option, at
 either a base rate or LIBOR plus, in each case, an applicable interest margin.
 The applicable interest margin for the term loan is 2.00 per annum for base
 rate loans or 3.00 per annum for LIBOR loans. The applicable interest margin
 for revolving loans is 1.75 per annum for base rate loans or 2.75 per annum
 for LIBOR loans. The Company is also required to pay customary agency fees
 and
 expenses. The Company paid commitment fees of approximately 121,000, 188,000
 and 69,000 for the years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

GUNDLE/SLT
 ENVIRONMENTAL, INC. 

NOTES
 TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 

The
 senior credit facility requires prepayment with the net proceeds of certain
 asset sales, the net proceeds of certain issuances of debt or preferred stock,
 a
 portion of net proceeds of certain issuances of common equity, the net proceeds
 from casualty and condemnation events in excess of amounts applied to repair
 or
 replace such assets, and an agreed-upon percentage of the Company s excess cash
 flow (subject to certain baskets). 

The
 senior credit facility is guaranteed by GEO Holdings and all of the Company s
 existing and future direct or indirect domestic subsidiaries, but not the
 Company s foreign subsidiaries or Bentofix Technologies (USA), Inc., a dormant
 subsidiary of its 75.5 -owned Canadian subsidiary, Bentofix Technologies, Inc.,
 except to the extent guarantees by such subsidiaries would be prohibited by
 applicable tax law or could result in adverse tax consequences. The senior
 credit facility is secured by substantially all of the Company s U.S. assets,
 and by its capital stock and the capital stock of substantially all of its
 domestic subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of substantially all of
 its
 first-tier foreign subsidiaries. 

The
 senior credit facility requires the Company to meet certain financial tests,
 including but not limited to, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum
 leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum capital
 expenditures, which become more restrictive over the term of the senior credit
 facility. In addition, the senior credit facility contains restrictive covenants
 which limits, among other things, dispositions of assets, certain business
 changes, certain ownership changes, mergers, acquisitions, dividends, stock
 repurchase and redemptions, incurrence of indebtedness, issuance of preferred
 stock, investments, liens, transactions with affiliates, sale and leaseback
 transactions, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements.
 The
 senior credit facility provides for customary events of default. At December
 31,
 2006, the Company made payments of 3,982,000 on its 25,000,000 term loan,
 leaving a balance of approximately 13,935,000 outstanding. The Company made
 no
 prepayments in 2006 or 2005 but made a 5 million prepayment in 2004. The
 Company had available 27,066,000 under its credit facility at December 31,
 2006, net of 1,934,000 of issued letters of credit and 11,000,000 of
 outstanding borrowings. 

Foreign
 Debt - 

The
 Company has an EGP 5,000,000 (USD 876,000) term loan with an Egyptian bank,
 bearing interest at 14 , secured by equipment. The promissory note requires
 quarterly payments of EGP 417,000 (USD 73,000) plus interest on July 27,
 October 27, January 27, and April 27, maturing in April 2007, and has a balance
 outstanding at December 31, 2006 of EGP 833,000 (USD 146,000). 

At
 December 31, 2006, GSE had five local foreign credit facilities. It had credit
 facilities with two German banks in the amount of EUR 5,100,000 (USD
 6,733,000). These revolving credit facilities are secured by a corporate
 guarantee and bear interest at various market rates. These credit facilities
 are
 used primarily to guarantee the performance of European installation contracts
 and temporary working capital requirements. At December 31, 2006, GSE had EUR
 4,532,000 (USD 5,983,000) available under these credit facilities with EUR
 1,347,000 (USD 1,778,000) of bank guarantees outstanding and no borrowing
 under
 the line of credit. 

The
 Company has two credit facilities with Egyptian banks in the amount of EGP
 9,167,000 (USD 1,605,000). These credit facilities bear interest at various
 market rates and are primarily for cash management purposes. The Company had
 Letters of Credit outstanding of EGP 2,022,000 354,000 USD). At December
 31,
 2006, the Company had EGP 7,145,000 (USD 1,251,000) available under these
 credit facilities.

NOTES
 TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 

The
 Company has a credit facility with a Canadian bank in the amount of Canadian
 Dollar 500,000 (USD 429,000) that bears interest at market rate, secured by
 all
 Canadian assets. At December 31, 2006, the Company had the full amount available
 under this line. 

In
 conjunction with the acquisition of SL Limitada, GSE entered into a five year
 installment obligation with the Seller of SL Limitada for 4.5 million, secured
 by a share pledge agreement for 30 of the equity of GSE Lining Technology
 Chile, S. A., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GSE. The installment
 obligation bears interest at 5 for the first two years, converting to a
 variable rate based on the London Interbank Offer Rates (LIBOR) for the
 remaining term. Payments are in five annual principal and interest amounts
 beginning on January 1, 2007. 

Other
 Debt -

In
 connection with the ProGreen acquisition, GSE entered into a three-year
 unsecured promissory note in the original principal amount of 2.7 million.
 The
 note bears interest at the rate of 5.13 per annum and is payable in three
 equal
 annual principal payments of 900,000 plus accrued interest commencing October
 13, 2007. 

Derivative
 Financial Instruments - 

As
 of
 December 31, 2006, the Company has an interest rate swap outstanding with a
 notional amount of 75 million. The swap was entered into in January 2005 as
 a
 mechanism to convert 75 million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt.
 Due
 to a SFAS 133 interpretation issued in 2005, effective January 1, 2006, the
 Company is no longer able to apply the short cut method of accounting for its
 interest rate swap. As of December 31, 2005, the fair value of the interest
 rate
 swap agreement of 3,110,000 was recorded in other liabilities with a
 corresponding decrease in the carrying value of debt. 

Because
 the Company no longer qualifies for the short cut method, the Company elected
 not to use hedge accounting. Beginning January 1, 2006, the Company began
 accreting the 3,110,000 reduction in the carrying value of debt as a yield
 adjustment to interest expense over the life of the debt. In 2006, accretion
 of
 this discount increased interest expense by approximately 484,000. In addition,
 on January 1, 2006, the Company began marking to market the liability for the
 change in value of the interest rate swap and reflecting the change in value
 in
 the line item titled Change in Fair Value of Derivatives in the Consolidated
 Statement of Income/(Loss). In 2006, the fair value of the interest rate swap
 recorded in other liabilities had increased to 3,273,000. During 2006, the
 Company recorded 163,000 of expense related to the mark-to-market change in
 value of the interest rate swap. 

In
 connection with the Merger, the Company issued 150,000,000 of 11 senior notes
 due in 2012. Within the terms of the senior notes are two embedded derivatives
 that allow for optional early redemption of the senior notes. With expiration
 dates of May 15, 2007 and May 15, 2008, these embedded derivatives are not
 considered clearly and closely related to the debt agreement and therefore
 are
 required to be valued separately from the senior notes. The fair value of these
 options as of December 31, 2006 was 1,000 and is recorded in other assets.
 Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in the line item
 Change in Fair Value of Derivatives . For the years ended December 31, 2006 and
 2005, the expense was 60,000 and 264,000, respectively. 

At
 the
 date of the issuance of the senior notes, the fair value of the embedded
 derivates was determined to be 324,000. This amount was recorded in other
 assets with a corresponding credit to the carrying value of the senior notes.
 This premium is amortized as a yield adjustment to interest expense over the
 life of the debt. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, amortization
 of this premium reduced interest expense by approximately 40,000 and 64,000,
 respectively.

 Transaction 2004 

On
 May
 18, 2004, GEO Sub Corp., a newly formed entity controlled by Code Hennessy
 
Simmons IV LP CHS IV ), merged with and into the Company, with the Company
 surviving the Merger , and each share of Company common stock converted into
 the right to receive 18.50 in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately
 242,100,000. As a result of the Merger, all of the outstanding capital stock
 of
 the Company is owned by GEO Holdings Corp., which is controlled by CHS IV,
 an
 entity controlled by Code Hennessy Simmons LLC (CHS). 

The
 acquisition of the Company in the Merger was accounted for under the purchase
 method of accounting. Under purchase accounting, the purchase price was
 allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and
 liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, with the remainder
 allocated to goodwill. The increase in basis of the assets will result in
 non-cash charges in future periods, principally related to the step-up in the
 value of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets. 

The
 aggregate purchase price of approximately 242,100,000 included 229,100,000
 paid for all of the outstanding stock and stock options of the Company,
 6,794,000 of closing costs and fees, 5,400,000 for the value of management
 stock options exchanged (see Note 13) and the assumption of 806,000 of debt.
 Company cash on hand of 5,087,000 was used to pay a portion of the closing
 costs. GEO Holdings had no operations prior to the acquisition of the
 Company. 

The
 total
 purchase price was allocated among the fair value of acquired assets and
 liabilities, primarily property and equipment and inventory, including
 24,200,000 before taxes allocated to finite life intangible assets, which
 are
 comprised primarily of the value of customer lists and contracts in the United
 States, Europe, and Thailand. The average amortization period for these
 intangible assets is slightly less than 10 years. The fair values of property,
 equipment and finite life intangible assets were determined utilizing a third
 party appraisal firm.

 Acquisition Activity 

On
 January 18, 2006, GSE International (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company)
 entered into a share purchase agreement with Naue GmbH CO KG Naue to
 acquire all the issued and outstanding shares Naue held in the capital of
 Bentofix Technologies, Inc. for 2,400,000 CDN 2,066,649 US). The purchase
 of
 these shares increased the Company s ownership percentage in Bentofix
 Technologies from 51 to 75.5 and was recorded as a 1,600,000 reduction in
 the
 minority interest obligation and an increase of 466,649 to
 goodwill. 

During
 2005 the Company vigorously pursued two acquisition candidates in competition
 with other buyers, which proved unsuccessful. The Company performed extensive
 due diligence activities and was in negotiation with sellers over several
 months. Expenses totaling 1,018,000 were primarily from fees incurred for
 legal, accounting and professional services assisting with due diligence efforts
 and contract negotiations.

 Fair value of financial instruments 

In
 January 2005, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which
 effectively converted 75,000,000 of its 11 fixed rate 150,000,000 senior
 notes into variable rates based on six-month LIBOR rates. Under the swap
 agreement, payments made or received are based on the Company paying variable
 rates; currently 11.9994 through May 15, 2007, adjusted based on LIBOR rates
 every six months thereafter, and receiving a fixed rate of 11 . The
 fair
 value of the swap is carried as an asset or a liability on the Consolidated
 Balance Sheet. The fair value of the Company s interest rate swap represents the
 estimated amount the Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreement
 as
 of the reporting dates. The fair value of the interest rate swap was
 3,273,000) and 3,190,000) at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
 respectively, which is recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
 For
 the year 2006, the Company recorded an expense of 582,000 in Other
 (income)/expense, net for the cash settlements in connection with the interest
 rate swap. In 2005, the Company reduced interest expense by 609,000 for the
 cash settlement received in connection with the interest rate swap. 

The
 Company s other financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash
 equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and debt instruments. The book
 values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and trade payables and
 floating-rate debt instruments are considered to be representative of their
 respective fair values due to the nature of these instruments. The Company
 had
 150,000,000 of fixed-rate debt instruments at December 31, 2006 and 2005 with
 fair values of approximately 144,750,000 and 144,000,000, respectively. The
 fair value of long-term debt was estimated based on quoted market prices for
 these or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for
 debt
 of the same remaining maturities. The difference between the fair value and
 the
 carrying value represents the theoretical net discount or premium the Company
 would receive or pay to retire all debt at such date.

 Stockholder s equity 

Predecessor 

The
 Company s board of directors adopted a qualified employee stock purchase plan on
 October 16, 1991, effective January 1, 1992. The plan as subsequently amended
 and restated authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000 shares of common stock
 for
 purchase by participating employees, as defined in the plan, at a 15 discount
 from the market price through December 1, 2006. As of December 31, 2003, 67,193
 had been issued under this plan. During January 2004, the Company issued an
 additional 2,031 shares under this plan. After this issuance of shares, the
 employee stock purchase plan was terminated. 

In
 1986,
 the Company s board of directors adopted an employee stock option plan (the
 1986 Employee Plan ). This Plan, as amended, permitted up to 850,000 stock
 options to be granted. The plan permitted the grant of both incentive and
 non-qualified stock options to employees of the Company. Each option is
 exercisable for a period of up to ten years after it is granted. Unless the
 terms of the option specify otherwise, options may be exercised in respect
 of
 33-1/3 , 66-2/3 and 100 of the shares covered, upon the third, fourth and
 fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. The option price cannot be less than
 the fair market value of the shares on the date the option is
 granted. 

In
 1995,
 the Company s board of directors adopted the 1995 Incentive Stock Plan (the
 1995 Employee Plan ). The 1995 Employee Plan, as subsequently amended and
 restated in 2001, permits the grant of up to 2,400,000 stock awards. This
 authorized amount has been reduced by any options exercised or outstanding
 under
 the 1986 Employee Plan. The 1995 Employee Plan provides for the grant of (i)
 non-qualified stock options, (ii) incentive stock options, (iii) shares of
 restricted stock, (iv) shares of phantom stock, and (v) stock bonuses
 (collectively, Incentive Awards ). In addition, the 1995 Employee Plan permits
 the grant of cash bonuses payable when a participant is required to recognize
 income for federal income tax purposes in connection with the vesting of shares
 of restricted stock or the grant of a stock bonus. Key employees, including
 officers (whether or not they are directors), of the Company and its
 subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the 1995 Employee Plan. Each
 non-qualified stock option issued under the 1995 Employee Plan is granted for
 a
 period up to seven years after it is granted and may be exercised in respect
 of
 50 and 100 of the shares covered upon the first and second anniversaries
 of
 the date of grant. The option price cannot be less than the fair market value
 of
 the shares on the date the option is granted. 

During
 1988, the Company s board of directors adopted a director stock option plan (the
 1988 Director Plan ), which permits the grant of up to 75,000 non-qualified 
stock options to non-employee directors. The terms of this plan are
 substantially the same as those of the 1986 Employee Plan. This Plan was
 terminated in December 1995 and subsequently replaced by the 1996 Non-Qualified
 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors. 

During
 1996, the Company s board of directors adopted the 1996 Non-Qualified Stock
 Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the 1996 Director Plan ). The 1996
 Director Plan authorizes an aggregate of 100,000 shares, of non-qualified stock
 options to be issued to non-employee directors. The 1996 Director Plan provides
 for the automatic annual grant to each non-employee director of a five year
 option to purchase 2,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal
 to
 the market price on the date of grant. The options were granted immediately
 following each annual meeting of stockholders, with each option to vest and
 become exercisable in its entirety one year from the date of grant.

GEO
 Holdings Corp. 2004 (Successor) Stock Option Plan 

The
 GEO
 Holdings Corp. (GEO Holdings) 2004 Stock Option Plan (the GEO Holdings Option
 Plan became effective upon the consummation of the CHS Merger. Under the GEO
 Holdings Option Plan, the board of directors of GEO Holdings (or a committee
 thereof) may from time to time grant options to purchase common stock of GEO
 Holdings representing up to 628,750 (229,487 unissued as of December 31, 2006)
 shares of GEO Holdings common stock on a fully-diluted basis immediately
 following the consummation of the Merger to executives or other key employees
 or
 directors of GEO Holdings and its subsidiaries. Both nonqualified stock
 options and incentive stock options may be granted under the GEO Holdings
 Option Plan with terms to be determined by the board of directors (or a
 committee thereof). The 333,600 options to purchase GEO Holdings common stock
 received by certain of the Company s executives in exchange for options to
 purchase GSE common stock on the closing date of the Merger pursuant to
 executive securities agreements, which represented approximately 10 of GEO
 Holdings common stock on a fully-diluted basis immediately following the
 completion of the Merger, were issued under the GEO Holdings Option Plan. The
 weighted average exercise price of the exchanged options is 3.67 per share.

These
 exchanged options are exercisable at any time and expire ten years from the
 date
 of grant, unless the holder is terminated for cause, as defined in the GEO
 Holdings Option Plan. In connection with a termination for cause, the Company
 or
 CHS IV has (1) the obligation to repurchase such options for the
 original cost, which is 18.50 less the original predecessor option s exercise
 price (which averages 3.67), and (2) the right, but not the obligation, to
 purchase any outstanding common stock held as a result of exercising such
 options for the lesser of fair market value or original cost. Should the holder
 separate from the Company for any reason other than cause, the Company or
 CHS IV would have the right but not the obligation to purchase any of the
 outstanding exchanged options or common stock held as a result of exercising
 such options for the greater of fair market value or original cost. 

As
 required by FASB Interpretation No. 45, the fair value of the exchanged
 options of 5,400,000 has been included in the aggregate purchase price paid
 by
 GEO Holdings for the Successor Company (see Note 10). The fair value was
 determined utilizing the minimum value method prescribed in SFAS 123. See
 Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Stock-Based Compensation

At
 December 31, 2006, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal
 income tax purposes of 27,305,000 which will begin to expire, if unused,
 in
 2023. The Company also has foreign tax credit carryforwards for federal income
 tax purposes of 4,218,000 which will begin to expire, if unused, in 2009.
 In
 addition, the Company has an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward
 of
 806,000, which does not expire. A valuation allowance of 1,579,000 was
 recorded in 2006 against the foreign tax credits generated on foreign earnings
 repatriated in 2006. The valuation allowance was recorded based on management s
 best estimate that it is more likely than not that a portion of the federal
 and
 state foreign tax credits will not be realized. At December 31, 2006, the
 valuation allowance on foreign tax credits and state net operating losses
 was
 4,746,000. If the Company is ultimately able to utilize all of the foreign
 tax
 credits that existed at May 18, 2004, 2,575,000 of this recorded valuation
 allowance would be allocated to reduce goodwill. During 2006, a deferred
 tax
 asset not given recognition in the opening balance sheet of the Chile
 acquisition (see Note 10) was realized. A reversal of the valuation allowance
 totaling 203,000 related to the utilization of that asset was recorded as
 a
 reduction to goodwill. The 2006 tax expense included 540,000 related to
 prior
 years state income and foreign taxes. 

Undistributed
 retained earnings of the Company s foreign subsidiaries amounted to
 approximately 24,146,000 at December 31, 2006. Provision for U.S. federal
 and
 state income taxes has not been provided for earnings considered to be
 indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of
 dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to both U.S. income taxes
 (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable
 to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of the
 unrecognized deferred tax asset/liability, if any, for temporary differences
 related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent
 in
 duration is not practicable.

NOTES
 TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 

The
 Company has completed its evaluation of the repatriation provision included
 in
 The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act ). The Company has determined
 that any U.S. income tax on 2005 repatriations is offset by a corresponding
 foreign tax credit, and therefore no provision has been provided on amounts
 repatriated under the Act in 2005. 

(15)
 Employee benefit plans 

The
 Company has a defined contribution employee benefit plan under which
 substantially all U.S. employees are eligible to participate. The Company
 matches a portion of the employees contributions. During 2006, the Company
 contributed 602,000 to the plan. During 2005, the Company contributed 614,000
 to the Plan. During 2004, the Predecessor Company contributed 274,000, and
 the
 Successor Company contributed 391,000 to the plan. Under the terms of the
 plan,
 contributions to the plan may be discontinued at any time. 

(16)
 Concentration of credit and other risks 

Accounts
 receivable, as financial instruments, could potentially subject the Company
 to
 concentrations of credit risk. The Company continuously evaluates the
 creditworthiness of its customers and may require customers to provide letters
 of credit to guarantee payments. During 2006, 2005, 2004, one customer accounted
 for13 , 13 , and 20 of sales and operating revenue, respectively. At December
 31, 2006 and 2005, 18 and 12 of the Company s consolidated accounts receivable
 were due from this one customer. 

The
 Company currently purchases its raw material (polyethylene and polypropylene
 resins) from at least two suppliers at each location. Polyethylene resins are
 occasionally in short supply and are subject to substantial price fluctuation
 in
 response to market demand. The Company has not encountered any significant
 prolonged difficulty to date in obtaining raw materials in sufficient quantities
 to support its operations at current or expected near-term future levels.
 However, any disruption in raw material supply or abrupt increases in raw
 material prices could have an adverse effect upon the Company s
 operations. 

(17)
 Commitments and contingencies 

Product
 warranties and insurance coverage 

The
 Company s products are sold and installed with specified limited warranties as
 to material quality and workmanship. These limited warranties may last for
 up to
 20 years, but are generally limited to repair or replacement by the Company
 of
 the defective liner or the dollar amount of the contract involved, on a prorated
 basis. The Company may also indemnify the site owner or general contractor
 for
 other damages resulting from negligence of the Company s employees. The Company
 accrues a warranty reserve based on estimates for warranty claims.
 This estimate is based on historical claims history and current business
 activities and is accrued at a cost of sales in the period such business
 activity occurs. The table below reflects a summary of activity of the Company s
 operations for warranty obligations through December 31, 2006 (in
 thousands):

Although
 the Company is not exposed to the type of potential liability that might arise
 from being in the business of handling, transporting or storing hazardous waste
 or materials, the Company could be susceptible to liability for environmental
 damage or personal injury resulting from defects in the Company s products or
 negligence by Company employees in the installation of its lining systems.
 Such
 liability could be substantial because of the potential that hazardous or other
 waste materials might leak out of their containment system into the environment.
 The Company maintains liability insurance, which includes contractor s pollution
 liability coverage in amounts which it believes to be prudent. However, there
 is
 no assurance that this coverage will remain available to the Company. While
 the
 Company s claims experience to date may not be a meaningful measure of its
 potential exposure for product liability, the Company has experienced no
 material losses from defects in products and installations. 

Bonding
 - Bank Guarantees 

The
 Company, in some direct sales and installation contracting situations, is
 required to post performance bonds or bank guarantees as part of the contractual
 guarantee for its performance. The performance bonds or bank guarantees can
 be
 in the full amount of the contracts. To date the Company has not received any
 claims against any of the posted securities, most of which terminate at the
 final completion date of the contracts. As of December 31, 2006, the Company
 had
 11,612,000 of bonds outstanding and 4,066,000 of guarantees issued under
 its
 bank lines. 

Litigation
 and claims 

The
 Company was a third-party defendant in a lawsuit that was filed in September
 1997 in the Supreme Court of New York, County of Richmond (Mario Cicala v.
 Interstate Industrial Corporation, Stearns, Conrad and Schmidt Consulting
 Engineers, Inc., Interstate Industrial Corporation v. Gundle Lining Construction
 Corp. and Gundle Lining Construction Corp. v. The City of New York; Case No.
 13076/97). The plaintiff, Mario Cicala, was a Company employee who slipped
 and
 fell at a job site and brought a claim against the primary defendants for
 20,000,000. On July 19, 2006, the defendants compromised and settled the
 plaintiff s personal injury damage claim for 1.4 million and waiver of worker s
 compensation subrogation rights. The Company paid 900,000 of the settlement
 cost, none of which was reimbursed by its insurance carrier, Reliance National
 Insurance in Liquidation. The Texas Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty
 Association and New York Liquidation Bureau contributed 350,000 to the
 settlement, along with 150,000 from Interstate Industrial Corp. The Company
 recorded a charge of 900,000 in the second quarter of 2006 to reflect the
 settlement of the Cicala lawsuit. 

On
 January 14, 2004, the Company received a letter from Shire Equipment Leasing
 Corporation Shire (Defendant, along with Robert Steinberg, as trustee for
 the bankruptcy estate of Pro Air, Inc.) relating to litigation instituted by
 Wembley Ltd., the Company s largest stockholder prior to the Merger. In the
 litigation, Wembley is seeking a declaratory judgment that neither Pro Air,
 Inc., nor Shire, Pro Air s Assignee, ever acquired an ownership interest in
 1,100,000 shares of the Company owned by Wembley. The dispute relates to
 Wembley s delivery to Pro Air in 1997 of a stock certificate representing the
 disputed shares along with an assignment of stock, or stock power, which
 provided that the assignment of the Company s shares was valid only if done in
 compliance with certain specified conditions. The parties disagree as to whether
 those conditions were met. In April 1998, Pro Air asked the Company to reflect
 Pro Air on the Company s books as the holder of record of the disputed shares,
 but the Company declined to do so, informing Pro Air that it had no record
 of
 Pro Air being a Company shareholder. Shire indicated in its January 2004 letter
 that it would pursue claims against the Company if testimony revealed that
 the
 Company acted in concert with Wembley to prevent the transfer of the disputed
 shares.

NOTES
 TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 

On
 December 16, 2004, Wembley prevailed in its declaratory judgment action with
 the
 issuance of a judgment that neither Pro Air nor Shire, Pro Air s assignee, ever
 acquired an ownership interest in the 1,100,000 shares. Shire has filed an
 appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and Wembley has filed a cross
 appeal. On April 20, 2005, the trial court granted Shire s motion to stay
 execution of the judgment. 

The
 Company believes that this dispute is between Wembley and Shire. Accordingly,
 if
 a claim is asserted against the Company, the Company intends to defend itself
 vigorously. 

The
 Company is also a party to various other legal actions arising in the ordinary
 course of our business. These legal actions cover a broad variety of claims
 spanning our entire business. As of the date of this filing, we believe it
 is
 not reasonably possible that resolution of these legal actions will,
 individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our
 financial condition or results of operations. 

Operating
 Leases 

The
 Company leases certain equipment through operating lease arrangements of varying
 terms. Annual rental expense under the terms of non-cancelable operating leases
 is less than 1 of consolidated revenues. 

(18)
 Segment Information 

The
 Company operates exclusively in the geosynthetic liner market. Substantially
 all
 sales and operating revenues result from the sale and installation of the
 Company s manufactured products. These products are manufactured and sold in
 various locations throughout the world using similar raw materials (polyethylene
 resin), production processes (flat or round die extrusion) and distribution
 channels (product and installation sales made directly to customers or through
 representatives of the Company). 

Statement
 of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures
 about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information 
 allows
 the aggregation of an enterprise s segments if they are similar. The Company
 operates in different geographic areas; however, the Company has reviewed the
 aggregation criteria and determined that the Company operates as one segment
 based on the high degree of similarity of the following aspects of the Company s
 operations: 

nature
 of the products and services, 

raw
 materials and production processes
 used, 

customers
 and markets served, 

methods
 used to distribute products and
 services, 

effects
 of regulatory influences on the market, and the economic characteristics
 of the products and services in different geographical
 areas.

 Related Party Transaction 

Management
 Agreement with CHS Management IV LP 

In
 connection with the Merger, the Company entered into a management agreement
 with
 GEO Holdings and CHS Management IV LP CHS Management a limited partnership
 (1) of which CHS is the general partner and (2) which is the general partner
 of
 CHS IV. Pursuant to the management agreement, CHS Management provides certain
 financial and management consulting services to GEO Holdings and to us. In
 consideration of those services the Company pays fees to CHS Management in
 an
 aggregate annual amount of 2,000,000, payable in equal monthly installments.
 The Company also agreed to reimburse CHS Management for its reasonable travel
 and other out-of-pocket expenses. The Company also provides customary
 indemnification to CHS Management. In connection with the structuring and
 implementation of the Merger and related financing transactions, GEO Holdings
 paid CHS management fees in the aggregate amount of 5,000,000 at the completion
 of the Merger. Under the Management Agreement, GEO Holdings will pay CHS
 Management a fee equal to 5 of any additional proceeds of GEO Holdings capital
 stock purchased from time to time by CHS Management or its affiliates. The
 management fee is subordinated to the prior payment in full of principal,
 interest and premium due and owing under its senior credit facility and the
 indenture governing the senior notes, but we may pay the management fee at
 all
 times except during certain events of default under its senior credit facility
 or under the indenture governing the senior notes. In the event any portion
 of
 the management fee is not so paid, such amount will accrue and become due and
 payable in the next month when payment is permitted. During 2006, 2005 and
 2004,
 the Company paid CHS 2,069,000, 2,016,000 and 1,287,000, respectively, under
 this agreement. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were no amounts payable
 to
 CHS under this agreement. 

(20)
 Condensed Consolidated Guarantor and Non-Guarantor Financial Information 

The
 payment of obligations of the Company under the senior notes is guaranteed
 by
 all of the Company s domestic subsidiaries other than Bentofix Technologies
 (USA), Inc. Subsidiary Guarantors ). Each of these Subsidiary Guarantors is
 included in the Company s consolidated financial statements and has fully and
 unconditionally guaranteed the senior notes on a joint and several basis.
 Separate financial statements and other disclosures concerning the Subsidiary
 Guarantors have not been presented because management believes that such
 information is not material to investors. The following supplemental financial
 information sets forth, on a combined basis, balance sheet, statement of
 operations and cash flows information for Gundle/SLT Environmental,
 Inc., the subsidiary guarantors and non-guarantor
 subsidiaries.

The
 Company has no outstanding publicly held common shares and therefore will not
 report earnings per share data. 

As
 noted
 in Note 14, the first and second quarter of 2005 include tax charges of
 1,241,000 and 119,000 respectively, for the reinstatement of a valuation
 allowance previously recorded as an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter
 of
 2004. 

Included
 in the fourth quarter are amounts relating to previous periods that reduce
 the
 recorded loss before income taxes by 417,000 and increase the recorded tax
 benefit by 188,000. These amounts are not material to any individual period.
 In
 addition, the fourth quarter includes a charge of 1,238,000 for a change in
 estimate regarding the accrual of year end incentive bonuses. The change in
 estimate was due to the achievement of higher operating income in the quarter
 than was forecasted through the first nine months of 2005. 

Included
 prior years tax adjustments in the second and fourth quarters of 390,000 and
 150,000, respectively, for the required valuation allowance for state net
 operating losses which no valuation allowance had previously been provided
 and
 prior years adjustments for state income and foreign taxes.

 New Accounting Pronouncements 

In
 June
 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting
 for Uncertainty in Income Taxes 
 FIN
 48 ), an interpretation of Statement No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the criteria and
 approach for recognition, derecognition and measurement of uncertain tax
 positions. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material
 impact on the financial position or results of operations.

 Subsequent Event

 January 2007, the Board of Directors approved the granting of 35,895 stock
 options to certain employee of the Company.
