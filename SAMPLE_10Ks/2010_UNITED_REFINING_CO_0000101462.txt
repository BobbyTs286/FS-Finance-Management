ITEM 1. 
 BUSINESS. Introduction United Refining Company is a Pennsylvania Corporation that began business operations in 1902. We are the leading integrated refiner and marketer of petroleum products in our primary market area, which
encompasses western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania. We own and operate a medium complexity 70,000 barrel per day bpd petroleum refinery in Warren, Pennsylvania where we produce a variety of products, including various grades of
gasoline, ultra low sulfur diesel fuel, kerosene, No. 2 heating oil and asphalt. Operations are organized into two business segments: wholesale and retail. The wholesale segment is responsible for the acquisition of crude oil, petroleum
refining, supplying petroleum products to the retail segment and the marketing of petroleum products to wholesale and industrial customers. 
 The retail segment sells petroleum products under the Kwik Fill , Citgo , Keystone and Country Fair brand names at a network of Company-operated retail units and convenience and grocery items through convenience stores under the Red Apple Food Mart and Country Fair brand names. As of August 31, 2010, (sometimes referred to as fiscal 2010 ), we operated 366 units, of which, 184 units are owned, 120 units are
leased, and the remaining stores are operated under a management agreement. Approximately 20 of the gasoline stations within this network are branded Citgo pursuant to a license agreement granting us the right to use Citgo s applicable brand names, trademarks and other forms of Citgo s identification. For
fiscal 2010 approximately 59 and 24 of our gasoline and distillate production, respectively, was sold through our retail network. 
 For fiscal 2010, we had total net sales of 2.7 billion, of which approximately 53 were derived from gasoline sales, approximately 37 
were from sales of other petroleum products and 10 were from sales of merchandise and other revenue. Our capacity utilization rates have averaged 90 for the last five years. 
 We believe that the location of our 70,000 bpd refinery in
Warren, Pennsylvania provides us with a transportation cost advantage over our competitors, which is significant within an approximately 100 mile radius of our refinery. For example, in Buffalo, New York over our last five fiscal years, and
including fiscal 2010, we have experienced approximately 2.2 cents per gallon transportation cost advantage over those competitors who are required to ship gasoline by pipeline and truck from New York Harbor sources to Buffalo. We own and operate
the Kiantone Pipeline, a 78-mile long crude oil pipeline which connects the refinery to Canadian, U.S. and world crude oil sources through the Enbridge Pipelines Inc. and affiliates (collectively, Enbridge pipeline system. Utilizing the
storage capability of the pipeline, we are able to blend various grades of crude oil from different suppliers, allowing us to efficiently schedule production while managing feedstock mix and product yields in order to optimize profitability.
 It is our view that the high construction costs
and the stringent regulatory requirements inherent in petroleum refinery operations make it uneconomical for new competing refineries to be constructed in our primary market area. The nearest fuels refinery is over 160 miles from Warren,
Pennsylvania and we believe that no significant production from such refinery is currently shipped into our primary market area. 
 Our primary market area is western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania and our core market area encompasses our Warren County base and
the eight contiguous counties in New York and Pennsylvania. Our retail gasoline and merchandise sales are split approximately 60 / 40 between rural and urban markets. Margins on gasoline sales are traditionally higher in rural markets, while
gasoline sales volume is greater in urban markets. Our urban markets include Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, New York and Erie, Pennsylvania. 
 As of August 31, 2010, 168 of our retail units were located in New York, 185 in Pennsylvania and 13 in Ohio. In fiscal year 2010,
approximately 59 of the refinery s gasoline production was sold through our retail network. In addition to gasoline, all units sell convenience merchandise, 106 are Quick Serve Restaurants QSRs including franchise operations and
eight of the units are full-service truck stops. Customers may pay

for purchases with credit cards including our own Kwik
Fill credit card. In addition to this credit card, we maintain a fleet credit card catering to regional truck
and automobile fleets. Sales of convenience products, which tend to have constant margins throughout the year, have served to reduce the effects of the seasonality inherent in gasoline retail margins. 
 Recent Developments 
 The Company continues to be impacted by the volatility in
petroleum markets in fiscal year 2011. The lagged 3-2-1 crackspread as measured by the difference between the price of crude oil contracts traded on the NYMEX for the proceeding month to the prices of NYMEX gasoline and heating oil contracts in the
current trading month, have been negatively affected by consistently fluctuating petroleum prices. The Company uses a lagged crackspread as a margin indicator as it reflects the time period between the purchase of crude oil and its delivery to the
refinery for processing. The lagged crackspread for the month of September in fiscal year 2011 was 7.36 as compared to 10.46 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, a decrease of 3.10 or 30 . The lagged crackspread for October of fiscal year
2011 was 15.17, an increase of 4.71 or 45 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. In June 2010, the Company announced changes to the healthcare and pension plans provided to salaried employees. Effective September 1, 2010, postretirement medical benefits for new hires and active
salaried employees retiring after September 1, 2010 were eliminated. Additionally, effective January 1, 2011, deductibles and co-payments will be added to the medical benefits plan for all plan participants. For salaried employees
meeting certain age and service requirements, the Company will contribute a defined dollar amount towards the cost of retiree healthcare based upon the employee s length of service. Similarly, effective August 31,
2010, benefits under the Company s defined benefit pension plan were frozen for all salaried employees, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Company will provide an enhanced
contribution under its defined contribution 401(k) plan for all eligible employees as well as a transition contribution for older employees. 
 On July 26, 2010, a rupture occurred in Line 6B pipeline on Enbridge s Lakehead system in Michigan. The Company s heavy
crude oil purchases are shipped on Line 6B from western Canada. As a result, on August 5, 2010, the Company was forced to reduce production in its crude processing unit until such time as the Enbridge Line 6B could be repaired. As a result,
during the month of August, crude run rates were reduced by approximately 41 from scheduled crude runs of 69,500 bbl per day to 40,900 bbl per day and further reduced in September to an average of 38,000 bbl per day. For the month of October,
actual crude runs were reduced an additional 8,740 bbl per day due to the Enbridge s pipeline disruption. The interruption of heavy crude deliveries via Line 6B also negatively affected asphalt production by 65 from the planned production of
656,000 bbl to actual production of 240,000 bbl at the peak of the asphalt selling season. The Company s supply group maintained crude sourcing at a reduced rate for the refinery during the disruption to Line 6B through other Enbridge
pipelines. On September 28, 2010, Enbridge
began a phased restart and return to service of Line 6B. Line 6B is currently operating at approximately 80 of the total capacity and meeting 100 of shipping demand. 
 The Company s property insurance covering the refinery
operation contains a provision for contingent business interruption, which limits of coverage are separate from the general limits applying to direct damage to the refinery. The Company has placed the insurers on notice of the Enbridge loss.
 The Company is in the process of quantifying its
resultant losses during the disruption, and intends to seek restitution from Enbridge for the losses it has incurred as a result of this pipeline rupture.

 Industry Overview 
 We are a regional refiner and marketer located primarily in
Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts I PADD I ). As of January 1, 2010, there were 13 operable refineries operating in PADD I with a combined crude processing capacity of 1.4 million bpd, representing approximately 8 
of U.S. refining capacity. Petroleum product consumption during calendar year 2009 in PADD I averaged 5.61 million bpd, representing approximately 30 of U.S. demand based on industry statistics reported by the Energy Information Administration EIA ). According to the EIA, prime supplier sales volume of gasoline in the region decreased by approximately 4.2 during the five-year period ending December 2009. Refined petroleum production in PADD I is insufficient to satisfy demand
for such products in the region, making PADD I a net importer of such products. Domestic refinery capacity utilization decreased from 83 crude capacity utilization in 2008 to 82 in 2009 due to nationwide and global uncertainty. 
 Refining Operations 
 The Company s refinery is located on a 92-acre site in
Warren, Pennsylvania. The refinery has a nominal capacity of 70,000 bpd of crude oil processing and averaged saleable production of approximately 58,500 bpd during fiscal 2010. 
 See Item 1. Business Recent Developments; for
reduction in crude processing due to the Enbridge Pipeline rupture on Line 6B. The annual shutdown of the reformer unit to regenerate its catalyst and shutdown of the gasoline and distillate hydrotreaters to replace their catalysts was completed during late February and early March,
2010. Shutdown durations were ten days for the reformer, eleven days for the gasoline hydrotreater, and sixteen days for the distillate hydrotreater. Crude oil throughput during this time was reduced to 37,000 barrels per day to manage
intermediate product inventories. Ethanol
blending into gasoline began in August, 2010, and by September, 2010, the new ethanol storage and injection system was commissioned to blend ten percent ethanol into all gasoline production. We believe our geographic location in the product short PADD I is a significant marketing advantage. Our
refinery is located in northwestern Pennsylvania and is geographically distant from the majority of PADD I refining capacity. The nearest fuels refinery is over 160 miles from Warren, Pennsylvania and we believe that no significant production from
such refinery is currently shipped into our primary market area. Products We produce three primary petroleum products: gasoline, middle distillates, and asphalt. We presently produce two grades of unleaded gasoline, 87-octane regular and 93-octane premium. We also blend our 87
and 93 octane gasoline to produce a mid-grade 89-octane. In fiscal year 2010, approximately 59 of our gasoline production was sold through our retail network and the remaining 41 of such production was sold to wholesale customers. 
 Middle distillates include kerosene, ultra low sulfur diesel
fuel, and No. 2 heating oil. For fiscal 2010, approximately 76 of our distillate production was sold to wholesale customers and the remaining 24 through our retail network. 
 We optimize our bottom of the barrel processing by producing
asphalt, a higher value alternative to residual fuel oil. Asphalt production as a percentage of all refinery production has exceeded 28 over the last five fiscal years due to our ability and decision to process a larger amount of less costly heavy
higher sulfur content crude oil in order to realize higher overall refining margins. Asphalt is a residual product of the crude oil refining process, which is used primarily for construction and maintenance of roads and highways and as a component of roofing shingles. Distribution of
asphalt is localized, 
 6 

Table of Contents 

usually within a distance of 150 miles from a refinery or terminal, and demand is influenced by levels of federal, state, and local government funding for highway construction and maintenance and
by levels of roofing construction activities. We believe that an ongoing need for highway maintenance and domestic economic growth will sustain asphalt demand. 
 Refining Process 
 Our production of petroleum products from crude oil involves many complex steps, which are briefly summarized below. 
 We seek to maximize refinery profitability by selecting crude
oil and other feedstocks taking into account factors including product demand and pricing in our market areas as well as price, quality and availability of various grades of crude oil. We also consider product inventory levels and any planned
turnarounds of refinery units for maintenance. The combination of these factors is optimized by a sophisticated proprietary linear programming computer model, which selects the most profitable feedstock and product mix. The linear programming model
is continuously updated and improved to reflect changes in the product market place and in the refinery s processing capability. 
 Blended crude is stored in a tank farm near the refinery, which has a capacity of approximately 200,000 barrels. The blended crude is then
brought into the refinery where it is first distilled at low pressure into its component streams in the crude and preflash unit. This yields the following intermediate products: light products consisting of fuel gas components (methane and ethane)
and LPG (propane and butane), naphtha or gasoline, kerosene, diesel or heating oil, heavy atmospheric distillate, and crude tower bottoms which are further distilled under vacuum conditions to yield light and heavy vacuum distillates and asphalt.
The present capacity of the crude unit is 70,000 bpd. The intermediate products are then processed in downstream units and blended to produce finished products. A naphtha hydrotreater treats naphtha and FCC light catalytic naptha with hydrogen across a fixed
bed catalyst to remove sulfur before further treatment. The treated naphtha is then distilled into light and heavy naphtha at a prefractionator. Light naphtha is then sent to an isomerization unit and heavy naphtha is sent to a reformer, in each
case for octane enhancement. The isomerization unit converts the light naphtha catalytically into a gasoline component with 83 octane. The reformer unit converts the heavy naphtha into another gasoline component with up to 94 octane depending upon
the desired octane requirement for the grade of gasoline to be produced. The reformer also produces as a co-product all the hydrogen needed to operate hydrotreating units in the refinery. Raw kerosene is treated with hydrogen at a distillate hydrotreater to remove sulfur to make finished kerosene.
A distillate hydrotreater built in 1993 and modified in 2006 also treats raw distillates to produce ultra low sulfur diesel fuel. 
 The long molecular chains of the heavy atmospheric and vacuum distillates are broken or cracked in the FCC unit and separated
and recovered in the gas concentration unit to produce fuel gas, propylene, butylene, LPG, light and heavy catalytic naptha gasoline, light cycle oil and clarified oil. Fuel gas is burned within the refinery, propylene is fed to a polymerization
unit which polymerizes its molecules into a larger chain to produce an 87 octane gasoline component, butylene is fed into an alkylation unit to produce a gasoline component and LPG is treated to remove trace quantities of water and then sold.
Clarified oil is burned in the refinery or sold. Various refinery gasoline components are blended together in refinery tankage to produce 87 octane and 93 octane finished gasoline. Likewise, light cycle oil is blended with other distillates to
produce No. 2 heating oil. FCC light and heavy catalytic naptha is hydrotreated in order to meet new more stringent legally mandated limits on gasoline sulfur content which took effect January 1, 2008, and a portion of the light cycle oil
is hydrotreated in order to meet new more stringent legally mandated limits on diesel fuel sulfur content which took effect June 1, 2006.

 Our refining configuration allows the processing of a wide variety of crude oil inputs.
During the past five years our inputs have been of Canadian origin and range from light low sulfur (38 degrees API, 0.5 sulfur) to high sulfur heavy asphaltic (21 degrees API, 3.5 sulfur). Our ability to market asphalt on a year round basis
enables us to purchase selected heavier crude oils at higher differentials and thus at a lower cost. 
 Supply of Crude Oil 
 Substantially all of our crude supply is sourced from Canada through the Enbridge pipeline. We are however, not dependent on this source
alone. While not utilized during the closure of the Enbridge 6B pipeline because of the anticipated length of the disruption we could within 90 days, shift up to 70 of our crude oil requirements to some combination of domestic and offshore crude.
With additional time, 100 of our crude requirements could be obtained from non-Canadian sources. This change in crude supply could result in a different crude slate and alter product yields and product mix and could affect refinery profitability.
Sixty seven percent of our term contracts with our crude suppliers are on a month-to-month evergreen basis, with 60-to-90 day cancellation provisions; 33 of our term crude contracts are on an annual basis (with month to month pricing provisions).
As of August 31, 2010, we had supply contracts with 14 major suppliers for an aggregate of 54,200 bpd of crude oil. We have contracts with three suppliers amounting to 48 of daily crude oil supply (none more than 12,000 barrels per day). None
of the remaining suppliers accounted for more than 10 of our crude oil supply. We access crude through the Kiantone Pipeline, which connects with the Enbridge pipeline system in West Seneca, New York, which is near Buffalo. The Enbridge pipeline system provides access to most North
American and foreign crude oils through three primary routes: (i) Canadian crude oils are transported eastward from Alberta and other points in Canada, (ii) foreign crude oils unloaded at the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port are transported
north via the Capline and Chicap pipelines which connect to the Enbridge pipeline system at Mokena, Illinois, and (iii) foreign crude unloaded at Portland, Maine shipped to Montreal then shipped on Enbridge s line 9 to Sarnia, Ontario.
 The Kiantone Pipeline, a 78-mile Company-owned
and operated pipeline, connects our West Seneca, New York terminal at the pipeline s northern terminus to the refinery s tank farm at its southern terminus. We completed construction of the Kiantone Pipeline in 1971 and have operated it
continuously since then. We are the sole shipper on the Kiantone Pipeline, and can currently transport up to 70,000 bpd along the pipeline. Our right to maintain the pipeline is derived from approximately 265 separate easements, right-of-way
agreements, licenses, permits, leases and similar agreements. The pipeline operation is monitored by a computer at the refinery. Shipments of crude arriving at the West Seneca terminal are separated and stored in one of the terminal s three storage tanks, which
have an aggregate storage capacity of 485,000 barrels. The refinery tank farm has two additional crude storage tanks with a total capacity of 200,000 barrels. An additional 35,000 barrels of crude can be stored at the refinery. 
 Refinery Turnarounds 
 Turnaround cycles vary for different refinery units. A
planned turnaround of each of the two major refinery units (the crude unit and the FCC) is conducted approximately every three to five years, during which time such units are shutdown for internal inspection and repair. The most recent turnarounds
occurred in March and April 2007 at our crude unit and its related processing equipment, and in October and November 2007 at our FCC unit and its related processing equipment. A turnaround, which generally takes two to four weeks to complete in the
case of the two major refinery units, consists of a series of moderate to extensive maintenance exercises. Turnarounds are planned and accomplished in a manner that allows for reduced production during maintenance instead of a complete plant
shutdown. We defer the cost of turnarounds when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit, which ranges from 3 to 10 years (for tank turnarounds). Thus, we charge costs to production over the period most clearly
benefited by the turnarounds. The west end of the
refinery consisting of the FCC unit and related units were shutdown October 4, 2010 for a scheduled 28 day turnaround. The major activity during the turnaround in addition to normal shutdown maintenance was upgrading of the regenerator, flue
gas line and electrostatic precipitator at the FCC Unit. A 28 day maintenance turnaround is scheduled for the Crude unit beginning at the end of March 2011.

 The scheduled maintenance turnarounds result in an inventory build of petroleum products to
meet minimum sales demand during the maintenance shutdown period. 
 Marketing and Distribution 
 General 
 We have a long history of service within our market area. Our first retail service station was established in 1927 near the Warren,
Pennsylvania refinery, and we have steadily expanded our distribution network over the years. We maintain an approximate 60 / 40 split between sales at our rural and urban units. We believe this to be advantageous, balancing the higher gross margins and lower volumes often achievable due to
decreased competition in rural areas with higher volumes and lower gross margins in urban areas. We believe that our network of rural convenience store units provide an important alternative to traditional grocery store formats. In fiscal year 2010,
approximately 59 and 24 of our gasoline and distillate production, respectively, was sold through this retail network. 
 We deliver asphalt from the refinery to end user contractors by truck or railcar in addition to re-supplying our asphalt terminals in
Rochester, New York and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
 Retail Operations 
 As of August 31, 2010, we operated a retail-marketing network (including those stores operated under a management
agreement) that includes 366 retail units, of which 168 are located in western New York, 185 in northwestern Pennsylvania and 13 in eastern Ohio. We own 184 of these units. The retail segment sells petroleum products under the Kwik Fill , Citgo and Keystone brand names and
grocery items under the Red Apple Food Mart and Country Fair brand names. We believe that Red Apple Food
Mart , Kwik Fill , Country Fair , Keystone and Citgo are well-recognized names in our marketing areas. Approximately 20 of the gasoline stations within this network are branded Citgo pursuant to a license agreement granting us the right to use Citgo s applicable brand names, trademarks and
other forms of Citgo s identification. We believe that the Company operation of our retail units provides us with a significant advantage over competitors that operate wholly or partly through dealer arrangements because we have greater control
over pricing and operating expenses. We classify
our retail stores into four categories: convenience stores, limited gasoline stations, truck stop facilities, and other stores. Convenience stores sell a wide variety of foods, snacks, cigarettes and beverages and also provide self-service gasoline.
One hundred and six of our 366 retail outlets include QSRs where food is prepared on the premises for retail sales and also distribution to our other nearby units that do not have in-store delicatessens. Limited gasoline stations sell gasoline,
cigarettes, oil and related car care products and provide full service for gasoline customers. Truckstop facilities sell gasoline and diesel fuel on a self-service and full-service basis. All truckstops include either a full or mini convenience
store. Total merchandise sales for fiscal year
2010 were 258.6 million, with a gross profit of approximately 65.3 million. Gross margins on the sale of convenience merchandise averaged 25.2 for fiscal 2010 and have been relatively constant at 25.8 for the last three years. Merchandise sales
have shown continued positive growth. 
 Merchandise Supply 
 Tripifoods, Buffalo, New York is our primary wholesale grocery supplier for our entire chain. During fiscal year 2010, we purchased
approximately 76.0 of our convenience merchandise from this vendor. Tripifoods supplies us with products including tobacco, candy, deli, grocery, health and beauty products, and sundry items.

Table of Contents 

We also purchase coffee, dairy products, beer, soda, snacks, and novelty goods from direct store vendors for resale. We annually review our suppliers costs and services versus those of
alternate suppliers. We believe that alternative sources of merchandise supply at competitive prices are readily available. 
 Location Performance Tracking 
 We maintain a store tracking mechanism to collect operating data including sales and inventory levels for our retail network. Data
transmissions are made using personal computers, which are available at each location. Once verified, the data interfaces with a variety of retail accounting systems, which support daily, weekly, and monthly performance reports. These different
reports are then provided to both the field management and administrative personnel. Upon completion of a capital project, management tracks before and after performance, to evaluate the return on investment which has resulted from the
improvements. Wholesale Marketing and
Distribution In fiscal 2010, we sold on a
wholesale basis approximately 38,800 bpd of gasoline, distillate and asphalt products to distributor, commercial, and government accounts. In addition, we sell approximately 1,000 bpd of propane to liquefied petroleum gas marketers. In fiscal year
2010, our production of gasoline, distillate, and asphalt sold at wholesale was 41 , 76 , and 100 , respectively. We sell approximately 98 of our wholesale gasoline and distillate products from our refinery in Warren, Pennsylvania, and our
Company-owned and operated product terminals. The remaining 2 are sold through third-party exchange terminals. 
 Our wholesale gasoline customer base includes 40 branded dealer/distributor units operating under our proprietary
 Keystone and Kwik Fill brand names. Long-term dealer/distributor contracts accounted for approximately 19 of our wholesale gasoline sales in fiscal 2010. Supply contracts generally
range from three to five years in length, with branded prices based on our prevailing wholesale rack price in Warren. 
 We believe that the location of our refinery provides us with a transportation cost advantage over our competitors, which is significant
within an approximately 100-mile radius of our refinery. For example, in Buffalo, New York over our last five fiscal years, including fiscal 2010, we have experienced an approximately 2.2 cents per gallon transportation cost advantage over those
competitors who are required to ship gasoline by pipeline and truck from New York Harbor sources to Buffalo. 
 Our ability to market asphalt is critical to the performance of our refinery. The timing and a consistent marketing effort enables the
refinery to process lower cost higher sulfur content crude oils, which in turn affords us higher refining margins. Sales of paving asphalt generally occur during the period May 1 through October 31 based on weather conditions. In order to
maximize our in season asphalt sales, we have made substantial investments to increase our asphalt storage capacity through the installation of additional tankage, as well as through the purchase or lease of outside terminals. Partially mitigating
the seasonality of the asphalt paving business is our ability to sell asphalt year-round to roofing shingle manufacturers. In fiscal year 2010, we sold 6.7 million barrels of asphalt. We have a significant share of the asphalt market in southwestern New York and western and central Pennsylvania
as well as in the greater metro areas of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Rochester and Buffalo, New York. We distribute asphalt from the refinery by railcar and truck transport to our owned and leased asphalt terminals in such cities or their suburbs.
Asphalt can be purchased or exchanged in the Gulf Coast area and delivered by barge to third party or Company-owned terminals near Pittsburgh. 
 We use a network of six terminals to store and distribute refined products. This network provides distillate, and asphalt storage
capacities, of approximately 1,217,000 barrels, as of August 31, 2010. During fiscal 2010, approximately 93 of our refined products were transported from the refinery via truck transports, with the remaining 7 transported by rail. The majority of our wholesale and retail
gasoline distribution is handled by common carrier trucking companies at competitive rates. We also operate a fleet of ten tank trucks that supply approximately 22 of our Kwik Fill retail stations.

Table of Contents 

 Product distribution costs to both retail and wholesale accounts are minimized through
product exchanges. Through these exchanges, we have access to product supplies at approximately 18 sources located throughout our retail marketing area. We seek to minimize retail distribution costs through the use of a system wide distribution
model. Environmental Considerations 
 General 
 We are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws
and regulations relating to fuel quality, pollution control and protection of the environment, such as those governing releases of certain materials to the air and water and the storage, treatment, transportation, disposal and clean-up of wastes
located on land. As with the industry in general, compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases the overall cost of business, including capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and
facilities. Gasoline, Diesel Fuel, and Heating
Oil Manufacturing Standards Mandatory fuel
regulations will continue to affect our operations including renewable fuel obligations, benzene reduction in gasoline, and future sulfur reductions in home heating oil. 
 In March of 2010 the United States Environmental Protection
Agency USEPA implemented changes to the Renewable Fuels Standard RFS1 ). The revision better known as RFS2 specifies the volume of cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel that
must be used in our transportation fuels. To fulfill our renewable volume obligation RVO our projections show we will be required to blend 2 biodiesel in all our diesel fuel as well as add 10 ethanol to all of our gasoline starting
January 1, 2011. Even though RFS 2 went into effect July 1, 2010, United qualified for a small refinery exemption that extends until December 31, 2010. 
 We started blending 2 biodiesel into all our diesel fuel
sold in the state of Pennsylvania to comply with the PA Biofuels Development and In State Production Incentive Act 78 of 2008. This Act requires all on-road diesel fuel sold in Pennsylvania to contain a minimum of 2 biodiesel starting
May 1, 2010. The cost for the projects
associated with all renewable fuels legislation is 19 million, of which 1.5 million is for biodiesel and 17.5 million for ethanol. 
 The USEPA finalized another rule on February 26, 2007 under the Clean Air Act CAA known as the Mobile Source Air Toxics
Rule No. 2 MSAT II intended to reduce emissions of benzene by, among other things, regulating gasoline quality. The rule requires us to reduce the amount of benzene in gasoline from a current average level of about 2.5 down to
0.62 starting January 2011. The estimated cost of the project to reduce the benzene content is 5 million and is scheduled to be completed in December of 2010. 
 On July 20, 2010 New York Governor David Paterson signed into law a Low-Sulfur Heating Oil mandate that requires
all heating oil sold in the state of New York not to contain more than 15 parts per million (ppm) sulfur beginning July 1, 2012. Pennsylvania is also discussing lowering the sulfur content which currently has a maximum of 5,000 ppm. This
project to reduce the sulfur content in heating oil is presently being reviewed by our engineering department. The cost estimate for the project is 4 million to be completed by the 2 nd quarter of 2011. 
 We are also monitoring closely all climate change and Greenhouse Gas GHG legislation, better known as Cap and Trade which is
currently being debated in Congress. The proposals vary and the final form of legislation, if any, is not yet certain. The core of the proposals generally require the capture and reporting of CO2 emissions data, leading to a baseline followed by
mandatory CO2 emission reductions over time and the purchase 
 11 

Table of Contents 

of carbon credits under certain circumstances. On September 22, 2009 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted regulations governing the measurement and reporting GHG emissions
commencing January 1, 2010. The Company believes compliance costs with these regulations will not be material. The ultimate cost of GHG reduction mandates and their effect on our business are, however, unknown until a more definitive proposal
has been crafted by Congress and implementing regulations proposed. Retail Gasoline Stations We currently operate gasoline stations in three states with underground petroleum product storage tanks and in the past have operated gasoline stations that are now closed. Federal and state statutes and
regulations govern the installation, operation and removal from service of these underground storage tanks and associated piping and product dispensing systems. The operation of underground storage tanks and systems carries the risk of contamination
to soil and groundwater with petroleum products. We manage this risk by promptly responding to actual and suspected leaks and spills and implementing remedial action plans meeting regulatory requirements. In addition to prompt response and
remediation, we receive reimbursement for response costs associated with leaks and spills in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania through the Underground Storage Tank Indemnification Fund. Competition 
 Petroleum refining and marketing is highly competitive. Our major retail gasoline c-store competitors include British Petroleum, Amerada
Hess, Exxon-Mobil, Sunoco, Sheetz, Delta Sonic, Valero and Giant Eagle/GetGo. With respect to wholesale gasoline and distillate sales, we compete with Sunoco, Inc., Exxon-Mobil, and other refiners via their pipeline system. We primarily compete with
Marathon Petroleum in the asphalt market, both in New York and Pennsylvania. Many of our principal competitors are integrated multinational oil companies that are substantially larger and better known than us. Because of their diversity, integration
of operations, larger capitalization and greater resources, these major oil companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions, compete on the basis of price and more readily obtain crude oil in times of shortages. 
 The principal competitive factors affecting our refining
operations are crude oil and other feedstock costs, refinery efficiency, refinery product mix and product distribution and transportation costs. Certain of our larger competitors have refineries, which are larger and more complex and, as a result,
could have lower per barrel costs or higher margins per barrel of throughput. We have no crude oil reserves and are not engaged in exploration. We believe that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate crude oil and other feedstocks at
generally competitive prices for the foreseeable future. The principal competitive factors affecting our retail marketing network are location, product price, overall appearance and cleanliness of stores and brand identification. Competition from large,
integrated oil companies, supermarkets, and big box convenience store chains such as Wal-Mart and Sam s Club, is expected to be ongoing. The principal competitive factors affecting our wholesale marketing business are the price and
quality of our products, as well as the reliability and availability of supply and the location of multiple distribution points. 
 Employees 
 As of August 31, 2010, we had approximately 4,434 employees; 1,920 full-time and 2,514 part-time employees. Approximately 3,861
persons were employed at our retail units, 368 persons at our refinery, Kiantone Pipeline and at terminals operated by us, with the remainder at our office in Warren, Pennsylvania. We have entered into collective bargaining agreements with
International Union of Operating Engineers Local No. 95, United Steel Workers of America Local No. 2122-A and General Teamsters Local Union No. 397 covering 252, 6, and 21 employees, respectively. The agreements expire on
February 1, 2012, January 31, 2012 and July 31, 2011, respectively. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

right to terminate this license in the event that we fail to maintain quality acceptable to the licensor. We license the right to use the Keystone trademark to approximately 44 independent distributors on a non-exclusive royalty-free basis. 
 We currently do not own any material patents. Management
believes that the Company does not infringe upon the patent rights of others, nor does our lack of patent ownership impact our business in any material manner. 
 Governmental Approvals 
 We believe we have obtained all necessary governmental approvals, licenses, and permits to operate the refinery and convenience stores.
 Financing 
 In November, 2008, we increased the limit of our revolving
credit facility with PNC Bank, N.A., as Agent Bank (the Revolving Credit Facility from 100,000,000 to 130,000,000. This amendment provides the Company greater flexibility relative to its cash flow requirements in light of market
fluctuations, particularly involving crude oil prices and seasonal business cycles. The improved liquidity resulting from the expansion of the facility will assist the Company in meeting its working capital, ongoing capital expenditure needs and for
general corporate purposes. The term of the agreement will expire on November 27, 2011. The amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility affected certain terms and provisions thereof, including an increase in the interest rate and a modification
to the Net Worth covenant. Under the new amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility effective November 21, 2008, the applicable margin will continue to be calculated on the average unused availability as follows: (a) for base rate
borrowing, at the greater of the Agent Bank s prime rate plus an applicable margin of .5 to 0 ; the Federal Funds Open Rate plus .5 ; or the Daily LIBOR rate plus 1 ; (b) for euro-rate based borrowings, at the LIBOR Rate plus an
applicable margin of 2.35 to 1.75 . The applicable margin varies with our facility leverage ratio calculation. The Agent Bank s prime rate at August 31, 2010 was 3.25 . 
 During May 2007, the Company sold an
additional 125,000,000 of 10 1 / 2 Senior Unsecured
Notes due 2012 (the Additional Notes for 130,312,500 resulting in a debt premium of 5,312,500 which is being amortized over the life of the Additional Notes using the effective interest method. These Additional Notes were issued under
an indenture, dated as of August 6, 2004 (the Indenture ), pursuant to which 200,000,000 of Notes of the same series were issued in August 2004 and an additional 25,000,000 in February 2005. The net proceeds of the offering were
used and will continue to be used for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Additional Notes are hereinafter collectively called the Senior Unsecured Notes and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured
basis by all of the Company s subsidiaries (see Notes 9 and 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). 
 The Revolving Credit Facility is secured primarily by certain cash accounts, accounts receivable and inventory. Until maturity, we may
borrow on a borrowing base formula as set forth in the facility. We had outstanding letters of credit of 4,433,000 and approximately 42,567,000 unused and available under the Revolving Credit Facility as of August 31, 2010.

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS. 
 Risks Relating to the Business 
 Substantial Leverage and Ability to Service and Refinance Debt Our ability to pay interest and principal on the Senior Unsecured Notes and to satisfy our
other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, most of which are beyond our control. We anticipate that our operating cash
flow, together with borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital expenditures, to sustain operations and to service our interest requirements as they become due. 
 The Company s 10 1 / 2 Senior Unsecured Notes mature on August 15, 2012, at which time
the Company will either have to pay the principal amount in full or refinance the Notes. We use our Revolving Credit Facility to finance a portion of our operations. These on-balance sheet financial instruments, to the extent they provide for variable rates, expose us to interest rate risks
resulting from changes in the PNC Prime rate, the Federal Funds rate or the LIBOR rate. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness and fund our capital expenditures, we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include reducing or delaying
capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness (including the notes) or seeking additional equity capital. There can be no assurance that any of these strategies could be affected on satisfactory terms, if at
all. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance which, in turn, is subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
 Volatility of Crude Oil Prices and Refining
Margins We are engaged primarily in the
business of refining crude oil and selling refined petroleum products. Our earnings and cash flows from operations are dependent upon us realizing refining and marketing margins at least sufficient to cover our fixed and variable expenses. The cost
of crude oil and the prices of refined products depend upon numerous factors beyond our control, such as the supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline and other refined products, which are affected by, among other things, changes in domestic and
foreign economies, political events, and instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions, production levels, weather, the availability of imports, the marketing of gasoline and other refined petroleum products by our competitors, the
marketing of competitive fuels, the impact of energy conservation efforts, and the extent of domestic and foreign government regulation and taxation. A large, rapid increase in crude oil prices would adversely affect our operating margins if the
increased cost of raw materials could not be passed to our customers on a timely basis, and would adversely affect our sales volumes if consumption of refined products, particularly gasoline, were to decline as a result of such price increases. A
sudden drop in crude oil prices would adversely affect our operating margins since wholesale prices typically decline promptly in response thereto, while we will be paying the higher crude oil prices until our crude supply at such higher prices is
processed. The prices which we may obtain for our refined products are also affected by regional factors, such as local market conditions and the operations of competing refiners of petroleum products as well as seasonal factors influencing demand
for such products. In addition, our refinery throughput and operating costs may vary due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance shutdowns. 
 We do not manage the price risk related to all of our inventories of crude oil and refined products with a permanent hedging program;
however, we do manage the risk exposure by managing inventory levels and by selectively applying hedging activities. At August 31, 2010, the Company had no open futures positions of crude oil puts. 
 At August 31, 2010, we were exposed to the risk of
market price declines with respect to a substantial portion of our crude oil and refined product inventories. 
 Competition 
 Many of our competitors are fully integrated companies engaged on a national and/or international basis in many segments of the petroleum
business, including exploration, production, transportation, refining and 
 14 

Table of Contents 

marketing, on scales much larger than ours. Large oil companies, because of the diversity and integration of their operations, larger capitalization and greater resources, may be better able to
withstand volatile market conditions, compete on the basis of price, and more readily obtain crude oil in times of shortages. 
 We face strong competition in our market for the sale of refined petroleum products, including gasoline. Such competitors have in the past
and may in the future engage in marketing practices that result in profit margin deterioration for us for periods of time, causing an adverse impact on us. 
 Concentration of Refining Operations 
 All of our refinery activities are conducted at our facility in Warren, Pennsylvania. We currently obtain substantially all of our crude
oil supply through pipelines owned and operated by Enbridge Energy Partner Enbridge Pipeline ), and our owned and operated Kiantone Pipeline. While the Company does have the ability to shift its sources of supply over a 90 to 120 day
period, any prolonged disruption to the operations of our refinery, the Enbridge Pipeline or the Kiantone Pipeline, whether due to labor difficulties, destruction of or damage to such facilities, severe weather conditions, interruption of utilities
service or other reasons, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In order to minimize the effects of any such incident, we maintain a full schedule of insurance coverage which includes,
but is not limited to, property and business interruption insurance. The property insurance policy has a combined loss limit for a property loss and business interruption at our refinery of 500 million, with various sub-limit accounts for
specialized risks. A deductible of 5 million applies to physical damage claims, with a 45-day wait period and a 5 million deductible for business interruption. We believe that our coverage limits are adequate. However, there can be no assurance
that the proceeds of any such insurance would be paid in a timely manner or be in an amount sufficient to meet our needs if such an event were to occur. 
 Impact of Environmental Regulation; Government Regulation 
 Our operations and properties are subject to increasingly
more stringent environmental laws and regulations, such as those governing the use, storage, handling, generation, treatment, transportation, emission, release, discharge and disposal of certain materials, substances and wastes, remediation of areas
of contamination and the health and safety of employees. These laws may impose strict, and under certain circumstances, joint and several, liability for remediation costs and also can impose responsibility for natural resource damages. Failure to
comply, including failure to obtain required permits, can also result in significant fines and penalties, as well as potential claims for personal injury and property damage. 
 We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of
environmental legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. The nature of our operations and previous operations by others at certain of our facilities
exposes us to the risk of claims under those laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims, including potential claims arising from discovery of currently
unknown conditions. We are also monitoring
closely all climate change and Greenhouse Gas GHG legislation, better known as Cap and Trade which is currently being debated in Congress. The proposals vary and the final form of legislation, if any, is not yet certain. The core of
the proposals generally require the capture and reporting of CO2 emissions data, leading to a baseline followed by mandatory CO2 emission reductions over time and the purchase of carbon credits under certain circumstances. On September 22, 2009
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted regulations governing the measurement and reporting GHG emissions commencing January 1, 2010. The Company believes compliance costs with these regulations will not be material. The ultimate cost
of GHG reduction mandates and their effect on our business are, however, unknown until a more definitive proposal has been crafted by Congress and implementing regulations proposed. Taxes 
 Our operations and products will be subject to taxes imposed by federal, state and local governments, which taxes have generally increased
over time. There can be no certainty of the effect that increases in these taxes, or the imposition of new taxes, could have on us, or whether such taxes could be passed on to our customers.

 Nature of Demand for Asphalt 
 In fiscal 2010, asphalt sales represented 17 of our total
revenues. Over the same period, approximately 89 of our asphalt was produced for use in paving or repaving roads and highways. The level of paving activity is, in turn, dependent upon funding available from federal, state and local governments.
Funding for paving has been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by budget difficulties at the federal, state or local levels. A decrease in demand for asphalt could cause us to sell asphalt at significantly lower prices or to
curtail production of asphalt by processing more costly lower sulfur content crude oil which would adversely affect refining margins. In addition, paving activity in our marketing area generally ceases in the winter months. Therefore, much of our
asphalt production during the winter must be stored until warmer weather arrives, resulting in delayed revenue recognition and inventory buildups each year. 
 Controlling Stockholder 
 John A. Catsimatidis indirectly owns all of our outstanding voting stock. By virtue of such stock ownership, Mr. Catsimatidis has the
power to control all matters submitted to our stockholders and to elect all of our directors. Restrictions Imposed by Terms of Indebtedness The terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture and the other agreements governing our indebtedness impose operating and financing restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictions
affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, sell assets, or engage in mergers or acquisitions. These restrictions could limit our
ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs or otherwise could restrict corporate activities. There can be no assurance that such restrictions will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future
operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities which will be in our interest. 
 Our Pension Plans are Currently Underfunded 
 Substantially all of our employees are covered by three
noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. As of August 31, 2010, as measured under ASC 715 (which is not the same as the measure used for purposes of calculating required contributions and potential liability to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC), the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation under our pension plans was approximately 97.3 million and the value of the assets of the plans was approximately 54.5 million. In fiscal 2010, we contributed 4.1
million to the three plans, and we have made additional contributions to our pension plans of 2.2 million in fiscal year 2011. If the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet our expectations or if other actuarial assumptions
are modified, our contributions for future years could be higher than we expect. In June 2010, the Company announced changes to the healthcare and pension plans provided to salaried employees. Effective September 1, 2010, postretirement medical benefits for new hires and active
salaried employees retiring after September 1, 2010 were eliminated. Additionally, effective January 1, 2011, deductibles and co-payments will be added to the medical benefits plan for all active and retired employees. For salaried
employees meeting certain age and service requirements, the Company will contribute a defined dollar amount towards the cost of retiree healthcare based upon the employee s length of service. Similarly, effective August 31,
2010, benefits under the Company s defined benefit pension plan were frozen for all salaried employees, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Company will provide an enhanced
contribution under its defined contribution 401(k) plan as well as a transition contribution for older employees. 
 Our pension plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. Under ERISA, the PBGC generally has the
authority to terminate an underfunded pension plan if the possible long-run loss of the PBGC with respect to the plan may reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably if the plan is not terminated. In the event our pension plans are terminated
for any reason while the plans are underfunded, we will incur a liability to the PBGC that may be equal to the entire amount of the underfunding.

ITEM 2. 
 PROPERTIES. 
 We own a 92-acre site in Warren, Pennsylvania upon which we operate our refinery. The site also contains an office building housing our
principal executive office. We own various real
property in the states of Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, and Alabama, upon which, as of August 31, 2010, we operated 184 retail units and two crude oil and six refined product storage terminals. We also own the 78-mile long Kiantone Pipeline, a
pipeline which connects our crude oil storage terminal to the refinery s tank farm. Our right to maintain the pipeline is derived from approximately 265 separate easements, right-of-way agreements, leases, permits, and similar agreements. We
also have easements, right-of-way agreements, leases, permits, and similar agreements that would enable us to build a second pipeline on property contiguous to the Kiantone Pipeline. As of August 31, 2010, we also lease an aggregate of 183 sites in Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio upon
which we operate retail units. 

ITEM 3. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of their
respective business operations. These proceedings include various administrative actions relating to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as well as civil matters before various courts seeking money damages. The Company
believes that if the legal proceedings in which it is currently involved were determined against the Company, there would be no material adverse effect on the Company s operations or its consolidated financial condition. In the opinion of
management, all such matters are adequately covered by insurance, or if not so covered, are without merit or are of such kind, or involve such amounts that an unfavorable disposition would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
operations or financial position of the Company.

 Business Strategy and Overview 
 Our strategy is to strengthen our position as a leading
producer and marketer of high quality refined petroleum products within our market area. We plan to accomplish this strategy through continued attention to 
 19 

Table of Contents 

optimizing our operations, resulting in the lowest possible crude and overhead costs, and continuing to improve and enhance our retail and wholesale positions. More specifically, we intend to:

Maximize the favorable economic impact of our transportation cost advantage by increasing our retail and wholesale market shares within our market
area. 

Optimize profitability by managing feedstock costs, product yields, and inventories through our refinery feedstock management program and our
system-wide distribution model. 

Continue to investigate additional strategic acquisitions and capital improvements to our existing facilities. 
 Company Background 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements and
supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8.
Inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. As such, materially different financial results
can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. The policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operation and financial position include: Revenue Recognition 
 Revenues for products sold by the wholesale segment are
recorded upon delivery of the products to our customers, at which time title to those products is transferred and when payment has either been received or collection is reasonably assured. At no point do we recognize revenue from the sale of product
prior to transfer of its title. Title to product is transferred to the customer at the shipping point, under predetermined contracts for sale at agreement upon or posted prices to customers of which collectibility is reasonably assured. 
 Revenues for products sold by the retail segment are
recognized immediately upon sale to the customer. Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges are recognized when the related product revenue is recognized. 
 Collectibility of Accounts Receivable 
 For accounts receivable we estimate the net collectibility
considering both historical and anticipated trends relating to our customers and the possibility of non-collection due to their financial position. While such non-collections have been historically within our expectations and the allowances the
Company has established, the Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience non-collection rates that it has experienced in the past. A significant change in the financial position of our customers could have a material impact on the
quality of our accounts receivable and our future operating results. Goodwill and Other Non-Amortizable Assets In accordance with ACS 350 , goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. We assess the impairment of goodwill and
other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually. 
 The Company performed separate impairment tests on June 1, 2010 for its tradename and other intangible assets using discounted and
undiscounted cash flow methods, respectively. The fair value of the tradename and other intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values. The Company has noted no subsequent indication that would require testing the tradename and
intangible assets for impairment. 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 There were no material changes in the gross carrying amounts of goodwill, tradename, or
other intangible assets for fiscal 2010. 
 Long-Lived Assets 
 Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of any of these assets may not be recoverable, the Company
will assess the recoverability of such assets based upon estimated undiscounted cash flow forecasts. When any such impairment exists, the related assets will be written down to fair value. Value of Pension Assets 
 The Company maintains three noncontributory defined benefit
retirement plans for substantially all its employees. The assets of the plans are invested with a financial institution that follows an investment policy drafted by the Company. The investment guidelines provide a percentage range for each class of
assets to be managed by the financial institution. The historic performance of these asset classes supports the Company s expected return on the assets. The asset classes are rebalanced periodically should they fall outside the range
allocations. The percentage of total asset
allocation range is as follows: 

Asset Class 
 
 Minimum 

Maximum 

Equity 

55 

75 

Fixed Income 

25 

35 

Cash or Cash Equivalents 

0 

10 
 The discount rate utilized in valuing the benefit obligations of the plans was derived from the rate of return on high quality bonds as of August 31, 2010. Similarly, the rate of compensation
utilizes historic increases granted by the Company and the industry as well as future compensation policies. See Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8. 
 Environmental Remediation and Litigation Reserve
Estimations Management also makes judgments
and estimates in recording liabilities for environmental cleanup and litigation. Liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of matters such as changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation; the effect of
additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination; and improvements in technology. Likewise, actual litigation costs can vary from estimates based on the facts and circumstance and application of laws in individual cases.
 The above assessment of critical accounting
policies is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the uncertainties to financial results that occur from the application of the full range of the Company s accounting policies. Materially different financial results could occur in the
application of other accounting policies as well. Likewise, materially different results can occur upon the adoption of new accounting standards promulgated by the various rule-making bodies. General 
 The Company is engaged in the refining and marketing of petroleum products. In fiscal 2010, approximately 59 and 24 of the
Company s gasoline and distillate production, respectively, was sold through the Company s network of service stations and truck stops. The balances of the Company s refined products were sold to wholesale customers. In addition to
transportation and heating fuels, primarily gasoline and distillate, the Company is a major regional wholesale marketer of asphalt. The Company also sells convenience merchandise at convenience stores located at most of its service stations. The
Company s profitability is influenced by fluctuations in the market prices 
 21 

Table of Contents 

of crude oils and refined products. Although the Company s product sales mix helps to reduce the impact of large short-term variations in crude oil price, net sales and costs of goods sold
can fluctuate widely based upon fluctuations in crude oil prices. Specifically, the margins on wholesale gasoline and distillate tend to decline in periods of rapidly declining crude oil prices, while margins on asphalt, retail gasoline and
distillate tend to improve. During periods of rapidly rising crude oil prices, margins on wholesale gasoline and distillate tend to improve, while margins on asphalt and retail gasoline and distillate tend to decline. Gross margins on the sale of
convenience merchandise averaged 25.2 for fiscal 2010 and have been between 25.2 and 27.4 for the last five years and are essentially unaffected by variations in crude oil and petroleum products prices. 
 The Company includes in costs of goods sold operating
expenses incurred in the refining process. Therefore, operating expenses reflect only selling, general and administrative expenses, including all expenses of the retail network, and depreciation and amortization. 
 Recent Developments 
 The Company continues to be impacted by the volatility in
petroleum markets in fiscal year 2011. The lagged 3-2-1 crackspread as measured by the difference between the price of crude oil contracts traded on the NYMEX for the proceeding month to the prices of NYMEX gasoline and heating oil contracts in the
current trading month, have been negatively affected by consistently fluctuating petroleum prices. The Company uses a lagged crackspread as a margin indicator as it reflects the time period between the purchase of crude oil and its delivery to the
refinery for processing. The lagged crackspread for the month of September in fiscal year 2011 was 7.36 as compared to 10.46 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, a decrease of 3.10 or 30 . The lagged crackspread for October of fiscal year
2011 was 15.17, an increase of 4.71 or 45 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. In June 2010, the Company announced changes to the healthcare and pension plans provided to salaried employees. Effective September 1, 2010, postretirement medical benefits for new hires and active
salaried employees retiring after September 1, 2010 were eliminated. Additionally, effective January 1, 2011, deductibles and co-payments will be added to the medical benefits plan for all plan participants. For salaried employees
meeting certain age and service requirements, the Company will contribute a defined dollar amount towards the cost of retiree healthcare based upon the employee s length of service. Similarly, effective August 31, 2010, benefits
under the Company s defined benefit pension plan were frozen for all salaried employees, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Company will provide an enhanced contribution under its
defined contribution 401(k) plan for all eligible employees as well as a transition contribution for older employees. 
 On July 26, 2010, a rupture occurred in Line 6B pipeline on Enbridge s Lakehead system in Michigan. The Company s heavy
crude oil purchases are shipped on Line 6B from western Canada. As a result, on August 5, 2010, the Company was forced to reduce production in its crude processing unit until such time as the Enbridge Line 6B could be repaired. As a result,
during the month of August, crude run rates were reduced by approximately 41 from scheduled crude runs of 69,500 bbl per day to 40,900 bbl per day and further reduced in September to an average of 38,000 bbl per day. For the month of October,
actual crude runs were reduced an additional 8,740 bbl per day due to the Enbridge Pipeline disruption. The interruption of heavy crude deliveries via Line 6B also negatively affected asphalt production by 65 from the planned production of 656,000
bbl to actual production of 240,000 bbl at the peak of the asphalt selling season. The Company s supply group maintained crude sourcing at a reduced rate for the refinery during the disruption to Line 6B through other Enbridge pipelines.
 On September 28, 2010, Enbridge began a
phased restart and return to service of Line 6B. Line 6B is currently operating at approximately 80 of the total capacity and meeting 100 of shipping demand. 
 The Company s property insurance covering the refinery operation contains a provision for contingent business interruption, which
limits of coverage are separate from the general limits applying to direct damage to the refinery. The Company has placed the insurers on notice of the Enbridge loss. 
 The Company is in the process of quantifying its resultant
losses during the disruption, and intends to seek restitution from Enbridge for the losses it has incurred as a result of this pipeline rupture.

 Results of Operations 
 The Company is a petroleum refiner and marketer in its
primary market area of Western New York and Northwestern Pennsylvania. Operations are organized into two business segments: wholesale and retail. 
 The wholesale segment is responsible for the acquisition of crude oil, petroleum refining, supplying petroleum
products to the retail segment and the marketing of petroleum products to wholesale and industrial customers. The retail segment sells petroleum products under the Kwik Fill , Citgo and Keystone brand names at a network of Company-operated retail units and convenience and grocery items through Company-owned
gasoline stations and convenience stores under the, Red Apple Food Mart and Country Fair brand names. 
 A discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to the Company s results of operations are presented below. The accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes (see Item 8), together with the following information, are intended to supply investors with a reasonable basis for evaluating the Company s operations, but should not serve as the only
criteria for predicting the Company s future performance.

 Net Sales 2010 vs. 2009 
 Retail sales increased during fiscal 2010 by 145.5 million or 12.0 for the comparable period in fiscal 2009 from 1,213.6 million to
 1,359.1 million. The increase was primarily due to 145.5 million in petroleum

Table of Contents 

sales and 19.5 million in merchandise sales. The petroleum sales increase resulted from a 12.1 increase in retail selling prices per gallon, and a 3.0 million gallon or .8 increase in
retail petroleum volume. The merchandise sales increase is primarily due to increased prepared food, beverages and cigarette sales due to promotional campaigns and increased selling prices. 2009 vs. 2008 
 Retail sales decreased during fiscal 2009 by 336.0 million, or 21.7 , for the comparable period in fiscal 2008 from 1,549.6 million to
 1,213.6. The retail sales decrease was a result of a 354.4 million decrease in petroleum sales, offset by an 18.4 million increase in merchandise sales. The petroleum sales decrease was due to a 28.7 decrease in retail selling price per gallon,
offset by an increase of 10.6 million gallons or 2.8 in volume. The decrease in price generally reflects the decline in world wide petroleum prices. The merchandise sales increase is primarily due to increased prepared food, beverages and
cigarette sales due to promotional campaigns and increased selling prices. Costs of Goods Sold 2010 vs. 2009 Retail costs of goods sold increased during fiscal 2010 by 167.9 million or 15.9 for the comparable period in fiscal 2009 from 1,053.1 million to 1,221.0 million. The increase was primarily due to
 143.4 million in petroleum purchase prices, merchandise cost of 15.9 million, inventory costs of 4.8, fuel tax of 3.1 million, and freight cost of .7 million. 
 2009 vs. 2008 
 Retail costs of goods sold decreased during fiscal 2009 by
 371.5 million, or 26.1 , for the comparable period in fiscal 2008 from 1,424.6 million to 1,053.1 million. This was primarily due to decreases in: petroleum purchase prices of 377.9 million, inventory pricing of 10.1 million and freight of .5
million offset by increases in: merchandise costs of 15.2 million and fuel tax of 1.8 million. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2010 vs. 2009 Retail Selling, General and Administrative SG A expenses increased during fiscal 2010 by 6.4 million or 5.3 for the comparable period in fiscal 2009 from 121.6 million to 128.0
million. The increase was primarily due to payroll costs of 3.7 million, credit/customer service costs of .8 million, pension/post retirement costs of 1.1 million, maintenance costs of .3 million, advertising costs of .3 million and
insurance/utilities/taxes of .2 million. 2009
vs. 2008 Retail Selling, General and
Administrative SG A expenses increased during fiscal 2009 by .5 million or .4 for the comparable period in fiscal 2008 from 121.1 million to 121.6 million. Retail operating expenses remained relatively constant during fiscal
2009 and fiscal 2008 due to the Company s effort to keep overheads at the previous year level. Wholesale Operations :

 Net Sales 2010 vs. 2009 
 Wholesale sales increased during fiscal 2010 by 121.7 million or 10.4 for the comparable period in fiscal 2009 from 1,173.6 million to
 1,295.3 million. The increase was due to a 10.4 increase in wholesale prices offset by a 2.3 decrease in wholesale volume. 
 2009 vs. 2008 
 Wholesale sales decreased during fiscal 2009 by 484.8 million, or 29.2 , for the comparable period in fiscal 2008 from 1,658.5 million
to 1,173.6 million. The wholesale sales decrease was due to a 25.4 decrease in wholesale prices and a 5.2 decrease in wholesale volume. 
 Costs of Goods Sold

 2009 vs. 2008 
 Wholesale costs of goods sold decreased during fiscal 2009
by 593.5 million, or 35.6 , for the comparable period in fiscal 2008 from 1,668.3 million to 1,074.8 million. The decrease in wholesale costs of goods sold was primarily due to the 31 decrease in the cost of purchased crude. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 2010 vs. 2009 
 Wholesale SG A expenses decreased during fiscal 2010 by
 .5 million or 2.4 for the comparable period in fiscal 2009 from 23.3 million or 2.0 of net wholesale to 22.8 million or 1.8 of net wholesale sales. 
 2009 vs. 2008 
 Wholesale SG A expenses remained relatively constant during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 due to the Company s effort to keep
overheads at the previous years level. Fiscal 2009 SG A was 23.4 million, or 2.0 of net wholesale sales, compared to 24.7 million or 1.5 of net wholesale sales for fiscal 2008. Interest Expense, Net 
 Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) decreased during fiscal 2010 by .7 million for the comparable period for
fiscal 2009 from 35.9 million to 35.2 million. The decrease was due to lower interest expense as a result of the buy back of notes in fiscal 2009. 
 Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) increased during fiscal 2009 by 3.9 million from 32.0 million for fiscal
2008 to 35.9 million for fiscal 2009. The increase was due to a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates. 
 Income Tax Expense / (Benefit) 
 Our fiscal 2010 effective tax rate of approximately 34 was a decrease from the relatively consistent tax rate of approximately 41 for fiscal 2009 and
2008, due to the accounting recognition of anticipated expiration of state net operating loss carry forwards. Liquidity and Capital Resources We operate in an environment where our liquidity and capital resources are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined petroleum products, availability of credit, market uncertainty and a
variety of additional factors beyond our control. Included in such factors are, among others, the level of customer product demand, weather conditions, governmental regulations, worldwide political conditions and overall market and economic
conditions. The Company has temporarily postponed
its efforts to construct a Coker Facility for use in the refinery. To date the Company has spent approximately 29,719,000, relating to, among other things, the design of the facility as well as materials to be used in construction. These costs are
currently capitalized in construction-in-progress within Property Plant and Equipment, net. The Company presently believes that the Coker Facility will be constructed and consequently the costs incurred to date will be realizable.

 Primary sources of liquidity have been cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations
and borrowing availability under a revolving line of credit. We believe available capital resources will be adequate to meet our working capital, debt service, and capital expenditure requirements for existing operations. We continuously evaluate
our capital budget; however, management does not foresee any significant increase in maintenance and non-discretionary capital expenditures during fiscal 2011 that would impact future liquidity or capital resources. Maintenance and non-discretionary
capital expenditures have averaged approximately 6 million annually over the last three years for the refining and marketing operations and management currently projects this capital expenditure to be approximately 5 million for fiscal 2011.
 In addition, the Company expects to receive a
federal tax refund of approximately 38 million by March 2011. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds. These investments have staggered maturity dates, none of which exceed three months. They have a high degree of
liquidity since the securities are traded in public markets. During fiscal 2010, significant uses of cash are summarized in the following table:

 We require a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to large
variations during the year resulting from purchases of inventory and seasonal demands. Inventory purchasing activity is a function of sales activity and turnaround cycles for the different refinery units. 
 Future liquidity, both short and long-term, will continue to
be primarily dependent on realizing a refinery margin sufficient to cover fixed and variable expenses, including planned capital expenditures. We expect to be able to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, contractual obligations, letter of
credit and debt service requirements out of cash flow from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility with PNC Bank, N.A. as Agent Bank. In November, 2008, we increased the limit of our revolving credit facility with
PNC Bank, N.A., as Agent Bank (the Revolving Credit Facility from 100,000,000 to 130,000,000. This amendment provides the Company greater flexibility relative to its cash flow requirements in light of market fluctuations, particularly
involving crude oil prices and seasonal business cycles. The improved liquidity resulting from the expansion of the facility will assist the Company in meeting its working capital, ongoing capital expenditure needs and for general corporate
purposes. The term of the agreement will expire on November 27, 2011. The amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility affected certain terms and provisions thereof, including an increase in the interest rate and a modification to the Net Worth
covenant. Under the new amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility effective November 21, 2008, the applicable margin will continue to be calculated on the average unused availability as follows: (a) for base rate borrowing, at the greater
of the Agent Bank s prime rate plus an applicable margin of .5 to 0 ; the Federal Funds Open Rate plus .5 ; or the Daily LIBOR rate plus 1 ; (b) for euro-rate based borrowings, at the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin of 2.35 to
1.75 . The applicable margin varies with our facility leverage ratio calculation. The Agent Bank s prime rate at August 31, 2010 was 3.25 . 
 The Revolving Credit Facility is secured primarily by certain cash accounts, accounts receivable and inventory. Until maturity, we may
borrow on a borrowing base formula as set forth in the facility. We had outstanding letters of credit of 4,433,000 as of August 31, 2010. As of August 31, 2010, we had 83,000,000 of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility resulting in net
availability of 42,567,000. 
 The Company s
10 1 / 2 Senior Unsecured Notes mature on August 15,

notes using the effective interest method (see Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8). 

(b) 
 Does not include interest on the Revolving Credit Facility. The applicable margin varies with our facility leverage ratio calculation. Under the
amended Revolving Credit Facility, for base rate borrowings, interest is calculated at the greater of the Agent Bank s prime rate less an applicable margin of 0 to .5 or federal funds rate plus 1 . For Euro-Rate borrowings, interest is
calculated at the LIBOR rate plus an applicable 
 28

margin of 1.25 to 1.75 . The applicable margin varies with our facility s average unused availability calculation (see Notes 8 and 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 8).

(c) 
 Pension obligations are not included since payments are not known. 
 Although we are not aware of any pending circumstances which
would change our expectations, changes in the tax laws, the imposition of and changes in federal and state clean air and clean fuel requirements and other changes in environmental laws and regulations may also increase future capital expenditure
levels. Future capital expenditures are also subject to business conditions affecting the industry. We continue to investigate strategic acquisitions and capital improvements to our existing facilities. 
 Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the
environment affect nearly all of our operations. As is the case with all the companies engaged in similar industries, we face significant exposure from actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters. Future expenditures
related to environmental matters cannot be reasonably quantified in many circumstances due to the uncertainties as to required remediation methods and related clean-up cost estimates. We cannot predict what additional environmental legislation or
regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied. 
 Related Party Transactions 
 See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions. Seasonal Factors 
 Seasonal factors affecting the Company s business may
cause variation in the prices and margins of some of the Company s products. For example, demand for gasoline tends to be highest in spring and summer months, while demand for home heating oil and kerosene tends to be highest in winter months.
 As a result, the margin on gasoline prices versus
crude oil costs generally tends to increase in the spring and summer, while margins on home heating oil and kerosene tend to increase in winter. 
 Inflation 
 The effect of inflation on the Company has not been significant during the last five fiscal years. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 810-10-15, which requires
a company to determine whether the Company s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. Additionally, ASC 810-10-15 requires ongoing reassessment of whether it is the primary
beneficiary of a variable interest entity and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009, and interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company believes that the adoption of ASC 810-10-15 will not have a significant
effect on the Company s consolidated financial position. 

ITEM 7A. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 We use our Revolving Credit Facility to finance a portion of
our operations. These on-balance sheet financial instruments, to the extent they provide for variable rates, expose us to interest rate risk resulting from changes in the PNC Prime rate, the Federal Funds rate or the LIBOR rate. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 We have exposure to price fluctuations of crude oil and refined products. We do not manage
the price risk related to all of our inventories of crude oil and refined products with a permanent formal hedging program, but we do manage our risk exposure by managing inventory levels and by selectively applying hedging activities. At
August 31, 2010, the Company had no future positions. At August 31, 2010, we were exposed to the risk of market price declines with respect to a substantial portion of our crude oil and refined product inventories.

2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income , stockholder s equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2010. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the management of United Refining Company and its subsidiaries. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United Refining Company and subsidiaries as of August 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

 UNITED REFINING COMPANY AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1. 
 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
 The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of United Refining Company and its subsidiaries, United Refining Company of Pennsylvania and its subsidiaries, and Kiantone Pipeline Corporation (collectively, the Company ). All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 The Company is a petroleum refiner and marketer in its primary market area of Western New York and Northwestern Pennsylvania. Operations
are organized into two business segments: wholesale and retail. The wholesale segment is responsible for the acquisition of crude oil, petroleum refining, supplying petroleum products to the retail segment and the marketing of petroleum products to wholesale and
industrial customers. The retail segment sells petroleum products under the Kwik Fill , Citgo and Keystone brand names at a network of Company-operated retail units and convenience and grocery items through Company-owned gasoline stations and convenience stores under the
Red Apple Food Mart and Country Fair brand names. The Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Refining, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Acquisition Corp., which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Red Apple Group, Inc. (the
 Parent ). Cash and Cash
Equivalents For purposes of the
consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investment securities with maturities of three months or less at date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Derivative Financial Instruments From time to time the Company uses derivatives to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil purchase
costs and refining margins. Derivative products, specifically crude oil option contracts and crack spread option contracts are used to hedge the volatility of these items. The Company does not enter such contracts for speculative purposes. The
Company accounts for changes in the fair value of its contracts by marking them to market and recognizing any resulting gains or losses in its statement of operations. During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, the Company
realized net losses from its trading activities of 0, 0, and 3,518,000, respectively, which is included as an increase to costs of goods sold. The Company includes the carrying amounts of the contracts in prepaid expenses and other assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. At August 31,
2010 and 2009, the Company had no open future positions. Inventories and Exchanges Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined under the Last-in, First-out (LIFO) method for crude oil and petroleum product inventories and the First-in, First-out
(FIFO) method for merchandise. Supply inventories are stated at either lower of cost or market or replacement cost and include various parts for the refinery operations. If the cost of inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made
currently for the difference between the cost and the market value.

UNITED REFINING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued) 
 Property, Plant and Equipment 
 Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and
depreciated by the straight-line method over the respective estimated useful lives. Routine current maintenance, repairs and replacement costs are charged against income. Expenditures which materially increase values expand capacities or extend
useful lives are capitalized. A summary of the principal useful lives used in computing depreciation expense is as follows: 

Estimated Useful Lives (Years) 

Refining 

20-30 

Marketing 

15-30 

Transportation 

20-30 
 
 Leases 
 The Company leases land, buildings, and equipment under long-term operating and capital leases and accounts for the leases in accordance
with ASC 360-10-30-8. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. The lease term begins on the date the Company has the right to control the use of the leased property pursuant to the terms
of the lease. Deferred Maintenance
Turnarounds The cost of maintenance
turnarounds, which consist of complete shutdown and inspection of significant units of the refinery at intervals of two or more years for necessary repairs and replacements, are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the
period of benefit, which ranges from 2 to 10 years. As of August 31, 2010 and 2009, deferred turnaround costs included in Deferred Turnaround Costs and Other Assets, amounted to 3,228,000 and 6,786,000, net of accumulated amortization of
 17,588,000 and 13,738,000, respectively. Amortization expense included in costs of goods sold for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 amounted to 5,056,000, 6,539,000, and 6,239,000, respectively. 
 Amortizable Intangible Assets 
 The Company amortizes identifiable intangible assets such as
brand names, non-compete agreements, leasehold covenants and deed restrictions on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from 5 to 25 years. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Revenues for products sold by the wholesale segment are
recorded upon delivery of the products to our customers, at which time title to those products is transferred and when payment has either been received or collection is reasonably assured. At no point do we recognize revenue from the sale of
products prior to the transfer of its title. Title to product is transferred to the customer at the shipping point, under pre-determined contracts for sale at agreed upon or posted prices to customers of which collectibility is reasonably assured.
Revenues for products sold by the retail segment are recognized immediately upon sale to the customer. Included in Net Sales and Costs of Goods Sold are consumer excise taxes of 218,811,000, 215,670,000 and 213,829,000 for the years ended
August 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 
 Cost Classifications 
 Our Cost of goods sold (which excludes depreciation and amortization on property, plant and equipment) includes Refining Cost of Products
Sold and related Refining Operating expenses.

Table of Contents 

UNITED REFINING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued) 
 Refining Cost of Products Sold includes cost of crude oil, other feedstocks,
blendstocks, the cost of purchased finished products, amortization of turnaround costs, transportation costs and distribution costs. Retail cost of products sold includes cost for motor fuels and for merchandise. Motor fuel cost of products sold
represents net cost for purchased fuel. Merchandise cost of products sold includes merchandise purchases, net of merchandise rebates and inventory shrinkage. Wholesale cost of products sold includes the cost of fuel and lubricants, transportation
and distribution costs and labor. Income
Taxes The Company accounts for income
taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
 The Company s results of operations are included in the
consolidated Federal Income tax return of the Parent and separately in various state jurisdictions. Income taxes are calculated on a separate return basis with consideration of the Tax Sharing Agreement between the Parent and its subsidiaries. The
Company is open to examination for tax years 2002 through 2009 and there is a federal tax audit in process for the tax years 2006 through 2008. There are currently no state tax audits in process and there are no unsettled income tax assessments
outstanding. The Company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax positions as a component of interest expense, net and other, net, respectively. No amounts of such expenses are currently accrued.
 Post-Retirement Healthcare and Pension
Benefits The Company provides
post-retirement healthcare benefits to salaried and certain hourly employees that retired prior to September 1, 2010. The benefits provided are hospitalization and medical coverage for the employee and spouse until age 65. Benefits continue until
the death of the retiree, which results in the termination of benefits for all dependent coverage. If an employee leaves the Company as a terminated vested member of a pension plan prior to normal retirement age, the person is not entitled to any
post-retirement healthcare benefits. Benefits payable under this program are secondary to any benefits provided by Medicare or any other governmental programs. 
 In June 2010, the Company announced changes to the healthcare and pension plans provided to salaried employees. Effective September
1, 2010, postretirement medical benefits for new hires and active salaried employees retiring after September 1, 2010 were eliminated. Additionally, effective January 1, 2011, deductibles and co-payments will be added to the medical
benefits plan for all active and retired employees. For salaried employees meeting certain age and service requirements, the Company will contribute a defined dollar amount towards the cost of retiree healthcare based upon the
employee s length of service. Similarly, effective August 31, 2010, benefits under the Company s defined benefit pension plan were frozen for all salaried employees, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer. The Company will provide an enhanced contribution under its defined contribution 401(k) plan as well as a transition contribution for older employees. 
 The Company accrues post-retirement benefits other than
pensions, during the years that the employee renders the necessary service, of the expected cost of providing those benefits to an employee and the employee s beneficiaries and covered dependents. The Company has elected to amortize the
transition obligation of approximately 12,000,000 on a straight-line basis over a 20-year period.

UNITED REFINING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued) 
 Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible. The
Company also recorded additional allowances based on historical collection experience and its assessment of the general financial conditions affecting the customer base. Senior management reviews accounts receivable on a weekly basis to determine if
any receivables will potentially be uncollectible. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. 
 Concentration Risks 
 Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash
investments. The Company places its temporary
cash investments with quality financial institutions. At times, such investments were in excess of FDIC insurance limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company purchased approximately 12 of its cost of goods sold from one vendor during the year ended
August 31, 2010 and approximately 33 from three vendors during the year ended August 31, 2009. The Company is not obligated to purchase from these vendors, and, if necessary, there are other vendors from which the Company can purchase
crude oil and other petroleum based products. The Company had approximately 0 and 24,194,000 in accounts payable for the years ended August 31, 2010 and 2009 to these respective vendors. 
 Environmental Matters 
 The Company expenses environmental expenditures related to
existing conditions resulting from past or current operations and from which no current or future benefit is discernible. Expenditures, which extend the life of the related property or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are
capitalized. The Company determines its liability on a site by site basis and records a liability at the time when it is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company s estimated liability is reduced to reflect the anticipated
participation of other potentially responsible parties in those instances where it is probable that such parties are legally responsible and financially capable of paying their respective shares of the relevant costs. The estimated liability of the
Company is not reduced for possible recoveries from insurance carriers and is recorded in accrued liabilities. 
 Goodwill and Other Non-Amortizable Assets 
 In accordance with ASC 350, goodwill and intangible assets
deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with ASC 350. Other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. 
 The Company performed separate impairment tests for its
goodwill and tradename using the discounted cash flow method. The fair value of the goodwill and tradename exceeded their respective carrying values. The Company has noted no subsequent indication that would require testing its goodwill and
tradename for impairment.

 Long-Lived Assets 
 Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of any of these assets (other than goodwill and tradename) may not be recoverable, the Company will assess the recoverability of such assets based upon estimated undiscounted cash flow forecasts. When any such impairment exists,
the related assets will be written down to fair value. Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income The Company reports comprehensive (loss) income in accordance with ASC 220-10. ASC 220-10 establishes guidelines for the reporting and display of comprehensive (loss) income and its components in
financial statements. Comprehensive (loss) income includes charges and credits to equity that is not the result of transactions with the shareholder. Included in other comprehensive loss for the Company is a charge for unrecognized post retirement
costs, which is net of taxes in accordance with ASC 715. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 810-10-15, which requires a company to determine whether the Company s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest
entity. Additionally, ASC 810-10-15 requires ongoing reassessment of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009, and interim periods within that fiscal
year. The Company believes that the adoption of ASC 810-10-15 will not have a significant effect on the Company s consolidated financial position. 
 Reclassification 
 Certain amounts in the prior year s consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the presentation in the
current year.

 Included in petroleum product inventories are exchange balances either held for or due
from other petroleum marketers. These balances are not significant. The Company does not own sources of crude oil and depends on outside vendors for its needs. 
 Inventories at the lower of last-in, first-out LIFO cost or market reflect a market valuation reserve of 0 and 6,104,000
at August 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of August 31, 2010 and 2009, the replacement cost of LIFO inventories exceeded their LIFO carrying values by approximately 50,265,000 and 5,278,000, respectively. For the fiscal years ended

 Credit Facility 
 In November 2006, the Company extended the term of its 100,000,000 Revolving Credit Facility from May 9, 2007 to
November 27, 2011. In November 2008, the Company amended its Revolving Credit Facility to increase the maximum facility commitment from 100,000,000 to 130,000,000 on a permanent basis and amended certain terms and provisions thereof,
including an increase in the interest rate and a modification to the Net Worth Covenant. Under the amended Revolving Credit Facility, interest is calculated as follows: (a) for base rate borrowings, at the greater of the Agent Bank s prime
rate plus an applicable margin of .5 to 0 or, the Federal Funds Open Rate plus .5 or the Daily LIBOR rate plus 1 ; and (b) for euro-rate based borrowings, at the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin of 2.35 to 1.75 . The applicable margin
will vary depending on a formula calculating our average unused availability under the facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured primarily by certain cash accounts, accounts receivable and inventory which amounted to 253,000,000 as of
August 31, 2010. Until maturity, the Company may borrow on a borrowing base formula as set forth in the facility. 
 As of August 31, 2010, 33,000,000 of Base-Rate borrowings and 50,000,000 of Euro-Rate borrowings were outstanding under the
agreement. As of August 31, 2009, no Base-Rate borrowing and no Euro-Rate borrowings were outstanding under the agreement. 4,433,000 and 3,233,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under the agreement at August 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The weighted average interest rate for Base-Rate borrowing for the years ended August 31, 2010 and 2009 was 3.4 and 3.8 , respectively. The weighted average interest rate for Euro-Rate borrowings for the years ended
August 31, 2010 and 2009 was 2.3 and 0 , respectively. The Company pays a commitment fee of 3/8 per annum on the unused balance of the facility. All bank related charges are included in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of

These additional notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of August 6, 2004, pursuant to
which 200,000,000 of notes of the same series were issued in August 2004. The net proceeds of the offering were used for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. During February 2005, the Company sold an additional 25,000,000 of 10 1 / 2 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2012 for 25,750,000, resulting in a
debt premium of 750,000 which is being amortized over the life of the notes using the interest method. These additional notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of August 6, 2004, pursuant to which 200,000,000 of notes of the same
series were issued in August 2004. The net proceeds of the offering were used to pay down a portion of the Company s outstanding indebtedness under its existing revolving credit facility. 
 During August 2004, the Company sold
 200,000,000 of 10 1 / 2 Senior Unsecured Notes due
2012 for 197,342,000, resulting in debt discount of 2,658,000 which is being amortized over the life of the notes using the interest method. 
 Such notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all of the Company s subsidiaries (see Footnote 16
to Consolidated Financial Statements). Both the
Indenture of the Senior Unsecured Notes and the facility (See Footnote 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements) require that the Company maintain certain financial covenants. The facility requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants, as
defined in the facility, a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and a minimum Consolidated Net Worth. In addition, the facility limits the amount the Company can distribute for capital and operating leases. Both the facility and the Indenture of the
Senior Unsecured Notes restrict the amount of dividends payable and the incurrence of additional Indebtedness. As of August 31, 2010 the Company is in compliance with covenants under the facility and the Indenture.

 Employee Benefit Plans 
 Substantially all employees of the Company are covered by three noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans. The benefits are based
on each employee s years of service and compensation. Effective August 31, 2010 benefits under the Company s defined benefit pension plan were frozen for all salaried employees, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer. The Company will provide enhanced contribution under its defined contribution 401(k) plan as well as a transition contribution for older employees. The Company s policy is to contribute the minimum amounts required by
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, and any additional amounts for strategic financial purposes or to meet other goals relating to plan funded status. The assets of the plans are invested in an investment trust
fund and consist of interest-bearing cash, separately managed accounts and bank common/collective trust funds. 
 In addition to the above, the Company provides certain post-retirement healthcare benefits to salaried and certain hourly employees that
retired prior to September 1, 2010. These post-retirement benefit plans are unfunded and the costs are paid by the Company from general assets.

 For measurement purposes, the assumed annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical and dental benefits was 8 and 5 
for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 5 for medical benefits until 2016 and remain at that level thereafter. The healthcare cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. To

UNITED REFINING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued) 
 The investment policy for the plans is formulated by the Company s Pension Plan
Committee (the Committee ). The Committee is responsible for adopting and maintaining the investment policy, managing the investment of plan assets and ensuring that the plans investment program is in compliance with all provisions
of ERISA, as well as the appointment of any investment manager who is responsible for implementing the plans investment process. 
 In drafting a strategic asset allocation policy, the primary objective is to invest assets in a prudent manner to meet the obligations of
the plans to the Company s employees, their spouses and other beneficiaries, when the obligations come due. The stability and improvement of the plans funded status is based on the various reasons for which money is funded. Other factors
that are considered include the characteristics of the plans liabilities and risk-taking preferences. 
 The asset classes used by the plan are the United States equity market, the international equity market, the United States fixed income or
bond market and cash or cash equivalents. Plan assets are diversified to minimize the risk of large losses. Cash flow requirements are coordinated with the custodian trustees and the investment manager to minimize market timing effects. The asset
allocation guidelines call for a maximum and minimum range for each broad asset class as noted above. 
 The target strategic asset allocation and ranges established under the asset allocation represents a long-term perspective. The Committee
will rebalance assets to ensure that divergences outside of the permissible allocation ranges are minimal and brief as possible. 
 The net of investment manager fee asset return objective is to achieve a return earned by passively managed market index funds, weighted
in the proportions identified in the strategic asset allocation matrix. Each investment manager is expected to perform in the top one-third of funds having similar objectives over a full market cycle. 
 The investment policy is reviewed by the Committee at least
annually and confirmed or amended as needed. 
 Under ASC 715-30-25 beginning at Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2007, the transition obligation, prior service costs, and actuarial
(gains)/losses are recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income each August 31 or any interim measurement date, while amortization of these amounts through net periodic benefit cost will occur in accordance with ASC 715-30 and ASC

The pension plan contributions
are deposited into a trust, and the pension plan benefit payments are made from trust assets. For the postretirement benefit plan, the contributions and the benefit payments are the same and represent expected benefit amounts, which are paid from
general assets. The Company s postretirement
benefit plan is likely to be affected by The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act ). Beginning in 2006, the Act provides a Federal subsidy payment to companies providing benefit plans that meet
certain criteria regarding their generosity. The Company expects to receive those subsidy payments. The Company has accounted for the Act in accordance with ASC 715-60-05-8, which requires, in the Company s case, recognition on August 31,
2004. The benefit obligation as of that date reflects the effect of the federal subsidy, and this amount is identified in the table reconciling the change in benefit obligation above. The estimated effect of the subsidy on cash flow is shown in the
accompanying table of expected benefit payments above. The expected subsidy reduced net periodic postretirement benefit cost by 939,000, as compared with the amount calculated without considering the effects of the subsidy. 
 The Company also contributes to voluntary employee savings
plans through regular monthly contributions equal to various percentages of the amounts invested by the participants. The Company s contributions to these plans amounted to 932,000, 894,000, and 1,011,000 for the years ended August 31,
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The Company s results of
operations are included in the consolidated Federal tax return of the Parent (See Footnote 13 to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company has a Federal net operating loss for regular tax purposes of 104,015,000 which will be carried back and
fully utilized against prior year s taxable income and, accordingly, is included in refundable income taxes at the Federal statutory rate. For state purposes, two entities have Pennsylvania net operating loss carry forwards of 164,000,000 and
 46,000,000, respectively, which will expire between fiscal year 2019 and 2030. Pennsylvania limits the amount of net operating loss carry forwards which can be used to offset Pennsylvania taxable income to the greater of 3,000,000 or 20 of
Pennsylvania taxable income prior to the net operating loss deduction. Due to these limitations, the Company has recognized valuation allowances, net of a federal benefit, of 8,971,000 and 0 at August 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for
Pennsylvania net operating loss carry forwards not anticipated to be realized before expiration.

 The fair value of long-term debt (See Footnote 9 to
Consolidated Financial Statements) was determined using the fair market value of the individual debt instruments. As of August 31, 2010, the carrying amount and estimated fair value of these debt instruments approximated 330,053,000 and

13. 
 Transactions with Affiliated Companies 
 On December 21, 2001, the Company acquired the operations and working capital assets of Country Fair. The fixed assets of Country
Fair were acquired by related entities controlled by John A. Catsimatidis, the indirect sole shareholder of the Company. These assets are being leased to the Company at an annual aggregate rental which management, based on an independent third party
valuation believes is fair, over a period ranging from 10 to 20 years. During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, 5,102,000, 5,102,000, and 5,102,000 of rent payments were made to these related entities. The Company is not
a guarantor on the underlying mortgages on the properties. Concurrent with the above acquisition of Country Fair, the Company entered into a management agreement with a non-subsidiary affiliate to operate and manage 18 of the retail units owned by the
non-subsidiary affiliate on a turn-key basis. For the years ended August 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company billed the affiliate 1,243,000, 1,219,000, and 1,147,000 for management fees and overhead expenses incurred in the management and
operation of the retail units which amount was deducted from expenses. As of August 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had a payable to the affiliate of 138,000 and 306,000, respectively, under the terms of the agreement, which is included in
Amounts Due from Affiliated Companies, Net. 
 Effective June 1, 2001, the Company entered into a 50 joint venture with an unrelated entity for the marketing of asphalt products.
The joint venture was accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As of July 31, 2008 the joint venture ceased operations due to the insolvency of the joint venture partner. For the years ended August 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, net
sales to the joint venture amounted to 0, 0, and 15,419,000, respectively. As of August 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had no (payable) receivable (to) from the joint venture. On September 29, 2000, the Company sold 42 retail units to an affiliate for 23,870,000. Concurrent with
this asset sale, the Company terminated the leases on 8 additional retail locations which it had previously leased from a non-subsidiary affiliate. The Company has entered into a management agreement with the non-subsidiary affiliate to operate and
manage the retail units owned by the non-subsidiary affiliate on a turnkey basis. For the years ended August 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company billed the affiliate 2,099,000, 2,245,000, and 2,037,000, respectively, for management fees and
overhead expenses incurred in the management and operation of the 50 retail units, which amount was deducted from expenses. For the fiscal years ended August 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, net sales to the affiliate amounted to 140,277,000,
 112,878,000, and 173,190,000, respectively. As of August 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had a payable to the affiliate of 344,000 and 614,000, respectively, under the terms of the agreement. 
 The Company paid a service fee relating to certain costs
incurred by its Parent for the Company s New York office. During the years ended August 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, such fees amounted to approximately 2,000,000, 2,000,000, and 2,000,000, respectively, which is included in Selling,

 The Company joins with the Parent and the Parent s other subsidiaries in filing a
Federal income tax return on a consolidated basis. Income taxes are calculated on a separate return basis with consideration of the Tax Sharing Agreement between the Parent and its subsidiaries. Amounts related to the Tax Sharing Agreement for the
utilization by the Company of certain tax attributes of the Parent and other subsidiaries related to the tax years ended August 31, 2010 and 2009 amounted to 502,000 and (2,667,000), respectively and have been recorded as a capital
contribution (distribution). As of August 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had a receivable from the Parent of 3,455,000 and 1,728,000, respectively, under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement. 
 During the years ended August 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
the Company incurred 372,000 in each year as its share of occupancy expenses for our offices in New York that it shares with affiliates of the Company. Such offices are located in a building owned by John Catsimatidis. 
 During the years ended August 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008,
the Company shared certain costs with an affiliate of the Company for aircraft owned by another affiliate of the Company and incurred 0, 0 and 180,000, respectively, as its share of such costs.

 Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies 
 The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to pollution and protection of the environment such as
those governing releases of certain materials into the environment and the storage, treatment, transportation, disposal and clean-up of wastes, including, but not limited to, the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended, the Clean Air Act, as amended,
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and analogous state and local laws and regulations. 
 Due to the nature of the Company s business, the Company
is and will continue to be subject to various environmental claims, legal actions and actions by regulatory authorities. In the opinion of management, all current matters are without merit or are of such kind or involve such amounts that an
unfavorable disposition would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or operations of the Company. 
 The management of the Company believes that remediation and related environmental response costs incurred during the normal course of
business, including contractual obligations as well as activities required under applicable law and regulation, will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or operations. 
 In addition to the foregoing proceedings, the Company and its
subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of their respective business operations. In the opinion of management, all such matters are adequately covered by insurance, or if not so covered, are without
merit or are of such kind, or involve such amounts that unfavorable dispositions would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company. 
 We are also monitoring closely all climate change and
Greenhouse Gas GHG legislation, better known as Cap and Trade which is currently being debated in Congress. The proposals vary and the final form of legislation, if any, is not yet certain. The core of the proposals generally require
the capture and reporting of CO2 emissions data, leading to a baseline followed by mandatory CO2 emission reductions over time and the purchase of carbon credits under certain circumstances. On September 22, 2009 the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency adopted regulations governing the measurement and reporting GHG emissions commencing January 1, 2010. The Company believes compliance costs with these regulations will not be material. The ultimate cost of GHG reduction
mandates and their effect on our business are, however, unknown until a more definitive proposal has been crafted by Congress and implementing regulations proposed.

During the quarter ended
February 28, 2009 the Company changed its method of accounting for inventories during interim periods from adjusting the inventory LIFO reserve on an annual basis to adjusting the inventory LIFO reserve on a quarterly basis. This change in
method of accounting better reflects interim results consistent with annual LIFO. Accordingly, the Company reflected this change in accounting policy in the three and six month periods ended February 28, 2009 and retrospectively applied this
policy to its previously issued financial statements for its fiscal year ended August 31, 2008. During the quarter ended May 31, 2009, the Company realized a 9,230,000 gain from extinguishment of debt.

 Legal Proceedings. 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of their
respective business operations. These proceedings include various administrative actions relating to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as well as civil matters before various courts seeking money damages. The Company
believes that if the legal proceedings in which it is currently involved were determined against the Company, there would be no material adverse effect on the Company s operations or its consolidated financial condition. In the opinion of
management, all such matters are adequately covered by insurance, or if not so covered, are without merit or are of such kind, or involve such amounts that an unfavorable disposition would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
operations or financial position of the Company.

ITEM 9A. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Based on an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of August 31, 2010, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (its principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, respectively)
have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 A control system, no matter how well conceived an operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all controls systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that
reasonable assurance level. Management s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such
term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process used to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial
statements for external reporting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ). Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedure that pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial
statements in accordance with GAAP; that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of the Company s board of directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 
 Management evaluates the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2010 and concluded that it is effective. 
 An internal control system over financial reporting has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore,
it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, the risk.

 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have not been any changes in the Company s
internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2010 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting.

The Pension Plan is a tax-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit plan established to provide pension benefits to employees of the
Company, including the named executive officers, meeting Pension Plan eligibility criteria. The criteria states that employees are eligible to participate in, and will be enrolled in, the Pension Plan on the first day of the month coincident with or
next following the later of the completion of one Year of Service and attainment of age twenty-one years. Years of service for benefits purposes are measured based on the number of years in which at least 1,000 hours are worked. 
 A participant s normal retirement
date is the first of the month coinciding with or following the attainment of age 65. Participants who are actively employed may also elect an unreduced option at age 59 1 / 2 . In addition to a single life annuity, benefits can be paid as
other actuarially equivalent annuities. 
 The United Refining Company s Pension Plan for Salaried Employees was frozen effective August 31, 2010 and participants will no
longer accrue a benefit under the Plan. The Plan has been replaced by a new 3 401(k) contribution. The benefit formula is based on the average earnings of the participant for the three years in which such participant s earnings were the highest. Earnings include salary and bonus up to a maximum of
the IRC 401(a)(17) limit, which for 2010 is 245,000. Benefits are calculated by multiplying the sum of (a) 1.1 of average earnings up to the Social Security compensation base, plus (b) 1.25 of average earnings in excess of the Social
Security compensation base, by (c) the number of years of service. Payments of retirement benefits are not reduced by any Social Security benefits received by the participant. Effective May 2001, for purposes of calculating retirement benefits,
the Company has fixed the earnings subject to tax under the Federal Insurance Contribution Act at 76,200.00 for years after 2001 for purposes of calculating Social Security compensation base. In connection with a transaction in 1984, a portion of the benefits from the plan are provided through an
annuity contract with an insurance company. The benefits shown in the table are gross amounts before offsetting the insured benefit and thereby represent the total benefit earned with the Company. 
 Vested benefits are those amounts to which participants are
entitled regardless of future services to the Company. A participant is credited with a year of service for vesting purposes for each Pension Plan year during which at least 1,000 hours of service are completed, commencing with year of hire. Each
executive is currently vested in his accumulated benefit. 
 67 

Table of Contents 

 In addition to vested benefits, the Pension Plan provides certain death benefits. Upon death
of a participant, the beneficiary is entitled to receive a portion of the vested interest of the participant s accrued benefit in the form of a monthly annuity amount, subject to eligibility requirements stipulated in the Pension Plan.
 The present value of accumulated benefits in the
table above has been determined by an independent actuary. These assumptions for August 31, 2010 include a 5.05 discount rate and the RP 2000 mortality table projected to 2015 with a 15-year phase-in and no collar adjustment, each of which is
consistent with the assumptions used for FYE 2010 financial reporting. Further, it was assumed that benefits will commence at the earliest age in which an unreduced benefit is available (age 59.5 or current age if later) and there will be no
turnover or death prior to retirement. DIRECTOR
COMPENSATION The Company pays its non-officer
Directors an annual retainer of 15,000 per year and 1,000 for meetings attended. Directors are reimbursed for reasonable travel, meals, lodging and other expenses incidental to attendance at meetings.

 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE. 
 On December 21, 2001, the Company acquired the
operations and working capital assets of Country Fair. The fixed assets of Country Fair were acquired by related entities controlled by John A. Catsimatidis, the indirect sole shareholder of the Company. These assets are being leased to the Company
at an annual aggregate rental which management, based on an independent third party valuation believes is fair, over a period ranging from 10 to 20 years. During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, 5,102,000, 5,102,000, and
 5,102,000 of rent payments were made to these related entities. The Company is not a guarantor on the underlying mortgages on the properties. 
 Concurrent with the above acquisition of Country Fair, the Company entered into a management agreement with a non-subsidiary affiliate to
operate and manage 18 of the retail units owned by the non-subsidiary affiliate on a turn-key basis. For the years ended August 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company billed the affiliate 1,243,000, 1,219,000, and 1,147,000 for management fees
