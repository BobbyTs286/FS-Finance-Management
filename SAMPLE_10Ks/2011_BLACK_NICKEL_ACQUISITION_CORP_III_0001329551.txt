Introduction 

Black Nickel Acquisition Corp. III we , us , our or the Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 26, 2005 and since February 15, 2010, maintains its principal executive offices at the offices of its parent, Efftec International, Inc. ("Efftec") at 6914 South Yorktown Ave, Suite 130, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74136. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination through the acquisition of, or merger with, an operating business. The Company filed a registration statement on Form 10-SB with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on January 12, 2006, and since its effectiveness, the Company
has focused its efforts to identify a possible business combination. 

On February 15, 2010, the shareholders of the Company sold 100 of the outstanding common stock (1,665,000 shares) to Efftec at which time the Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Efftec. 

The Company, based on proposed business activities, is a blank check company. The SEC defines those companies as "any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies." Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of "blank check" companies in their respective jurisdictions. The Company is also a shell company, defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act as a company with no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Management does not intend to
undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements. 

On December 18, 2009, the Company filed a Form 15 with the SEC to temporarily suspend its filing responsibilities. 

The Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company s principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with an operating company or a development stage company, which has not been identified. 

Competition 

The Company faces vast competition from other shell companies with the same objectives. The Company is in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood
of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination. 

Employees 

We have no employees other than our management who devotes only a limited amount of time to our business. 

3 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

You should carefully review and consider the following risks as well as all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the notes to those statements. The following risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware or which we believe are not material also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. To the extent any of the information contained in this annual report constitutes forward-looking information, the risk factors set forth below are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results for various financial reporting periods to differ materially from
those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on our behalf and could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

We have a limited operating history. 

We have a limited operating history and no revenues or earnings from operations since inception, and there is a risk that we will be unable to continue as a going concern and consummate a business combination. We have no significant assets or financial resources. We will, in all likelihood, sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues, at least until the consummation of a merger or other business combination with a private company. This may result in our incurring a net operating loss that will increase unless we consummate a business combination with a profitable business. We cannot assure you that we can identify a suitable business opportunity and consummate a business combination, or that any such business will be profitable at the time of its acquisition by us or ever. 

We have incurred and may continue to incur losses. 

Since inception (May 26, 2005) through December 31, 2010, we have incurred a net loss of 160,518. We expect that we will incur losses at least until we complete a merger or other business combination with an operating business and perhaps after such a combination as well. There can be no assurance that we will complete a merger or other business combination with an operating business or that we will ever be profitable. 

We face a number of risks associated with potential acquisitions. 

We intend to use reasonable efforts to complete a merger or other business combination with an operating business. Such combination will be accompanied by risks commonly encountered in acquisitions, including, but not limited to, difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies and insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business, our strategy and our operating results in a material way. 

There is competition for those private companies suitable for a merger transaction of the type contemplated by management. 

The Company is in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. We are, and will continue to be, an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and
successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination. 

4 

Future success is highly dependent on the ability of management to locate and attract a suitable acquisition. 

The nature of our operations is highly speculative, and there is a consequent risk of loss of your investment. The success of our plan of operation will depend to a great extent on the operations, financial condition and management of the identified business opportunity. While management intends to seek business combination(s) with entities having established operating histories, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in locating candidates meeting that criterion. In the event we complete a business combination, the success of our operations may be dependent upon management of the successor firm or venture partner firm and numerous other factors beyond our control. 

Management intends to devote only a limited amount of time to seeking a target company which may adversely impact our ability to identify a suitable acquisition candidate. 

While seeking a business combination, management anticipates devoting very limited time to the Company's affairs. Our officers have not entered into written employment agreements with us and are not expected to do so in the foreseeable future. This limited commitment may adversely impact our ability to identify and consummate a successful business combination. 

There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully consummate a business combination. 

We can give no assurances that we will successfully identify and evaluate suitable business opportunities or that we will conclude a business combination. Management has not identified any particular industry or specific business within an industry for evaluation. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to negotiate a business combination on favorable terms. 

The time and cost of preparing a private company to become a public reporting company may preclude us from entering into a merger or acquisition with the most attractive private companies. 

Target companies that fail to comply with SEC reporting requirements may delay or preclude acquisition. Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act require reporting companies to provide certain information about significant acquisitions, including certified financial statements for the company acquired, covering one, two, or three years, depending on the relative size of the acquisition. The time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target entities to prepare these statements may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an acquisition. Otherwise suitable acquisition prospects that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements may be inappropriate for acquisition so long as the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act are applicable. 

The Company may be subject to further government regulation which would adversely affect our operations. 

Although we are subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act, management believes we are not subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), since we are not engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. If we engage in business combinations which result in our holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we could be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. If so, we would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs. We have obtained no formal determination from the SEC as to our status under the Investment Company Act and, consequently, violation of the Investment Company Act could subject us to
material adverse consequences. 

Any potential acquisition or merger with a foreign company may subject us to additional risks. 

If we enter into a business combination with a foreign company, we will be subject to risks inherent in business operations outside of the United States. These risks include, for example, currency fluctuations, regulatory problems, punitive tariffs, unstable local tax policies, trade embargoes, risks related to shipment of raw materials and finished goods across national borders and cultural and language differences. Foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the United States economy in growth of gross national product, rate of inflation, market development, rate of savings, and capital investment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payments positions, and in other respects. 

5 

The Company may be subject to certain tax consequences in our business, which may increase our cost of doing business. 

We may not be able to structure our acquisition to result in tax-free treatment for the companies or their stockholders, which could deter third parties from entering into certain business combinations with us or result in being taxed on consideration received in a transaction. Currently, a transaction may be structured so as to result in tax-free treatment to both companies, as prescribed by various federal and state tax provisions. We intend to structure any business combination so as to minimize the federal and state tax consequences to both us and the target entity; however, we cannot guarantee that the business combination will meet the statutory requirements of a tax-free reorganization or that the parties will obtain the intended tax-free treatment upon a transfer of stock or assets. A non-qualifying
reorganization could result in the imposition of both federal and state taxes that may have an adverse effect on both parties to the transaction. 

Our business will have no revenue unless and until we merge with or acquire an operating business. 

We are a development stage company and have had no revenue from operations. We do not expect to realize any revenue unless and until we successfully merge with or acquire an operating business. 

Because we may seek to complete a business combination through a reverse merger , following such a transaction we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms. 

Additional risks may exist since we expect to assist a privately held business to become public through a reverse merger. Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of our Company since there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Common Stock ). No assurance can be given that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of our post-merger company in the future. 

We cannot assure you that following a business combination with an operating business, our Common Stock will be listed on NASDAQ or any other securities exchange. 

Following a business combination, we may seek the listing of our Common Stock on NASDAQ or the American Stock Exchange. However, we cannot assure you that following such a transaction, we will be able to meet the initial listing standards of either of those or any other stock exchange, or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our Common Stock on either of those or any other stock exchange. After completing a business combination, until our Common Stock is listed on the NASDAQ or another stock exchange, we expect that our Common Stock would be eligible to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board, another over-the-counter quotation system, or on the pink sheets, where our stockholders may find it more difficult to dispose of shares or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of
our Common Stock. In addition, we would be subject to an SEC rule that, if it failed to meet the criteria set forth in such rule, imposes various practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities governed by the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such rule may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our Common Stock, which may further affect its liquidity. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital following a business combination. 

Our stockholder may have a minority interest in the Company following a merger or other business combination with an operating business. 

If we consummate a merger or business combination with a company with a value in excess of the value of our Company and issue shares of Common Stock to the stockholders of such company as consideration for merging with us, our stockholder would own less than 50 of the Company after the business combination. The stockholders of the acquired company would therefore be able to control the election of our board of directors (the Board of Directors and control our Company. 

6 

There is currently no trading market for our Common Stock, and liquidity of shares of our Common Stock is limited. 

Shares of our Common Stock are not registered under the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction, and accordingly there is no public trading market for the Common Stock. Further, no public trading market is expected to develop in the foreseeable future unless and until the Company completes a business combination with an operating business and the Company thereafter files a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Therefore, outstanding shares of Common Stock cannot be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred unless subsequently registered pursuant to, or exempt from registration under, the Securities Act and any other applicable federal or state securities laws or regulations. Shares of Common Stock cannot be sold under the
exemptions from registration provided by Rule 144 under or Section 4(1) of the Securities Act Rule 144 ), in accordance with the letter from Richard K. Wulff, Chief of the Office of Small Business Policy of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Division of Corporation Finance, to Ken Worm of NASD Regulation, dated January 21, 2000 (the Wulff Letter ). The Wulff Letter provides that certain private transfers of the shares of common stock also may be prohibited without registration under federal securities laws. The SEC changed certain aspects of the Wulff Letter and such changes apply retroactively to our stockholder. Since February 15, 2008, all holders of shares of common stock of a shell company have been permitted to sell their shares of common stock under Rule 144, subject to certain restrictions, starting one year after (i) the completion of a business combination with a private company in a reverse merger or reverse takeover
transaction after which the company would cease to be a shell company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) and (ii) the disclosure of certain information on a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days thereafter. 

Compliance with the criteria for securing exemptions under federal securities laws and the securities laws of the various states is extremely complex, especially in respect of those exemptions affording flexibility and the elimination of trading restrictions in respect of securities received in exempt transactions and subsequently disposed of without registration under the Securities Act or state securities laws. 

There are issues impacting liquidity of our securities with respect to the SEC s review of a future resale registration statement. 

Since shares of our Common Stock issued prior to a business combination or reverse merger cannot currently, nor will they for a considerable period of time after we complete a business combination, be available to be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred without being registered pursuant to the Securities Act, we will likely file a resale registration statement on Form S-1, or some other available form, to register for resale such shares of Common Stock. We cannot control this future registration process in all respects as some matters are outside our control. Even if we are successful in causing the effectiveness of the resale registration statement, there can be no assurances that the occurrence of subsequent events may not preclude our ability to maintain the effectiveness of the registration
statement. Any of the foregoing items could have adverse effects on the liquidity of our shares of Common Stock. 

In addition, the SEC has recently disclosed that it has developed internal informal guidelines concerning the use of a resale registration statement to register the securities issued to certain investors in private investment in public equity (PIPE) transactions, where the issuer has a market capitalization of less than 75 million and, in general, does not qualify to file a Registration Statement on Form S-3 to register its securities if the issuer s securities are listed on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board or on the Pink Sheets. The SEC has taken the position that these smaller issuers may not be able to rely on Rule 415 under the Securities Act Rule 415 ), which generally permits the offer and sale of securities on a continued or delayed basis over a period of time, but instead would
require that the issuer offer and sell such securities in a direct or "primary" public offering, at a fixed price, if the facts and circumstances are such that the SEC believes the investors seeking to have their shares registered are underwriters and/or affiliates of the issuer. It appears that the SEC in most cases will permit a registration for resale of up to one third of the total number of shares of common stock then currently owned by persons who are not affiliates of such issuer and, in some cases, a larger percentage depending on the facts and circumstances. Staff members also have indicated that an issuer in most cases will have to wait until the later of six months after effectiveness of the first registration or such time as substantially all securities registered in the first registration are sold before filing a subsequent registration on behalf of the same investors. Since, following a reverse merger or business combination, we may have little or no tradable shares of
Common Stock, it is unclear as to how many, if any, shares of Common Stock the SEC will permit us to register for resale, but SEC staff members have indicated a willingness to consider a higher percentage in connection with registrations following reverse mergers with shell companies such as the Company. The SEC may require as a condition to the declaration of effectiveness of a resale registration statement that we reduce or cut back the number of shares of common stock to be registered in such registration statement. The result of the foregoing is that a stockholder s liquidity in Common Stock may be adversely affected in the event the SEC requires a cut back of the securities as a condition to allow the Company to rely on Rule 415 with respect to a resale registration statement, or, if the SEC requires us to file a primary registration statement. 

7 

We have never paid dividends on our Common Stock. 

We have never paid dividends on our Common Stock and do not presently intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that any funds available for payment of dividends will be re-invested into the Company to further its business strategy. 

The Company intends to issue more shares in a merger or acquisition, which will result in substantial dilution. 

Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of a maximum of 75,000,000 shares of Common Stock and a maximum of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value .0001 per share (the Preferred Stock ). Any merger or acquisition effected by us may result in the issuance of additional securities without stockholder approval and the substantial dilution in the percentage of Common Stock held by our then existing stockholders. Moreover, the Common Stock issued in any such merger or acquisition transaction may be valued on an arbitrary or non-arm s-length basis by our management, resulting in an additional reduction in the percentage of Common Stock held by our current stockholders. Our Board of Directors has the power to issue any or all of such authorized but unissued shares
without stockholder approval. To the extent that additional shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock are issued in connection with a business combination or otherwise, dilution to the interests of our stockholder will occur and the rights of the holder of Common Stock might be materially and adversely affected. 

Our stockholders may engage in a transaction to cause the Company to repurchase their shares of Common Stock. 

In order to provide an interest in the Company to one or more third parties, our stockholders may choose to cause the Company to sell Company securities to third parties, with the proceeds of such sale(s) being utilized by the Company to repurchase their shares of Common Stock. As a result of such transaction(s), our management, stockholders and Board of Directors may change. 

Our Board of Directors has the power to issue shares of Preferred Stock with certain rights without stockholder approval. 

Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time to time by its Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue shares of Preferred Stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting, or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the Common Stock. In the event of issuance, the Preferred Stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of our authorized Preferred Stock, there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future. 

Item 2. Properties. 

The Company neither rents nor owns any properties. The Company utilizes the office space and equipment of its parent at no cost. Management estimates such amounts to be immaterial. The Company currently has no policy with respect to investments or interests in real estate, real estate mortgages or securities of, or interests in, persons primarily engaged in real estate activities. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 

Presently, there are not any pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or as to which any of its property is subject, and no such proceedings are known to the Company to be threatened or contemplated against it.

Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 75,000,000 shares of Common Stock. Our Common Stock is not listed on a publicly-traded market. Since February 15, 2010, there was one holder of record of our Common Stock. 

Preferred Stock 

Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. The Company has not yet issued any of the Preferred Stock. 

Dividend Policy 

The Company has not declared or paid any cash dividends on Common Stock and does not intend to declare or pay any cash dividend in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends, if any, is within the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company s earnings, if any, its capital requirements and financial condition and such other factors as the Board of Directors may consider. 

Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans 

None. 

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 

The Company did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2010. 

Item 6. Selected Financial Data. 

Not applicable. 

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. 

Plan of Operation 

The Company has not realized any revenues from operations since inception, and its plan of operation for the next twelve months is to locate a suitable acquisition or merger candidate and consummate a business combination. The Company may need additional cash advances from its stockholder or loans from other parties to pay for operating expenses until the Company consummates a merger or business combination with a privately-held operating company. Although it is currently anticipated that the Company can satisfy its cash requirements with additional cash advances or loans from other parties, if needed, for at least the next twelve months, the Company can provide no assurance that it can continue to satisfy its cash requirements for such period. 

Since our formation on May 26, 2005, our purpose has been to effect a business combination with an operating business which we believe has significant growth potential. We are currently considered to be a blank check company in as much as we have no specific business plans, no operations, revenues or employees. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly contingent upon a business combination and/or the successful sale of securities in the company. 

9 

As a result of our limited resources, we expect to effect only a single business combination. Accordingly, the prospects for our success will be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike certain entities that have the resources to consummate several business combinations or entities operating in multiple industries or multiple segments of a single industry, we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. A target business may be dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services, in which case there will be an even higher risk that the target business will not prove to be commercially viable. 

On February 15, 2010, the shareholders of the Company sold 100 of the outstanding common stock (1,665,000 shares) to Efftec at which time the Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Efftec. 

On December 18, 2009, the Company filed a Form 15 with the SEC to temporarily suspend its filing responsibilities. 

Our officer and director is only required to devote a very limited portion of his time to our affairs on a part-time or as-needed basis. We expect to use outside consultants, advisors, attorneys and accountants as necessary, none of which will be hired on a retainer basis. We do not anticipate hiring any full-time employees so long as we are seeking and evaluating business opportunities. 

Results of Operations 

The Company has not conducted any active operations since inception, except for its efforts to locate a suitable acquisition or merger transaction. No revenue has been generated by the Company during such period, and it is unlikely the Company will have any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition of or merger with another operating company, of which there can be no assurance. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The SEC issued Financial Reporting Release No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure about Critical Accounting Policies FRR 60 ), suggesting companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies. In FRR 60, the SEC defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results, and require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

The Company is a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act and currently has no operations. When the Company completes an acquisition, it will establish its critical accounting policies for the new operation.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors 

Black Nickel Acquisition Corp III 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Black Nickel Acquisition Corp III (a development stage company) the Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the period from inception (May 26, 2005) through December 31, 2010. The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Black Nickel Acquisition Corp III as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the period from inception (May 26, 2005) through December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company is in the development stage and has suffered recurring losses. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regards to these matters are also described in Note 1. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Black Nickel Acquisition Corp. III 

(A Development Stage Enterprise) 

Notes to Financial Statements 

1. Development Stage Enterprise 

Black Nickel Acquisition Corp. III, a development stage enterprise (the Company ), was incorporated in the state of Delaware on May 26, 2005 and since February 15, 2010 maintains its principal offices in the office of its parent Efftec International, Inc. ("Efftec") in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination. 

On February 15, 2010, the shareholders of the Company sold 100 of the outstanding common stock (1,665,000 shares) to Efftec at which time the Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Efftec. 

On December 18, 2009, the Company filed a Form 15 with the SEC to temporarily suspend its filing responsibilities. Filing of this Form 10-K is a step in bringing our filing obligations current. 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company incurred net losses from May 26, 2005 (inception) through the period ended December 31, 2010 of 160,518. In addition, the Company s development activities since inception have been financially sustained through equity and debt financing. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon management s plans to find a suitable acquisition or merger candidate, raise additional capital from the sale of stock, receive additional paid in capital from its existing stockholders and ultimately, the achievement of significant
positive operating results. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be required should the Company be unable to recover the value of its assets or satisfy its liabilities. 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Loss Per Common Share - T he Company is required to report both basic earnings per share, which is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, and diluted earnings per share, which is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus all potential dilutive shares outstanding. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no common stock equivalents. Accordingly, basic and diluted earnings per share are the same for all periods presented. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments - Current assets and current liabilities are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value because of their short-term maturity. The notes payable approximates fair value based on market rates available to the Company for financing with similar terms. 

Cash and cash equivalents - The Company considers all cash on hand, cash in banks and all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. 

Income Taxes - The Company is required to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates in effect. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. 

17 

The Company has approximately 62,000 in gross deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010, resulting from deferred start-up costs of 160,518 which are capitalized and amortized for income tax purposes and expensed for financial reporting purposes, a change of 1,500 for 2010. A valuation allowance has been recorded to fully offset these deferred tax assets as the future realization of the related tax benefits is uncertain. The difference between the statutory federal income tax rate of 34 , state taxes net of federal benefits of 4.6 , and the effective rate of 0 is due to the capitalization of the Company s start-up costs for tax purposes. 

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties relating to any tax obligations. The Company currently has no federal or state tax examinations in progress nor has it had any federal or state tax examinations since its inception. All of the Company s tax years are subject to federal and state tax examination. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets - Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a market value methodology. 

Impairment of Long-lived Assets - The Company evaluates its long-lived assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events change or if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements - There are several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB which are not yet effective. Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company s financial position or operating results. 

3. Goodwill 

On February 15, 2010, Efftec International, Inc. acquired 100 of the Company's common stock in exchange for 350,000 shares of Efftec common stock valued at 52,500 based on its trading price on that date. Efftec and the Company utilized "push down" accounting and recorded the following transaction.

4. Notes Payable - Related Parties 

During 2007, the Company entered into two loan agreements, consisting of an 8,000 loan with a stockholder and a 16,000 loan with an entity owned by certain stockholders of the Company. Any amounts outstanding under the loans accrue interest at 10 per annum computed on actual days outstanding in a 365/366 day year. The 16,000 loan and the related accrued interest was due on September 5, 2007. The 8,000 loan and the related accrued interest was due on October 27, 2007.

Item 9A(T). Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules, regulations and related forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

As of December 31, 2010, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The Company has only one officer and director and no other employees and the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded there was a material weakness due to a lack of segregation of duties. The principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded this weakness was mitigated by engaging a third party consultant to assist the Company in the preparation of its financial statements and its SEC filings. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this Annual Report. 

Changes in Internal Controls. 

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls. This annual report does not include a report of management's assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of the company's registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies.

Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act 

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company s directors and officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10 of a registered class of the Company s equity securities, to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership of the Company s securities with the SEC on Forms 3, 4 and 5. Officers, directors and greater than 10 stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 

Based solely on the Company s review of the copies of the forms received by it during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and written representations that no other reports were required, the Company believes that no persons who, at any time during such fiscal year, was a director, officer or beneficial owner of more than 10 of Common Stock failed to comply with all Section 16(a) filing requirements during such fiscal year. 

Code of Ethics 

The Company has not yet adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. 

Nominating Committee 

We have not adopted any procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our Board of Directors. 

Audit Committee 

The Board of Directors acts as the audit committee. The Company does not have a qualified financial expert at this time because it has not been able to hire a qualified candidate. Further, the Company believes that it has inadequate financial resources at this time to hire such an expert. The Company intends to continue to search for a qualified individual for hire.
