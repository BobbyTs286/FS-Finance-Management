FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements 
(within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) regarding the plans
and objectives of management for future operations. Such statements involve known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements
of ours to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed
or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are
based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Our plans and
objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving judgments with respect to, among other
things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of
which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of
us. Although we believe that our assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are
reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance
that the forward-looking statements included in this report will prove to be accurate. In light of
the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein,
particularly in view of our limited operations, the inclusion of such information should not be
regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the objectives and plans of ours will
be achieved. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date on which such statements are made. Factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those express or implied by such forward-looking statements
include, but are not limited to, the factors set forth in this report under the headings The
Company , Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations . We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be
made from time to time on our behalf. 

THE COMPANY 

Overview 

CDSI Holdings Inc. is a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and holds limited amounts of cash. Prior to April 2007, we held 2,800 shares of Common
Stock of Dialog Group Inc. Dialog , formerly known as IMX Pharmaceuticals Inc.). Prior to
February 2000, our former wholly-owned subsidiary, Controlled Distribution Systems, Inc. CDS ),
was primarily engaged in marketing and leasing a prepaid, wireless, remote-operated retail
inventory control and dispensing system for tobacco products called the Coinexx Star 10. Prior to
October 2000, CDS also owned traditional cigarette vending machines and a related vending route.
In February 2000, we terminated all operations relating to marketing and leasing the Coinexx Star
10 system. In October 2000, CDS sold the assets of its cigarette vending route, including vending
machines and a van. Prior to January 2007, Dialog was a provider of relationship marketing
communications services, business and consumer targeting databases for the healthcare, financial
and other direct-to-customer, direct-to-professional business markets. In January 2007, the Dialog
reported that it had completed the sale of substantially all of its operating assets. We sold our
remaining 2,800 shares in Dialog in April 2007.

Table of Contents 

We intend to seek new business opportunities. As we have only limited cash resources, our
ability to complete any acquisition or investment opportunities we may identify will depend on our
ability to raise additional financing, as to which there can be no assurance. There can be no
assurance that we will successfully identify, complete or integrate any future acquisition or
investment, or that acquisitions or investments, if completed, will contribute favorably to our
operations and future financial condition.

Company History 

We were incorporated in Delaware in December 1993 under the name PC411, Inc. In January 1999,
we changed our name to CDSI Holdings Inc. to reflect the change in our principal business. We were
originally formed to develop an on-line service that transmits name, address, telephone number and
other related information digitally to users of personal computers. In May 1998 we acquired CDS
and, in December 1998, CDS acquired substantially all of the assets of TD Rowe Corporation s New
York cigarette vending route. In November 1998, we transferred substantially all of the non-cash
assets and certain liabilities used in our on-line data distribution business to
ThinkDirectMarketing Inc. TDMI in exchange for an initial 42.5 interest in that company. The
other investors of TDMI included Acxiom Corporation, Cater Barnard plc and TDMI s management and
employees. In January 2002, Dialog acquired all the stock of TDMI that it did not already own. In
April 2007, we sold our remaining 2,800 shares of Dialog Common Stock for 204.

In November 2003, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary CDS merged with CDSI Holdings Inc. as the
surviving corporation.

ThinkDirectMarketing, Inc. 

In November 1998, we contributed substantially all the non-cash assets and certain liabilities
related to our on-line electronic delivery information service to TDMI, and received preferred
stock of TDMI. In January 2002, Dialog acquired all the shares of TDMI that it did not already own
by exercising an option previously granted by the remaining TDMI stockholders. We received 8,250
shares of Dialog Class B Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for our interest in TDMI, which
were converted into shares of Dialog Common Stock. We sold shares of Dialog stock for 4,888 in
2004 and our remaining shares in April 2007 for 204.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2008, we had two employees, our President and Chief Executive Officer and
our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, both of whom are also employees of Vector Group
Ltd. Vector ), our largest stockholder. We believe that we have good relations with our
employees.

ITEM 1A. 
 
 RISK FACTORS 

Accumulated Deficit; History of Losses. At December 31, 2008, we had an accumulated deficit
of approximately 8.2 million. We have reported an operating loss in each of our fiscal quarters
since inception and expects to continue to incur operating losses in the immediate future. We have
reduced operating expenses and are seeking acquisition and investment opportunities. There is a
risk that we will continue to incur operating losses.

Limited Resources and No Source of Operating Revenues . At December 31, 2008, we had cash and
cash equivalents of 19,698 and net working capital of 8,048. Since the sale of CDS s vending
route in October 2000, we have had no source of operating revenue. We will not achieve any
significant revenues until the consummation of an acquisition or investment, if ever. Moreover,
there can
be no assurance that any acquisition or investment, if achieved, will result in material revenues
from our operations or that we will operate on a profitable basis.

-3- 

Table of Contents 

Additional Financing Requirements. Our ability to complete any acquisition or investment
opportunities we may identify will depend upon the availability of, and our ability to secure, new
equity or debt financing. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate
levels of revenues and cash flows sufficient from any acquisition or investment to fund operations
or that we will be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, if at all, to achieve profitable
operations.

Blind Pool Broad Discretion of Management. Prospective investors who invest in us will do
so without an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any proposed transactions.
As a result, investors will be entirely dependent on the broad discretion and judgment of
management in connection with the application of our working capital and the selection of an
acquisition or investment target. There can be no assurance that determinations ultimately made by
us will permit us to achieve profitable operations.

Acquisition and Investment Risks. As part of our business strategy, we may evaluate new
acquisition and investment opportunities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including
difficulties in the assimilation of the operations and products or services of the acquired
companies, the expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and subsequent assimilation of
operations and products or services and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired
company. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify, complete or integrate any
future acquisitions or investments or that completed acquisitions or investments will contribute
favorably to our operations and future financial condition.

Dependence Upon Executive Officers and Board of Directors . The ability of us to successfully
effect a transaction will be largely dependent upon the efforts of our management and the Board of
Directors. We only have two employees, none of whom work full-time for us. No assurance can be
given that the Board of Directors and management will be successful in consummating a transaction
and achieving profitability.

Limited Trading Market . Since 1999, our common stock has been traded on the OTC Bulletin
Board of the National Association of Security Dealers, Inc. There is a limited trading market in
our shares and a stockholder could likely find it difficult to sell or to obtain quotations as to
prices of our shares. During 2008, the average daily trading volume of our Common Stock was
approximately 2,367 shares, with 190 days of 252 trading days having no trading activity. No
assurances can be given that our Common Stock will continue to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board or
that an orderly trading market will be maintained for our Common Stock.

Absence of Full-Time Management Personnel. Our current President and Chief Executive Officer
and our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer are executive officers of Vector. Neither of
these individuals devotes his full time and attention to our affairs.

Concentration of Stock Ownership. Vector beneficially owns approximately 47.8 of our
outstanding Common Stock. As a result, Vector effectively controls all matters requiring
stockholder approval, including the election of directors, the appointment of officers and approval
of significant corporate transactions including a merger, an acquisition or a sale of all or
substantially all of our assets. Such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of
delaying or preventing a change in control. In addition, we are subject to a State of Delaware
statute regulating business combinations, which may also hinder or delay a change of control.

Absence of Dividends. We have never paid nor do we expect in the foreseeable future to pay
any dividends.

-4- 

Table of Contents 

Limitation on Director Liability. To the extent permitted under the Delaware General
Corporation Law, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation limits the liability of directors for
monetary damages for breaches of a director s fiduciary duty, including breaches that constitute
gross negligence. As a result, under certain circumstances, neither us nor our stockholders may be
able to recover damages from directors.

Dilution. Our Board of Directors, without any action by the stockholders, is authorized to
designate and issue additional classes or series of capital stock (including classes or series of
preferred stock) as it deems appropriate and to establish the rights, preferences and privileges of
such classes or series. The issuance of any new class or series of capital stock would not only
dilute the ownership interest of our current stockholders but may also adversely affect the voting
power and other rights of holders of Common Stock. The rights of holders of preferred stock and
other classes of common stock that may be issued may be superior to the rights of the holders of
the existing class of Common Stock in terms of the payment of ordinary and liquidating dividends
and voting rights.

Forward-looking Statements. This report contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties. Words such as anticipate, believes, expects, future and intends 
and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements. You should not unduly
rely on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. Our
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements
for many reasons, including the risks described above and elsewhere in this report.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 

We intend to seek new business opportunities. As we have only limited cash resources, our
ability to complete any acquisition or investment opportunities we may identify will depend on our
ability to raise additional financing, as to which there can be no assurance. There can be no
assurance that we will successfully identify, complete or integrate any future acquisition or
investment, or that acquisitions or investments, if completed, will contribute favorably to our
operations and future financial condition.

Results of Operations 

Revenues 

For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we did not generate revenues from operations.

Expenses 

Expenses associated with corporate activities were 36,029 and 35,070 for the years ended
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The expenses in both years were primarily associated
with costs necessary to maintain a public company, which consist primarily of directors fees,
auditing fees and stock transfer fees.

Other Income 

Interest income was 439 and 2,501 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The decrease is due primarily to lower cash balances and lower interest rates in
2008 versus 2007.

The recovery of unclaimed property relates to refunds receivable for unclaimed property in a
state where we previously conducted business. We received 21,791 of refund claims in 2007.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At December 31, 2008, we had an accumulated deficit of 8,233,096. We have reported an
operating loss in each of our fiscal quarters since inception and we expect to continue to incur
operating losses in the immediate future. We have reduced operating expenses and are seeking
acquisition and investment opportunities. No assurance can be given that we will not continue to
incur operating losses.

We have limited available cash, limited cash flow, limited liquid assets and no credit
facilities. We have not been able to generate sufficient cash from operations and, as a
consequence, financing has been required to fund ongoing operations. Since completion of our
initial public offering of our common stock (the IPO in May 1997, we have primarily financed our
operations with the net proceeds of the IPO. The funds were used to complete the introduction of
the PC411 Service over the Internet, to expand marketing, sales and advertising, to develop or
acquire new services or databases, to acquire CDS and for general corporate purposes.

Cash used for operations for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was 30,590 and
 11,728, respectively. The decrease is associated primarily with the receipt of the refunds of
unclaimed
property in 2007 and the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. We
evaluate our accruals on a quarterly basis and make adjustments when appropriate.

-7- 

Table of Contents 

We do not expect significant capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2009.

At December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents of 19,698.

Inflation and changing prices had no material impact on revenues or the results of operations
for years ended December 31, 2008.

We are not authorized to transact business in any state other than Delaware, which is our
state of incorporation. We received an inquiry from the Florida Department of State inquiring
whether we should have registered with the Florida Department of State in previous years, beginning
in 1998. We have responded to the inquiry and believe our activities in prior years did not meet
the requirements for such registration; however, no assurance can be provided that our position
will be accepted by the Florida Department of State. We are unable to quantify the amount of any
registration fees and other costs attributable to any failure to register and have not accrued any
amounts in our financial statements related to such inquiry.

In March 2009, we entered into a revolving credit promissory note where our principal
stockholder, Vector, has agreed to lend us 50,000 to meet our liquidity requirements over the next
twelve months. The facility bears interest at 11 per annum and is due on December 31, 2012. No
amounts were outstanding under the facility at March 27, 2009.

Although there can be no assurance, we believe that we will be able to continue as a going
concern for the next twelve months.

We or our affiliates, including Vector, may, from time to time, based upon present market
conditions, purchase shares of the Common Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions.

ITEM 9A (T). CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2008. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, such disclosure
controls and procedures were effective in ensuring information required to be disclosed by us in
reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i)
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (ii)
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

(b) Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. As of December 31, 2008, under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation was conducted of
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework contained
in the report titled Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). This evaluation included review of
the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the
operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on that evaluation,
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2008.

This annual report does not include an attestation report of Becher Della Torre Gitto Company PC,
our independent registered public accounting firm, regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Our report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public
accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit
us to provide only management s report in this annual report.

(c) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect
that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or
detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance the objectives of the control system are met.
Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact there are resource constraints, and
the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the
controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
due to errors or fraud may occur and not be detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance that their objectives are achieved.

(d) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Each director of ours holds office until the next annual meeting of stockholders, or until his
successor is elected and qualified. At present, our By-laws provide for not less than two
directors or more than nine directors. Currently, there are three directors. The By-laws permit
the Board of Directors to fill any vacancy and such director may serve until the next annual
meeting of stockholders or until his successor is elected and qualified. Officers serve at the
discretion of the Board of Directors.

Audit Committee 

The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors consists of Mr. Lundgren and, prior to March 27,
2008, consisted of Messrs. Lundgren and Henry Morris. Our Board of Directors has determined that
Mr. Lundgren is an audit committee financial expert and independent , and that Mr. Morris was
 independent prior to his resignation on March 27, 2008, as those terms are defined under the
applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules. In determining that Messrs. Lundgren and
Morris were independent , the Board used the definition of independence in Rule 4200(a)(15) of the
NASD s listing standards.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our officers and directors, and
persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities, to file
reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 SEC ). Officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders are required by SEC
regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms which they file. Based solely on
review of the copies of such forms furnished to us, or written representations that no Forms 5 were
required, we believe that, during and with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, all
officers and directors complied with applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements.

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to our two employees, our President and Chief
Executive Officer and our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will provide, without
charge, a copy of the Code of Ethics on the written request of any person addressed to our Chief
Financial Officer at CDSI Holdings Inc., 100 S.E. Second Street, 32 nd Floor, Miami,

(1) Richard J. Lampen, who has served as our President and Chief Executive Officer since

other than the normal compensation paid to directors of ours. See Compensation of
Directors. 

Stock Options 

In order to attract and retain persons necessary for our business, we adopted the 1997 Stock
Option Plan (the Option Plan covering up to 750,000 shares, pursuant to which officers,
directors and key employees of ours and our consultants are eligible to receive incentive and/or
non-incentive stock options. The Option Plan, which expired on January 29, 2007, was administered
by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee. The selection of participants, allotment
of shares, determination of price and other conditions relating to the grant of options was
determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee. Incentive stock options
granted under the Option Plan were exercisable for a period of up to 10 years from the date of
grant at an exercise price which is not less than the fair market value of the Common Stock on the
date of the grant, except that the term of an incentive stock option granted under the Option Plan
to a stockholder owning more than 10 of the outstanding Common Stock could not exceed five years
and its exercise price could not be less than 110 of the fair market value of the shares on the
date of the grant.

Under the Option Plan, each director who is not a full-time employee, immediately upon first
taking office, was granted options to purchase 6,000 shares of Common Stock exercisable at the fair
market value of such shares on the date of grant. Options for 3,000 shares covered thereby were
exercisable immediately and options for 3,000 shares became exercisable on the first anniversary of
the date of grant. Subsequently, the Option Plan provided for annual grants of options to purchase
3,000 shares of Common Stock upon reelection as a director.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 
CDSI Holdings Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of CDSI Holdings Inc. (the Company as of December
31, 2008 and 2007, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows
for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2008. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the CDSI Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended
December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United State
of America.

 Business and Organization 

CDSI Holdings Inc. (the Company or CDSI was incorporated in Delaware on December 29, 1993
and is a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On
January 12, 1999, the Company s stockholders voted to change the corporate name of the Company
from PC411, Inc. to CDSI Holdings Inc. Prior to May 1998, the Company s principal business
was an on-line electronic delivery information service that transmits name, address, telephone
number and other related information digitally to users of personal computers (the PC411
Service ). In May 1998, the Company acquired Controlled Distribution Systems, Inc. CDS ), a
company engaged in the marketing and leasing of an inventory control system for tobacco
products. In February 2000, CDSI announced CDS will no longer actively engage in the business
of marketing and leasing the inventory control system. In November 2003, the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiary CDS merged with the Company as the surviving corporation. 

At December 31, 2008, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately 8,233,096. The
Company has reported an operating loss in each of its fiscal quarters since inception and it
expects to continue to incur operating losses in the immediate future. The Company has
reduced operating expenses and is seeking acquisition and investment opportunities. There is
a risk the Company will continue to incur operating losses. 

CDSI intends to seek new business opportunities. As CDSI has only limited cash resources,
CDSI s ability to complete any acquisition or investment opportunities it may identify will
depend on its ability to raise additional financing, as to which there can be no assurance.
There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully identify, complete or integrate
any future acquisition or investment, or that acquisitions or investments, if completed, will
contribute favorably to its operations and future financial condition.

 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include money market funds with a maturity of three months or less. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The fair values of the Company s cash and cash equivalents and accrued expenses approximate
their carrying values due to the relatively short maturities of these instruments.

Notes to Financial Statements Continued

Income Taxes 

The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Under the
liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax
rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. 

Computation of Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share 

Basic net loss per share of Common Stock has been computed by dividing the net loss applicable
to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the year. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, increased by the
assumed conversion of other potentially dilutive securities during the period. Stock options
and warrants totaling 9,000 and 128,000 shares at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively,
were excluded from the calculation of diluted per share results presented because their effect
was anti-dilutive. Accordingly, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net
loss per common share. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Concentrations of Risks 

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk
consist principally of cash held in overnight money market accounts. The Company has no
formal policy requiring collateral to support the financial instruments subject to credit
risk.

 Sale of Dialog Stock 

Dialog Group Inc. owns the PC411 Service. In April 2007, the Company sold its remaining 2,800
shares of Dialog stock for 204 and recorded a gain of 204 from the sale for the year ended
December 31, 2007. 

(4) 
 
 Investments and Fair Value Measurements 

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements , for financial
assets and financial liabilities. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value
measurements but rather introduces a framework for measuring fair value and expands required
disclosure about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities. 

SFAS No. 157 discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market
prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost
approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The statement
clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing amounts that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants. 

SFAS No. 157 utilizes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a
brief description of those three levels: 

Level 1

Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2

Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
assets or liability, either directory or indirectly. These
include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in
active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

Level 3

Unobservable inputs in which there is little market data,
which requires the reporting entity to develop their own
assumptions

This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data, when available, and to minimize the
use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. 

The Company s population of recurring financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value
measurements and the necessary disclosures consists of approximately 19,394 of cash invested
in a money market fund. The fair value determination of the money market fund is a Level 1
asset under the SFAS 157 hierarchy. The money market fund is invested in Treasury Funds with
quoted prices in active markets.

 Related Party Transactions 

Certain accounting and related finance functions are performed on behalf of the Company by
employees of the parent of the Company s principal stockholder, Vector Group Ltd. Vector ).
Expenses incurred relating to these functions are allocated to the Company and paid as
incurred to Vector based on management s best estimate of the cost involved. The amounts
allocated were immaterial for all periods presented herein. 

On March 26, 2009, the Company and Vector entered into a 50,000 Revolving Credit Promissory
Note (the Revolver due December 31, 2012. The loan bears interest at 11 per annum and is
due on December 31, 2012. No amounts were outstanding under the Revolver at March 27, 2009.

 Stock Options 

The Company granted equity compensation under its 1997 Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan ),
which expired on January 29, 2007 and provided for the grant of options to purchase the
Company s stock to the employees and directors of the Company. The term of the options granted
under the 1997 Plan was limited to 10 years from the date of grant. 

The Company accounts for stock options under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), which requires
the Company to value unvested stock options granted prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)
under the fair value method of accounting and expense this amount in the statement of
operations over the stock option s remaining vesting period. The Company adopted this new
standard, prospectively, on January 1, 2006. Because all options outstanding were fully vested
at January 1, 2006, there was no impact on the Company s financial statements. 

As permitted by SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 123(R), the fair value of option grants is estimated
at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. There were no option grants
in the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. 

Approximately 25,333 and 119,000 options to acquire shares of Common Stock expired during 2007
and 2008. In addition to the options issued to employees, the Company had granted New Valley
LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vector, options to acquire 500,000 shares of Common Stock at
 5.75 per share, which fully vested upon the completion of the Company s initial public
offering in May 1997. These options expired in March 2007.

 Income Taxes 

During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no income and therefore
made no provision for Federal and state income taxes. 

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had approximately 7,025,000 and 6,995,000,
respectively, of net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax reporting purposes
available to offset future taxable income, if any; such carryforwards expire between 2009 and
2028 (federal) and 2006 and 2028 (state). Deferred tax assets and liabilities principally
relate to net operating loss carryforwards and aggregate approximately 2,500,000 before
valuation allowance. In assessing the realizability of the net deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary
differences become deductible. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has provided a full
valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets due to the Company s uncertainty of future
taxable income against which the deferred tax asset may be utilized. Accordingly, no deferred
tax asset has been recorded on the accompanying balance sheet. 

(9) 
 
 Contingencies 

As of December 31, 2008, the Company was not authorized to transact business in any state
other than Delaware, which is its state of incorporation. The Company received an inquiry
from the Florida Department of State (the FDS inquiring whether the Company should have
registered with the FDS in previous years, beginning in 1998. In March 2006, the Company
responded to the inquiry and stated it believes its activities in previous years did not meet
the requirements for such registration; however, no assurance can be provided that the
Company s position will be accepted by the FDS. The Company is unable to quantify the amount
of any registration fees and other costs attributable to any failure to register and has not
accrued any amounts in its financial statements related to such inquiry. 

The Company received refunds of approximately 21,791 in 2007 for unclaimed property in a
state the Company previously conducted business.
