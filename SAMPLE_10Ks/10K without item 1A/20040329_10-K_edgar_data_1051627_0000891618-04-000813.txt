Item 1. 
 
 Business Overview 

We design, develop, manufacture and distribute
high-performance compound semiconductor substrates comprising
gallium arsenide (GaAs), indium phosphide (InP) and germanium
(Ge). Our substrate products are used primarily in wireless
communications, lighting display applications, and fiber optic
communications. We believe our proprietary vertical gradient
freeze, or VGF, technique for manufacturing compound
semiconductor substrates provides significant benefits over
other methods and has enabled us to become a leading
manufacturer of compound semiconductor substrates. We pioneered
the commercial use of VGF technology to manufacture GaAs
substrates and subsequently used VGF technology to manufacture
substrates from InP, and Ge. Some of our competitors followed
our lead by developing their own versions of VGF technology.
Customers for our substrates include United Epitaxy Company,
Motorola, Agilent Technologies, Samsung, EMCORE, Kopin, IQE, and
Sumika. Over the past four years, we have implemented an
initiative, which is now largely complete, to reduce the cost of
manufacturing our substrates by moving most of our operations to
China and by investing in sources of low cost raw materials.

On June 24, 2003, the Company s Board
of Directors approved management s plan to exit the
Company s unprofitable opto-electronics business. The
disposition was a result of continuing operating losses and
negative cash flows from the division and significant
uncertainty regarding future profitability.

We were incorporated in California in December
1986 and reincorporated in Delaware in May 1988. We changed our
name from American Xtal Technology, Inc. to AXT, Inc. in July
2000. Our principal offices are located at 4281 Technology
Drive, Fremont, California 94538, and our telephone number at
this address is (510) 683-5900. Our web site is
www.axt.com; however, the information on our web site does not
constitute a part of this annual report on Form 10-K and is
not incorporated herein. We make available, free of charge, on
or through our web site, our annual, quarterly and current
reports, and any amendments to those reports.

Industry Background 

Historically, most semiconductors were created on
a single crystal base material, or substrate, of silicon. Today,
however, many electronic and opto-electronics semiconductors are
being developed with requirements that exceed the capabilities
of silicon. These semiconductors address the continually
increasing demand to send, receive and display information on
high-speed wireless and wireline networks. This demand creates a
growing need for power-efficient high-performance semiconductors
that can operate at high frequencies and can be produced
cost-effectively in large volumes. These semiconductors enable
the growth and development of a wide range of end user
applications. For example, Gartner, Inc., an independent
research firm, expects

1

Table of Contents 

worldwide mobile terminal production to grow from
approximately 510 million units in 2003 to approximately
560 million units in 2004.

Other examples of applications for these systems
include:

voice and high-speed wireless data systems;

infrared emitters and optical detectors in
 computer systems;

fiber optic networks and optical systems within
 these networks;

selected wi-fi networks

solid-state lighting, including exterior and
 interior automobile lighting; and

satellite communications systems.

As a result of the limitations of silicon-based
technologies, semiconductor device manufacturers use compound
semiconductor substrates to improve the performance of
semiconductor devices and to enable these new applications. This
use occurs even though these compound semiconductor substrates
are more expensive than silicon. Compound semiconductor
substrates are composed of multiple elements that include a
metal, such as gallium, aluminum or indium, and a non-metal,
such as arsenic, phosphorus or nitrogen. The resulting compounds
include gallium arsenide, indium phosphide and gallium nitride.
Advantages of devices manufactured on compound substrates over
devices manufactured using silicon substrates include:

operation at higher speeds;

lower power consumption;

less noise and distortion; and

opto-electronic properties that enable devices to
 emit and detect light.

A key step in producing a compound semiconductor
substrate is to grow a crystal of the materials. Historically,
two processes were used to grow crystals: the Liquid
Encapsulated Czochralski, or LEC, technique and the
Horizontal-Bridgeman, or HB, technique. We believe two trends
reduced the appeal of these techniques: more semiconductor
devices are being formed using an epitaxial process and
semiconductor device manufacturers are switching their
production lines to larger diameter substrates, including
six-inch diameters for electronic device applications and three-
and four-inch for opto-electronic device applications. The LEC
and HB techniques each have difficulties producing high quality,
low-cost compound semiconductor substrates for epitaxial
processing. Substrates produced using the LEC technique have a
high volume of defects as size increases beyond four-inches in
diameter. The HB technique has been unable to reliably produce
substrates more than three-inches in diameter.

We introduced our VGF technique in 1986 to
respond to the limitations inherent in the LEC and HB
techniques, and, in recent years, some of our competitors who
previously relied on the LEC or HB methods have also developed
their own versions of VGF. We believe that a majority of the
substrates sold commercially in 2003 for electronic device
applications were manufactured using the VGF or similar
techniques.

Compound semiconductor substrates enable the
development of a wide range of electronic products including
power amplifiers and radio frequency integrated circuits used in
wireless handsets. Compound substrates can also be used to
create opto-electronic products including high brightness light
emitting diodes, or HBLEDs, and vertical cavity surface emitting
lasers, or VCSELs, used in solid-state lighting and fiber optic
communications, respectively.

The AXT Advantage 

We are a leading developer and supplier of
high-performance compound semiconductor substrates. There are
three key causes of our success:

Our VGF technology is a competitive
advantage. We pioneered the commercial
use of VGF technology to manufacture GaAs substrates and we
believe that through the use of VGF we became a leading
worldwide supplier of GaAs substrates. Our VGF process produces
substrates with high mechanical strength and physical and
chemical uniformity, as well as low crystal defect densities.
The following changes in our customers technologies are
increasing the share of substrates sold with these features:

Greater use of epitaxy rather than ion
 implantation. Many of the newest
 generation of high-performance semiconductor devices for fiber
 optic and wireless communications applications, including
 heterojunction bipolar transistors, or HBTs, and pseudomorphic
 high electron mobility transistors, or PHEMTs, are popular
 because they offer lower power consumption and better device
 linearity than their predecessors. These devices are created
 using epitaxial processed substrates. Our VGF substrates are
 more suitable for these applications than are products
 manufactured using LEC and HB technologies, and competing
 materials such as silicon germanium, or SiGe.

Switch to six-inch diameter
 wafers. Many semiconductor device
 manufacturers switched their GaAs production lines to six-inch
 diameter substrates in order to reduce unit costs and increase
 capacity. We were among the first competitors able to deliver
 large volumes of six-inch diameter VGF substrates and retain a
 significant amount of manufacturing capacity for this product.

Customer technology
 independence. Our semiconductor device
 manufacturing customers often compete among themselves. For
 example, several of our customers compete for technological
 leadership in the wireless handset market. These customers or
 end-users all manufacture their devices on GaAs substrates. We
 are, therefore, largely immune from the effects of such
 competition and benefit from an overall need for faster, more
 power efficient electronic and opto-electronic devices.

Some customers specify VGF
substrates. Our wafers are qualified
with many of the key suppliers of GaAs and InP semiconductor
devices. The qualification process, which is lengthy and must be
repeated for each customer, can be a barrier to entry for a new
material or supplier. Furthermore, certain of our customers now
effectively specify that they will only accept VGF-grown or
equivalent substrates for their manufacturing processes. The
lengthy qualification period benefits us when we are already
qualified with a customer, but acts as a barrier to entry for
those customers with which we are not qualified.

Our low-cost manufacturing is an
advantage. In 1998, we began moving
portions of our substrate manufacturing operations to China, to
benefit from a combination of lower costs for facilities, labor
and materials than we encounter in the United States. That move
continued and as of the end of 2003, most of our substrate
manufacturing activities occur in China. We have also made some
strategic investments in raw materials producers, including one
that produces gallium, that provide us with a secured and low
cost source of important materials and enables us to market
surplus production to others. We believe this provides us with a
cost advantage vis- -vis our competitors, which do not
enjoy similar arrangements.

Technology 

Our core technologies include our proprietary VGF
technique used to produce high quality crystals that are
processed into compound substrates, and our gallium extraction
technology which allows us to extract raw gallium from aluminum
ore.

Our VGF technique is designed to control the
crystal-growth process with minimal temperature variation and is
the technique we use to produce our GaAs, InP and Ge substrates.
Unlike traditional techniques, our VGF technique places the hot
compound melt above the cool crystal, thereby reducing the
turbulence at the interface of the melt and the solid crystal,
compared with the LEC technique in which the melt and crystal
are inverted. The temperature gradient between the melt and the
crystal in the VGF technique is significantly lower than in
traditional techniques. These aspects of the VGF technique
enable us to grow crystals that have a relatively low defect
density and high uniformity. The crystal and the resulting
substrate are mechanically strong, resulting in lower breakage
rates during a customer s manufacturing process. Since the
temperature gradient is controlled electronically rather than by
physical movement, the sensitive crystal is not disturbed as it
may be during some competitors VGF-like growth processes.
In addition, the melt and growing crystal are contained in a
closed chamber, which isolates the crystal from the outside
environment to reduce potential contamination. This substrate
isolation allows for more precise control of the
gallium-to-arsenic ratio, resulting in better consistency and
uniformity of the crystals.

Our VGF technique offers several benefits when
compared to traditional crystal growing technologies. The Liquid
Encapsulated Czochralski, or LEC, technique is the traditional
method for producing semi-insulating GaAs substrates for
electronic applications. During the LEC process, the crystal is
grown by dipping a seed crystal through molten boric oxide into
a melt and slowly pulling the seed up into the cool zone above
the boric oxide where the crystal hardens. Unlike the VGF
technique, the LEC technique is designed so that the hotter GaAs
melt is located beneath the cooler crystal, resulting in greater
turbulence in the melt, and at a temperature gradient that is
significantly higher than the VGF technique. The turbulence and
high temperature cause LEC-grown crystals to have a higher
dislocation density than VGF-grown crystals, resulting in a
higher rate of breakage during the device manufacturing process.
As an open process, the LEC technique also results in greater
propensity for contamination and difficulty controlling the
ratio of gallium to

arsenic. It requires large, complex
electro-mechanical systems that are expensive and require highly
skilled personnel to operate. Strategy Analytics, a third-party
market research firm, estimated that approximately
60 percent of the GaAs substrates sold in 2002 by all
competitors to customers that manufacture electronic devices
were manufactured using VGF or similar techniques. They
projected that VGF s share would increase to approximately
70 percent by 2007.

Our VGF technique also offers advantages over the
Horizontal-Bridgeman, or HB, technique, for producing
semi-conducting GaAs substrates for opto-electronic
applications. The HB technique holds the GaAs melt in a
semi-cylindrical container, causing crystals grown using the HB
method to have a semi-circular, or D-shaped, cross-section.
Accordingly, more crystal material is discarded when the
D-shaped substrate is subsequently trimmed to a round shape. In
addition, crystals grown using the HB technique have a higher
defect density than VGF-grown crystals. The HB technique cannot
be used cost-effectively to produce substrates greater than
three inches in diameter. The HB technique houses the GaAs
melt in a quartz container during the growth process, which can
contaminate the GaAs melt with silicon impurities, making it
unsuitable for producing semi-insulating GaAs substrates.

The following table provides a comparison of
these three techniques: LEC remains about 40 of the
semi-insulating market and HB is still present in the
semi-conducting market.

Historically, we have sold a significant portion
of our products in any particular period to a limited number of
customers. No customer represented greater than 10 of product
revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001. The company s top five customers represented 28.9 of
product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003, 31.4 
of product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002,
and 31.1 of product revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2001. We expect that sales to certain
customers will continue to comprise a significant portion of our
revenue in the future.

Manufacturing, Raw Materials and
Supplies 

We believe that our results are partially due to
our manufacturing efficiency and high product yields and we
continually emphasize quality and process control throughout our
manufacturing operations. We perform our substrate manufacturing
operations at our facilities in Beijing, China and Fremont,
California. As part of our plan to reduce substrate
manufacturing costs, we shifted the vast majority of our
manufacturing processes to our facilities in China, where costs
are generally lower, by the end of 2003. We currently perform
research and development and limited manufacturing in our
Fremont, California facilities. We believe that our capital
investment and subsequent operating costs are lower for our
manufacturing facilities in China relative to the U.S. Many
of our manufacturing operations are fully automated and computer
monitored or controlled, enhancing reliability and yield. We use
proprietary equipment in our substrate manufacturing operations
to protect our intellectual property and control the timing and
pace of capacity additions. All of our manufacturing facilities
are ISO 9001 or 9002 certified.

Although we purchase supply parts, components and
raw materials from several domestic and international suppliers,
we depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for certain
critical materials used in the production of our substrates,
such as quartz tubing, polishing solutions, and paralytic boron
nitride. We generally purchase these materials through standard
purchase orders and not pursuant to long-term supply contracts.
Although we seek to maintain sufficient inventory levels of
certain materials to guard against interruptions in supply and
to meet our near term needs, and have to date been able to
obtain sufficient supplies of materials in a timely manner,
there may be shortages of certain key materials, such as
gallium. Accordingly, to help ensure continued supply of
materials, we formed joint ventures with and made investments in
some suppliers of key raw materials required to manufacture our
products, including gallium. We believe that these joint
ventures and investments will be advantageous in procuring
materials to support our growth. In addition, excess capacity is
marketed to others.

We advertise in trade publications, distribute
promotional materials, conduct marketing and sales programs, and
participate in industry trade shows and conferences in order to
raise market awareness of our products. We sell our substrate
products through our direct sales force in the U.S. and Japan
and through independent sales representatives in France, Japan,
South Korea, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Our direct sales
force consists of sales engineers who are knowledgeable in the
manufacture and use of compound and single-element substrates.
Our sales engineers work with customers during all stages of the
substrate manufacturing process, from developing the precise
composition of the substrate through manufacturing and
processing the substrate to the customer s exact
specifications. We believe that maintaining a close relationship
with customers and providing them with ongoing technical support
improves customer satisfaction and will provide us with a
competitive advantage in selling other substrates to our
customers. The substrate division launched a program in late
2000 with selected customers in which we guaranteed that certain
volumes of six-inch GaAs and other substrates would be delivered
on specific dates and the customer made a prepayment for part of
the value of its order. Several major customers participate in
this program. At December 31, 2003, the unearned
pre-payments we retained under this program equaled
 1.0 million. We do not expect to continue this program
after the pre-payments currently in hand are utilized by
customers.

International Sales. 
International sales are an important part of our business. In
the year ended December 31, 2003, sales to customers
outside of the United States accounted for 65.9 of our revenue,
as compared with 43.9 in 2002 and with 47.5 in 2001. The
primary markets for sales of our products outside of the United
States include countries in Asia and Western Europe. Our ability
to sustain and increase our international sales involves
significant risks, including volatile political, social and
economic instabilities abroad, possible fluctuations in currency
exchange rates, and changes in tariffs, import restrictions or
other trade barriers.

Research and Development 

To maintain and improve our competitive position,
we focus our research and development efforts on designing new
proprietary processes and products, improving the performance of
existing products and reducing manufacturing costs. We have
assembled a multi-disciplinary team of highly skilled
scientists, engineers and technicians to meet our research and
development objectives.

Our current substrate research and development
activities focus on continued development and enhancement of
GaAs, InP and Ge substrates, including improved yield, enhanced
surface characteristics and uniformity, greater substrate
strength and increased crystal length. During 2003 we
experienced surface quality problems with our GaAs substrates
for some customers.

Research and development expenses were
 1.3 million in 2003, compared with 2.3 million in
2002, and 3.9 million in 2001. We believe that our current
rate of expenditure can enable us to achieve our research and
development goals.

Competition 

The semiconductor substrate industry is
characterized by rapid technological change and price erosion,
as well as intense foreign and domestic competition. We believe
we currently have a leading position in the existing markets for
compound semiconductor substrates primarily as a result of our
expertise in VGF technology. However, we believe we face actual
and potential competition from a number of established domestic
and international companies who have advantages not available to
us.

We believe that the primary competitive factors
in the markets in which our substrate products compete are:

quality;

price;

performance;

7

Table of Contents 

meeting customer specifications; and

customer support and satisfaction.

Our ability to compete in target markets also
depends on factors such as:

the timing and success of the development and
 introduction of new products and product features by us and our
 competitors;

the availability of adequate sources of raw
 materials; and

protection of our products by effective use of
 intellectual property laws and general economic conditions.

Our primary competition in the market for
compound semiconductor substrates includes Freiberger, Japan
Energy and Sumitomo Electric. In addition, we also face
competition from compound semiconductor device manufacturers
that produce substrates for their own internal use, including
Hitachi, and from companies such as IBM that are actively
developing alternative compound semiconductor materials.

Protection of our Intellectual
Property 

Our success and the competitive position of our
VGF technique depend on our ability to maintain trade secrets
and other intellectual property protections. We rely on a
combination of patents, trademark and trade secret laws,
non-disclosure agreements and other intellectual property
protection methods to protect our proprietary technology. We
believe that, due to the rapid pace of technological innovation
in the markets for our products, our ability to establish and
maintain a position of technology leadership depends as much on
the skills of our development personnel as upon the legal
protections afforded our existing technologies. To protect our
trade secrets, we take certain measures to ensure their secrecy,
such as executing non-disclosure agreements with our employees,
customers and suppliers. However, reliance on trade secrets is
only an effective business practice insofar as trade secrets
remain undisclosed and a proprietary product or process is not
reverse engineered or independently developed.

To date, we have been issued
4 U.S. patents and have 4 U.S. patent
applications pending, which relate to our VGF products and
processes. We have 9 patent applications pending (in
PCT/national stage process) in Europe, Canada, China, Japan and
South Korea which are based on our U.S. patents that relate
to our VGF processes. We have 1 issued foreign patent.

Environmental Regulations 

We are subject to federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations. These laws, rules and
regulations govern the use, storage, discharge and disposal of
hazardous chemicals during manufacturing, research and
development and sales demonstrations. If we fail to comply with
applicable regulations, we could be subject to substantial
liability for clean-up efforts, personal injury and fines or
suspension or cessation of our operations. We cooperated with
the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or
Cal-OSHA, in an investigation primarily regarding impermissible
levels of potentially hazardous materials in certain areas of
our manufacturing facility in Fremont, California. In May 2000,
Cal-OSHA levied a fine against us in the amount of 313,655 for
alleged health and safety violations. In March 2001, we settled
this claim in the amount of 200,415, and have put in place
engineering, administrative and personnel protective equipment
programs to address these issues. On May 1, 2001, the
Santa Clara Center for Occupational Safety and Health
(SCCOSH) filed a complaint for injunctive relief and civil
penalties against us alleging violations of California Business
Professions Code 17200 et seq., and Health and Safety Code
section 25249 et seq. as a result of our use of arsenic and
inorganic arsenic compounds in our workplace. We reached a
settlement with SCCOSH during 2002.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2003, we had
972 employees, of whom 818 were principally engaged in
manufacturing, 141 in sales and administration, and 13 in
research and development. Of these employees, 119

Table of Contents 

are located in the U.S., 852 in China and 1
in Japan. As a result of shifting more of our substrate
manufacturing to China, we implemented headcount reductions in
our Fremont, California facilities, and expect further
reductions as our shift of manufacturing activities to China is
completed. Our employees are not represented by a union and we
have never experienced a work stoppage. Although morale has been
affected by our workforce reductions, we consider our relations
with our employees to be good.

On April 15, 2003, Sumitomo Electric
Industries, Ltd., (SEI) filed a complaint in the Tokyo
District Court, Civil Division against us and our Japanese
distributor alleging patent infringement of two patents held by
SEI in Japan. The suit seeks penalties from AXT in the amount of
 1.67 million plus interest and court costs and the
cessation of AXT s sales of gallium arsenide substrates in
Japan. AXT intends to defend itself vigorously in these lawsuits
and continues to sell its products in Japan.

On June 11, 2003, Cree, Inc. filed a
complaint in the United States Court for Northern District of
California against us alleging patent infringement. The
complaint sought damages and injunction against infringement. On
July 23, 2003, we filed a counter complaint in the United
States Court for Northern District of California, denying any
patent infringement and alleging that Cree s actions were
intentionally designed to interfere with our prospective
business relationships. We reached an agreement with Cree
resolving the disputes between us and signed a settlement
agreement on March 5, 2004. The resolution of the disputes
did not have a material adverse impact on the Company s
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations 

The following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with Selected Consolidated Financial
Data and our consolidated financial statements and related
notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition to
historical information, the discussion in this Form 10-K
contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and

forward looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of
the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, statements
regarding our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies
regarding the future. All forward-looking statements included in
this Report on Form 10-K are based on information available
to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update
any such forward-looking statements. These statements involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which
may cause our actual results to differ materially from those
implied by the forward-looking statements. In some cases, you
can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as
 may, will, should, 
 expects, plans, anticipates, 
 believes, estimates, 
 predicts, potential, or
 continues or the negative of these terms or other
comparable terminology. Factors that might cause or contribute
to such differences include, but are not limited to, those set
forth under Risks Related to Our Business and
elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Overview 

We were founded in 1986 to commercialize and
enhance our proprietary vertical gradient freeze
(VGF) technique for producing high-performance compound
semiconductor substrates. Upon the discontinuance of our
opto-electronics division, and the sale of substantially all of
the assets of this business in 2003, we now have one operating
segment: our substrate division. We made our first substrate
sales in 1990 and our substrate division currently sells gallium
arsenide (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP) substrates to
manufacturers of semiconductor devices for use in applications
such as fiber optic and wireless telecommunications, light
emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers. We also sell raw materials
including gallium and germanium through our participation in
majority- and minority-owned joint ventures. We have the
capability to manufacture germanium substrates for use in
satellite solar cells but withdrew from this business during
2000 so that we could more profitably use our then constrained
capacity. We are now trying to re-qualify our germanium
substrates with the few existing satellite solar cell system
manufacturers.

Our total revenue from continuing operations was
 34.7 million for 2003, 44.9 million for 2002 and
 108.8 million for 2001. In 2003 we incurred a loss from
operations of 9.6 million compared to a loss of
 39.7 million for 2002 and income of 20.2 million for
2001.

On June 24, 2003, we announced the
discontinuation of our opto-electronics division, which we
established as part of our acquisition of Lyte
Optronics, Inc. in May 1999. Accordingly, the results of
operations of the opto-electronics division have been segregated
from continuing operations and are reported separately as
discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of
operations for all periods presented (see Note 2 to our
consolidated financial statements for details regarding the
accounting for discontinued operations). The discontinued
opto-electronics division manufactured blue, cyan, and green
high-brightness light emitting diodes (HBLEDs) for the
illumination markets, including full-color displays, wireless
handset backlighting and traffic signals, and also manufactured
vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) and laser
diodes for fiber optic communications and storage area networks.

On September 27, 2003 we completed a sale of
substantially all of the assets of our opto-electronics business
to Lumei Optoelectronics, Corp. and Dalian Luming Science and
Technology Group, Co., Ltd. for the Chinese Renminbi (RMB)
equivalent of 9.6 million. Sale proceeds of
 1.0 million will be held in escrow for up to one year and
will not be recorded until all claims, if any, are settled. If
unclaimed, up to 250,000 of the sale proceeds will be held in
escrow for a second year and will not be recorded until all
claims, if any, are settled. We retain a building located in
Monterey Park, CA, that we expect to sell in 2004. This asset is
classified as Held for Sale on our consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2003.

Table of Contents 

Our continuing business, primarily sales of our
substrate products, is dependant on the semiconductor industry,
which is highly cyclical and has historically experienced
downturns both as a result of economic changes and of
overcapacity. We experienced a growth period that lasted from
our initiation of sales in 1990 through the first half of 2001.
In the second half of 2001, we experienced a 44.9 million,
or 58.5 decrease in revenue compared to the first half as a
result of the rapid decline in the mobile and fiber optic
telecommunications markets. Together with other industry
participants, we experienced lower revenues, slower bookings,
push outs and cancellation of orders. As such, we recorded
losses in the third and fourth quarters of 2001.

During the first half of 2002 our revenues grew
due to improvements in the wireless market. In the second half
of 2002 our revenue fell, however, because the substrate
industry was still facing excess capacity that caused prices to
decline, and because we experienced a loss of market share after
two competitors developed technologies similar to ours. In
addition, certain customers selected competitors products
in order to diversify their supply sources and due to the belief
that the competitors substrates offered better surface
qualities. Full year 2002 revenue declined 63.9 million,
or 58.8 compared to 2001. We recorded losses in each quarter of
2002 and incurred impairment charges against fixed assets and
inventory due to the decline in demand and prices. In reaction
to the economic downturn, we initiated an aggressive effort to
reduce substrate manufacturing costs. This included moving much
of our substrate manufacturing operations to China, reducing
capacity in our Fremont, CA facility and developing and
investing in key low-cost raw material sources.

In 2003, we believe that the wireless
communications and HBLED markets grew, but our revenue did not
increase until the fourth quarter of 2003 due to continued
reductions in prices and the time required to improve our
substrate surface quality and regain some lost customers.
Revenue for 2003 fell by 10.2 million, or 22.6 compared
with 2002. We recorded losses in each quarter of 2003. During
the year we continued to shift more of our manufacturing
operations to China and reduced our costs incurred in the United
States.

We cannot predict the level of future industry
demand or of our ability to regain lost market share, but they
have impacted our ability to sell our products and operate
profitably. If demand for our products remains depressed for an
extended period, our business will be harmed as a result. Our
business performance will be most influenced by market demand
for compound semi-conductor substrates, our ability to offer
products that equal or exceed the quality provided by
competitors, product pricing, our ability to shift more of our
manufacturing production to China, and our ability to create and
defend our intellectual property while not infringing on the
intellectual property of others.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates 

We have prepared our consolidated financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. As such, we have had
to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the
amounts reported on our financial statements. These estimates,
assumptions and judgments about future events and their effects
on our results cannot be determined with certainty, and are made
based upon our historical experience and on other assumptions
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
These estimates may change as new events occur or additional
information is obtained, and we may periodically be faced with
uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within our control
and may not be known for a prolonged period of time. The
discussion and analysis of our results of operations and
financial condition are based upon these consolidated financial
statements. We have identified the policies below as critical to
our business operations and understanding of our financial
condition and results of operations. A critical accounting
policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our
financial statements and requires us to make difficult,
subjective or complex judgments that could have a material
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
They may require us to make assumptions about matters that are
highly uncertain at the time of the estimate, and different
estimates that we could have used, or changes in the estimate
that are reasonably likely to occur, may have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations.

Table of Contents 

We believe that the following are our critical
accounting policies:

Revenue Recognition 

We recognize revenue upon shipment of products to
our customers provided that we have received a signed purchase
order, the price is fixed or determinable, title has
transferred, collection of resulting receivables is probable,
product returns are reasonably estimable, there are no customer
acceptance requirements and there are no remaining obligations.
We assess the probability of collection based on a number of
factors including past history with the customer and credit
worthiness. We provide for future returns based on historical
experience, current economic trends and changes in customer
demand at the time revenue is recognized. Except for sales in
Japan and some sales in Taiwan, which in both cases are
denominated in Japanese yen, we denominate and collect our
international sales in U.S. dollars. We do not provide for
warranty related exposure as such exposure has historically been
immaterial.

Allowance for Doubtful
 Accounts 

We periodically review the likelihood of
collecting our accounts receivable balances and provide an
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable primarily based upon
the age of these accounts. We provide a 100 allowance for
U.S. receivables in excess of 90 days and for foreign
receivables in excess of 120 days. At December 31,
2003 our accounts receivable balance was 6.3 million net
of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 4.3 million.

Inventory 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is determined using the standard cost method.
Finished goods and work-in-process inventories include material,
labor and manufacturing overhead costs. We routinely evaluate
the levels of our inventory in light of current market
conditions in order to identify excess and obsolete inventory
and we provide a valuation allowance for certain inventories
based upon the age and quality of the product. Competitive
delivery times are frequently less than the time required for us
to manufacture a product, requiring us to build some
work-in-process inventories in anticipation of orders. If orders
are not obtained for the product built, the products will
ultimately be deemed obsolete and we will establish a reserve
for their value. We also review our inventory to ensure costs
can be realized upon ultimate sale to our customers. If we
determine that the value of any items in ending inventory
exceeds the sales value less any related selling costs, a
reserve is established for the difference.

Impairment of Long-Lived
 Assets 

We evaluate the recoverability of property,
equipment, and intangible assets in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, or
SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. When events and
circumstances indicate that long-lived assets may be impaired,
we compare the carrying value of the long-lived assets to the
projection of future undiscounted cash flows attributable to
such assets and in the event that the carrying value exceeds the
future undiscounted cash flows, we record an impairment charge
against income equal to the excess of the carrying value over
the asset s fair value.

Investments 

We determine the appropriate classification of
investments at the time of purchase. Available-for-sale
investments are carried at their fair value based on quoted
market prices as of the balance sheet date. The amortized cost
of securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization is
included in other (income) and expense, net. 
Realized gains or losses are determined on the specific
identification method and are reflected in other (income)
and expense, net. Net unrealized gains or losses are
recorded directly in stockholders equity. Those unrealized
losses that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected
in interest and other income, net. We also maintain
minority investments in private companies which are accounted
for under the cost basis. These investments are reviewed for
other

15

Table of Contents 

than temporary declines in value on a quarterly
basis. Reasons for other than temporary declines in value
include whether the related company would have insufficient cash
flow to operate for the next twelve months, significant changes
in the operating performance and changes in market conditions.

Income Taxes 

We account for deferred income taxes using the
liability method, under which the expected future tax
consequences of timing differences between the book and tax
basis of assets and liabilities are recognized as deferred tax
assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are established
when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets when management
estimates, based on available objective evidence, that it is
more likely than not that the future income tax benefit
represented by the net deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Voluntary Stock Option Exchange
Program 

On May 27, 2003, we announced a voluntary
stock option exchange program for our employees. Under the
program, our option holders, excluding our executive officers
and independent directors, had the opportunity to cancel
outstanding options with an exercise price in excess of
 2.10 per share in exchange for new options to be granted
at a future date that was at least six months and one day after
the cancellation date. The number of shares of common stock
subject to the new options was equal to 75 of the number
subject to the exchanged options. Under the exchange program,
options to purchase an aggregate of 738,027 shares of our
common stock, representing approximately 48 of the options that
were eligible to be tendered in the Offer were tendered and
cancelled. New options will vest at the same rate as the
exchanged options and have an exercise price equal to the fair
market value of our common stock at the new grant date, which
was 3.11 per share. On December 31, 2003, we granted
options to purchase an aggregate of 522,754 shares of our
common stock in exchange for such tendered options.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to
Year Ended December 31, 2002 

Revenue from continuing
operations. Revenue from continuing
operations decreased 10.2 million, or 22.6 , to
 34.7 million in 2003 compared to 44.9 million in
2002. Total GaAs substrate revenue decreased 4.6 million,
or 13.9 , to 28.3 million in 2003 compared to
 32.9 million in 2002. Sales of 5 inch and 6 inch
diameter GaAs substrates, which are used exclusively to
manufacture electronic devices, decreased 3.4 million, or
38.9 , to 5.4 million in 2003 compared to
 8.8 million in 2002. InP substrate revenue decreased
 4.4 million, or 68.0 , to 2.1 million in 2003
compared to 6.5 million in 2002. InP substrates are used
almost exclusively for telecommunications applications. The
decrease in GaAs and InP substrate revenue is due to decreased
volume and lower average sales prices as a result of the
slowdown in our target markets including telecommunications,
high speed electronic devices, and short wavelength lasers, and
the introduction of VGF-like substrates from our competitors
that caused some customers to purchase substrates from our
competitors rather than from us.

International revenue increased to 65.9 of total
revenue from continuing operations in 2003 compared to 43.9 in
2002. The increase was primarily due to a greater share of our
GaAs substrates being used in opto-electronics applications and
the majority of our customers for these applications being in
Asia.

Gross margin. Gross
margin increased to 6.4 of revenue in 2003 compared to negative
19.8 in 2002. The increase was primarily due to reduced costs
associated with moving most of our production to China. In
addition, we incurred a charge of 9.7 million in 2002
related to the write-down of certain inventory that we concluded
was obsolete.

17

Table of Contents 

Selling, general and administrative
expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses decreased 3.4 million, or 24.4 ,
to 10.5 million in 2003 compared to 13.9 million in
2002. As a percentage of total revenue, selling, general and
administrative expenses were 30.2 in 2003 compared to 30.9 in
2002. The decrease in selling, general and administrative
expenses is the result of our efforts to adjust costs in line
with our current business and of our ability to shift some of
these activities to China where our costs are lower.

Research and development
expenses. Research and development
expenses decreased 1.0 million or 42.8 , to
 1.3 million in 2003 compared to 2.3 million in 2002.
As a percentage of total revenue, research and development
expenses were 3.9 in 2003 compared to 5.2 in 2002. Although we
reduced research and development expenses in 2003 as part of our
effort to reduce costs, we believe that continued investment in
product development is critical to attaining our strategic
objectives of maintaining and increasing our technology
leadership, and as a result, we expect research and development
expenses to remain at current levels in future periods. Research
and development efforts during 2003 were focused primarily on
improving the yield and surface quality of our GaAs substrates.

Interest expense. 
Interest expense increased 29,000, or 6.6 , to 466,000 in 2003
compared to 437,000 in 2002. By the end of 2003, we had repaid
 10.1 million in equipment lease and loan debt which will
reduce future interest payments.

Other income and expense,
net. Other expense was
 1.1 million in 2003 compared to 12.7 million in
2002. The amount in 2003 includes charges of 2.1 million
related to the write-down of investments we hold in two
privately held U.S. companies. The amount in 2002 includes
non-cash charges of 10.8 million related to the write-down
to market value of our investment in Finisar Corporation common
stock and 3.1 million to write-down a building held for
sale to net realizable value.

Provision for income
taxes. Due to our continuing operating
losses and uncertainty regarding future profitability, we
recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax
assets of 31.2 million in 2002. During 2003, we continued
to record a full valuation allowance against our net deferred
tax assets and as a result, our effective tax rate decreased to
0.0 for 2003.

Loss from discontinued
operations. Loss from our discontinued
opto-electronics division for the year ended December 31,
2003 was 15.6 million, which included a loss on disposal
of 9.5 million and the operating loss from our
discontinued opto-electronics division of 6.1 million.

Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to
Year Ended December 31, 2001 

Revenue from continuing
operations. Revenue from continuing
operations decreased 63.9 million, or 58.8 , to
 44.9 million in 2002 compared to 108.8 million in
2001. Total GaAs substrate revenue decreased 42.5 million,
or 56.4 , to 32.9 million in 2002 compared to
 75.4 million in 2001. Sales of 5 and 6 
diameter GaAs substrates decreased 12.8 million, or 59.2 ,
to 8.8 million in 2002 compared to 21.6 million in
2001. InP substrate revenue decreased 21.7 million, or
77.0 , to 6.5 million in 2002 compared to
 28.2 million in 2001. The decrease in GaAs and InP
substrate revenue was due to decreased volume and sales prices
as a result of the slowdown in our markets including
telecommunications, high speed electronic devices, and short
wavelength lasers.

International revenue decreased to 43.9 of total
revenue in 2002 compared to 47.5 of total revenue in 2001.

Gross margin. Gross
margin decreased to negative 19.8 of revenue in 2002 compared
to positive 38.0 in 2001. The decrease was primarily due to
lower unit sales and average sales prices of GaAs and InP
substrates spread over a relatively fixed manufacturing overhead
base and a 9.7 million charge to write-down excess
inventory. As a result, we initiated manufacturing cost
reductions in order to align our costs with lower expected sales
volumes and prices. We shifted much of our substrate
manufacturing to China and reduced capacity in our Fremont,
California facility.

Selling, general and administrative
expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses decreased 3.3 million, or 19.5 ,
to 13.8 million in 2002 compared to 17.2 million in
2001. As a percentage of total

18

Table of Contents 

revenue, selling, general and administrative
expenses were 30.9 in 2002 compared to 15.8 in 2001. In order
to align our cost structure with the rapid decline in revenues,
we initiated and aggressively pursued cost reductions in this
area, which led to the decrease in 2002.

Research and development
expenses. Research and development
expenses decreased 1.5 million or 39.7 , to
 2.3 million in 2002 compared to 3.9 million in 2001.
As a percentage of total revenue, research and development
expenses were 5.2 in 2002 compared to 3.6 in 2001. Research
and development efforts during 2002 were focused primarily on
improving the yield and surface quality of our GaAs substrates.

Interest expense. 
Interest expense decreased 394,000, or 47.4 , to 437,000 in
2002 compared to 831,000 in 2001. The decrease was primarily
due to the repayment of certain long-term real estate notes and
capital equipment leases.

Other income and
expense. Other expense was
 12.7 million in 2002 compared to 13.4 million in
2001. The amount in 2002 includes non-cash charges of
 10.8 million related to the write-down to market value of
our investment in Finisar Corporation common stock and
 3.1 million to write-down a building held for sale to net
realizable value. The 2001 balance includes a non-cash charge of
 15.6 million to write-down to market value our investment
in Finisar common stock.

Provision for income
taxes. Due to our continuing operating
losses during 2002 and uncertainty regarding future
profitability, we recorded a full valuation allowance against
our net deferred tax assets of 31.2 million in 2002. As a
result, our effective tax rate decreased to 7.2 in 2002. Our
effective tax rate in 2001 was 36 .

Loss from discontinued
operations. Loss from our discontinued
opto-electronics division for the year ended December 31,
2002 was 26.2 million net of income tax benefit of
 8.4 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We consider cash and cash equivalents, and
short-term investments as liquid and available for use.
Short-term investments are comprised of government bonds and
high-grade commercial debt instruments. Also included in
short-term investments is our common stock investment in Finisar
Corporation.

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments
and long-term investments, excluding 3.7 million and
 1.1 million for our investment in Finisar common stock at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 respectively, increased
 8.9 million to 44.6 million at December 31,
2003 compared to 35.7 million at December 31, 2002.

Cash and cash equivalents increased
 10.5 million to 24.3 million at December 31,
2003 compared to 13.8 million at December 31, 2002.

Net cash provided by operating activities of
 6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 was
comprised primarily of our net loss adjusted for non-cash items
of 18.0 million, consisting primarily of the loss on
disposal of our opto-electronics division of 9.5 million,
depreciation of 5.8 million, and by a 15.0 million
net change in assets and liabilities. The net change in assets
and liabilities resulted primarily from a decrease in inventory,
prepaid expenses and income tax receivable, offset by decreases
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

Accounts receivable decreased 898,000, or 12.5 ,
to 6.3 million at December 31, 2003 compared to
 7.2 million at December 31, 2002. The change reflects
lower sales volume, collections of 32.5 million and a
decrease in our allowance for doubtful accounts of
 2.4 million due to the collection of previously
written-down receivables. It also included a 666,000 write-down
of accounts receivable from our discontinued opto-electronics
division, which is included in loss on disposal in
our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2003.

Inventories decreased 13.5 million, or
35.9 to 24.1 million at December 31, 2003 compared
to 37.6 million at December 31, 2002. The decrease in
inventory included a 2 million write-down of inventory
from our discontinued opto-electronics division, which is
included in loss on disposal in our consolidated

Table of Contents 

statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The Company adopted a strategy of using
inventory to conserve cash. During 2004 we do not expect to
maintain the same rate of net inventory decrease as we
experienced in 2003.

Net cash provided by investing activities of
 13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003
includes proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, and
high grade investment securities totaling 27.7 million,
offset by purchases of property and equipment of
 2.2 million primarily used to transfer production capacity
to China for the substrate division, and purchases of high grade
investment securities with maturities of less than two years
totaling 5.9 million. It also includes an increase in
restricted cash of 5.8 million to collateralize a letter
of credit with a bank that supports our long-term debt and
workers compensation insurance policy.

We do not have any plans to initiate any major
new capital spending projects through 2004. We are currently
completing certain projects at our China facilities and are
continuously constructing minor improvements to our existing
production facilities in China and California. We expect to
invest approximately 5.0 million in capital projects in
2004. We believe that our existing and planned facilities and
equipment are sufficient to fulfill current and expected future
orders.

Net cash used in financing activities of
 9.6 million consisted of proceeds of 480,000 from the
exercise of options by our employees, offset by payments of
 10.1 million to reduce long-term borrowings and capital
leases.

Our main Fremont, California manufacturing
facility is financed by long-term borrowings, which were
refinanced by taxable variable rate revenue bonds in 1998. These
bonds mature in 2023 and bear interest at a variable rate that
was 1.35 at December 31, 2003. The bonds are traded in the
public market. Repayment of principal and interest under the
bonds is supported by a letter of credit from our bank and is
paid on a quarterly basis. We have the option to redeem the
bonds in whole or in part during their term. At
December 31, 2003, 8.5 million was outstanding under
these bonds.

At December 31, 2003 the credit facility
maintained by us with a bank included a letter of credit
supporting repayment of our industrial bonds with an outstanding
amount of 8.5 million. The Company has pledged and placed
cash and certain investment securities with an affiliate of the
bank as additional collateral for this facility. We have also
pledged cash for a credit facility for our workers compensation
insurance. As a result, 9.3 million of our cash and
long-term investments are restricted.

We currently hold a note payable secured by
certain equipment in China totaling 3.3 million at
December 31, 2003 (see Note 4 to our consolidated
financial statements). The balance on this note will be due in
December 2004.

We believe that we have adequate cash and
investments to meet the Company s short- and long-term
needs. If our sales decrease, however, our ability to generate
cash from operations will be adversely affected which could
adversely affect our future liquidity, require us to use more
cash at a more rapid rate than expected, and require us to seek
additional capital. There can be no assurance that such
additional capital will be available or, if available it will be
at terms acceptable to the Company. Cash from operations could
be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but
not limited to those set forth below under Risks Related
to Our Business.

We lease certain office space, manufacturing
facilities and property under long-term operating leases
expiring at various dates through March 2013. Total rent expense

Risks Related to Our Business 

The semiconductor industry is cyclical and
 has experienced a downturn which has adversely impacted our
 operating results. 

Our continuing business depends in significant
part upon manufacturers of electronic and opto-electronic
semiconductor devices, as well as the current and anticipated
market demand for such devices and products using such devices.
As a supplier to the semiconductor industry, we are subject to
the business cycles that characterize the industry. The timing,
length and volatility of these cycles are difficult to predict.
The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical
because of sudden changes in demand for semiconductors and
capacity requirements, including capacity utilizing the latest
technology. The rate of changes in demand, including end demand,
is high, and the effect of these changes upon us occurs quickly,
exacerbating the volatility of these cycles. These changes have
affected the timing and amounts of customers capital
equipment purchases and investments in new technology. These
industry cycles create pressure on our net sales, gross margin
and net income.

The industry has previously experienced periods
of oversupply that result in significantly reduced demand for
semiconductor devices and components, including our products,
both as a result of general economic changes and overcapacity.
When these periods occur, our operating results and financial
condition are adversely affected, and create pressure on our
revenue, gross margins and net income. Inventory buildups in
telecommunications products and slower than expected sales of
computer equipment resulted in overcapacity and led to reduced
sales by our customers, and therefore reduced purchases of our
products. During periods of weak demand such as those
experienced over the past years, customers typically reduce
purchases, delay delivery of products and/or cancel orders of
component parts such as our products. Increased price
competition has resulted, causing pressure on our net sales,
gross margin and net income. We experienced cancellations, price
reductions, delays and push outs of orders, which have resulted
in reduced revenues. If the economic downturn were to continue,
or occur again in the future, further order cancellations,
reductions in order size or delays in orders will materially
adversely affect our business and results of operations. Actions
to reduce our costs, such as those we have recently taken, may
be insufficient to align our structure with prevailing business
conditions. We may be required to undertake additional
cost-cutting measures, and may be unable to invest in marketing,
research and development and engineering at the levels we
believe are necessary to maintain our competitive position. Our
failure to make these investments could seriously harm our
business.

During periods of increasing demand for
semiconductor devices, we must have sufficient manufacturing
capacity and inventory to meet customer demand, and must be able
to attract, hire, train and retain qualified employees to meet
demand. It appears that the semiconductor industry is in the
early stages of an upturn and increasing demand. However, we
cannot predict the sustainability of a recovery, if any, and the
industry s rate of growth in this recovery, if it occurs.
If we are unable to effectively manage our resources and
production

21

capacity during an industry upturn, there could
be a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

If the economy recovers and we are again in
 a period of high demand for our products, we may be unable to
 expand our manufacturing capacity quickly enough to meet
 increased demand, we may make decisions to expand capacity that
 are not profitable, and we may be unable to lower our costs or
 increase revenue. 

It appears that the industry may be in an upturn,
which may cause demand to increase rapidly as it has in prior
years after other cyclical downturns in the economy and the
industries in which we operate. If this happens, in order to
meet increased demand and maintain our market share, we may need
to increase production, which could require us to build new
facilities, expand and modify our existing facilities, purchase
additional manufacturing equipment, and add qualified staff. If
we are not at that time able to expand our manufacturing
capacity, we will be unable to increase production, which may
adversely impact our ability to meet increased production demand
while reducing unit costs, margins and improving our operating
results.

We are currently constructing and modifying
facilities in California and China. Our construction activities
subject us to a number of risks, including:

unforeseen environmental or engineering problems;

unavailability or late delivery of production
 equipment;

delays in completing new facilities;

delays in bringing production equipment on-line;

work stoppages or delays;

inability to recruit and train qualified
 staff; and

unanticipated cost increases and restrictions
 imposed by requirements of local, state or federal regulatory
 agencies in the United States and China.

If any of these risks occurs, construction may be
costlier than anticipated and completion could be delayed, which
could hurt our ability to expand capacity and increase our
sales. In addition, if we experience delays in expanding our
manufacturing capacity, we may not be able to timely meet
customer requirements, and we could lose future sales. We are
also completing selective investments in equipment and
facilities as part of our previously planned capacity expansion.
To offset the additional fixed operating expenses, we must
increase our revenue by increasing production and improving
yields. If demand for our products does not grow, if prices
decline significantly, or if our yields do not improve as
anticipated, we may be unable to offset these costs against
increased revenue, which would adversely impact our operating
results.

Unpredictable fluctuations in our operating
 results could disappoint analysts or our investors, which could
 cause our stock price to decline. 

We have not over the past year been able to
sustain growth, and may not be able to return to historic growth
levels in the current economic environment. Our net loss in 2002
was the largest in our history and our losses continued during
2003. We believe we will endure losses for at least part of
2004. We have and may continue to experience significant
fluctuations in our revenue and earnings. Our quarterly and
annual revenue and operating results have varied significantly
in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a
number of factors, including:

decline in general economic conditions or
 downturns in the industry in which we compete;

fluctuations in demand for our products;

expansion of our manufacturing capacity;

expansion of our operations in China;

22

Table of Contents 

limited availability and increased cost of raw
 materials;

the volume and timing of orders from our
 customers, and cancellations, push outs and delays of customer
 orders;

fluctuation of our manufacturing yields;

decreases in the prices of our competitors 
 products;

costs incurred in connection with any future
 acquisitions of businesses or technologies;

increases in our expenses, including expenses for
 research and development; and

our ability to develop, manufacture and deliver
 high quality products in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Due to these factors, we believe that
period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be
meaningful indicators of our future performance. Our operating
results have over the past year at times been below the
expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs
again in future periods, the price of our common stock could
decline or fluctuate.

A substantial percentage of our operating
expenses are fixed in the short term and we may be unable to
adjust spending to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in
revenues. As a result, any delay in generating revenue could
cause our operating results to be below the expectations of
market analysts or investors, which could also cause our stock
price to fall.

Our results of operations may suffer if we
 do not effectively manage our inventory. 

We must manage our inventory of component parts,
work-in-process, and finished goods effectively to meet changing
customer requirements, while keeping inventory costs down and
improving gross margins. Some of our products and supplies have
in the past and may in the future become obsolete while in
inventory due to changing customer specifications, or become
excess inventory due to decreased demand for our products and an
inability to sell the inventory within a foreseeable period.
Furthermore, if current costs of production increase or sales
prices drop below the standard prices at which we value
inventory, we may need to take a charge for a reduction in
inventory values. We have in the past had to take inventory
valuation and impairment charges. If we are not successfully
able to manage our inventory, we may need to write off
unsaleable, obsolete or excess inventory, which could adversely
affect our results of operations. On October 1, 2003, we
implemented a new inventory control system that may experience
unexpected difficulties.

The disposal of our opto-electronics
 business may fail to result in the benefits we
 anticipate. 

We may not obtain the benefits we expect as a
result of discontinuation of our opto-electronics business, such
as greater strategic focus on our core businesses. We may be
required to return to the buyer some or all of the
 1 million of the sale proceeds which will be held in
escrow should the buyer successfully claim that we breached one
of the representations or warranties made to it. Our building in
Monterey Park may not be sold for the 1 million at which
we are carrying it on our balance sheet. We may incur additional
costs associated with the discontinued operations which could
materially reduce our short term earnings.

Much of our cash resources are denominated
 in Chinese currency and are subject to exchange control
 restrictions. 

Much of our cash resources are denominated in
Chinese Renminbi and held in accounts in China and, under some
circumstances, may not be easily exchanged for US dollars. The
value of our Chinese cash holdings are also subject to changes
in the exchange rate between Chinese Renminbi and US dollars. If
our US dollar commitments were to exceed the cash we have
available in the United States, we may be unable to access cash
held in China to satisfy these commitments.

A reoccurrence of Severe Acute Respiratory
 Syndrome (SARS) or the outbreak of a different contagious
 disease may adversely impact our manufacturing operations and
 some of our key suppliers and customers. 

The majority of our substrate manufacturing
activities are conducted in China. In addition, we source key
raw materials, including gallium, from our joint ventures and
other suppliers in China. The 2003 SARS outbreak was most
notable in China and a small number of cases have been reported
to date in 2004. One employee at our LED production facility in
China contracted SARS in late April 2003 prompting us to close
the facility for ten days. There was no significant impact to
our ability to fill customer orders. If there were to be another
outbreak of SARS or a different contagious disease and if our
employees contracted the disease, we may be required to
temporarily close our manufacturing operations. Similarly, if
one of our key suppliers is required to close for an extended
period, we may not have enough raw material inventory to
continue manufacturing operations. In addition, while we possess
management skills among our China staff that enable us to
maintain our manufacturing operations with minimal on-site
supervision from our US-based staff, our business could also be
harmed if travel to or from Asia and the United States is
restricted or inadvisable, as it was during parts of 2003. None
of our substrate competitors is as dependent on manufacturing
facilities in China as we are. If our manufacturing operations
were closed for a significant period, we could lose revenue and
market share during that period which would depress our
financial performance and could be difficult to recapture.
Finally, if one of our key customers is required to close for an
extended period, we may not be able to ship product to them, our
revenue would decline and our financial performance would suffer.

The impact of changes in global economic
 conditions on our customers may cause us to fail to meet
 expectations, which would negatively impact the price of our
 stock. 

Our operating results can vary significantly
based upon the impact of changes in global economic conditions
on our customers. More specifically, the macro-economic
environment that we faced in 2003 was more uncertain than in
some prior periods, lasted longer than expected and has
materially and adversely affected us and our operating results
and may continue to do so. The revenue growth and profitability
of our business depends on the overall demand for our
substrates, and we are particularly dependant on the market
conditions for the wireless, solid-state illumination, fiber
optics and telecommunications industries. Because our sales are
primarily to major corporate customers whose businesses
fluctuate with general economic and business conditions, a
softening of demand for products that use our substrates, caused
by a weakening economy may result in further or prolonged
decreased revenues. Customers may find themselves facing excess
inventory from earlier purchases, and may defer or reconsider
purchasing products due to the downturn in their business and in
the general economy.

If we do not successfully develop new
 products to respond to rapidly changing customer requirements,
 our ability to generate sales and obtain new customers may
 suffer. 

Our success depends on our ability to offer new
products and product features that incorporate leading
technology and respond to technological advances. In addition,
our new products must meet customer needs and compete
effectively on quality, price and performance. The life cycles
of our products are difficult to predict because the markets for
our products are characterized by rapid technological change,
changing customer needs and evolving industry standards. If our
competitors introduce products employing new technologies or
performance characteristics, our existing products could become
obsolete and unmarketable. During the past year, we have seen
our competitors selling more substrates manufactured using a
crystal growth technology similar to ours, which has eroded our
technological differentiation. If we fail to offer new products,
we may not generate sufficient revenue to offset our development
costs and other expenses or meet our customers 
requirements. Other companies, including Triquent, are actively
developing substrate materials that could be used to manufacture
devices that could provide the same high-performance, low-power
capabilities as GaAs- and InP-based devices at competitive
prices. If these substrate materials or VGF derived products are
successfully developed and semiconductor device manufacturers
adopt them, demand for our GaAs substrates could decline and our
revenue could suffer.

24

Table of Contents 

The development of new products can be a highly
complex process, and we may experience delays in developing and
introducing new products. Any significant delays could cause us
to fail to timely introduce and gain market acceptance of new
products. Further, the costs involved in researching, developing
and engineering new products could be greater than anticipated.

Our operating results depend in large part
 on further customer acceptance of our existing substrate
 products manufactured in China. 

To shift more of our substrate manufacturing
operations to China successfully, we will need our customers to
qualify products manufactured in China. If we are unable to
achieve qualifications for these products, our China facility
will be underutilized, our investments in China will not be
recouped and we will be unable to lower our costs by moving to
China. We may lose sales of our products to competitors who are
not manufacturing in China, or whose operations in China have
already been qualified by customers. All of these events could
reduce our revenue but increase our cost structure.

Furthermore, some customers have reduced their
orders from us until our surface quality is as good and
consistent as that offered by competitors. As a result, some
customers are now allocating their requirements for VGF grown
substrates across more competitors and we believe that we have
lost revenue and market share as a result of these customer
decisions, which we may be unable to recover. If we are unable
to retain our market share, our revenue and performance will
decline.

Intense competition in the markets for our
 products could prevent us from increasing revenue and sustaining
 profitability. 

The markets for our products are intensely
competitive. We face competition for our substrate products from
other manufacturers of substrates, such as Freiberger, Hitachi
Cable, Japan Energy and Sumitomo Electric and from semiconductor
device manufacturers that produce substrates for their own use,
and from companies, such as Triquent, that are actively
developing alternative materials to GaAs and some semiconductor
devices are being marketed using these materials. We believe
that at least two of our competitors are shipping high volumes
of GaAs substrates manufactured using a technique similar to our
VGF technique. Other competitors may develop and begin using
similar technology. If we are unable to compete effectively, our
revenue may not increase and we may be unable to be profitable.
We face many competitors that have a number of significant
advantages over us, including:

greater experience in the business;

more manufacturing experience;

extensive intellectual property;

broader name recognition; and

significantly greater financial, technical and
 marketing resources.

Our competitors could develop new or enhanced
products that are more effective than our products are.

The level and intensity of competition has
increased over the past year and we expect competition to
continue to increase in the future. Competitive pressures caused
by the current economic conditions have resulted in reductions
in the prices of our products, and continued or increased
competition could reduce our market share, require us to further
reduce the prices of our products, affect our ability to recover
costs or result in reduced gross margins.

Defects in our products could diminish
 demand for our products. 

Our products are complex and may contain defects.
We have experienced quality control problems with some of our
products over the past two years, which caused customers to
return products to us, reduce orders for our products, or both.
If we continue to experience quality control problems, or
experience these or other problems in new products, customers
may cancel or reduce orders or purchase products from our
competitors

25

Table of Contents 

and sales of our products could decline. Defects
in our products could cause us to incur higher manufacturing
costs and suffer product returns and additional service
expenses, all of which could adversely impact our operating
results.

If new products developed by us contain defects
when released, our customers may be dissatisfied and we may
suffer negative publicity or customer claims against us, lose
sales or experience delays in market acceptance of our new
products.

If we have low product yields, the shipment
 of our products may be delayed and our operating results may be
 adversely impacted. 

Our products are manufactured using complex
technologies, and the number of usable substrates we can produce
can fluctuate as a result of many factors, including:

impurities in the materials used;

contamination of the manufacturing environment;

substrate breakage;

equipment failure, power outages or variations in
 the manufacturing process; and

performance of personnel involved in the
 manufacturing process.

If our yields decrease, our revenue could decline
because many of our manufacturing costs are fixed, or would
increase. We have experienced product shipment delays and
difficulties in achieving acceptable yields on both new and
older products, and delays and poor yields have adversely
affected our operating results. We may experience similar
problems in the future and we cannot predict when they may occur
or their severity. In particular, many of our manufacturing
processes are new and are still being refined, which can result
in lower yields.

We derive a significant portion of our
 revenue from international sales, and our ability to sustain and
 increase our international sales involves significant
 risks. 

Our revenue growth depends in part on the
expansion of our international sales and operations.
International sales represented 65.9 of our total revenue for
the year ended December 31, 2003 and 43.9 for the year
ended December 31, 2002. We expect that sales to customers
outside the U.S. will continue to represent a significant
portion of our revenue, particularly sales to customers in Asia.

Currently, an increasing percentage of our sales
are to customers headquartered in Asia. Certain manufacturing
facilities and suppliers are also located outside the
U.S. Managing our global operations presents challenges,
including periodic regional economic downturns, trade balance
issues, varying business conditions and demands, political
instability, variations in enforcement of intellectual property
and contract rights in different jurisdictions, differences in
the ability to develop relationships with suppliers and other
local businesses, changes in U.S. and international laws and
regulations including U.S. export restrictions,
fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, the
ability to provide sufficient levels of technical support in
different locations, cultural differences, shipping delays and
terrorist acts or acts of war, among other risks. Many of these
challenges are present in China, which represents a large
potential market for semiconductor equipment and where AXT
anticipates significant opportunity for growth. Global
uncertainties with respect to: (i) economic growth rates in
various countries; (ii) sustainability of demand for
electronics products; (iii) capital spending by
semiconductor manufacturers; (iv) price weakness for
certain semiconductor devices; and (v) political
instability in regions where we have operations may also affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our dependence on international sales involves a
number of risks, including:

changes in tariffs, import or export restrictions
 and other trade barriers;

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

26

Table of Contents 

longer periods to collect accounts receivable;

changes in export license requirements;

political and economic instability;

unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade
 relationships; and

foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

Our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars,
except for sales to our Japanese and some Taiwanese customers,
which are denominated in Japanese yen. Thus, increases in the
value of the U.S. dollar could increase the price of our
products in non-U.S. markets and make our products more
expensive than competitors products in these markets.
Also, denominating some sales in Japanese yen subjects us to
fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar
and the Japanese yen. The functional currencies of our Japanese
and Chinese subsidiaries are the local currencies. We incur
transaction gains or losses resulting from consolidation of
expenses incurred in local currencies for these subsidiaries, as
well as in translation of the assets and liabilities of these
assets at each balance sheet date. If we do not effectively
manage the risks associated with international sales, our
revenue, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely
affected.

Demand for our products may decrease if our
 customers experience difficulty manufacturing, marketing or
 selling their products. 

Our products are used as components in our
customers products. Accordingly, demand for our products
is subject to factors affecting the ability of our customers to
successfully introduce and market their products, including:

the competition our customers face in their
 particular industries;

the technical, manufacturing, sales and marketing
 and management capabilities of our customers;

the financial and other resources of our
 customers; and

the inability of our customers to sell their
 products if they infringe third party intellectual property
 rights.

If demand for the end user applications for which
our products are used decreases, or our customers are unable to
develop, market and sell their products, demand for our products
will decrease.

The financial condition of our customers
 may affect their ability to pay amounts owed to
 us. 

Many of our customers are facing business
downturns that have reduced their cash balances and their
prospects. We frequently allow our customers to pay for products
we ship to them within 30 to 90 days after delivery.
Subsequent to our shipping a product, some customers have been
unable to make payments as due, reducing our cash balances and
causing us to incur charges to allow for a possibility that some
accounts might not be paid. At least three customers that owed
us a significant amount have filed for bankruptcy protection and
we are unlikely to receive a substantial portion or any of the
amounts owed to us as part of a bankruptcy settlement. Other
customers may also be forced to file for bankruptcy. If our
customers do not pay their accounts when due, we will be
required to incur charges that would reduce our earnings.

We purchase critical raw materials and
 parts for our equipment from single or limited sources, and
 could lose sales if these sources fail to fill our
 needs. 

We depend on a limited number of suppliers for
certain raw materials, components and equipment used in
manufacturing our products, including key materials such as
quartz tubing, polishing solutions, and paralytic boron nitride.
We generally purchase these materials through standard purchase
orders and not pursuant to long-term supply contracts and no
supplier guarantees supply of raw materials or equipment to us.
If we lose any of our key suppliers, our manufacturing efforts
could be significantly hampered and we could be prevented from
timely producing and delivering products to our customers. We
have experienced delays

27

Table of Contents 

obtaining critical raw materials and spare parts,
including gallium, due to shortages of these materials. We may
experience delays due to shortages of materials and may be
unable to obtain an adequate supply of materials. These
shortages and delays could result in higher materials costs and
cause us to delay or reduce production of our products. If we
have to delay or reduce production, we could fail to meet
customer delivery schedules and our revenue and operating
results could suffer.

If we fail to comply with environmental and
safety regulations, we may be subject to significant fines or
cessation of our operations; in addition, we could be subject to
suits for personal injuries caused by exposure to hazardous
materials. 

We are subject to federal, state and local
environmental and safety laws and regulations in all of our
operating locations. These laws, rules and regulations govern
the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals
during manufacturing, research and development, and sales
demonstrations. If we fail to comply with applicable
regulations, we could be subject to substantial liability for
clean-up efforts, personal injury and fines or suspension or
cessation of our operations. In March 2001, we settled a claim
made by the California Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, or Cal-OSHA, in an investigation primarily
regarding impermissible levels of potentially hazardous
materials in certain areas of our manufacturing facility in
Fremont, California for 200,415. Although we have put in place
engineering, administrative and personnel protective equipment
programs to address these issues, our ability to expand or
continue to operate our present locations could be restricted or
we could be required to acquire costly remediation equipment or
incur other significant expenses. Existing or future changes in
laws or regulations may require us to incur significant
expenditures or liabilities, or may restrict our operations. In
addition, our employees could be exposed to chemicals or other
hazardous materials at our facilities and we may be subject to
lawsuits seeking damages for wrongful death or personal injuries
allegedly caused by exposure to chemicals or hazardous materials
at our facilities.

If litigation is brought against us, litigation
is inherently uncertain and while we would expect to defend
ourself vigorously, it is possible that our business, financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows, could be
affected in any particular period by such litigation if brought
against us.

The loss of one or more of our key
 substrate customers would significantly hurt our operating
 results. 

A small number of substrate customers have
historically accounted for a substantial portion of our total
revenue. Five customers accounted for 28.9 of our total revenue
for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 31.4 for the year
ended December 31, 2002. One customer accounted for 6.8 of
our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003. We expect
that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue
to be derived from a limited number of substrate customers. Our
customers are not obligated to purchase a specified quantity of
our products or to provide us with binding forecasts of product
purchases. In addition, our customers may reduce, delay or
cancel orders at any time without any significant penalty, and
during the past year, we have experienced slower bookings,
significant push outs and cancellation of orders. In addition,
due to the difficult economic environment, several of our
previously large customers have stopped operations entirely. If
we lose a major customer or if a customer cancels, reduces or
delays orders, our revenue would decline. In addition, customers
that have accounted for significant revenue in the past may not
continue to generate revenue for us in any future period. Any
delay in scheduled shipments of our products could cause net
sales to fall below our expectations and the expectations of
market analysts or investors, causing our stock price to decline.

Our substrate products have a long
 qualification cycle that makes it difficult to plan our expenses
 and forecast our results. 

Customers typically place orders with us for our
substrate products three months to a year or more after our
initial contact with them. The sale of our products may be
subject to delays due to our customers lengthy internal
budgeting, approval and evaluation processes. During this time,
we may incur substantial expenses and expend sales, marketing
and management efforts while the customers evaluate our
products. These expenditures may not result in sales of our
products. If we do not achieve anticipated sales in a period as

28

Table of Contents 

expected, we may experience an unplanned
shortfall in our revenue. As a result, we may not be able to
cover expenses, causing our operating results to vary. In
addition, if a customer decides not to incorporate our products
into its initial design, we may not have another opportunity to
sell products to this customer for many months or even years. In
the current competitive and economic climate, the average sales
cycle for our products has lengthened even further and is
expected to continue to make it difficult to accurately forecast
our future sales. We anticipate that sales of any future
substrate products will also have lengthy sales cycles and will,
therefore, be subject to risks substantially similar to those
inherent in the lengthy sales cycle of our current substrate
products.

If we are unable to protect our
 intellectual property, we may lose valuable assets or incur
 costly litigation. 

We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights,
trademark and trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements and
other intellectual property protection methods to protect our
proprietary technology. However, we believe that, due to the
rapid pace of technological innovation in the markets for our
products, our ability to establish and maintain a position of
technology leadership also depends on the skills of our
development personnel.

Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual
property, a third party could develop products or processes
similar to ours. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights
may not be adequate and our competitors may independently
develop similar technology, duplicate our products or design
around our patents. We believe that at least two of our
competitors have begun to ship GaAs substrates produced using a
process similar to our VGF technique. Our competitors may also
develop and patent improvements to the VGF technology upon which
we rely, and thus may limit any exclusivity we enjoy by virtue
of our patents or trade secrets.

It is possible that pending or future United
States or foreign patent applications made by us will not be
approved, that our issued patents will not protect our
intellectual property, or that third parties will challenge the
ownership rights or the validity of our patents. In addition,
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our
proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the
United States and it may be more difficult to monitor the use of
our intellectual property. Our competitors may be able to
legitimately ascertain non-patented proprietary technology
embedded in our systems. If this occurs, we may not be able to
prevent the development of technology substantially similar to
ours.

We may have to resort to costly litigation to
enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade
secrets or know-how or to determine their scope, validity or
enforceability. Enforcing or defending our proprietary
technology is expensive, could cause us to divert resources and
may not prove successful. Our protective measures may prove
inadequate to protect our proprietary rights, and if we fail to
enforce or protect our rights, we could lose valuable assets.

Intellectual property infringement claims
 may be costly to resolve and could divert management
 attention. 

Other companies may hold or obtain patents on
inventions or may otherwise claim proprietary rights to
technology necessary to our business. The markets in which we
compete are comprised of competitors who in some cases hold
substantial patent portfolios covering aspects of products that
could be similar to ours. We could become subject to claims that
we are infringing patent, trademark, copyright or other
proprietary rights of others, and have recently been sued by a
substrate competitor concerning alleged patent infringement.
Litigation to determine the validity of alleged claims could be
time-consuming and result in significant expense to us and
divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel,
whether or not the litigation is ultimately determined in our
favor. If a lawsuit is decided against us, we could be subject
to significant liabilities, requiring us to seek costly licenses
or preventing us from manufacturing and selling our products. We
may not be able to obtain required licensing agreements on terms
acceptable to us or at all.

As our business matures, we may need to
 upgrade our systems, or incur additional costs related to
 regulatory compliance. 

In the past, periods of rapid growth and
expansion has strained our management and other resources. The
expansion of our manufacturing capacity and the shift of
manufacturing operations to China placed and continue to place a
significant strain on our operations and management resources.
We recently upgraded our inventory control systems and may
implement additional systems relating to consolidation of our
financial results. If we fail to manage these changes
effectively, our operations may be disrupted.

To manage our business effectively, we may need
to implement additional and improved management information
systems, further develop our operating, administrative,
financial and accounting systems and controls, add experienced
senior level managers, and maintain close coordination among our
executive, engineering, accounting, marketing, sales and
operations organizations.

If necessary, we will spend substantial sums to
support our future growth and shift to China and to comply with
the reporting and attestation requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002. We may incur additional unexpected costs. Our
systems, procedures or controls may not be adequate to support
our operations, and we may be unable to expand quickly enough to
exploit potential market opportunities.

If we fail to manage periodic contractions,
 we may utilize our cash balances and our existing cash and cash
 equivalent balances could decline. 

We anticipate that our existing cash resources
will fund any anticipated operating losses, purchases of capital
equipment and provide adequate working capital for the next
twelve months. However, our liquidity is affected by many
factors including, among others, the extent to which we pursue
additional capital expenditures, the level of our production,
and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry
and global economies. If we fail to manage our contractions
successfully we may draw down our cash reserves, which would
adversely affect our operating results and financial condition,
reduce our value and may impinge our ability to raise debt and
equity funding in the future, at a time when we may be required
to raise additional cash. Accordingly, there can be no assurance
that events in the future will not require us to seek additional
capital, or, if so required, that such capital will be available
on terms acceptable to us, if at all. As part of our effort to
reduce costs, we may lose key staff, production resources, and
technology that we will need to grow when end markets recover.
These events could reduce our ability to grow profitably as
markets recover.

As a result of the difficult economic
 conditions, we have implemented restructuring and workforce
 reductions, which may adversely affect the morale and
 performance of our personnel and our ability to hire new
 personnel. 

In connection with our efforts to streamline
operations, reduce costs and bring staffing and structure in
line with demand for our products, we implemented a corporate
restructuring beginning in 2001 and reduced our workforce,
shifted production activities to China, reduced capital
expenditures, and discontinued our opto-electronics business. In
addition, our stock price is volatile, which can affect the
value of stock options issued to our employees. Our
restructuring may yield unanticipated consequences, such as
attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce and loss of
employee morale and decreased performance. As a result of these
factors, our remaining personnel may seek employment with
larger, more established companies or companies that they
perceive as having less volatile stock prices. Continuity of
personnel can be very important factors in the sales and
production of our products and completion of our research and
development efforts.

Any future acquisitions may disrupt our
 business, dilute stockholder value or distract management
 attention. 

As part of our strategy, we may consider
acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses that
offer products, services and technologies complementary to ours.
Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including:

we may have difficulty assimilating the
 operations, products and personnel of the acquired businesses;

our ongoing business may be disrupted;

we may incur unanticipated costs;

our management may be unable to manage the
 financial and strategic position of acquired or developed
 products, services and technologies;

we may be unable to maintain uniform standards,
 controls, procedures, and policies; and

our relationships with employees and customers
 may be impaired as a result of any integration.

For example, we incurred substantial costs in
connection with our acquisition of Lyte Optronics in May 1999,
including the assumption of approximately 10.0 million of
debt, which was subsequently repaid, resulting in a decline of
cash available. We also incurred consistent operating losses for
the business following the acquisition, and have discontinued
all operations and sold the related assets acquired in our
acquisition of Lyte Optronics during 2003.

To the extent that we issue shares of our stock
or other rights to purchase stock in connection with any future
acquisitions, dilution to our existing stockholders will result
and our earnings per share may suffer. Any future acquisitions
may not generate additional revenue or provide any benefit to
our business.

If any of our facilities is damaged by
 actions such as fire, explosion, or natural disaster, we may not
 be able to manufacture our products. 

The ongoing operation of our manufacturing and
production facilities in California and China is critical to our
ability to meet demand for our products. If we are not able to
use all or a significant portion of our facilities for prolonged
periods for any reason, we will not be able to manufacture
products for our customers. For example, a natural disaster,
fire or explosion caused by our use of combustible chemicals and
high temperatures during our manufacturing processes would
render some or all of our facilities inoperable for an
indefinite period of time. Actions outside of our control, such
as earthquakes, could also damage our facilities, rendering them
inoperable. Some of our manufacturing and research and
development is currently performed at our Fremont, California
facilities, which are located near an active seismic fault line.
If we are unable to operate our facilities and manufacture our
products, we will lose customers and revenue and our business
will be harmed.

If we lose key personnel or are unable to
 hire additional qualified personnel as necessary, we may not be
 able to successfully manage our business or achieve our
 objectives. 

Our success depends upon the continued service of
Morris S. Young, Ph.D., our president, chairman of the
board and chief executive officer, as well as other key
management and technical personnel. We do not have long-term
employment contracts with, or key person life insurance on, any
of our key personnel.

We believe our future success will also depend in
large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled
managerial, engineering, sales and marketing, finance and
manufacturing personnel. The competition for these employees is
intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in
attracting and retaining new personnel. The loss of the services
of any of our key personnel, the inability to attract or retain
qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required
personnel, particularly engineers, could make it difficult for
us to manage our business and meet key objectives, including the
timely introduction of new products.

Changes in China s political, social
 and economic environment may affect our financial
 performance. 

Our financial performance may be affected by
changes in China s political, social and economic
environment. The role of the Chinese central and local
governments in the Chinese economy is significant. Chinese
policies toward economic liberalization, and laws and policies
affecting technology companies, foreign investment, currency
exchange rates and other matters could change, resulting in
greater restrictions on our ability to do business and operate
our manufacturing facilities in China. Any imposition of
surcharges or any increase in Chinese tax rates could hurt our
operating results. The Chinese government could revoke,
terminate or suspend our license for national security and
similar reasons without compensation to us. If the government of
China were to take any of these actions, we would be prevented
from conducting all or part of our business. Any failure on our
part to comply with governmental regulations could result in the
loss of our ability to manufacture our products in China.

China has from time to time experienced instances
of civil unrest and hostilities. Confrontations have occurred
between the military and civilians. Events of this nature could
influence the Chinese economy, result in nationalization of
foreign-owned operations such as ours, and could negatively
affect our ability to operate our facilities in China.

The effect of terrorist threats and actions
 on the general economy could decrease our
 revenues. 

The United States continues to be on alert for
terrorist activity. The potential near- and long-term impact
terrorist activities may have in regards to our suppliers,
customers and markets for our products and the U.S. economy
are uncertain. There may be embargos of ports or products, or
destruction of shipments or our facilities, or attacks that
affect our personnel. There may be other potential adverse
effects on our operating results due to a significant event that
we cannot foresee.

Our stock price has been and may continue
 to be volatile. 

Our stock price has fluctuated significantly
since we began trading on the Nasdaq National Market. For the
year ended December 31, 2003, the high and low closing
sales prices of our common stock were 3.42 and 0.67,
respectively. A number of factors could cause the price of our
common stock to continue to fluctuate substantially, including:

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our
 quarterly or annual operating results;

changes in expectations about our future
 financial performance or changes in financial estimates of
 securities analysts;

announcements of technological innovations by us
 or our competitors;

new product introduction by us or our competitors;

large customer orders or order
 cancellations; and

the operating and stock price performance of
 comparable companies.

In addition, the stock market in general has
experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to
the operating performance of particular companies. These broad
market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the
trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual
operating performance.

We have adopted certain anti-takeover
 measures that may make it more difficult for a third party to
 acquire us. 

Our board of directors has the authority to issue
up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine
the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares
without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The
rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and
may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any
preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance
of shares of preferred stock, while potentially providing
desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions
and for

32

Table of Contents 

other corporate purposes, could have the effect
of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a
majority of our outstanding voting stock. We have no present
intention to issue shares of preferred stock.

Further, on April 24, 2001, our board of
directors adopted a preferred stock purchase rights plan
intended to guard against certain takeover tactics. The adoption
of this plan was not in response to any proposal to acquire us,
and the board is not aware of any such effort. The existence of
this plan could also have the effect of making it more difficult
for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding
voting stock. In addition, certain provisions of our certificate
of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a
change of control, which could adversely affect the market price
of our common stock.

In addition, provisions in our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the
effect of delaying or preventing a merger, acquisition or change
of control of us, or changes in our management, including:

the division of our board of directors into three
 separate classes, each with three year terms;

the right of our board to elect a director to
 fill a space created by a board vacancy or the expansion of the
 board;

the ability of our board to alter our bylaws;

the ability of our board to authorize the
 issuance of up to 2,000,000 shares of blank check preferred
 stock; and

the requirement that only our board or the
 holders of at least 10 of our outstanding shares may call a
 special meeting of our stockholders.

Furthermore, because we are incorporated in
Delaware, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203
of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions
prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15 or
more of the outstanding voting stock, from consummating a merger
or combination with a corporation unless:

66 2/3 of the shares of voting stock not
 owned by these large stockholders approve the merger or
 combination, or

the board of directors approves the merger or
 combination or the transaction which resulted in the large
 stockholder owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock.

Legislative actions, higher insurance costs
 and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to cause
 our general and administrative expenses to increase and impact
 our future financial position and results of
 operations. 

In order to comply with the newly adopted
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as proposed changes to
listing standards by Nasdaq, and proposed accounting changes by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, we may be required to
increase our internal controls, hire additional personnel and
additional outside legal, accounting and advisory services, all
of which will cause our general and administrative costs to
increase. Insurers may increase premiums as a result of the high
claims rates they incurred over the past year, and our premiums
for our various insurance policies, including our
directors and officers insurance policies, increased
during 2003. Proposed changes in the accounting rules, including
legislative and other proposals to account for employee stock
options as a compensation expense among others, could materially
increase the expense that we report under generally accepted
accounting principles and adversely affect our operating results.

We need to continue to improve or implement
 our systems, procedures and controls and may not receive
 favorable attestation of our internal control systems by our
 independent auditors. 

The new requirements adopted by the Securities
and Exchange Commission in response to the passage of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require annual review and
evaluation of our internal control systems, and attestation of
these systems by our independent accountants. We are currently
reviewing our internal control procedures and considering
further documentation of such procedures that may be necessary.
However, the

33

Table of Contents 

guidelines for the evaluation and attestation of
internal control systems have not yet been finalized.
Furthermore, once the guidelines are finalized, the evaluation
and attestation processes will be new and untested. Therefore,
we can give no assurances that our systems will satisfy the new
requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission or that
we will receive a favorable review and attestation by our
independent auditors.

 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
 About Market Risk 

Foreign Currency Risk 

We use short-term forward exchange contracts for
hedging purposes to reduce the effects of adverse foreign
exchange rate movements. We have purchased foreign exchange
contracts to hedge against certain trade accounts receivable
denominated in Japanese yen. The change in the fair value of the
forward contracts is recognized as part of the related foreign
currency transactions as they occur. As of December 31,
2003, we had no outstanding commitments with respect to foreign
exchange contracts.

Interest Rate Risk 

Cash and cash equivalents earning interest and
certain variable rate debt instruments are subject to interest

We also maintain minority investments in private
and publicly traded companies. These investments are reviewed
for other than temporary declines in value on a quarterly basis.
Reasons for other than temporary declines in value include
whether the related company would have insufficient cash flow to
operate for the next twelve months, significant changes in the
operating performance and changes in market conditions. In 2003,
we recorded 2.0 million in charges to other expense to
write down our investment in two private US companies. As of
December 31, 2003, the minority investments we continue to
hold totaled 4.3 million.

Item 9A. Controls and
Procedures 

(a) Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted
an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such
term is defined under Rule 13a-14(c) promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on their evaluation, our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
period covered by this report.

(b) As required by Rule 13a-15(d), our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal finance officer, also conducted an evaluation of our
internal control over financial reporting to determine whether
any changes occurred during the quarter covered by this report
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such
change during the quarter covered by this report. It should be
noted that any system of controls, however well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance
that the objectives of the system will be met.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
AXT, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
operations, of stockholders equity and cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
AXT, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2003
and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company s management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 

Note 1. 
 
 The Company and Summary of Accounting
 Policies 

The Company 

AXT designs, develops, manufactures and
distributes high-performance compound semiconductor substrates.
AXT s substrate products are used primarily in wireless
communications, lighting display applications, and fiber optic
communications.

On June 24, 2003, the Company s Board
of Directors approved management s plan to exit the
Company s unprofitable Opto-electronics business.
Substantially all of the assets of this division were sold in
September 2003. The decision to dispose of the business was due
to continuing operating losses and negative cash flows from the
division and significant uncertainty regarding future
profitability.

The Company officially changed its name from
American Xtal Technology, Inc. to AXT, Inc. on
July 7, 2000.

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ materially from these estimates.

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. Investments in business entities in which AXT does
not have control, but has the ability to exercise significant
influence over operating and financial policies (generally
20-50 ownership), are accounted for by the equity method.

Foreign Currency Translation 

The functional currencies of the Company s
Japanese and Chinese subsidiaries are the local currencies.
Transaction gains and losses resulting from transactions
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for
the Company or in the functional currencies for the subsidiaries
are included in other (income) expense for the periods presented.

The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries
are translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet
date. Revenue and expense items are translated at the average
rate of exchange for the period. Gains and losses from foreign
currency translation are included in other comprehensive income
in stockholders equity.

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenue upon the shipment
of its products to the customer provided that the Company has
received a signed purchase order, the price is fixed or
determinable, title has transferred, collection of resulting
receivables is probable, product returns are reasonably
estimable, there are no customer acceptance requirements and
there are no remaining significant obligations. The Company
provides for future returns based on historical experience at
the time revenue is recognized. The Company does not provide for
warranty related exposure as such exposure has historically been
immaterial.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Fair Value of Financial
 Instruments 

The reported amounts of certain of the
Company s financial instruments including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term investments,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value
due to their short maturities. The reported amounts of
short-term and long-term debt approximate fair value due to the
market interest rates that these debts bear, and interest rates
currently available to the Company.

Concentration of Credit Risk 

Financial instruments, which potentially subject
the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily
of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers financial condition, and limits the amount of
credit extended when deemed necessary, but generally does not
require collateral. The Company invests primarily in money
market accounts and commercial paper instruments. Cash
equivalents are maintained with high quality institutions and
their composition and maturities are regularly monitored by
management.

No customer represented greater than 10 of
product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001. The company s top five customers represented
28.9 of product revenue for the year ended December 31,
2003, 31.4 of product revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2002, and 31.1 of product revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2001. We expect that sales to
certain customers will continue to comprise a significant
portion of our revenue in the future.

No customer accounted for 10 or more of the
trade accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2003
and 2002.

Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents.

Investments 

Management determines the appropriate
classification of investments at the time of purchase.
Available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair value
based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date. The
amortized cost of securities is adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such
amortization is included in other (income) and expense,
net. Realized gains or losses are determined on the
specific identification method and are reflected in other
(income) and expense, net. Net unrealized gains or losses
are recorded directly in stockholders equity. Those
unrealized losses that are deemed to be other than temporary are
reflected in interest and other income, net. The
Company also maintains minority investments in private companies
which are accounted for under the costs basis. These investments
are reviewed for other than temporary declines in value on a
quarterly basis. Reasons for other than temporary declines in
value include whether the related company would have
insufficient cash flow to operate for the next twelve months,
significant changes in the operating performance and changes in
market conditions.

Inventories 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(approximated by standard cost) or market. Cost is determined
using the weighted average cost method. Finished goods and
work-in-process inventories include material, labor and
manufacturing overhead costs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost
less accumulated depreciation computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, which
vary from 3 to 27.5 years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the
term of the lease. We generally depreciate computers and
software over 3 years, automobiles over 5 years,
office equipment, furniture and fixtures over 3 years,
leasehold improvements over 10 years, and buildings over
27.5 years. Depreciation expense was 5.8 million,
 9.5 million, and 8.5 million for the years ended
2003, 2002, and 2001 respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived
 Assets 

Management evaluates the recoverability of
property, equipment, and intangible assets in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, or
SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. When events and
circumstance indicate that long-lived assets may be impaired,
management compares the carrying value of the long-lived assets
to the projection of future undiscounted cash flows attributable
to such assets and in the event that the carrying value exceeds
the future undiscounted cash flows, management records an
impairment charge against income equal to the excess of the
carrying value over the asset s fair value.

Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company accounts for stock-based employee
compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method as
prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related
interpretations thereof. Accordingly, compensation cost for
stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the market
price of the Company s stock at the date of grant over the
stock option exercise price. In addition, the Company provides
additional disclosure provisions as required under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation and SFAS 148,
 Accounting for Stock- Based Compensation 
Transition and Disclosure in Note 13.

Research and Development 

Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred.

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for deferred income taxes
using the liability method, under which the expected future tax
consequences of timing differences between the book and tax
basis of assets and liabilities are recognized as deferred tax
assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are established
when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets when management
estimates, based on available objective evidence, that it is
more likely than not that the future income tax benefit
represented by the net deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income is defined as the change in
equity of a company during a period from transactions and other
events and circumstances, excluding transactions resulting from
investment by owners and distribution to owners. The difference
between net income and comprehensive income for the Company
relates to foreign currency translation adjustments and
unrealized gains and losses on investment securities.
Comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001 is disclosed in the Consolidated Statements
of Stockholders Equity.

Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per
 Share 

Basic income (loss) per share is computed by
dividing the income (loss) available to holders of common stock
for the period by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of
diluted income (loss) per share excludes potential common stock
if the effect of such stock is antidilutive. Potential common
stock consists of common shares issuable upon the exercise of
stock options.

Reclassifications 

Certain reclassifications have been made to the
prior years consolidated financial statements to conform
to current period presentation.

Recent Accounting
 Pronouncements 

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 45 FIN 45 ),
 Guarantor s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others. FIN No. 45 requires that
a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet
upon issuance of a guarantee. In addition, FIN No. 45
requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has
issued, including a reconciliation of changes in the
entity s product warranty liabilities. The initial
recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN
No. 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees
issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of
the guarantor s fiscal year-end. The disclosure
requirements of FIN No. 45 are effective for financial
statements of interim or annual periods ending after
December 15, 2002. Our adoption of FIN No. 45 did not
have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46 FIN 46 ),
 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
Interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated
by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors
in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling
financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for
the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46
is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities
created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable
interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1,
2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the
first interim or annual period beginning after December 15,
2003. Our adoption of FIN No. 46 did not have a material
effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force, or
EITF, reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-21,
 Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. 
EITF Issue No. 00-21 requires revenue arrangements with
multiple deliverables to be divided into separate units of
accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain
criteria. The arrangement s consideration should be
allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their
relative fair values. Applicable revenue recognition criteria
should be considered separately for each unit. The provisions of
EITF Issue No. 00-21 are effective for revenue arrangements
entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15,
2003. Our adoption of EITF Issue No. 00-21 did not have a
material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This
Statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and
reporting for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively
referred to as derivatives), and for hedging activities under
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. This Statement is
effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated
after June 30, 2003. Our adoption of SFAS No. 149
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial
statements.

In May 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for
an issuer to classify

and measure certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. This Statement
requires an issuer to classify a financial instrument that meets
certain characteristics as a liability (or an asset in some
circumstances). This Statement is effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003,
and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim
period beginning after June 15, 2003. Our adoption of
SFAS No. 150 did not have a material effect on our
consolidated financial statements.

Note 2. 
 
 Discontinued Operations 

On June 24, 2003, the Company announced the
discontinuation of its opto-electronics division, which was
established as part of the acquisition of Lyte
Optronics, Inc. in May 1999. Accordingly, the results of
operations of the opto-electronics division have been segregated
from continuing operations and are reported separately as
discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of
operations. The discontinued opto-electronics division
manufactured blue, cyan, and green high-brightness light
emitting diodes (HBLEDs) for the illumination markets, including
full-color displays, wireless handset backlighting and traffic
signals, and also manufactured vertical cavity surface emitting
lasers (VCSELs) and laser diodes for fiber optic communications
and storage area networks.

On September 27, 2003 the Company completed
a sale of substantially all of the assets of its
opto-electronics business to Lumei Optoelectronics, Corp. and
Dalian Luming Science and Technology Group, Co., Ltd. for the
Chinese Renminbi equivalent of 9.6 million. Proceeds of
 1.0 million will be held in escrow for up to one year and
will not be recorded until all claims, if any, are settled. If
unclaimed, up to 250,000 of the sale proceeds will be held in
escrow for a second year and will not be recorded until all
claims, if any, are settled. The Company retains a building
located in Monterey Park, CA, that it expects to sell in 2004.
This asset is classified as Held for Sale on the consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2003.

The Company recorded a loss on disposal of
 9.5 million to write-down the book value of assets sold to
their estimated fair market value.

The Company s financial statements have been
presented to reflect the opto-electronics business as a
discontinued operation for all periods presented. Operating

 Assets Held for Sale 

Assets held for sale at December 31, 2003
consist of a property located in Monterey Park, California,
which is part of the Company s discontinued
opto-electronics division (see Note 2). Assets held for
sale at December 31, 2002 consist of a property located at
4281 Technology Drive, Fremont, California. In November of 2002,
the Company entered into a contract to sell this property to a
third party. On March 11, 2003, the Company completed the
sale of its property located at 4281 Technology Drive, Fremont,
California, for 6.3 million. Net cash proceeds from the
sale were 5.2 million. The gain the Company incurred on
this transaction was less than 15,000. Under the terms of the
sale agreement, the Company has agreed to lease back the
property for a ten-year period. Accordingly, on March 11,
2003, the Company signed an operating lease for this property
through March 2013. Annual rent under this operating lease is
approximately 600,000.

Note 4. 
 
 Inventories 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted
average cost method. Finished goods and work-in-process
inventories include material, labor and manufacturing overhead
costs. The Company routinely evaluates the levels of its
inventory in light of current market conditions in order to
identify excess and obsolete inventory and provides a valuation
allowance for certain inventories based upon the age and quality
of the product.

Net deferred tax assets

At December 31, 2003, the Company had
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately 75.9 million and 31.4 million,
respectively, which will expire beginning in 2020 and 2005,
respectively. In addition, the Company had federal tax credit
carryforwards of approximately 1.6 million, which will
expire beginning in 2019. The Company also has state tax credit
carryforwards of approximately 2.7 million which will
expire beginning 2007.

The deferred tax assets valuation allowance at
December 31, 2003 is attributed to U.S. federal, and
state deferred tax assets, which result primarily from future
deductible accruals, reserves, net operating loss carryforwards,
and tax credit carryforwards. The Company believes that, based
on a number of factors, the available objective evidence creates
sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of the
deferred tax assets such that a full valuation allowance has
been recorded. These factors include the Company s history
of losses, and the lack of carryback capacity to realize
deferred tax assets.

In accordance with Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code, the amounts of and benefits from net
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be impaired or
limited in certain circumstances. Events which cause limitations
in the amount of net operating losses or credits that the
Company may utilize in any one year include, but are not limited
to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50 as defined,
over a three year period.

Plan ), which provided for granting of incentive and
non-qualified stock options to employees and directors of the
Company. Under the 1993 Plan, 880,000 shares of common
stock were reserved for issuance as of December 31, 1998.
Options granted under the 1993 Plan were generally for periods
not to exceed ten years and were granted at the fair market
value of the stock at the date of grant as determined by the
board of directors. Options granted under the 1993 Plan
generally vested 25.0 upon grant and 25.0 each year
thereafter, with full vesting occurring on the third anniversary
of the grant date. This plan terminated on March 12, 2003.

In July 1997, the Company s board of

Stock-Based Compensation Under APB
 No. 25 

In connection with certain stock option grants
the Company recorded deferred compensation costs totaling
 203,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998. Compensation
cost is the difference between the exercise price and the deemed
fair value at the date of grant. Compensation cost is being
amortized over the vesting period relating to these options, of
which no amount was amortized for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and 107,000 was amortized for
the year ended December 31, 2001.

Certain Pro
Forma Disclosures 

As required under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123),
 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148
(SFAS 148), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure, the pro forma effects of
stock-based compensation on net income and net earnings per
common share have been estimated at the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
that have no restrictions and are fully transferable and
negotiable in a free trading market. Black-Scholes does not
consider the employment, transfer or vesting restrictions that
are inherent in the Company s employee options. Use of an
option valuation model, as required by SFAS 123, includes
highly subjective assumptions based on long-term predictions,
including the expected stock price volatility and average life
of each option grant. Because the Company s employee
options have characteristics significantly different from those
of freely traded options, and because changes in the assumptions
underlying the option-pricing model can materially affect the
Company s estimate of the fair value of those options, in
the Company s opinion, the existing valuation models,
including Black-Scholes, are not reliable single measures and
may misstate the fair value of the Company s employee
options.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan 

In February 1998, the Company s board of
directors approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
 1998 Purchase Plan ). The Company s stockholders
approved the 1998 Purchase Plan in March 1998. At
December 31, 2003 a total of 900,000 shares of the
Company s common stock were reserved for issuance under the
1998 Purchase Plan. A total of 683,000 shares were
purchased as of December 31, 2003. The 1998 Purchase Plan
permits eligible employees to acquire shares of the
Company s common stock through payroll deductions. The
common stock purchase price is determined as 85.0 of the lower
of the market price of the common stock at the purchase date or
the date of offer to the employee.

 Voluntary Stock Option Exchange
 Program 

On May 27, 2003, the Company announced a
voluntary stock option exchange program for our employees. Under
the program, option holders, excluding our executive officers
and independent directors, had the opportunity to cancel
outstanding options with an exercise price in excess of
 2.10 per share in exchange for new options to be granted
at a future date that was at least six months and one day after
the date of cancellation, which was June 30, 2003. The
number of shares of common stock subject to the new options was
equal to 75 of the number subject to the exchanged options.
Under the exchange program, options to purchase an aggregate of
738,027 shares of our common stock, representing
approximately 48 of the options that were eligible to be
tendered in the Offer as of May 27, 2003, were tendered and
cancelled. New options will vest at the same rate as the
exchanged options and have an exercise price equal to the fair
market value of our common stock at the new grant date, which
was 3.11 per share. On December 31, 2003, the Company
granted options to purchase an aggregate of 522,754 shares
of our common stock in exchange for such tendered options.

 Related Party Transactions 

Since January 2002, there has not been, nor is
there currently proposed, any transaction or series of similar
transactions to which the Company was or is to be a party in
which the amount involved exceeds 60,000, and in which any
director, executive officer or holder of more than 5 of any
class of the Company s voting securities or members of that
person s immediate family had or will have a direct or
indirect material interest other than the transactions described
below.

The Company entered into an operating lease in
July 2001 for warehouse space in Fremont, CA with 4160 Business
Center, LLC, a real estate holding company, in which Davis
Zhang, the president of our substrate division, is the sole
shareholder. Lease payments to 4160 Business Center, LLC were
approximately 121,000 for the three months ended March 31,
2003. In April of 2003, Mr. Zhang sold this warehouse to a
party unrelated to the Company. The Company began leasing this
warehouse from the new owner on the date of sale. Mr. Zhang
will continue to hold a 3.7 million note on the property
through April 2005.

Note 17. 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies 

From time to time we are involved in judicial or
administrative proceedings concerning matters arising in the
ordinary course of our business. We do not expect that any of
these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
cash flows or results of operation.

On April 15, 2003, Sumitomo Electric
Industries, Ltd., (SEI) filed a complaint in the Tokyo
District Court, Civil Division against us and our Japanese
distributor alleging patent infringement of two patents held by
SEI in Japan. The suit seeks penalties from AXT in the amount of
 1.67 million plus interest and court costs and the
cessation of AXT s sales of gallium arsenide substrates in
Japan. AXT intends to defend itself vigorously in these lawsuits
and continues to sell its products in Japan.

On June 11, 2003, Cree, Inc. filed a
complaint in the United States Court for Northern District of
California against the Company alleging patent infringement. The
complaint sought damages and injunction against infringement. On
July 23, 2003, the Company filed a counter complaint in the
United States Court for Northern District of California, denying
any patent infringement and alleging that Cree s actions
were intentionally designed to interfere with the Company s
prospective business relationships. The Company reached an
agreement with Cree resolving the disputes between us and signed
a settlement agreement on March 5, 2004. The resolution of
the disputes did not have a material adverse impact on the
Company s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

The Company has entered into contracts to supply
several large customers with GaAs wafers. The contracts
guarantee the delivery of a certain number of wafers between
January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2004 with a current
contract value of 2.0 million. The contract sales prices
are subject to review quarterly and can be adjusted in the event
that raw material prices change. In the event of non-delivery of
the determined wafer quantities in any monthly delivery period,
the Company could be subject to non-performance penalties of
between 5 and 10 of the value of the delinquent monthly
deliveries. The Company has not received any claims for
non-performance penalties due to non-delivery. Partial
prepayments received for these supply contracts totaling
 994,000 are included in accrued liabilities at
December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the
Company has met all of its delivery obligations under these
contracts and expects to do so for the remainder of the contract
terms.

The Company leases certain office space,
manufacturing facilities and property under long-term operating
leases expiring at various dates through March 2013. Total rent
expense under these operating leases was approximately
 1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003,
 947,000 in 2002 and 779,000 in 2001.

AXT, INC.
 CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS

1. POLICY STATEMENT

 We are committed to being a good corporate citizen and it is our policy
to conduct our business affairs honestly and in an ethical manner. That goal
cannot be achieved unless each of our employees individually accepts his or her
responsibility to promote integrity and ethical conduct in all of his or her
activities. Activities that may call into question AXT's reputation or integrity
should be avoided. The provisions of this Code cannot anticipate every situation
that may pose an ethical or moral issue, and AXT understands that not every
situation is black and white. The key to compliance with the Code is exercising
good judgment. This means following the spirit of this Code and the law, doing
the "right" thing and acting ethically even when the law is not specific.

 Supervisors set an example for other employees and are often
responsible for directing the actions of others. Every supervisor is expected to
take necessary actions to ensure compliance with this Code, to provide guidance
and assist employees in resolving questions concerning the Code and to permit
employees to express any concerns regarding compliance with this Code. No one
has the authority to order another employee to act contrary to this Code.

 The Code outlines the broad principles of legal and ethical business
conduct under which we do business. The Code is intended to supplement, but not
to replace, our Employee Handbook and any policies that we have established.
Every person who works for AXT, its affiliates or subsidiaries, is expected to
understand and comply with the provisions of this Code.

 Violations of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, including
failures to report potential violations by others, will be viewed as a
disciplinary matter that may result in personnel action, including termination
of employment. If you believe that a violation of this Code of Business Conduct
and Ethics has occurred, please contact your supervisor, or the Chairman of our
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors at
Chairman, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, c/o AXT, Inc., 4281
Technology Drive, Fremont, CA 94538. If you are concerned about maintaining
anonymity, you may also send correspondence to the Chairman of our Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors, in accordance with our Whistle-Blowing and
Complaint Policy, at the following address: Chairman of the Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors, c/o AXT, Inc., 4281 Technology Drive, Fremont, CA 94538.

2. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS

 AXT is committed to full compliance with the laws and regulations of
the cities, states and countries in which it operates. Numerous federal, state
and local laws and regulations define and establish obligations with which AXT,
its employees and agents must comply. Violation of governing laws and
regulations may subject AXT to significant risk of fines, penalties and damaged
reputation. All of our employees are expected to comply with applicable laws,
rules and regulations when performing duties for AXT. Under certain
circumstances, local country law may establish requirements that differ from
this Code, and in such situations employees should comply with all local country
laws. An employee or agent who violates laws or regulations in performing duties
for AXT risks individual indictment, prosecution and penalties, and civil
actions and penalties, and may subject AXT to the same risks and penalties. An
employee who violates these laws or this Code may be subject to immediate
disciplinary action, including possible termination of employment or affiliation
with AXT.

3. FULL, FAIR, ACCURATE, TIMELY AND UNDERSTANDABLE DISCLOSURE

 It is of critical importance to AXT that all disclosure in reports and
documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission be fair,
accurate, timely and understandable. You may be called upon to provide
information to assist AXT in these responsibilities consistent with your role
within AXT, and to assure that our public reports are complete, fair and
understandable. We expect all of our employees to take this responsibility

 1

seriously, and to provide prompt and accurate answers to all inquiries made to
you in connection with the preparation of our public reports and disclosure.

4. SPECIAL ETHICS OBLIGATIONS FOR EMPLOYEES WITH FINANCIAL REPORTING
RESPONSIBILITIES

 Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, controller and
other members of our Finance Department each bear a special responsibility for
promoting integrity throughout AXT. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer and other members of our Finance Department have a
responsibility to foster a culture throughout AXT as a whole that ensures the
fair and timely reporting of our financial results and condition. Because of
this special role, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer,
controller and other members of our Finance Department are bound by the
following Financial Officer Code of Ethics, and by accepting the Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics each agrees that he or she will:

 o Act with honesty and integrity, including the ethical handling
 of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal
 and professional relationships.

 o Comply with rules and regulations of federal, state,
 provincial and local governments, and other appropriate
 private and public regulatory agencies applicable to the
 performance of his or her duties to AXT.

 o Comply with our established accounting procedures, our system
 of internal controls and generally accepted accounting
 principles.

 o Provide information that is accurate, complete, objective,
 relevant, timely and understandable to ensure full, fair,
 accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
 documents that we file with, or submits to, governmental
 agencies and in other public communications made by us.

 o Respect the confidentiality of proprietary information
 acquired in the course of his or her work except when
 authorized or otherwise legally obligated to disclose.
 Proprietary information acquired in the course of one's work
 will not be used for personal advantage.

5. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES

 There are certain situations and activities that may create a conflict
between your interests and those of AXT. You should avoid any relationship,
influence or activity that would cause a conflict of interest, or appear to
cause a conflict of interest, with your duties and responsibilities at AXT. This
includes situations in which your personal, family or financial interests
conflict or appear to conflict with those of AXT. You should not take for your
own benefit opportunities discovered in the course of employment that you have
reason to know would benefit AXT. Sometimes a conflict of interest will develop
unexpectedly. If you feel that you have a conflict, actual or potential, you
should report the details to your supervisor. Although not all actual or
potential activity creating a conflict of interest is automatically prohibited,
you should disclose all details of the conflict to your supervisor, and if
possible obtain written approval from your supervisor before participating in
any such activity.

 Since it isn't always easy to spot potential conflicts of interests,
set forth below are some examples of actual or potential conflicts, although it
is not possible to list every possible potential conflict, and you are
encouraged to consult with your supervisor before taking action if you are
uncertain whether an activity may constitute a conflict of interest.

 o you, or a member of your family, receive improper personal
 benefits as a result of your position in AXT;

 o you use Company's property for your personal benefit;

2

o you engage in activities that interfere with your loyalty to
 AXT or your ability to perform Company duties or
 responsibilities effectively;

 o you work simultaneously (whether as an employee or a
 consultant) for a competitor, customer or supplier;

 o you, or a member of your family, have a financial interest in
 a customer, supplier, or competitor which is significant
 enough to cause divided loyalty with AXT or the appearance of
 divided loyalty (the significance of a financial interest
 depends on many factors, such as size of investment in
 relation to your income, net worth and/or financial needs,
 your potential to influence decisions that could impact your
 interests, and the nature of the business or level of
 competition between AXT and the supplier, customer or
 competitor);

 o you, or a member of your family, acquire an interest in
 property (such as real estate, patent or other intellectual
 property rights or securities) in which you have reason to
 know AXT has, or might have, a legitimate interest;

 o you, or a member of your family, receive a loan or a guarantee
 of a loan from a customer, supplier or competitor (other than
 a loan from a financial institution made in the ordinary
 course of business and on an arm's-length basis);

 o you divulge or use AXT's confidential information - such as
 financial data, customer information, or computer programs -
 for your own personal or business purposes;

 o you make gifts or payments, or provide special favors, to
 customers, suppliers or competitors (or their immediate family
 members) with a value significant enough to cause the
 customer, supplier or competitor to make a purchase, or take
 or forego other action, which is beneficial to AXT and which
 the customer, supplier or competitor would not otherwise have
 taken; or

 o you are given the right to buy stock in other companies or you
 receive cash or other payments in return for promoting the
 services of an advisor, such as an investment banker, to AXT.

 You should not give or receive valuable gifts, payments, special favors
or other consideration to or from customers, suppliers or competitors beyond
those extended in normal business, and you should not make payments or promises
to influence someone else's acts or decisions. You must observe all government
restrictions on gifts and entertainment, including the restrictions of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it illegal to offer payment, promise
to pay, or authorize payment of any money, gifts, or things of value to any
foreign official, or any foreign political party, candidate or official, for the
purpose of (i) influencing any act, or failure to act, in the official capacity
of that foreign official or party; or (ii) inducing the foreign official or
party to use influence to affect a decision of a foreign government or agency,
in order to obtain or retain business for anyone, or direct business to anyone.

 Although we encourage you to participate in industry and civic
associations, you should be sensitive to possible conflicts with our business
interests, if, for instance, the association takes a position adverse to our
interests. As a general rule employees may not accept a position as an outside
director of any current or likely competitor of AXT.

6. REPORTING VIOLATIONS OF COMPANY POLICIES AND RECEIPT OF COMPLAINTS REGARDING
FINANCIAL REPORTING OR ACCOUNTING ISSUES

 If you become aware of conduct by an officer, director, employee or
contract worker which you believe in good faith is a potential violation of this
Code, you should notify your own or any other AXT supervisor, the Chief
Executive Officer, or the Chief Financial Officer as soon as possible. You
should also report any complaint or concern regarding AXT's accounting, internal
accounting controls, or auditing matters, or any concerns regarding

3

questionable accounting or auditing matters. Supervisors are required to refer
all reports of possible violations to the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief
Financial Officer or the Chair of the Audit Committee.

 All reports of complaints or concerns shall be recorded in a log,
indicating the description of the matter reported, the date of the report and a
brief summary of the disposition. The log shall be maintained by the Chief
Financial Officer and shall be reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee.
Allegations of violations of the Code should be made only in good faith and not
to embarrass or put someone in a false light. If you become aware of a suspected
or potential violation don't try to investigate or resolve it on your own.
Prompt disclosure under this Code is vital to ensuring a timely and thorough
investigation and resolution. You are expected to cooperate in internal or
external investigations or alleged violations of the Code.

 In response to every report made in good faith and subsequently
determined to concern activity outside the Code, AXT will undertake an effective
and thorough investigation, and if improper conduct is found, AXT will take
appropriate disciplinary and remedial action. Compliance procedures are set
forth in Appendix B to this Code. AXT will attempt to keep its discussions with
any person reporting a violation confidential to the extent reasonably possible
without compromising the effectiveness of the investigation. If you believe your
report is not properly explained or resolved, you may take your concern or
complaint to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

 It is our policy that there be no intentional retaliation against any
person who provides truthful information to a Company or law enforcement
official concerning a possible violation of any law, regulation or Company
policy, including this Code. Persons who retaliate may be subject to civil,
criminal and administrative penalties, as well as disciplinary action, up to and
including termination of employment. In cases in which you report a suspected
violation in good faith and are not engaged in the questionable conduct, we will
attempt to keep our discussions with you confidential to the greatest extent
possible. In the course of our investigation, we may find it necessary to share
information with others on a "need to know" basis. No retaliation shall be taken
against you for reporting alleged violations while acting in good faith.

7. COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES

 o Compliance Officer. The Corporate Compliance Officer is the
 Chief Financial Officer. The Compliance Officer's
 responsibility is to ensure communication, training,
 monitoring, and overall compliance with the Code. The
 Compliance Officer will, with the assistance and cooperation
 of AXT's officers, directors and Supervisors, foster an
 atmosphere where employees are comfortable in communicating
 and reporting concerns and possible Code violations.

 o Access to the Code. AXT shall ensure that employees, officers
 and directors may access the Code on AXT's website. In
 addition, each current employee will be provided with a copy
 of the Code. New employees will receive a copy of the Code as
 part of their new hire information. From time to time, AXT
 will sponsor employee training programs in which the Code and
 other Company policies and procedures will be discussed.

 o Monitoring. Supervisors are the "go to" persons for employee
 questions and concerns relating to the Code. Supervisors or
 supervisors will immediately report any violations or
 allegations of violations to the Compliance Officer.
 Supervisors will work with the Compliance Officer in assessing
 areas of concern, potential violations, any needs for
 enhancement of the Code or remedial actions to effect the
 Code's policies and overall compliance with the Code and other
 related policies.

 o Internal Investigation. When an alleged violation of the Code
 is reported, AXT shall take prompt and appropriate action in
 accordance with the law and regulations and otherwise
 consistent with good business practice. If the suspected
 violation appears to involve either a possible violation of
 law or an issue of significant corporate interest, or if the
 report involves a complaint or concern of any person, whether
 employee, a stockholder or other interested person regarding
 AXT's financial disclosure, internal accounting controls,
 questionable auditing or accounting matters or practices or
 other issues relating to AXT's accounting or auditing, then
 the manager or investigator should immediately notify the
 Compliance Officer, who, in turn, shall notify the Chair of
 the Audit Committee. If a suspected

4

violation involves any director or executive officer or if the
 suspected violation concerns any fraud, whether or not
 material, involving management or other employees who have a
 significant role in AXT's internal controls, any person who
 received such report should immediately report the alleged
 violation to the Compliance Officer and, in every such case,
 the Chair of the Audit Committee. The Compliance Officer or
 the Chair of the Audit Committee, as applicable, shall assess
 the situation and determine the appropriate course of action,
 including the conduct of an investigation, as appropriate.

 o Disciplinary Actions. Subject to the following sentence, the
 Compliance Officer, after consultation with the Manager of
 Human Resources, shall be responsible for implementing the
 appropriate disciplinary action in accordance with AXT's
 policies and procedures for any employee who is found to have
 violated the Code. If a violation has been reported to the
 Audit Committee or another committee of the Board, that
 Committee shall be responsible for determining appropriate
 disciplinary action. Any violation of applicable law or any
 deviation from the standards embodied in this Code will result
 in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of
 employment. In addition to imposing discipline upon employees
 involved in non-compliant conduct, AXT also will impose
 discipline, as appropriate, upon an employee's supervisor, if
 any, who directs or approves such employees' improper actions,
 or is aware of those actions but does not act appropriately to
 correct them, and upon other individuals who fail to report
 known non-compliant conduct. In addition to imposing its own
 discipline, AXT will bring any violations of law to the
 attention of appropriate law enforcement personnel.

 o Retention of Reports and Complaints. All reports and
 complaints made to or received by the Compliance Officer or
 the Chair of the Audit Committee relating to violations of
 this Code shall be logged into a record maintained for this
 purpose by the Compliance Officer and this record of such
 report shall be retained for five years.

 o Required Government Reporting. Whenever conduct occurs that
 requires a report to the government, the Compliance Officer
 shall be responsible for complying with such reporting
 requirements.

 o Corrective Actions. Subject to the following sentence, in the
 event of a violation of the Code, the manager and the
 Compliance Officer should assess the situation to determine
 whether the violation demonstrates a problem that requires
 remedial action as to Company policies and procedures. If a
 violation has been reported to the Audit Committee or another
 committee of the Board, that committee shall be responsible
 for determining appropriate remedial or corrective actions.
 Such corrective action may include providing revised public
 disclosure, retraining Company employees, modifying Company
 policies and procedures, improving monitoring of compliance
 under existing procedures and other action necessary to detect
 similar non-compliant conduct and prevent it from occurring in
 the future. Such corrective action shall be documented, as
 appropriate.

8. PUBLICATION OF THE CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS; AMENDMENTS AND
WAIVERS OF THE CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS

 The most current version of this Code will be posted and maintained on
AXT's website. Any substantive amendment or waiver of this Code for executive
officers or directors may be made only after approval by a committee comprised
of a majority of AXT's independent directors and will be promptly disclosed to
shareholders.
