 PART I ITEM 1. 
 BUSINESS. Overview We provide design and implementation software that enables chip designers to
reduce the time it takes to design and produce complex integrated circuits used in the communications, computing, consumer electronics, networking and semiconductor industries. Our products are used in all major phases of the chip development cycle,
from initial design through physical implementation. An
important technical foundation of our software products is our patented FixedTiming methodology, which allows our customers to reduce the number of iterations that are often required in conventional integrated circuit design processes. Our single
data model architecture is a key enabler for this methodology and for our ability to deliver automated signal integrity detection and correction. It contains logical and physical information about the design and is resident in core memory during
execution, which makes it possible to analyze the design and make rapid tradeoff decisions during the physical design process. Our software products enable chip designers to meet critical time-to-market objectives, improve chip performance and handle chip designs involving
millions of components. Blast Create enables logic designers to visualize, evaluate and improve code quality, design constraints, testability and analysis. Blast Create, Blast Fusion and Blast Fusion APX combine into one integrated chip design flow
what traditionally had been separate logic design and physical design processes. This integrated flow significantly reduces timing closure iterations, allowing our customers to accelerate the time it takes to design and produce deep submicron
integrated circuits. Blast Plan enables hierarchical planning and partitioning of a design into blocks that can be designed separately and later combined into a complex chip or system-on-a-chip. Blast Noise detects and corrects signal interference,
or crosstalk, in physical designs. Blast Rail is a correct-by-construction rail design solution that is integrated with our design implementation flow. We provide consulting, training and services to help our customers more rapidly adopt our technology. We also provide post-contract support, or
maintenance, for our products. Technology Our patented FixedTiming methodology and single data model architecture are
the technical foundation of our Blast Fusion and Blast Chip Products. FixedTiming Methodology Our patented
FixedTiming methodology allows us to reduce the timing closure iterations that are often required between the front-end and back-end processes in conventional integrated circuit design flows. These timing closure iterations are caused by the fact
that the final circuit timing cannot be accurately calculated until the physical layout is completed. In deep submicron integrated circuits, timing performance is primarily determined by the physical layout of the wiring that connects the logic
gates to achieve the desired circuit functionality. Timing that is estimated during the front-end process is often not realized in the final layout, and the design team must iterate between the front-end and back-end processes modifying the design
in an attempt to reach the desired timing performance. Since each timing closure iteration can add one or more weeks to the design cycle, the time it takes to design and produce an integrated circuit can be severely impacted. Our FixedTiming methodology is designed to predict circuit speeds prior to
detailed physical design. We then use a series of design refinements during physical design to achieve a final timing that is very close to the predicted circuit speed. This approach reduces the need for timing closure iterations that exist in
conventional flows and can significantly reduce the time it takes to design and produce deep submicron integrated circuits.

Table of Contents 

 There are several differences between the conventional approach to integrated circuit design and our
FixedTiming methodology. In the conventional flow, synthesis is used to transform a computer program description of the desired circuit functionality into a circuit-level description, or netlist, that is comprised of gates from a semiconductor
manufacturer s library. A gate is a basic building block that performs a specific logic function. Gates are typically available in different sizes, or drive strengths, in the library. Larger gates are required to drive large loads, which are
caused by long wires or wires that are connected to the inputs of many other gates. Smaller gates are used to drive smaller loads. For a given wire, the larger the size of the gate, the shorter the signal delay through the gate and the wire that it
is driving. The job of the synthesis tool is to produce a netlist that delivers the desired circuit functionality and meets the required circuit timing. The synthesis tool produces this netlist without knowing what the final layout will look like.
Since the synthesis tool must determine which size gates to choose from the library, it must either rely on statistical estimates of the wire loads or perform a coarse placement of the gates to build estimates of what the wiring might look like. In
both of these cases, the estimates often do not correlate well with the actual loads presented by the wires in the final layout. Following synthesis, the gates specified in the netlist are placed in the layout. If the actual load on a given gate is larger than the load that was
estimated during synthesis, the delay will be longer than was predicted by synthesis. If the particular gate and load are critical to the performance of the integrated circuit, this will limit the operating speed of the integrated circuit and force
the design team into timing closure iterations. Typically, there are many of these critical paths on a complex integrated circuit that must be addressed. Our FixedTiming methodology recognizes that wire loads cannot be accurately estimated prior to layout. Because of this, we do not choose gate sizes during
the synthesis process. Instead we rely on the use of placeholder gates, called SuperCells, that we create automatically by analyzing the vendor s library. Each SuperCell is just like a gate from the library, but we assume that its size is
completely flexible. Therefore only one SuperCell is required for each logic function in the library, rather than the collection of gates of different sizes that are required in the conventional approach. Before beginning physical layout, we apply our optimization technology to
determine and set the delays that each gate and its load must have in order to meet the desired circuit speed. During placement, we use the SuperCells instead of the actual gates in the library. As the design progresses and we gain more information
about the location and length of the wires, we continuously adjust the size of each SuperCell to keep the circuit delay as constant as possible. We increase the size of a SuperCell as the load on it increases and decrease it in size as the load
decreases. As a result, we develop an overall circuit that is well balanced electrically, since each gate is sized optimally for the wire load that it is driving. This often results in layouts that are more compact and use less power than layouts
derived using the conventional approach. Once we have determined the final placement for each gate, we replace each SuperCell in the layout with the closest matching size gate in the semiconductor vendor s library. Using this approach, we are
able to reduce the timing closure iterations that often occur in conventional integrated circuit design approaches.

In addition to helping
us reduce timing closure iterations, we believe SuperCells enable faster and higher capacity synthesis. In conventional synthesis, the tool optimizes the circuit using library cells. Because a given logical function may be represented in the library
by a collection of different gate sizes, the synthesis tool must try every permutation of gate size during optimization. If the circuit is large, the number of permutations becomes very large, which negatively impacts run times and memory usage and
puts a practical limit on capacity. Since the SuperCell concept has only one gate per logical function, the optimization search space can be much smaller. As a result, run times are significantly improved and the capacity of the system is much
larger. Running on a standard engineering workstation, our system has a capacity of up to five million gates, an order of magnitude improvement over existing systems. Single Data Model Architecture Our single data model architecture is a key enabler for our FixedTiming methodology as well as our ability to deliver
automated signal integrity detection and correction. This architecture also forms the basis for our Diamond SI verification product. We believe we are the only electronic design automation vendor that offers a complete integrated circuit design
implementation flow based on a single data model. The single data model contains all of the logical and physical information about the design and is resident in core memory during execution. The various functional elements of our software such as
the implementation engines for synthesis, placement and routing, and our analysis software for timing, delay extraction and signal integrity all operate directly on this data model. Because the data model is concurrently available to all of the
engines and analysis software, it makes it possible to analyze the design and make rapid tradeoff decisions during the physical design process. During optimization and placement, for example, our system continuously adjusts the sizes of SuperCells
in the design as more accurate information about the layout is obtained from the data model. Additionally, our implementation software can instantly access our analysis software and continuously check for signal integrity problems during layout and
take steps to avoid them. Existing approaches force the designer to 
 
 4 

Table of Contents 

perform signal integrity analysis after the layout is completed. Problems that are found then must be manually corrected, which may also affect timing
closure and cause further iterations. Conventional electronic
design automation flows are typically based on a collection of software programs that have their own associated data models. Data sharing and communications between software tools are accomplished either through file interfaces or through the
establishment of a common database. If a common database is used, then each tool communicates with the database through a programming interface. For example, a software tool that is requested to send information to the common database must extract
the data from its own data model, translate it into a form usable by the common database and then call on the programming interface to write the information to the database. Similarly, the software tool that requested the data must obtain the
information from the common database through the programming interface, translate it into the format of its local data model and re-build the data model before the data can be used. The multiple data model approach has several limitations. It
results in inefficient use of memory because the design data is replicated in various forms in memory. There are also capacity limitations due to the inefficient use of memory. In addition, there are performance limitations because the process of
sharing data among software tools requires the use of a programming interface and the rebuilding of the data models each time that data is exchanged. Our single data model is designed to overcome these limitations. Memory is used more efficiently, capacity is higher, and performance is faster than in
conventional systems because there is only one copy of the design data in memory. This eliminates the need for cumbersome data translations or reading and writing of data through a programming interface. Products Blast Fusion is our flagship product that provides significant advantages over traditional back-end design software. Our
Blast Chip product broadens the capabilities of Blast Fusion by adding front-end synthesis capability. In the front-end process, the chip design is conceptualized and written as a register transfer level computer program, or Register Transfer Level RTL file, that describes the required functionality of the chip. We also offer Blast Noise, our product that detects and corrects noise and other electrical problems in deep submicron chips, as a separate product to be used with Blast
Chip and Blast Fusion. Blast Chip was discontinued in 2003 and its capabilities are now largely available in our Blast Create product, announced in April 2003.

 Similar to the conventional design flow, our design flow starts by reading in technology libraries and
constraint files. The following diagram illustrates our integrated design flow and where our products fit within this design flow. 

 Blast Fusion, first shipped
in April 1999, is our physical design software that shortens the time it takes to design and produce deep submicron integrated circuits. The Blast Fusion flow starts by reading in the netlist, target library and design constraints. The netlist is
optimized for circuit performance taking into account placement information that specifies the location of the gates in the chip layout. At the conclusion of this step, Blast Fusion generates a report that predicts the final timing performance that
is achievable in the completed chip layout. In the final step, detailed physical design, Blast Fusion generates the final chip layout by performing the routing of wires that are needed to connect the gates into the desired circuit configuration and
meet the timing performance requirements. Blast Fusion is
intended for use by chip design teams and other groups whose responsibility it is to take a design from netlist to completed chip layout. In the conventional Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC design flow, front-end designers
use synthesis software to translate and optimize their RTL files into a netlist that is then handed off to the ASIC or semiconductor vendor or separate layout design group for physical design using Blast Fusion. Sales of Blast Fusion accounts for
the majority of our revenue. Blast Chip, first shipped
in May 2000, extends the capabilities of Blast Fusion by adding RTL synthesis to the flow. At the beginning of the design flow, Blast Chip reads and synthesizes the RTL files that describe the desired functionality of the design. After this step,
the design flow is identical to the Blast Fusion flow. Blast Chip is intended for use by system design teams, chip design teams and other groups whose responsibility it is to take a design from concept to completed chip layout. This bundle was later
defined in fiscal 2003, to be the two major component pieces of this flow, Blast Create for logic design and Blast Fusion for physical design.

 Blast Noise, first shipped in September 2000, is our noise detection and correction product.
Interference, or noise from wires in close proximity to each other, can decrease chip performance or cause chip failure, particularly at .18 micron and below. Blast Noise works with Blast Fusion and Blast Chip to actively detect potential noise
problems and correct them during the physical design process. Blast Plan, first shipped in September 2001, delivers hierarchical design planning capabilities for use in implementing complex integrated circuit and system-on-chip designs. In a hierarchical design methodology, a chip design is
partitioned into blocks that are designed and implemented individually and then later assembled to create the entire chip. Blast Plan works with Blast Fusion and Blast Chip to streamline the hierarchical planning and design of large chips and
system-on-chips within a single environment. Diamond SI,
 first shipped in January 2002, is our stand-alone system for post-layout signal integrity verification and is based in part on technology obtained through our merger with Moscape, Inc. The initial release of Diamond SI focuses on accurate
crosstalk noise analysis. Future releases of Diamond SI are planned to also address signal electromigration and voltage drop. Diamond SI is suitable for use with either Magma or non-Magma chip design flows. New Products Blast Create is a key component of Magma s RTL-to-GDSII IC design solution. It enables logic designers to
synthesize, visualize, evaluate and improve the quality of their RTL code, design constraints, testability requirements and floorplan by building and analyzing a flat silicon virtual prototype that portrays the design in silicon. The physical
netlist generated by Blast Create provides a clean handoff between RTL designer and layout engineer, eliminating back-to-front iterations necessary for timing closure in conventional flows. Blast Rail provides IC designers with integrated power analysis and
planning, voltage-drop analysis, voltage-drop-induced delay analysis, and electromigration analysis on rail wires and vias. This enables designers to maintain power integrity in their designs. Blast Rail is fully integrated with Magma s
RTL-to-GDSII implementation flow to enable a correct-by-construction rail design solution. Services We provide
consulting, training and chip design services to help our customers more rapidly adopt our technology. Design services include assisting our customers on complex chip design challenges and providing services ranging from the design and
implementation of specific blocks to complete chip designs, including the delivery of the final chip layout, ready for release to manufacturing. We also provide post-contract support, or maintenance, for our products. Customers We license our software products to semiconductor manufacturers and electronic products companies around the world. Our
costumers include Broadcom, Infineon, NEC, Texas Instruments, Toshiba and Vitesse. In fiscal 2003, NEC and Toshiba each accounted for at least 10 of our total revenue and together accounted for 30 of our total revenue. Product Backlog For fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 we had approximately 180 million and 121 million in backlog, respectively. We define backlog as non-cancelable
contractual commitments by our customers, through purchase orders or contracts that have no contingencies other than our performance. We expect that we will ultimately be able to recognize this backlog as revenue. However, if a customer defaults and
fails to pay amounts owed, we 
 
 7 

Table of Contents 

may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog. In the current economic environment it is possible that customers from whom we expect to derive
revenue from backlog will default or that the level of defaults will increase. Any material payment default by our customers could reduce the amount of backlog we recognize as revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations. Revenue by Geographic Areas
 We generated 39 of our total revenue from sales outside
the United States for fiscal 2003, compared to 22 in fiscal 2002. Additional disclosure regarding financial information on geographic areas is included in Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
 Sales and Marketing We license our products primarily through a direct sales force focused
primarily on the industry leaders in the communications, computing, consumer electronics, networking and semiconductor industries. We have North American sales offices in California, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and
Canada. Internationally, we have European offices in Belgium, Germany, and the United Kingdom, an office in Israel and Asian offices in Japan, Korea, India and Taiwan. Our direct sales force is supported by a larger group of field application
engineers that work closely with the customers technical chip design professionals. As of March 31, 2003, we had 147 employees in our marketing, sales and technical sales support organizations. We intend to continue to expand our sales and field application engineering personnel on a worldwide basis.
 Competition The electronic design automation industry is highly competitive and
characterized by technological change, evolving standards, and price erosion. Major competitive factors in the market we address include technical innovation, product features and performance, level of integration, reliability, price, total system
cost, reduction in design cycle time, customer support and reputation. We currently compete with companies that hold dominant shares in the electronic design automation market. In particular, Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and Synopsys, Inc. are continuing to broaden their product lines to provide an integrated
design flow. Each of these companies has a longer operating history and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources, as well as greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases than we do. These companies also have
established relationships with our current and potential customers and can devote substantial resources aimed at preventing us from establishing or enhancing our customer relationships. Our competitors are better able to offer aggressive discounts
on their products, a practice that they often employ. Our competitors offer a more comprehensive range of products than we do; for example, we do not offer logic simulation, formal verification, full-feature custom layout editing, analog or mixed
signal products, which can sometimes be an impediment to our winning a particular customer order. In addition, our industry has traditionally viewed acquisitions as an effective strategy for growth in products and market share and our
competitors greater cash resources and higher market capitalization may give them a relative advantage over us in buying companies with promising new chip design products or companies that may be too large for us to acquire without a strain on
our resources. Examples of acquisitions by our competitors include Synopsys acquisition of Avant! and Cadence s acquisition of Silicon Perspectives, Inc. and Get2Chip. Further consolidation in the electronic design automation market could
result in an increasingly competitive environment. Competitive pressures may prevent us from obtaining market share or require us to reduce the price of products and services, which could harm our business. To execute our business strategy
successfully, we must continue to increase our sales worldwide. If we fail to do so in a timely manner or at all, we may not be able to gain market share and our business and operating results could suffer.

Table of Contents 

 Also, a variety of small companies continue to emerge, developing and introducing new products. Any of
these companies could become a significant competitor in the future. We also compete with the internal chip design automation development groups of our existing and potential customers. Therefore, these customers may not require, or may be reluctant
to purchase, products offered by independent vendors. Our
competitors may develop or acquire new products or technologies that have the potential to replace our existing or new product offerings. The introduction of these new or additional products by competitors may cause potential customers to defer
purchases of our products. If we fail to compete successfully, we will not gain market share and our business will fail. Research and Development We devote a substantial portion of our resources to developing new products and enhancing our existing products, conducting product testing and quality
assurance testing, improving our core technology and strengthening our technological expertise in the electronic design automation market. Our research and development expenditures for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 were 18.7 million, 18.2 million and
 20.6 million, respectively. There have not been any customer-sponsored research activities since the inception of the Company. As of March 31, 2003, our research and development group consisted of 90 employees. We have engineering centers in California, Texas and the Netherlands.
Our engineers are focused in the areas of product development, advanced research, product engineering and design services. Our product development group develops our common core technology and is responsible for ensuring that each product fits into
this common architecture. Our advanced research group works independently from our product development group to assess and develop new technologies to meet the evolving needs of integrated circuit design automation. Our product engineering group is
primarily focused on product releases and customization. Our design services group is specifically focused on, and assists in completing, customer designs for commercial applications. Intellectual Property Currently, we have eight issued patents in the United States. We also have eight U.S. patent applications pending before the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. Of these patent applications, one was recently allowed by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, we also have pursued patent protection in some foreign (non-U.S.) jurisdictions. Specifically, we have pending non-U.S. patent
applications that are based on certain of the corresponding U.S. patents and patent applications. We also have two issued patents in Taiwan. Patent protection affords only limited protection for our technology. The term of patent protection is 20
years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application. Our patents will expire on various dates between April 2018 and April 2019. We do not know if our patent applications or any future patent application will result in a patent
being issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at all, or whether any patents we may receive will be challenged or invalidated. Rights that may be granted under our patent applications that may issue in the future may not provide us
competitive advantages. Further, patent protection in foreign jurisdictions where we may need this protection may be limited or unavailable. It is difficult to monitor unauthorized use of technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as
fully as in the United States. In addition, our competitors may independently develop technology similar to ours. We will continue to assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent and other intellectual property protections for those aspects of
our technology that we believe constitute innovations providing significant competitive advantages. Our success depends in part upon our rights in proprietary software technology. We have patent applications pending for some of our proprietary software
technology. We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark and contractual protection to establish and protect our proprietary rights that are not protected by

patents, and we enter into confidentiality agreements with those of our employees and consultants involved in product development. We routinely require our
employees, customers and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements before we will disclose any sensitive aspects of our products, technology or business plans. We require employees to agree to surrender
to us any proprietary information, inventions or other intellectual property they generate or come to possess while employed by us. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights through confidentiality and license agreements, unauthorized
parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. These precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights, trademarks and similar proprietary rights. Many of our
contracts contain provisions indemnifying our customers from third party intellectual property infringement claims. In addition, other parties may assert infringement claims against us. Although we have not received notice of any alleged
infringement, our products may infringe issued patents that may relate to our products. In addition, because patent applications in the United States are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued, applications may have been filed which
relate to our software products. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third
parties. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming and could divert management s attention away from running our business. This litigation could also require us to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty
or license agreements. These royalty or license agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, in the event of a successful claim of infringement. Our failure to develop non-infringing technology or license the
proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business. Employees
 As of March 31, 2003, we had 270 full-time employees,
including 90 in research and development, 147 in sales and marketing and 33 in general and administrative. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relations with our employees are good. Corporate Information We were incorporated in Delaware in 1997. Our principal executive offices are located at 2 Results Way, Cupertino,
California 95014 and our telephone number is (408) 864-2000. Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the ticker symbol LAVA. Our Web site address is www.magma-da.com. The information in our Web site is not incorporated
by reference into this annual report. ITEM 2. 
 PROPERTIES. Our corporate
headquarters are located in Cupertino, California, where we occupy approximately 42,000 square feet under a lease expiring in December 2003. We have North American sales offices in California, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas,
Washington and Canada. Internationally, we have European offices in Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands; offices in Israel and Asian offices in Japan, Korea, India and Taiwan. We believe our current facilities are adequate to
support our current and near-term operations. However, if we need additional space, adequate space may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. ITEM 3. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. On February 6,
2003, we entered into a definitive agreement to settle a lawsuit initially filed in Santa Clara County, California Superior Court in August of 2001 by Prolific, Inc. The plaintiff filed two amended complaints during the course of the litigation. The
second amended complaint, which was filed in September 2002 and was pending prior to the settlement agreement, alleged breach of contract, concealment, undisclosed conflict of

interest, promissory fraud and misrepresentation arising out of an OEM distribution agreement. The plaintiff s second amended complaint sought damages
of 14.7 million, as well as other damages from any gains, profits and advantages lost and punitive damages. The settlement agreement provides that we make two installment payments in the aggregate amount of 1.85 million. The first payment of 0.925 million was
made in February 2003 and the second payment of 0.925 million will be made in July 2003. The settlement is included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Approximately 0.925 is accrued as of
March 31, 2003. Other than payment of the settlement amount, there are no continuing obligations by the parties to each other. We may be subject to various other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. ITEM 4.

 As of June 18, 2003,
there were approximately 483 holders of record (not including beneficial holders of stock held in street names) of our common stock. Dividend Policy We have not declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We expect to
retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Our Board of Directors will determine future dividends, if any. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities Under the terms of a Purchase Agreement dated May 16, 2003, we sold 150 million of our Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes due May 15, 2008 to
Credit Suisse First Boston LLC and UBS Warburg LLC. The issuance and sale of the notes and the subsequent offering of the notes by the initial purchasers were exempt from the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended by
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. We sold the notes for cash. The aggregate offering price was 150 million and our net proceeds were 145.3 million. The notes will mature on May 15, 2008 and are convertible on or before the maturity date into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of
 22.86 per share, subject to adjustment for certain events. This is equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately 43.7445 shares per 1,000 principal amount of notes. The notes will not accrete interest. Fees paid to the initial purchasers of
 4.5 million have been classified as debt discount. We will accrete these fees using an effective interest rate of 0.6 over the term of the notes. ITEM 6. 
 SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The
following selected consolidated financial data for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999 has been derived from our audited financial statements. This data includes the accounts of Magma and its wholly-owned and

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation section should be read in
conjunction with Selected Consolidated Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and results appearing elsewhere in this report. Throughout the Management s Discussion section, we make forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can often identify these and other forward looking statements by terms such as becoming, may, will, should, 
 predicts , potential, continue, anticipates, believes, estimates, seeks, expects, plans, intends, or using negative of such words,
or comparable terminology. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, and we have based these expectations on our beliefs and assumptions, such expectations may prove to be incorrect. Our
actual results of operations and financial performance could differ significantly from those expressed in or implied by our forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:
increasing competition in the electronic design automation market; the impact of the economic recession; the impact of SARS on business activities in Asia; effects that terrorist activities or events in the Middle East may have on Magma, its
customers and industry; any delay of customer orders or failure of customers to renew licenses; weaker-than-anticipated sales of Magma s products and services; weakness in the semiconductor or electronic systems industries; the ability to
successfully manage Magma s expanding operations; the ability to attract and retain the key management and technical personnel needed to operate Magma successfully; the ability to continue to deliver competitive products to customers to help
them get their products to market; and changes in accounting rules. Overview We provide design and implementation
software that enables chip designers to reduce the time it takes to design and produce complex integrated circuits used in the communications, computing, consumer electronics, networking and semiconductor industries. Our products are used in all
major phases of the chip development cycle, from initial design through physical implementation. An important technical foundation of our software products is our patented FixedTiming methodology, which allows our customers to reduce iterations that
are often required in conventional integrated circuit design processes. Our single data model architecture is a key enabler for this methodology and for our ability to deliver automated signal integrity detection and correction. It contains logical
and physical information about the design and is resident in core memory during execution, which makes it possible to analyze the design and make rapid tradeoff decisions during the physical design process. Our software products enable chip designers to meet critical time-to-market
objectives, improve chip performance and handle chip designs involving millions of components. Blast Create enables logic designers to visualize, evaluate and improve code quality, design constraints, testability and analysis. Blast Create, Blast
Fusion and Blast Fusion APX combine into one integrated chip design flow what traditionally had been separate logic design and physical design processes. Our integrated flow significantly reduces timing closure iterations, allowing our customers to
accelerate the time it takes to design and produce deep submicron integrated circuits. 
 
 15

Blast Plan enables hierarchical planning and partitioning of a design into blocks that can be designed separately and later combined into a complex chip or
system-on-a-chip. Blast Noise detects and corrects signal interference, or crosstalk, in physical designs. Blast Rail is a correct-by-construction rail design solution that is integrated with our design implementation flow. We provide consulting, training and services to help our customers more
rapidly adopt our technology. Design services include assisting our customers in the utilization of our products for complex chip design challenges. We also provide post-contract support, or maintenance, for our products. We license our software products to semiconductor manufacturers and
electronic products companies around the world. Our customers include Broadcom, Infineon, NEC, Texas Instruments, Toshiba and Vitesse. NEC and Toshiba each accounted for at least 10 of revenue, and together accounted for approximately 30 of
revenue, in fiscal 2003. We were incorporated in Delaware in
1997. Our principal executive offices are located at 2 Results Way, Cupertino, California 95014 and our telephone number is (408) 864-2000. In the second quarter of fiscal 2003, we transferred a number of research and development personnel who previously performed a combination of research and
development and customer service activities to our service organization if their activities are limited to providing customer service. Accordingly, we have recorded their expenses into cost of sales. On May 14, 2003, we repurchased 209,753 shares of common stock from Roy
Jewell, Magma s President and Chief Operating Officer, for an aggregate purchase price of 3,565,805, or 17.00 per share, which was the closing sale price of the common stock on that date, and Mr. Jewell repaid his indebtedness to us in the
same amount. On that date, we also granted Mr. Jewell an option to purchase 297,393 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 7.00 per share, vesting monthly through March 5, 2005. In connection with the grant of the option, we expect to
recognize approximately 3.0 million of deferred stock-based compensation over the 22-month vesting period of the option. On May 22, 2003, we issued 150.0 million principal amount of our Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes due May 15, 2008 (the Notes resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately 145.3 million. The Notes do not bear coupon interest and are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of 22.86 per share, for an aggregate of 6,561,680 shares. The
Notes are subordinated to our existing and future senior indebtedness and effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. Magma may not redeem the Notes prior to their maturity date. Magma paid approximately
 4.5 million in fees to the initial purchasers of the Notes, which will be accounted for as debt discount and approximately 0.2 million for debt issuance costs. The shares issuable on the conversion of Notes will be included in fully
diluted shares outstanding under the as-if-converted method of accounting for purposes of our diluted earnings per share calculation. In connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock at a price of 18.00 per share
for a cash payment of approximately 20.0 million from one of the initial purchasers of the Notes and those shares were retired as of May 30, 2003. We also entered into an arrangement with Credit Suisse First Boston International CSFB
International) that is intended to limit potential dilution resulting from the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Notes. Under this arrangement, which was consummated contemporaneously with the issuance of the Notes, CSFB
International agreed to sell to Magma, for 22.86 per share, up to 6,561,680 shares of our common stock to cover our obligation to issue shares upon conversion of the Notes. In addition, we issued CSFB International a warrant to purchase up to
6,561,675 shares of common stock for a purchase price of 31.50 per share. Purchases and sales under this arrangement may be made only upon expiration of the Notes or their earlier conversion (to the extent therof). Our net cost incurred in
connection with this arrangement was approximately 20.3 million.

 On June 10, 2003, we entered into an agreement to acquire Aplus Technologies Inc. for a combination of
cash and shares of common stock, including up to approximately 4.5 million in cash and up to 1,079,420 shares of our common stock, for an aggregate value of approximately 22.3 million. Approximately 28 of the aggregate purchase consideration will
be payable at closing of the acquisition, which is expected to occur in the quarter ending September 30, 2003. The remaining 72 of the purchase consideration is payable pursuant to an earnout arrangement, under which 7 will be payable based upon
Aplus Technologies bookings in fiscal 2004, 35 will be payable upon completion of certain technology milestones, and 30 will be payable based on operating income targets no later than March 31, 2005. Upon completion of the milestones, we will
recognize additional purchase price equal to the fair value of the cash paid and stock issued to Aplus shareholders on the date the milestones are achieved. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparing these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, and investments. Our estimates are based on historical experience
and on various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with Statement of Position SOP 97-2, as modified by SOP 98-9, which generally requires revenue earned on
software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products, upgrades, enhancements, maintenance, installation and training to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements. The fair value of an
element must be based on evidence that is specific to the vendor. If evidence of fair value does not exist for all elements of a license agreement and maintenance is the only undelivered element, then all revenue for the license arrangement is
recognized over the term of the agreement. If evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements, then revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method,
the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred until the delivery of the element and the remaining portion of the license fee is recognized as revenue. 
 License revenue We derive license revenue primarily from our design and implementation software and, to a much lesser extent, from our analysis and verification products.
We license our products under time-based and perpetual licenses. We recognize license revenue after the execution of a license agreement and the delivery of the product to the customer, provided that there are no uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance, fees are fixed or determinable,
collectibility is probable and there are no remaining obligations other than maintenance. For licenses where we have vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, or VSOE, for maintenance, we recognize license revenue using the residual method.
For these licenses, license revenue is recognized in the period in which the license agreement is executed assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. For licenses where we have no VSOE for maintenance, we recognize license revenue
ratably over the maintenance period, or if extended payment terms exist, based on the lower of amounts due and payable or ratably over the contract period.

Table of Contents 

 For transactions in which we bundle maintenance for the entire license term into a time-based license
agreement, no VSOE of fair value exists for each element of the arrangement. For these agreements, where the only undelivered element is maintenance, we recognize revenue ratably over the contract term. If an arrangement involves extended payment
terms that is, where less than 80 is due in one year from the contract date we recognize revenue to the extent of the lesser of the portion of the amount presently due and payable or the ratable portion of the entire fee. For our perpetual licenses and some time-based license arrangements, we
unbundle maintenance, by including maintenance for only the first year of the license term, with maintenance renewable by the customer at the rate stated in their agreements with us. In these unbundled licenses, the aggregate renewal period is
greater than or equal to the initial maintenance period. The stated rate for maintenance renewal in these contracts is VSOE of the fair value of maintenance in both our unbundled time-based and perpetual licenses. In the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003, we changed our business practice for pricing of maintenance renewals from a fixed percentage of annual list price to a fixed percentage of the annual net license fee. We believe these new pricing policies better reflect the underlying
economics of our software license agreements as we enter into larger scale license arrangements with our customers, which include substantial discounts from our list prices. Where the only undelivered element is maintenance, we recognize license
revenue using the residual method. If an arrangement involves extended payment terms, revenue recognized using the residual method is limited to amounts due and payable. Services revenue We derive services revenue primarily from consulting and training for our software products and from maintenance fees for our products. Most of our
license agreements include maintenance, generally for a one-year period, renewable annually. Services revenue from maintenance arrangements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance term. Because we have VSOE of fair value for
consulting and training services, revenue is recognized as these services are delivered or completed. Allowance for doubtful accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after
considering the size of the accounts receivable balance, each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer. We review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate using
the factors described above. We also monitor our accounts receivable for concentration to any one customer, industry or geographic region. To date our receivables have not had any particular concentrations that, if not collected, would have a significant impact on our operating income (loss).
The allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate, but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future. Investments We invest in debt and equity of privately held technology companies for business and strategic purposes. These companies are
typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial losses in the near-term. Therefore, these companies may never become publicly traded. Even if they do, an active trading market for their securities may never develop
and we may never realize any return on these investments. Further, if these companies are not successful, we could incur charges related to write-downs or write-offs of these investments. 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 We review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts based on
information requested from these privately held companies on at least a quarterly basis. Assessing each investment s carrying value requires significant judgment by management. If we determine that an other-than- temporary decline in fair value
exists in a strategic investment, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related expense in other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations. During fiscal year 2003, we determined that the decline in value of certain strategic investments was other-than-temporary
and recorded write-downs of these investments totaling 573,000. During fiscal 2002 and 2001 we recorded no investment write-downs. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109. We assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable
income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. We consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance.
However, adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is greater or less than the amount we have recorded. Valuation of Long-Lived Intangible Assets As we acquire intangible assets through acquisitions, we will review long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,
 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Asset whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances include, but are not
limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the
operations of the acquired business or use of an asset.

Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2003
and 2002 Revenue Revenue increased from 46.4 million in fiscal 2002 to 75.1 million in
fiscal 2003 due to the increases in both license and service revenue. Of the 75.1 million of revenue recognized during fiscal 2003, approximately 63.6 million is license revenue. The increase in revenue is due to sales to new customers, which
increased by more than 100 from the prior year, proliferation to additional design group designers in existing customers and the additions of new products. Our revenue consists of perpetual, bundled and unbundled time-based license agreements.
Revenue for bundled time-based licenses is generally recognized over the contract period while revenue from unbundled time-based and perpetual licenses are generally recognized at the beginning of the contract period. PCS for unbundled time-based
and perpetual licenses is recognized over the contract period. Certain significant contracts with extended payment terms entered into in recent quarters provide for payments, which are weighted towards the latter part of the contract term.
Accordingly, if the payment terms are extended, the revenue from these contracts is recognized as amounts become due and payable. Revenue recognized under these arrangements will be higher in the latter part of the contract term. Our ability to
recognize revenue in the future on contracts with extended payment terms will be subject to the customer s continuing credit worthiness. Although we plan to enter into both bundled and unbundled time-based license agreements and perpetual
license

agreements in the future, we expect to derive the majority of our revenue in the foreseeable future from unbundled time-based license agreements. 
 License revenue License revenue increased 66.5 , from 38.2 million in fiscal 2002 to 63.6
million in fiscal 2003. For fiscal 2003, the increase was primarily due to increased license revenue from our design and implementation software products, specifically from the introduction of Blast Fusion APX as well as from existing products, such
as Blast Fusion, Blast Noise and to a lesser extent from Blast Chip. For the quarter ended September 30, 2001, we began to recognize revenue from perpetual and unbundled time-based license agreements using the residual method under SOP 98-9 which
revenue recognition is accelerated. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we changed our revenue model for maintenance from a fixed percentage of list price to a percentage of the net license fee. We believe this methodology for recording maintenance
is substantive and better reflects the underlying economics as the company enters into larger scale license arrangements with our customers. We expect license revenue to continue to grow in absolute dollars during fiscal 2004. Services revenue Services revenue increased 40.2 , from 8.2 million in fiscal 2002 to 11.5
million in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to consulting services provided to licensees of our design and implementation software products. Although we intend to continue to offer these consulting services, we expect consulting service
revenue as a percent of total revenue to remain flat. Cost of Revenue
 Cost of revenue consists primarily of cost of license
revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of consulting services for our design and implementation software products and amortization of technology acquired. Cost of revenue consists primarily of salary and related costs for engineers associated with
technical services, including quality assurance, and cost of engineers associated with post-contract customer support, consulting services, and amortization of acquired technology. To date, the cost of service revenue for analysis and verification
products has been insignificant. Cost of revenue increased in absolute dollars from 8.3 million or 18 of revenue in fiscal 2002 to 11.5 million or 15 of revenue in fiscal 2003. The increase is primarily due to costs associated with additional
support required by our expanding customer base combined with costs related to increased design services. The cost of sales relating to design services increased as a result of increased services revenue. In addition, we transferred the costs
associated with all research and development employees who work in design services to cost of sales at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2003 because such employees activities were revised and now only perform work on customer related
activities. We expect cost of sales to decline as a percentage of revenue due to the emphasis on higher margin software products. Operating Expenses Research and development During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, we transferred the costs associated with all research and development employees who work in design services to
cost of sales because such employees will only perform work on customer related activities. Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries, bonuses and benefits of engineering personnel, depreciation of engineering equipment, and
outside engineering services from contractors and consultants as we continue to invest in our technology. Research and development expense increased in absolute dollars from 18.2 million or 39 of revenue in fiscal 2002 to 18.7 million or 25 of
revenue in fiscal 2003. The fiscal 2003 increase of 0.5 million was attributed to an increase in travel expense of 0.3 million, payroll related expenses of 3.5 million due to an increase in headcount, and outside services of consultants of 0.5
million. These increases were offset by 3.8 million of costs transferred to cost of sales. These costs were associated with a number of research and development personnel who previously performed a 
 
 21 

Table of Contents 

combination of research and development and services activities for our services organization. Their activities were changed limiting them to providing
services only. Development costs incurred in the research and development of new technology and enhancements to existing technology are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility in the form of a working model has been established. To
date, we have not capitalized any costs for our software development as technological feasibility is established concurrently with the general release of the product. Although we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute
dollars and that these expenses will fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue, our objective is to reduce research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue over time. Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries, sales commissions, bonuses, benefits and related costs of sales and marketing personnel,
tradeshows and other marketing activities. Sales and marketing expense increased from 22.9 million or 49 of revenue in fiscal 2002 to 25.7 million or 34 of revenue in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to increases in payroll related
expenses of 2.9 million resulting from headcount increases to support the sales plan, advertising expense of 0.3 million, third party sales representative commissions of 1.0 million resulting from growth outside the United States, principally in
Asia, travel expense of 0.6 million and office related expense of 0.5 million. In addition, an increase of 0.9 million related to the change in business focus of the field application engineers toward sales support, from customer design services
charged to cost of sales in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of 3.3 million in commission expense resulting from a change in the compensation plan, 0.1 million in industry tradeshow related expenses. For fiscal
year 2004, the Company is changing its sales compensation plan such the commissions earned on fiscal year 2004 orders will be equivalent to payments made. Payments will be spread on a ratable basis over two to six quarters depending on the dollar
amount of an individual order. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars in connection with the anticipated expansion of our customer base and the number and amount of our license agreements. . Although we expect sales
and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars and that these expenses will fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue, our objective is to reduce sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue over time. General and administrative General and administrative expense consists of salaries, bonuses, benefits
and related costs of finance and administrative personnel and outside service expenses including legal, accounting and recruiting services. General and administrative expense increased 78 from 6.0 million or 13 of revenue in fiscal 2002 to
 10.7 million or 14 of revenue in fiscal 2003. Of the net increase of 4.7 million, 1.9 million was related to the settlement with Prolific, Inc. Other increases include outside services of 1.2 million primarily from legal and accounting
services, insurance expense of 0.4 million, bad debt expense of 0.6 million, travel expenses of 0.1, office related expenses of 0.2 million and payroll related expenses of 0.3 million. Although we expect general and administrative expense to
increase in absolute dollars and that these expenses will fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue, our objective is to reduce general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue over time. Stock-based compensation Stock-based compensation expense consists of the amortization of deferred
stock-based compensation resulting from the grant of stock options at exercise prices less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the grant date for officers and employees and the fair value of the stock options granted to consultants
and other non-employees. The options granted to officers and employees generally vest over four years, with 25 vesting after one year and the balance vesting ratably over the remaining 36 months. Stock-based compensation declined 29 , to 4.8
million or 7 of revenue in fiscal 2003 from 6.8 million or 15 of revenue in fiscal 2002. For the year ended March 31, 2003, stock-based compensation included 4.3 million related to employees, of which 1.2 million was associated with our asset
purchase of VeraTest, which occurred in fiscal 2003 and 0.5 million expense related to consultant options.

 Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was 1.3 million in fiscal 2003 and (13.8) million in fiscal 2002. Interest income increased
from 1.0 million in fiscal 2002 to 1.8 million in fiscal 2003 due to a change in the investment policy to include long-term investments beginning in the fourth quarter and more funds being available for investment on average for the year ended
March 31, 2003. Interest and other expense decreased from 14.8 million in fiscal 2002 to 0.6 million in fiscal 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to a non-cash charge of 14.6 million related to the 25 million subordinated
convertible promissory notes issued in July and August 2001. Such charges will not be incurred in future periods since the promissory notes were automatically converted into common stock on the completion of our initial public offering in November
2001. For the year ended March 31, 2003, we had an other-than-temporary decline in fair value of 0.6 million related to two of our strategic investments. Income Taxes Prior to fiscal year 2003, we have incurred net losses since inception for federal and state tax purposes and have not recognized any tax benefit. We are
in a net deferred tax asset position, which has been fully reserved. We will continue to provide a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets until it becomes more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. The
increase of income taxes of 0.9 million between the years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 is primarily due to foreign tax expenses and U.S. federal alternative minimum tax. As of March 31, 2003, we had approximately 85.0 million of federal and 26.0 million of state net operating loss
carry-forwards to offset future taxable income. The federal net operating loss carry-forwards expire on various dates from 2019 through 2021. The state net operating loss carry-forwards expire on various dates from 2006 through 2013. Utilization of
net operating losses and credits is subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net
operating losses and credits before utilization. Fiscal Years Ended March
31, 2002 and 2001 Revenue Revenue increased from 11.8 million in fiscal 2001 to 46.4 million in
fiscal 2002. Of the 46.4 million of revenue recognized during fiscal 2002, approximately 38.2 million is license revenue. While to date we have focused primarily on time-based license agreements on which revenue has been recognized ratably, we
also began to enter into perpetual licenses and unbundled time-based license agreements during the quarter ended September 30, 2001. For the year ended March 31, 2002, revenue from our ratable time-based licenses accounted for approximately 77 of
our total revenue, and revenue from our perpetual and our unbundled time-based license agreements accounted for approximately 23 of our total revenue. License revenue License revenue increased from 11.3 million in fiscal 2001 to 38.2 million in fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to an increase in license
revenue from our design and implementation software products, specifically from Blast Fusion and to a lesser extent from Blast Chip, which was first shipped in May 2000. In addition, beginning in the quarter ended September 30, 2001, we began to
recognize revenue under perpetual and unbundled time-based license agreements using the residual method under which revenue is recognized more rapidly. For the year ended March 31, 2002, 7.2 million and 3.2 million, respectively, were derived from
perpetual licenses and unbundled time-based license agreements using the residual method.

 Services revenue Services revenue increased from 0.6 million in fiscal 2001 to 8.2 million in fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due
to consulting services provided to licensees of our design and implementation software products. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue increased from 5.8 million or 49 of revenue in fiscal 2001 to 8.3 million or 18 of revenue in fiscal 2002. This increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to costs associated with additional support required by our
expanding customer base combined with costs related to increased design services. Operating Expenses Research and
development Research and development expense decreased
from 20.6 million or 174 of revenue in fiscal 2001 to 18.2 million or 39 of revenue in fiscal 2002. This decrease was primarily due to reductions of 0.9 million in outside service expense, 1.0 million in payroll related expenses, and 0.3
million in travel expenses. Sales and marketing
 Sales and marketing expense increased from 21.6 million
or 182 of revenue in fiscal 2001 to 22.9 million or 49 of revenue in fiscal 2002. The increase was primarily due to an increase in commission expense of 3.6 million. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of 0.2 million in
industry tradeshow related expenses, a reduction of 1.5 million in distribution commission expense which includes a 725,000 credit associated with the termination of a distribution agreement, and reductions in travel and outside services.
 General and administrative General and administrative expense decreased from 7.2 million or 61 of
revenue in fiscal 2001 to 6.0 million or 13 of revenue in fiscal 2002. Of the net decrease of 1.2 million, outside services decreased by 0.8 million, payroll related expenses decreased by 0.5 million, and facility and support costs
applicable to general and administration decreased by 0.2 million. These costs were partially offset by increases of 0.2 million in insurance expense and 0.1 million in bad debt expense. Amortization of stock based compensation Amortization of stock-based compensation was 6.8 million or 15 of revenue
in fiscal 2002 and 3.7 million or 32 of revenue in fiscal 2001. As of March 31, 2002, we had recorded cumulative deferred stock-based compensation of approximately 21.0 million from the grant of stock options to officers, employees and
consultants. As of March 31, 2002, deferred stock-based compensation was 7.2 million. Other Income (Expense), Net Other
income (expense), net was (13.8) million in fiscal 2002 and 1.2 million in fiscal 2001. Interest income decreased from 1.4 million to 1.0 million in fiscal 2002 due to significantly lower market interest rates from high-grade investments and
less funds being available for investment on average for the year ended March 31, 2002. Other income (expense) increased from 232,000 in fiscal 2001 to 14.8 million in fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily attributable to a non-cash charge
of 14.6 million related to the 25 million subordinated convertible promissory notes issued in July and August 2001.

 Income Taxes The increase of income taxes of 150,000 between the years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001 is primarily due to increases in foreign income taxes.
 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of March 31, 2003, working capital was 69.0 million compared to 84.0
million as of March 31, 2002. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2003 were 67.8 million compared to 91.9 million as of March 31, 2002. Net cash provided by operating activities was 3.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2003, compared to 12.5 million used
for the year ended March 31, 2002. For the year ended March 31, 2003 net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income of 3.1 million and non-cash items of 4.9 million of depreciation and amortization, 4.8 million of
amortization of stock-based compensation, 0.6 million of provision for doubtful accounts, and 0.6 million related to loss on write-down of investments. These increases were offset by changes in accounts receivable, prepaids and other current
assets, accounts payable, deferred revenue, accrued expenses, other assets, other long-term liabilities and accounts payable. For the year ended March 31, 2002 significant non-cash related adjustments included 11.8 million interest expense related
to the beneficial conversion feature of our subordinated convertible promissory notes sold in July and August 2001, 2.2 million amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and 0.6 million accrued interest, which were subsequently converted
into shares of our common stock, as well as, related to such promissory notes. In addition, other non-cash related adjustments include amortization of stock-based compensation of 6.8 million and depreciation and amortization of 4.4 million.
 Net cash used in investing activities was 21.7 million for
the year ended March 31, 2003, compared to 17.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2002. Of the cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2003, 28.9 million was used for purchase of long-term investments, 3.2 million was used for
purchase of property and equipment and 3.1 million was used for purchase of short-term investments, which was offset by the net sale of short-term investments of 13.5 million. For fiscal 2002, 13.9 million was for the purchase of short-term and
other investments and 3.3 million for purchases of property and equipment. Cash provided by financing activities was 5.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2003, compared to 93.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2002. Cash provided for the year ended March 31, 2003, was primarily due
to proceeds from issuance of common stock of 4.9 million. For the year ended March 31, 2002, cash provided was primarily related to the 67.4 million of net proceeds from our initial public offering combined with 24.8 million proceeds from the
issuance of subordinated notes and warrants. As of March 31,
2003, our principal source of liquidity consisted of 95.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our
anticipated operating and working capital expenditure requirements in the ordinary course of business for at least the next 12 months. If we require additional capital resources to grow our business internally or to acquire complementary
technologies and businesses at any time in the future, we may use cash or need to sell additional equity or debt securities. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in more dilution to our existing stockholders.
Financing arrangements may not be available to us, or may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. As of March 31, 2003, our principal commitment consisted of operating leases, the future amount of which was 2.4 million through fiscal 2006 for office
facilities. Although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures, we anticipate a substantial increase in our capital expenditures and lease commitments with our anticipated growth in operations, infrastructure, and personnel.

On May 22, 2003, we
issued 150.0 million principal amount of our Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes due May 15, 2008 (the Notes resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately 145.3 million. The Notes do not bear coupon interest and are
convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of 22.86 per share, for an aggregate of approximately 6.56 million shares. The Notes are subordinated to our existing and future senior indebtedness and effectively
subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. Magma may not redeem the Notes prior to their maturity date. Magma paid approximately 4.5 million for debt discount and approximately 200,000 for debt issuance costs.
 Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 On April 1, 2002 we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets. While SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121, Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of , it retains many of the fundamental provisions of SFAS 121. SFAS 144 also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions APB 30 ), for the disposal of a
segment of a business. However, SFAS 144 retains the requirement of APB 30 to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of (by sale, abandonment, or in a
distribution to owners) or is classified as held for sale. SFAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company s adoption of SFAS 144 did not have a material effect
on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2002, the
FASB issued SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities , which provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities. Those activities can include
eliminating or reducing product lines, terminating employees and contracts, and relocating plant facilities and personnel. The provisions of SFAS 146 will not supersede the accounting requirements for costs to restructure operations acquired in a
business combination. Under SFAS 146, companies are required to record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value as opposed to being recognized at the date
of an entities commitment to an exit plan under EITF No. 94-3. The new requirements are effective prospectively for exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company adopted this standard beginning January 1, 2003 and the
adoption of SFAS 146 did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB, issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123
to require disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The annual disclosure provisions are effective for
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of this standard in fiscal 2003 and the adoption of SFAS 148 did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

 In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. For guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, a liability shall be recognized for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the
guarantee. The disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual financial statements for periods ending after December 15, 2002. See Note 7 for disclosures required by FIN 45. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material effect on the
Company s consolidated financial statements. In January
2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51. The effective date of Interpretation No. 46 is the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003 for
interests in variable interest entities acquired before February 1, 2003 and immediately to interests in variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS issued Interpretation No. 46;
effective beginning on July 1, 2003, to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. On May 15, 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150 Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and
Equity. The statement requires issuer to classify as liabilities (or assets in some circumstances) three classes of freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer. Generally, the statement is effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period after June 15, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating whether the adoption of SFAS No. 150 will have a material effect
on its consolidated financial statements. FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR
BUSINESS AND FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Our business faces many risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the
events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.
 We were incorporated in April 1997 and introduced our
first principal software product, Blast Fusion, in April 1999. Our business model is still emerging, and the revenue and income potential of our business and market is unproven. We have a limited history of generating revenue from our software
products. As a result of our short operating history, we have limited financial data that can be used to evaluate our business. Our software products represent a new approach to the challenges presented in the electronic design automation market,
which to date has been dominated by established companies with longer operating histories. Key markets within the electronic design automation industry may fail to adopt our proprietary technologies and software products. Any evaluation of our
business and our prospects must be considered in light of our limited operating history and the risks and uncertainties often encountered by relatively young companies. We have a history of losses prior to fiscal 2003 and had an accumulated deficit of approximately 118.5 million as of March 31,
2003; if we do not increase profitability, our public stock-trading price would be likely to decline. We had an accumulated deficit of approximately 118.5 million as of March 31, 2003. Although we achieved profitability in fiscal 2003, we incurred losses
in prior years. If we incur new losses, or do not increase profitability at a level expected by securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock is likely to decline. If we incur net losses, we may not be able to maintain or
increase our number of employees or our investment in capital equipment, sales, marketing, and research and development programs, and we may not be able to continue to operate.

 Our quarterly results are difficult to predict, and if we miss quarterly financial expectations, our stock price could
decline. Our quarterly revenue and operating results are
difficult to predict, and fluctuate from quarter to quarter. It is likely that our operating results in some periods will be below investor expectations. If this happens, the market price of our common stock is likely to decline. Fluctuations in our
future quarterly operating results may be caused by many factors, including: 

size and timing of customer orders, which are received unevenly and unpredictably throughout a fiscal year; 

the mix of products licensed and types of license agreements; 

our ability to recognize revenue in a given quarter; 

timing of customer license payments; 

time-based license agreements with graduated payment schedules that reflect phased deployment of our software and lower relative payments in the first years;

the relative mix of time-based licenses bundled with maintenance, unbundled time-based license agreements and perpetual license agreements, each of which has different revenue
recognition practices; 

the relative mix of our license and services revenues; 

our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers; 

changes in our pricing and discounting practices and licensing terms and those of our competitors; 

changes in the level of our operating expenses, including increases in incentive compensation payments that may be associated with future revenue growth; 

changes in the interpretation of the authoritative literature under which we recognize revenue; 

the timing of product releases or upgrades by us or our competitors; and 

the integration, by us or our competitors, of newly-developed or acquired products. Customer payment defaults may cause us to be unable to recognize revenue from backlog and may have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations. As of
March 31, 2003, we had approximately 180.5 million in backlog, which we define as non-cancelable contractual commitments by our customers, through purchase orders or contracts that have no contingencies other than our performance. We expect that we
will ultimately be able to recognize this backlog as revenue. However, if a customer defaults and fails to pay amounts owed, we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog. In the current economic environment it is possible that
customers from whom we expect to derive revenue from backlog will default or that the level of defaults will increase. Any material payment default by our customers could reduce the amount of backlog we recognize as revenue and could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our
lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle, and the large size of some orders, makes it difficult for us to forecast revenue and increases the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations, which could harm our stock price. Customers for our software products typically commit significant resources
to evaluate available software. The complexity of our products requires us to spend substantial time and effort to assist potential customers in evaluating our software and in benchmarking it against our competition. In addition, potential customers
may be limited in their current spending by existing time-based licenses with their legacy vendors. In these cases, customers delay a significant new commitment to our software until the term of the existing license has expired. Also, because our
products require a significant investment of time and cost by our customers, we must target 
 
 28 

Table of Contents 

those individuals within the customer s organization who are able to make these decisions on behalf of their companies. These individuals tend to be
senior management in an organization, typically at the vice president level. We may face difficulty identifying and establishing contact with such individuals. Even after initial acceptance, the negotiation and documentation processes can be
lengthy. Our sales cycle typically ranges between three and nine months, but can be longer. Any delay in completing sales in a particular quarter could cause our operating results to fall below expectations. We rely on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and our
revenue could decline due to delays of customer orders or the failure of existing customers to renew licenses or if we are unable to maintain or develop relationships with current or potential customers. Our business depends on sales to a small number of customers. In fiscal
2003, we had two customers that each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue and that together accounted for approximately 30 of our revenue. In fiscal 2002, we had two customers that each accounted for more than 10 of our revenue and that
together accounted for approximately 32 of our revenue. We
expect that we will continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If we fail to successfully sell our products and services to one or more customers in any
particular period, or a large customer purchases less of our products or services, defers orders, or fails to renew licenses, our business and operating results would be harmed. Most of our customers license our software under a time-based licensing agreement, with terms that typically vary from 15
months to 48 months. Most of our licensing agreements automatically expire at the end of the term unless the customer renews the license with us or purchases a perpetual license. If our customers do not renew their licenses, we may not be able to
maintain our current revenue or may not generate additional revenue. Some of our licensing agreements allow customers to terminate an agreement prior to its expiration under limited circumstances for example, if our products do not meet
specified performance requirements or goals. If these agreements are terminated prior to expiration or we are unable to collect under these agreements, our revenue may decline. Some contracts with extended payment terms provide for payments which are weighted toward the later part of the contract
term. Accordingly, as the payment terms are extended, the revenue from these contracts is not recognized evenly over the contract term, but is recognized as the lesser of the cumulative amounts due and payable or ratably for bundled agreements, and
as amounts become due and payable for unbundled agreements, at each period end. Revenue recognized under these arrangements will be higher in the later part of the contract term, which puts our revenue recognition in the future at greater risk of
the customer s continuing credit-worthiness. In addition, some of our customers have extended payment terms, which creates additional credit risk. We compete against companies that hold a large share of the electronic design automation market. If we cannot compete successfully, we will not gain market share.
 We currently compete with companies that hold dominant
shares in the electronic design automation market, such as Cadence and Synopsys. Each of these companies has a longer operating history and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do, as well as greater name
recognition and larger installed customer bases. Our competitors are better able to offer aggressive discounts on their products, a practice they often employ. Our competitors offer a more comprehensive range of products than we do; for example, we
do not offer logic simulation, formal verification, full-feature custom layout editing, analog or mixed signal products, which can sometimes be an impediment to our winning a particular customer order. In addition, our industry has traditionally
viewed acquisitions as an effective strategy for growth in products and market share and our competitors greater cash resources and higher market capitalization may give them a relative advantage over us in buying companies with promising new
chip design products or companies that may be too large for us to acquire without a strain on our resources. Examples of acquisitions by our competitors 
 
 29 

Table of Contents 

include Synopsys acquisition of Avant! and Cadence s acquisition of Get2Chip. Further consolidation in the electronic design automation market
could result in an increasingly competitive environment. Competitive pressures may prevent us from gaining market share, require us to reduce the price of products and services or cause us to lose existing customers, which could harm our business.
To execute our business strategy successfully, we must continue to increase our sales worldwide. If we fail to do so in a timely manner or at all, we may not be able to gain market share and our business and operating results could suffer.
 Also, a variety of small companies continue to emerge,
developing and introducing new products. Any of these companies could become a significant competitor in the future. We also compete with the internal chip design automation development groups of our existing and potential customers. Therefore,
these customers may not require, or may be reluctant to purchase, products offered by independent vendors. Our competitors may develop or acquire new products or technologies that have the potential to replace our existing or new product offerings. The
introduction of these new or additional products by competitors may cause potential customers to defer purchases of our products. If we fail to compete successfully, we will not gain market share and our business will fail. We may not be able to hire the number of qualified engineering personnel required for our
business, particularly field application engineering personnel, which would harm our ability to grow. We continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our growth strategy. Our success
depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified engineering personnel with experience in integrated circuit design. Specifically, we need to attract and retain field application engineers to work with our direct sales force to
technically qualify new sales opportunities and perform design work to demonstrate our products capabilities to customers during the benchmark evaluation process. Competition for qualified engineers is intense, particularly in Silicon Valley
where our headquarters are located. If we lose the services of a significant number of our engineers or we cannot hire additional engineers, we will be unable to increase our sales or implement or maintain our growth strategy. Because many of our current competitors have pre-existing relationships with our current
and potential customers, we might not be able to gain market share, which could harm our operations. Many of our competitors, including Cadence and Synopsys, have established relationships with our current and potential customers and can devote
substantial resources aimed at preventing us from establishing or enhancing our customer relationships. These existing relationships can make it difficult for us to obtain additional customers due to the substantial investment that these potential
customers have already made in their current design flows. If we are unable to gain market share due to these relationships with our potential customers, our operating results could be harmed. Our operating results will be significantly harmed if chip designers do not adopt Blast
Fusion and Blast Fusion APX. Blast Fusion and Blast
Fusion APX have accounted for a significant majority of our revenue since our inception and we believe that revenue from Blast Fusion and Blast Fusion APX and related products will account for most of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If
integrated circuit designers do not adopt Blast Fusion and Blast Fusion APX, our operating results will be significantly harmed. We must continue market penetration of Blast Fusion and Blast Fusion APX to achieve our growth strategy and financial
success. If the industries into which we sell our products experience
recession or other cyclical effects affecting our customers research and development budgets, our revenue would be likely to decline. Demand for our products is driven by new integrated circuit design projects. The demand from semiconductor and systems companies is uncertain and
difficult to predict. Slower growth in the semiconductor 
 
 30 

Table of Contents 

and systems industries, a reduced number of design starts, reduction of electronic design automation budgets or continued consolidation among our customers
would harm our business and financial condition. We have experienced slower growth in revenue than we anticipated as a result of the prolonged downturn and decreased spending by our customers in the semiconductor and systems industries. 
 The primary customers for our products are companies in the
communications, computing, consumer electronics, networking and semiconductor industries. Any significant downturn in our customers markets or in general economic conditions that results in the cutback of research and development budgets or
the delay of software purchases would be likely to result in lower demand for our products and services and could harm our business. For example, the United States economy, including the semiconductor industry, is currently experiencing a slowdown,
which has negatively impacted and may continue to impact our business and operating results. Terrorist attacks in the United States, the aftermath of war with Iraq and other worldwide events including in the Middle East have increased uncertainty in
the United States economy. If the economy continues to decline as a result of the economic, political and social turmoil, existing customers may delay their implementation of our software products and prospective customers may decide not to adopt
our software products, either of which could negatively impact our business and operating results. In addition, the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical. In recent years, some Asian countries have experienced significant economic
difficulties, including devaluation and instability, business failures and a depressed business environment. These difficulties triggered a significant downturn in the semiconductor market, resulting in reduced budgets for chip design tools, which,
in turn, negatively impacted us. We have experienced delayed orders and slower deployment of our products under new orders as a result of reduced budgets for chip design tools. In addition, the electronics industry has historically been subject to
seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in demand for its products, and this trend may continue in the future. These industry downturns have been, and may continue to be, characterized by diminished product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and
subsequent erosion of average selling prices. Difficulties in developing
and achieving market acceptance of new products and delays in planned release dates of our software products and upgrades may harm our business. To succeed, we will need to develop innovative new products. We may not have the financial resources necessary to fund all required future innovations.
Also, any revenue that we receive from enhancements or new generations of our proprietary software products may be less than the costs of development. If we cannot successfully develop and market new products, or if we fail to do so in a timely
manner, our reputation and our business would suffer. Our costs of customer
engagement and support are high, so our gross margin may decrease if we incur higher-than-expected costs associated with providing support services in the future or if we reduce our prices. Because of the complexity of our products, we typically incur high field
application engineering support costs to engage new customers and assist them in their evaluations of our products. If we fail to manage our customer engagement and support costs, our operating results could suffer. In addition, our gross margin may
decrease if we are unable to manage support costs associated with the mix of license and services revenue we generate or if we reduce prices in response to competitive pressure. Product defects could cause us to lose customers and revenue, or to incur unexpected expenses. Our products depend on complex software, both internally developed and
licensed from third parties. Our customers may use our products with other companies products, which also contain complex software. If our software does not meet our customers performance requirements, our customer relationships may
suffer. Also, a limited number of our contracts include specified ongoing performance criteria. If our products fail to meet these 
 
 31 

Table of Contents 

criteria, it may lead to termination of these agreements and loss of future revenue. Complex software often contains errors. Any failure or poor performance
of our software or the third-party software with which it is integrated could result in: 

delayed market acceptance of our software products; 

delays in product shipments; 

unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to identify the source of errors or to correct errors; 

damage to our reputation; 

delayed or lost revenue; and 

product liability claims. Our product functions are often critical to our customers, especially because of the resources our customers expend on the design and fabrication of
integrated circuits. Many of our licensing agreements contain provisions to provide a limited warranty, which provides the customer with a right of refund for the license fees if we are unable to correct errors reported during the warranty period.
If our contractual limitations are unenforceable in a particular jurisdiction or if we are exposed to product liability claims that are not covered by insurance, a successful claim could harm our business. We currently do not carry product liability
insurance. Much of our business is international, which exposes us to risks
inherent to doing business internationally that could harm our business. We also intend to expand our international operations. If our revenue from this expansion does not exceed the expenses associated with this expansion, our business and
operating results could suffer. We generated 39 of our
total revenue from sales outside North America for fiscal 2003, compared to 22 in fiscal 2002. While all of our international sales to date have been denominated in U.S. dollars, our international operating expenses have been denominated in foreign
currencies. As a result, a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies could increase the relative costs of our overseas operations, which could reduce our operating margins. The expansion of our international operations includes the maintenance of
sales offices in Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region. If our revenue from international operations does not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining our international operations, our business could suffer. Additional risks
we face in conducting business internationally include: 

difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations across different geographic areas; 

changes in currency exchange rates and controls; 

uncertainty regarding tax and regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions; 

the possible lack of financial and political stability in foreign countries, preventing overseas sales growth; 

the aftermath of war in Iraq; 

the effect of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, on business in the Asia-Pacific region; and 

the effects of terrorist attacks in the United States and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide. Future changes in accounting standards, specifically changes affecting revenue
recognition, could cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations. Future changes in accounting standards for interpretations thereof, specifically those changes affecting software revenue recognition, could require us to change our methods of revenue recognition. These changes 
 
 32 

Table of Contents 

could result in deferral of revenue recognized in current periods to subsequent periods or in accelerated recognition of deferred revenue to current periods,
each of which could cause shortfalls in meeting the expectations of investors and securities analysts. Our stock price could decline as a result of any shortfall. Future implementation of internal controls reporting and attestation requirements will
impose additional financial and administrative obligations on us that could adversely affect our results. Changes in effective tax rates could affect our results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following: 

earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are taxed at lower statutory rates as compared to the U.S. tax rate; 

an increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process technology; 

changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; or 

changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws. Our success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technology standards of the semiconductor industry. If we are unable to keep pace with
rapidly changing technology standards, our products could be rendered obsolete, which would cause our operating results to decline. The semiconductor industry has made significant technological advances. In particular, recent advances in deep sub-micron technology have required
electronic design automation companies to continuously develop or acquire new products and enhance existing products. The evolving nature of our industry could render our existing products and services obsolete. Our success will depend, in part, on
our ability to: 

enhance our existing products and services; 

develop and introduce new products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis that will keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards;

address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers; and 

acquire other companies that have complementary or innovative products. If we are unable, for technical, legal, financial or other reasons, to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or customer requirements,
our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. Because
competition for qualified personnel is intense in our industry, we may not be able to recruit necessary personnel, which could impact the development or sales of our products. Our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain senior management, sales, marketing and other key
personnel. Because of the intense competition for such personnel, it is possible that we will fail to retain key technical and managerial personnel. If we are unable to retain our existing personnel, or attract and train additional qualified
personnel, our growth may be limited due to our lack of capacity to develop and market our products. This could harm the market s perception of our business and our ability to achieve our business goals. Our success is highly dependent on the technical, sales, marketing and managerial
contributions of key individuals, and we may be unable to recruit and retain these personnel. We depend on our senior executives, and our research and development, sales and marketing personnel, who are critical to our business. We do not have
long-term employment agreements with our key employees, and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. If we lose the services of any of these key executives, our product development processes and sales efforts could be slowed. We
may also incur increased operating 
 
 33 

Table of Contents 

expenses and be required to divert the attention of other senior executives to search for their replacements. The integration of our new executives or any
new personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations. If we fail to maintain
competitive stock option packages for our employees, or if our stock price declines materially for a protracted period of time, we might have difficulty retaining our employees and our business may be harmed. In today s competitive technology industry, employment decisions of
highly skilled personnel are influenced by stock option packages, which offer incentives above traditional compensation only where there is a consistent, long-term upward trend over time of a company s stock price. If our stock price declines
due to market conditions, investors perceptions of the technology industry or managerial or performance problems we have, our stock option incentives may lose value to key employees, and we may lose these employees or be forced to grant
additional options to retain them. This in turn could result in: 

immediate and substantial dilution to investors resulting from the grant of additional options necessary to retain employees; and 

potential compensation charges against the company, which could negatively impact our operating results. In addition, if we are required to account for stock options as an operating expense, our net income would be reduced or net
losses increased. Accordingly, our financial results would be adversely affected, particularly relative to companies that grant fewer stock options. If we reduce our level of stock option grants, our ability to recruit and retain employees may be
adversely affected. If our sales force compensation arrangements are
designed poorly, we may lose sales personnel and resources. Designing an effective incentive compensation structure for our sales force is critical to our success. We have experimented, and continue to experiment, with different systems of sales force compensation. If our incentives are not well
designed, we may experience reduced revenue generation, and we may also lose the services of our more productive sales personnel, either of which would reduce our revenues or potential revenues. Fluctuations in our growth place a strain on our management systems and resources, and if
we fail to manage the pace of our growth our business could be harmed. Periods of growth followed by efforts to realign costs when revenue growth is slower than anticipated have placed a strain on our management, administrative and financial resources. For example, in the third quarter
of fiscal year 2003, we laid off 32 employees. Over time we have significantly expanded our operations in the United States and internationally, and we plan to continue to expand the geographic scope of our operations. To pace the growth of our
operations with the growth in our revenue, we must continue to improve administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls. Failure to improve our internal procedures and controls could result in a disruption of our operations
and harm to our business. If we are unable to manage our growth the execution of our business plan could be delayed. We may have difficulty assimilating technology, personnel and operations from acquisitions, and these difficulties may disrupt our business and divert
management s attention. We have made acquisitions
and we may continue to pursue acquisitions that we believe may complement our business. If we do acquire additional companies, the integration of the separate operations of our company and an acquisition partner may result in problems related to
integration of technology and management teams, either of which could divert management s attention from day-to-day operations. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, and we may not be able to retain key management,
technical and sales personnel after an acquisition. Our products incorporate software licensed from third parties, and if we lose or are unable to maintain any of these software licenses, our product shipments could be delayed or reduced.
 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 We use software, such as front-end language processing, license keying software and schematic viewing
software that we license from third parties. We have also licensed the rights to some technologies from various universities, including the Technical University of Eindhoven, Delft University and the University of California, Berkeley. These
third-party software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot maintain existing third-party technology licenses or enter into licenses for other existing or future technologies needed for
our products, we could be required to cease or delay product shipments while we seek to develop alternative technologies. If chip designers and manufacturers do not integrate our software into existing design flows, or if other software companies do not cooperate in working with us to
interface our products with their design flows, demand for our products may decrease. To implement our business strategy successfully, we must provide products that interface with the software of other electronic design automation software companies. Our competitors may not support our or our
customers efforts to integrate our products into their existing design flows. We must develop cooperative relationships with competitors so that they will work with us to integrate our software into a customer s design flow. Currently,
our software is designed to interface with the existing software of Cadence, Synopsys and others. If we are unable to convince customers to adopt our software products instead of those of competitors offering a broader set of products, or if we are
unable to convince other semiconductor companies to work with us to interface our software with theirs to meet the demands of chip designers and manufacturers, our business and operating results will suffer. We may not obtain sufficient patent protection, which could harm our competitive position
and increase our expenses. Our success and ability to
compete depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary technology. We currently have a few issued patents in the United States, particularly few in relation to our competitors. These legal protections afford only limited protection for our technology. In
addition, rights that may be granted under any patent application that may issue in the future may not provide competitive advantages to us. Further, patent protection in foreign jurisdictions where we may need this protection may be limited or
unavailable. It is possible that: 

our pending U.S. and non-U.S. patent applications may not be issued; 

competitors may design around our present or future issued patents or may develop competing non-infringing technologies; 

present and future issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary rights; and 

present and future issued patents could be successfully challenged for validity and enforceability. We believe the patent portfolios of our competitors are far larger than ours, and this may increase the risk that they may
sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent cross-licenses. We rely on trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights, and if these rights are not sufficiently
protected, it could harm our ability to compete and generate income. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses. Our ability to
compete and grow our business could suffer if these rights are not adequately protected. We seek to protect our source 
 
 35 

Table of Contents 

code for our software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws. We license our software pursuant to agreements, which
impose certain restrictions on the licensee s ability to utilize the software. We also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute
confidentiality agreements. Our proprietary rights may not be adequately protected because: 

laws and contractual restrictions in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies or deter others from developing similar technologies;

competitors may independently develop similar technologies and software code; 

for some of our trademarks, Federal U.S. trademark protection may be unavailable to us; 

our trademarks may not be protected or protectable in some foreign jurisdictions; 

the validity and scope of our U.S. and foreign trademarks could be successfully challenged; and 

policing unauthorized use of our products and trademarks is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and we may be unable to determine the extent of this unauthorized use.
 The laws of some countries in which we market
our products may offer little or no protection of our proprietary technologies. Reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our technologies without
paying us for it, which would harm our competitive position and market share. We may face intellectual property infringement or other claims against us or our customers that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights. Many of our contracts contain provisions in which we agree to indemnify our customers from third-party intellectual property
infringement claims. Other parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers, and our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. We have also acquired or may hereafter acquire
software as a result of our past or future acquisitions, and we may be subject to claims that such software infringes the intellectual property rights of third parties. If we become involved in litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights and
incur substantial unexpected operating costs. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming and could divert management s attention from our business. If there is a successful claim of infringement, we may be required to
develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business. Our products may infringe
third-party patents that may relate to our products. Also, we may be unaware of filed patent applications that relate to our software products. We believe the patent portfolios of our competitors are far larger than ours, and this may increase the
risk that they may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent cross-licenses. We may also become involved in litigation unrelated to intellectual property infringement claims. For example, in August 2001, a complaint was filed
against us alleging breach of contract, among other things. This litigation was recently settled. We may not be successful in defending other claims that may be made against us. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can result in substantial expense
and could divert the efforts of our management and technical personnel. Our
directors, executive officers and principal stockholders own a substantial portion of our common stock and this concentration of ownership may allow them to elect most of our directors and could delay or prevent a change in control of Magma.
 Our directors, executive officers and stockholders who
currently own over 5 of our common stock beneficially own a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders, if they vote 
 
 36

together, will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, they may be able to elect most of our directors,
delay or prevent a transaction in which stockholders might receive a premium over the market price for their shares or prevent changes in control or management. 
 Our stock price may decline significantly because of stock market fluctuations that affect the prices of technology stocks. A decline in our stock price could
result in securities class action litigation against us, that could divert management s attention and harm our business. The stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have adversely affected the market prices of common stock of technology
companies. These broad market fluctuations may reduce the market price of our common stock. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after periods of volatility in the market price of securities. We
may in the future be a target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources, which could harm our ability to execute our business plan. We may need additional capital in the future, but there is no assurance that funds would
be available on acceptable terms. In the future we may
need to raise additional capital in order to achieve growth or other business objectives. This financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us and may be dilutive to existing stockholders. If adequate funds are not
available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to expand, develop or enhance services or products, or respond to competitive pressures would be limited. Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware corporate law contain anti-takeover provisions which could delay or prevent a
change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. We could also adopt a stockholder rights plan, which could also delay or prevent a change in control. Delaware law, as well as our certificate of incorporation and bylaws,
contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if the change of control would be beneficial to the stockholders. These provisions could lower the price that future investors might be willing to
pay for shares of our common stock. These anti-takeover provisions: 

authorize the Board of Directors without prior stockholder approval to to create and issue preferred stock that can issued by increasing the number of outstanding shares and deter
or prevent a takeover attempt; 

prohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; 

establish a classified Board of Directors requiring that not all members of the board be elected at one time; 

prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates; 

limit the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and 

require advance notice for nominations for election to the Board of Directors and proposals that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. 
 In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the
terms of our stock option plans may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. That section generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for three years after
the date the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Also, our stock option plans include change-in- 
 
 37 

Table of Contents 

control provisions that allow us to grant options or stock purchase rights that will become vested immediately upon a change in control of us. The board of directors also has the power to adopt a stockholder rights plan,
which could delay or prevent a change in control even if the change in control appeared to be beneficial to stockholders. These plans, sometimes called poison pills, are sometimes criticized by institutional investors or their advisors
and could affect our rating by such investors or advisors. If the board were to adopt such a plan it might have the effect of reducing the price that new investors are willing to pay for shares of our common stock. We are subject to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
 We transact some portions of our business in various
foreign currencies. Accordingly, we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure is primarily related to operating expenses in the United Kingdom, Europe and Japan, which are denominated in the
respective local currencies. As of December 31, 2002, we had no hedging contracts outstanding. We do not currently use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses in the United Kingdom and Japan denominated in the respective local currency. We
assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis. The convertible notes we issued in May 2003 are debt obligations that must be repaid in cash in May 2008 if they are not converted into our common stock at an earlier date, which is unlikely to occur if the price
of our common stock does not exceed the conversion price. In May 2003, we issued 150 million principal amount of our zero coupon convertible notes due May 2008. We will be required to repay that principal amount in full in May 2008 unless the holders of those notes elect to convert them into our
common stock before the repayment date. The conversion price of the notes is 22.86 per share. If the price of our common stock does not rise above that level, conversion of the notes is unlikely and we would be required to repay the principal
amount of the notes in cash. There have been previous quarters in which we have experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors, which have had an immediate and significant adverse effect on
the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual
companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Because the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock, volatility or depressed prices for our common stock
could have a similar effect on the trading price of the notes. Hedging
transactions and other transactions may affect the value of our common stock and our convertible notes. We entered into hedging arrangements with Credit Suisse First Boston International at the time we issued our convertible notes, with the objective of
reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing common stock upon conversion of the notes. These hedging arrangements are likely to have caused Credit Suisse First Boston International and others to take positions in our common stock in secondary
market transactions or to enter into derivative transactions at or after the sale of the notes. Any market participants entering into hedging arrangements are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity
of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock or other securities, which may increase the volatility and reduce the market price of our common stock. Our convertible notes are subordinated and there are no financial covenants in the indenture. Our convertible notes are general unsecured obligations of Magma and are
subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness, which we may incur in the future. In the event of our 
 
 38 

Table of Contents 

bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, or upon acceleration of the notes due to an event of default under the indenture and in certain other events, our
assets will be available to pay obligations on the notes only after all senior indebtedness has been paid. As a result, there may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the outstanding notes. In addition, we will not
make any payments on the notes in the event of payment defaults or other specified defaults on our designated senior indebtedness. Neither we nor our subsidiaries are restricted under the indenture for the notes from incurring additional debt, including senior indebtedness. If we or
our subsidiaries incur additional debt or other liabilities, our ability to pay our obligations on the notes could be adversely affected. We expect that we and our subsidiaries from time to time will incur additional indebtedness and other
liabilities. We may be unable to meet the requirements under the indenture
to purchase our convertible notes upon a change in control. Upon a change in control, as to which is defined in the indenture to include some cash acquisitions and private company mergers, note holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes they hold. If a change in control were to
occur, we might not have enough funds to pay the purchase price for all tendered notes. Future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness might prohibit the redemption or repurchase of the notes and provide that a change in
control constitutes an event of default. If a change in control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing the notes, we could seek the consent of our lenders to purchase the notes or could attempt to refinance this debt. If we do not
obtain a consent, we could not purchase the notes. Our failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture, which might constitute a default under the terms of our other debt. In such circumstances, or if a
change in control would constitute an event of default under our senior indebtedness, the subordination provisions of the indenture would possibly limit or prohibit payments to note holders. Our obligation to offer to purchase the notes upon a
change in control would not necessarily afford note holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, merger or similar transaction involving us. ITEM 7A. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market
risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. This is accomplished by
investing in widely diversified short-term and long-term investments, consisting primarily of investment grade securities, substantially all of which mature within the next twenty-four months. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest
rates would result in an approximate 475,000 decline (less than 1 in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We transact some portions of our business in various foreign currencies. Accordingly, we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign
currency exchange rates. This exposure is primarily related to operating expenses in the United Kingdom and Japan, which are denominated in the respective local currency. As of March 31, 2003, we had no hedging contracts outstanding. We do not
currently use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses in the United Kingdom and Japan denominated in the respective local currency. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.

 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT The Board of Directors and Stockholders Magma
Design Automation, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Magma Design Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations, redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity (deficit), and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2003. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial statement schedule as listed in the Index to Consolidated
Financial Statements. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted
our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Magma Design Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

 MAGMA DESIGN AUTOMATION, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Years Ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 Note 1. The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The Company Magma Design Automation, Inc. (the Company or Magma ), a Delaware corporation, was incorporated on April 1, 1997. The Company
provides design and implementation software that enables chip designers to reduce the time it takes to design and produce complex integrated circuits used in the communications, computing, consumer electronics, networking and semiconductor
industries. The Company s Blast Fusion and Blast Chip products utilize a methodology for complex, deep submicron chip design that combines traditionally separate logical design and physical design processes into an integrated design flow. The
Company has licensed its flagship product, Blast Fusion, to major semiconductor companies and electronic products manufacturers in Asia, Europe, and the United States. Principles of consolidation 
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of estimates Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management periodically evaluates such
estimates and assumptions for continued reasonableness. Appropriate adjustments, if any, to the estimates used are made prospectively based upon such periodic evaluation. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2 ), as modified by SOP 98-9. SOP 97-2, as modified, generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving
multiple elements such as software products, upgrades, enhancements, post contract customer support PCS ), installation, and training to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements. The fair value of an
element must be based on evidence that is specific to the vendor. If evidence of fair value does not exist for all elements of a license agreement and PCS is the only undelivered element, then all revenue for the license agreement is recognized
ratably over the term of the agreement. If evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements, then revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, the
fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue. Revenue from licenses that include a right to specified upgrades is deferred until the upgrades are delivered. 
 Through June 30, 2001, the Company licensed its Blast Fusion and Blast
Chip products under time-based licenses. Starting in the quarter ended September 30, 2001, the Company began offering perpetual licenses on these products.

MAGMA DESIGN AUTOMATION, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
 Years Ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 
 For Blast Fusion and Blast Chip software products, the Company s standard license agreement
includes PCS for a specified period of time. Through June 30, 2001, the Company bundled PCS into its agreements for the entire license term; therefore, vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value did not exist for each element of the
arrangement. Accordingly, revenue from all license agreements entered into through June 30, 2001, has been recognized ratably over the contract term after delivery of the product to the customer, provided that there are no uncertainties surrounding
the product acceptance, fees are fixed or determinable, collectibility is probable, and the Company has no remaining obligations other than the delivery of PCS. If an arrangement involves extended payment terms, revenue is recognized to the extent
of the lesser of the portion of the fee presently due and payable or the ratable portion of the entire fee. The Company considers arrangements where less than 80 of the fee is due within one year of the agreement date to have extended payment
terms. Payments received from customers in advance of revenue being recognized are presented as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Also, in addition to continuing to offer time-based licenses bundled with PCS, beginning in the quarter ended December 31,
2001, for Blast Fusion and Blast Chip software products, the Company began offering time-based and perpetual licenses with PCS bundled for the first year of the license term. Thereafter, PCS can be renewed annually for an additional fee stated in
the agreement. The Company uses the respective PCS renewal rate as evidence of fair value of PCS; therefore, where the only undelivered element is PCS, license revenue from these contracts is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual
method, the fair value of PCS is recognized over the PCS term and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized after the execution of a license agreement and the delivery of the product to the customer, provided that there are no
uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance, fees are fixed or determinable, collectibility is probable, and the Company has no remaining obligations other than the delivery of PCS. If an agreement involves extended payment terms, revenue
recognized on the residual method is limited to amounts due and payable. License revenue is comprised of software licenses and PCS where the Company does not have vendor specific evidence of fair value of PCS. Service revenue is comprised of PCS on licenses where the Company has vendor
specific evidence of fair value of PCS, and consulting and training on all products. The Company has vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for consulting and training services. Therefore, revenue from such services is recognized when
delivered. Commission expense The Company recognizes sales commission expense as it is earned by
employees. In fiscal year 2002, a portion of the commission was earned upon the customer signing the license agreement, and the remaining portion was earned as cash payments are received over the term of the license. In fiscal year 2003, commissions
were earned when revenue was recognized. Commissions advanced to employees in excess of amounts earned which are considered recoverable are reflected as prepaid expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Net prepaid commission
totaled 0.6 and 0 at March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Unbilled receivables The Company considers
unbilled receivables to be revenue that has been recognized in the financial statements in advance of being invoiced to the customer. As of March 31, 2003 and March 31, 2002, unbilled receivables were approximately 6.8 million and 2.1 million,
respectively, and are included in accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets for each of these periods.

 Years Ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 
 Research and development expenses Research and development expenses are charged to expense as incurred.
 Capitalized software Costs incurred in connection with the development of software products are
accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed . Development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to
existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility in the form of a working model has been established. To date, the Company s software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of
technological feasibility, and accordingly no costs have been capitalized to date. Software included in property and equipment includes amounts paid for purchased software and customization services for software used internally which has been capitalized in accordance with SOP 98-1, Accounting
for Costs of Computer Software for Internal Use . Foreign currency The financial statements of
foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency of the subsidiary as the functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated at current rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, and all revenue
and expense items are translated using weighted-average exchange rates. At March 31, 2003, cumulative foreign currency translation loss is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet. At March 31, 2002,
cumulative foreign currency translation gains and losses were not significant. Cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments The Company invests its excess cash in money market accounts and debt securities and considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Investments with an original maturity at the time of purchase between three and twelve months are classified as short-term investments and investments that have a maturity date more than twelve months from the balance sheet date, are classified as
long-term investments. The Company accounts for investments in
accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities . These investments are classified as available for sale, and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or
losses excluded from net income or loss and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity (deficit) until realized. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments have not been material.

Concentration of
credit risk Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short and long-term investments and accounts receivable. The Company s cash equivalents, short and long-term generally consist of corporate bonds,
municipal obligations and money market funds with high quality financial institutions. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from product sales. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains
reserves for potential credit losses. Property and
equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
Equipment under capital lease is stated at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Depreciation of property and equipment is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally three to five
years. Equipment under capital lease and leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Impairment of long-lived assets In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ,
the Company reviews long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, for impairment whenever 
 
 51

 Years Ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 
 
 events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Under SFAS 144, an impairment loss would be
recognized for assets to be held and used when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is measured by the amount by
which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Strategic investments The Company invests in debt and equity of private companies as part of its business strategy. The investments are carried at cost and are included in
other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. If the Company determines that an other-than-temporary decline exists in the fair value of an investment, the Company writes down the investment to its fair value and records the related write-down as
an investment loss in other income (expense) in its consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended March 31, 2003, the Company wrote down two of its strategic investments by 573,000. At March 31, 2003 and 2002, the carrying value of the
strategic investments was 927,000 and 500,000, respectively. Trade accounts receivable Trade accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is Magma s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company s existing accounts receivable. The Company
determines the allowance based on historical write-off experience, current market trends and for larger accounts, the ability to pay outstanding balances. Magma continually reviews its allowances for collectibility. Past due balances over 90 days
and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectibility. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. Income taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. Restricted cash
 Included in other non-current assets on the condensed
consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2003 and March 31, 2002 is restricted cash of 517,000 and 564,000, respectively, to support letters of credit as security deposits on leased facilities. The deposits are required for the three-year and
five-year terms of the leases. Stock-based
compensation The Company accounts for employee
stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB Opinion No. 25 ). The Company s 
 
 52

MAGMA DESIGN AUTOMATION, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

 stock plans are described in Note 4. No employee stock-based compensation cost is reflected in net income related to options granted under those plans for
which the exercise price was equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Deferred compensation is recorded on the date of grant if the exercise price of the stock award is less than the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. Deferred compensation is expensed on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the stock award. SFAS 123 requires the disclosure of pro forma net loss as if the Company had adopted the fair value method for its stock-based compensation arrangements
for employees since the Company s inception. Had
compensation cost been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards consistent with the provisions of SFAS 123, the Company s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share would have been as follows (in thousands, except
per share data):

 On April 1, 2002 the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets. While SFAS 144 supersedes
SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of , it retains many of the fundamental provisions of SFAS 121. SFAS 144 also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions APB
30 ), for the disposal of a segment of a business. However, SFAS 144 retains the requirement of APB 30 to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of (by
sale, abandonment, or in a distribution to owners) or is classified as held for sale. SFAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company s adoption of SFAS 144 did
not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities , which provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities.
Those activities can include eliminating or reducing product lines, terminating employees and contracts, and relocating plant facilities and personnel. The provisions of SFAS 146 will not supersede the accounting requirements for costs to
restructure operations acquired in a business combination. Under SFAS 146, companies are required to record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value as
opposed to being recognized at the date of an entities

 commitment to an exit plan under EITF No. 94-3. The new requirements are effective prospectively for exit and disposal activities initiated after December
31, 2002. The Company adopted this standard beginning January 1, 2003 and the adoption of SFAS 146 did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB, issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of
the method used on reported results. The annual disclosure provisions are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of this standard in fiscal 2003 and the adoption of SFAS 148 did not
have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. For guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002, a liability shall be recognized for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual financial statements for periods ending after December 15,
2002. See Note 7 for disclosures required by FIN 45. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation
of ARB No. 51. The effective date of Interpretation No. 46 is the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003 for interests in variable interest entities acquired before February 1, 2003 and immediately to interests in variable interest
entities created after January 31, 2003. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS issued Interpretation No. 46; effective beginning on July 1, 2003, to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. On May 15, 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150 Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. The statement requires issuer to classify as liabilities (or assets in some circumstances) three classes of freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations
for the issuer. Generally, the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period after June 15, 2003. The Company is currently
evaluating whether the adoption of SFAS No. 150 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Note 2. Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with SFAS 128, Earnings per Share . Basic net loss
per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributed to common stockholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share gives effect to all
dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock subject to repurchase, stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method and redeemable convertible preferred stock using the as-if-converted method. The diluted
net income (loss) per share is the same as the basic net loss per share for the years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001 because potential common shares are not considered when their effect is antidilutive.

4. Stockholders Equity Stock incentive
plans 2001 Stock Incentive Plan The 2001 Stock Incentive Plan 2001 Plan was approved by the
stockholders in August 2001. Under the 2001 Plan, the Company may grant incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options to purchase common stock to employees, directors, advisors, and consultants. They may also be awarded restricted common
shares, stock appreciation rights SARs or unit awards Stock Units based on the value of the common stock. The initial number of shares of common stock issuable under the 2001 Plan was 2,000,000 shares, subject to
adjustment for certain changes in the Company s capital structure. Such shares may be authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares. As of January 1 of each year, commencing January 1, 2002, the aggregate number of options, restricted
awards, SARs, and Stock Units that may be awarded under the 2001 Plan will automatically increase by a number equal to the lesser of 6 of the total number of shares of common stock then outstanding, 6,000,000 shares of common stock, or any lesser
number as is determined by the Board of Directors. A committee of the Board of Directors determines the exercise price per share; however, the exercise price of an incentive stock option cannot be less than 100 of the fair market value of the
common stock on the option grant date, and the exercise price of a non-qualified stock option cannot be less than the par value of the common stock subject to such non-qualified stock options. As of March 31, 2003, the Company has reserved 6,015,021
shares of the Company s common stock for issuance pursuant to the 2001 Plan. 1997 and 1998 Stock Incentive Plans In the year ended March 31, 1998, the Company adopted the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan 1997 Plan ), and in the year ended March 31, 1999 the Company adopted the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan 1998

 (collectively, the Plans ). Under the Plans, the Company may grant options to purchase common stock to employees, directors, and consultants.
Shares that are subject to options that in the future expire, terminate or are cancelled or as to which options have not been granted under these plans will not be available for future option grants or issuance. Options granted under the Plans were
either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. The exercise price of incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options were no less than 100 and 85 , respectively, of the fair market value per share of the Company s
common stock on the grant date (110 of fair market value in certain instances), as determined by the Board of Directors. Pursuant to the Plans, the Board of Directors also had the authority to set the term of the options (no longer than ten years
from the date of grant, five years in certain instances). Under the terms of the Plans, the options become exercisable prior to vesting, and the Company has the right to repurchase such shares at their original purchase price if the optionee is
terminated from service prior to vesting. Such rights expire as the options vest over the vesting period, which is generally four years. As a result of the 2001 Option Plan becoming effective, no shares of the Company s common stock are available for future issuance under the 1997 and
1998 stock incentive plans. At March 31, 2003, 233,933 unvested shares with a weighted average exercise price per share of 6.755 had been exercised and were subject to the Company s repurchase rights. At March 31, 2002, 486,994 unvested
shares with a weighted average exercise price per share of 7.985 had been exercised and were subject to the Company s repurchase rights. In October 2001, the Company s President exercised options to purchase 428,570 shares of common stock at the exercise price of 10.50 per share by
executing a full recourse promissory note of approximately 4.5 million bearing interest of 5.5 per annum and due in March 2006. Terms of the note provided that if the President were still employed by the Company on any anniversary of his date
of hire after a liquidity event occurred or if he were terminated other than for cause before a liquidity event, up to 2,700,000 note principal and 373,000 related total interest to maturity would be forgiven. A liquidity event means a sale of the
Company or an initial public offering of the Company s common stock and the expiration of any lock-up period imposed by such a transaction that restricted the sale of the President s Shares. The forgivable portion of the note and related
interest was recorded as a reduction of notes receivable from stockholders and a charge to deferred compensation, which would be amortized to compensation expense over the five-year term of the note. As of March 31, 2003, approximately 1,131,000 of
principal and related accrued interest had been forgiven. The outstanding principal and accrued interest at March 31, 2003 totaled 3,702,000, of which 1,756,000 was subject to forgiveness. In November 2001, the Company s Vice President North America Sales
exercised options to purchase 85,713 shares of common stock at the exercise price of 10.50 per share by executing a full recourse promissory note of approximately 900,000 bearing interest of 5.5 per annum and due in March 2006. The provisions of
the note agreement allowed for forgiveness of 540,000 related to principal due under the note and 72,000 related total interest to maturity over the five-year term of the note. In March 2002, the Company forgave approximately 110,000 in principal
and interest. In September 2002, the Vice President-North America Sales resigned, and at the time of his resignation the outstanding balance in principal and interest of the note was approximately 829,000. In September 2002, the Company entered
into an agreement to repurchase 37,142 vested shares at a price of 10.98 for a total of approximately 408,000 by reducing the note balance by that amount. Pursuant to certain provisions in the standard option agreement with the Vice
President-North America Sales, the Company also repurchased 38,572 unvested shares at a price of 10.50 for approximately 405,000 by reducing the note balance by that amount. The remaining note balance of approximately 16,000 was offset by amounts
owed to the Vice President-North America Sales.

Options to consultants and other

Company granted options to purchase 43,120 shares, 109,209 shares and 22,840 shares, respectively, of common stock to consultants and other non-employees with weighted average exercise prices of approximately 11.250, 6.874 and 10.742,
respectively. The fair value of such options is calculated at the end of each reporting period through the applicable vesting date based upon the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the resulting expense is amortized based on the term of the
consulting agreement or service period. Included in amortization of stock-based compensation in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations was amortization related to consultants and other non-employees of 533,000, 742,000, and
 134,000, for the years ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Employee stock purchase plans The 2001
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 2001 Purchase Plan ), was established in November 2001. Employees, including officers and employee directors but excluding 5 or greater stockholders, are eligible to participate if they are employed for more
than 20 hours per week and five months in any calendar year. The 2001 Purchase Plan provided for a series of overlapping offering periods with a duration of 24 months, with new offering periods, except the first offering period, which commenced on
November 19, 2001, beginning in February, May, August and November of each year. The maximum number of shares a participant may purchase during a single offering period is 4,000 shares. The 2001 Purchase Plan allows employees to purchase common
stock through payroll deductions of up to 15 of their defined compensation. Such deductions will accumulate over a three-month accumulation period without interest. After such accumulation period, shares of common stock will be purchased at a price
equal to 85 of the fair market value per share of common stock on either the first day preceding the offering period or the last date of the accumulation period, whichever is less. As of March 31, 2003, a total of 1,907,194 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2001 Purchase
Plan and 548,008 shares of common stock have been issued. Starting with fiscal 2003, the number of shares reserved for issuance will be increased on the first day of each fiscal year through fiscal 2011 by the lesser of 3,000,000 shares, 3 of the
outstanding common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or such lesser number of shares as is determined by the Board of Directors.

 Warrants In September 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with a non-employee to cancel a warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company s common
stock. As a result of the cancellation, the Company recorded a reduction of amortization of stock-based compensation expense of approximately 144,000. In connection with the sale to an investor of Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock and a related strategic development agreement, the Company
issued warrants to purchase 40,317 shares of Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock at 7.441 per share in April 1999. These warrants were converted to 40,317 shares of warrants to purchase common stock in connection with the IPO. The
warrants to purchase common stock vest based on certain provisions of the development agreement, are exercisable after vesting, and expire in April 2004. Neither the investor nor the Company pursued initially or have current plans to pursue the
development agreement, and accordingly the Company has not ascribed any fair value to these warrants. As of March 31, 2003, these warrants remained unvested and outstanding. Note 5. Restructuring charge The Company incurred restructuring charges for the year ended March 31, 2003 in the amount of 727,000 related to employee
termination costs of 32 technical, sales, marketing and administrative employees. As of March 31, 2003, all 32 employees were terminated and the Company paid 642,000 in termination costs. As of March 31, 2003, 85,000 remained accrued relating to
termination costs and is included in accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company anticipates that the remaining termination costs will be substantially paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004.

6. Asset Purchase of VeraTest, Inc. On November 1, 2002, the Company completed an acquisition of VeraTest, Inc., a private California corporation VeraTest ), primarily for the purpose of acquiring VeraTest s chip design verification software. The Company previously acquired 18.0 of VeraTest, Inc. on April 10, 2002 for
 0.2 million, which was charged to research and development. On November 1, 2002, the Company acquired the remaining outstanding common stock held by certain shareholders for approximately 1.57 million in cash, including the cancellation of
indebtedness of 0.3 million of certain VeraTest stockholders to the Company. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset purchase. The purchase price was allocated to capitalized software. Under SFAS 86, amortization is based on the greater of the ratio of current
gross revenues of the related product to current and anticipated future gross revenues or on a straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life. As of March 31, 2003, the Company amortized 0.2 million of the value of the capitalized
software on a prorated straight-line basis and the remaining unamortized balance of 1.37 million is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2003.

milestones. Of these shares of common stock, 171,646 shares were placed in escrow and will be released upon completion of three milestone achievements: 20 for completion of the first milestone (no later than December 15, 2002), 40 for completion
of the second milestone (no later than September 15, 2003), and 40 for the completion of the third milestone (no later than September 15, 2004). The remaining 101,352 shares were issued pursuant to a restricted stock grant and will vest on the same
basis as the shares placed in escrow. The milestones are based upon testing and integration of certain current features, as well as the development of additional working features of the software tool. If it is determined that any milestone has not
been attained, the shares will be cancelled. The first milestone was completed on November 30, 2002. As of March 31, 2003, the Company recognized stock-based compensation in the amount of 1.2 million relating to the achievement of the first
milestone. Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies

County, California Superior Court in August of 2001 by Prolific, Inc. The plaintiff filed two amended complaints during the course of the litigation. The second amended complaint, which was filed in September 2002 and was pending prior to the
settlement agreement, alleged breach of contract, concealment, undisclosed conflict of interest, promissory fraud and misrepresentation arising out of an OEM distribution agreement. The plaintiff s second amended complaint sought damages of
 14.7 million, as well as other damages from any gains, profits and advantages lost and punitive damages. The settlement agreement provides that the Company make two installment payments in the aggregate amount of 1.85 million. The first payment of 0.925
million was made in February 2003 and the second payment of 0.925 million will be made in July 2003. The settlement is included as general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Approximately 0.925 is
accrued as of March 31, 2003. Other than payment of the settlement amount, there are no continuing obligations by the parties to each other. The Company may be subject to various other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.

 Years Ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 
 At March 31, 2003, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and California income
tax purposes of approximately 85.0 million and 26.0 million, respectively, available to reduce future income subject to income taxes. The federal net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2019 through 2021. The California net operating
loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2006 through 2013. The Company also has research credit carryforwards for federal and California tax purposes of approximately 3.2 million and 1.2 million, respectively, available to reduce future income
subject to income taxes. The federal research credit carryforward expires through 2022, and the California research credit carries forward indefinitely. The Company has established a valuation allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain. The net change in the
valuation allowance for the years ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was an increase of 1,755,000, 5,051,000 and 17,527,000, respectively. Approximately 491,000 of the valuation allowance at March 31, 2003 is attributable to employee stock option deductions, the benefit from which will be
allocated to additional paid-in capital when and if subsequently realized. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the California Conformity Act of 1987 impose restriction on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change as defined
in the Internal Revenue Code, Section 382. If an ownership change as defined by the Internal Revenue Code has occurred, the Company s ability to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to restriction pursuant
to these provisions. Note 9. Related Party
Transactions In fiscal 2003, Magma invested approximately
 1.4 million in two private companies. Both of these companies purchased software licenses from the Company during fiscal year 2003 and 2002. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized 403,000 and 1,471,000 in
revenue from these software licenses, respectively. In
September 2001, the Company entered into an agreement for software licenses with Raza Foundries, whose majority shareholder is a member of the Company s Board of Directors. Raza Foundries has an outstanding accounts receivable balance of
approximately 282,000, which has been fully been reserved. The Company believes collection is remote. In September 1999, Moscape entered into a sales and development agreement with a customer. In connection with Moscape s Series C redeemable
convertible preferred stock financing in November 1999, the customer purchased 94,373 shares of Moscape Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock for total cash consideration of 1.0 million. In fiscal 2002 and 2001, revenues of approximately
 80,000 and 623,000, respectively, were recognized from this customer, of which 401,000 in fiscal 2001 related to the sales and development agreement. There was no revenue recognized in fiscal 2003. In October 1999, the Company entered into a Product Distribution Agreement PDA ), which granted a distributor the right to sell the Company s products in Japan for a three-year period. In connection with the PDA, the Company sold approximately 10 of its stock of Magma Design Automation, KK Magma
KK ), its Japanese subsidiary, to the distributor. The distributor s interest in Magma KK was subject to both a call option whereby the Company can repurchase the stock and a put option whereby the distributor can require the Company to
repurchase the stock upon the termination of the PDA at the original purchase price plus interest compounded at 5 per annum. The original purchase price was 50 million Japanese Yen. Because of the put and call options, the Company accounted for the
sale of stock as a long-term liability in the accompanying

 consolidated financial statements. No portion of Magma KK s net loss has been allocated to the distributor. In June 2001, the Company repurchased all of
the shares of stock of Magma KK held by the distributor for 435,000, including 33,000 of accrued interest. In June 2001, the Company and the distributor agreed to terminate the PDA, pursuant to which the Company agreed to make a termination payment of 550,000
for unpaid commissions on the sales of software license agreements. As of March 31, 2002, the 550,000 termination payment has been paid in full. As a result of the termination, the Company recorded a reduction in commission expense of 725,000 for
the year ended March 31, 2002 for the excess of accrued commissions over the termination payment. Note 10. Employee Benefit Plan Effective April 1, 1997, the Company adopted a plan (the 401(k) Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The 401(k) Plan covers essentially all
employees. Eligible employees may make voluntary contributions to the 401(k) Plan up to 20 of their annual eligible compensation. The Company is permitted to make contributions to the 401(k) Plan as determined by the Board of Directors. The Company
has not made any contributions to the Plan. Note
11. Segment Information The
Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information , which requires the reporting of segment information using the management approach . Under this approach,
operating segments are identified in substantially the same manner as they are reported internally and used by the Company s chief operating decision maker CODM for purposes of evaluating performance and allocating resources.
Based on this approach, the Company has one reportable segment as the CODM reviews financial information on a basis consistent with that presented in the consolidated financial statements. Revenue from the United States, Europe, and Asia-Pacific region, which
includes Japan, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the People s Republic of China, was as follows (in thousands):

 Years Ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 
 Note 12. Subsequent Events On May 14, 2003, the Company repurchased 209,753 shares of its common stock
from the Company s President and Chief Operating Officer, for an aggregate purchase price of 3,565,805, or 17.00 per share, which was the closing sale price of the common stock on the date of the repurchase, and the President repaid his
indebtedness to the Company in the same amount. On that date, the Company also granted the President an option to purchase 297,393 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of 7.00 per share, vesting monthly through March 5, 2005. In
connection with the grant of the option, the Company expects to recognize approximately 3.0 million of deferred stock-based compensation over the 22-month vesting period of the option. On May 22, 2003, the Company issued 150.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated
Notes due May 15, 2008 (the Notes resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately 145.3 million. The Notes do not bear coupon interest and are convertible into the Company s common stock at an initial conversion price of
 22.86 per share, for an aggregate of 6,561,680 shares. The Notes are subordinated to the Company s existing and future senior indebtedness and effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company s
subsidiaries. The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to their maturity date. The Company paid approximately 4.5 million in fees to the initial purchasers of the Notes, which will be accounted for as debt discount and approximately 200,000 for
debt issuance costs. The shares issuable upon conversion of outstanding Notes will be included in fully diluted shares outstanding under the as-if-converted method of accounting for purposes in the Company s diluted earnings per
share calculation. In connection with the issuance and sale of
the Notes, the Company repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of its common stock from one of the initial purchasers of the notes at a price of 18.00 per share for a cash payment of approximately 20.0 million. Such shares have been retired
as of May 30, 2003. In connection with the Notes transaction,
the Company also entered into an arrangement with Credit Suisse First Boston International CSFB International) that was intended to limit potential dilution resulting from the issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of the Notes.
Under this arrangement, which was consummated contemporaneously with the issuance of the Notes, CSFB International agreed to sell to the Company, for 22.86 per share, up to 6,561,680 shares of the Company s common stock to cover the
Company s obligation to issue shares upon conversion of the Notes. In addition, the Company issued CSFB International a warrant to purchase up to 6,561,675 shares of common stock for a purchase price of 31.50 per share. Purchases and sales
under this arrangement may be made only upon expiration of the Notes or their earlier conversion (to the extent thereof). The Company s net cost incurred in connection with this arrangement was 20.3 million, which will be classified in
stockholders equity. On June 10, 2003, we entered into
an agreement to acquire Aplus Technologies Inc. for a combination of cash and shares of common stock, including up to approximately 4.5 million in cash and up to 1,079,420 shares of our common stock, for an aggregate value of approximately 22.3
million. Approximately 28 of the aggregate purchase consideration will be payable at closing of the acquisition, which is expected to occur in the quarter ending September 30, 2003. The remaining 72 of the purchase consideration is payable
pursuant to an earnout arrangement, under which 7 will be payable based upon Aplus Technologies bookings in fiscal 2004, 35 will be payable upon completion of certain technology milestones, and 30 will be payable based on operating income targets
no later than March 31, 2005. Upon completion of the milestones, the Company will recognize additional purchase price equal to the fair value of the cash paid and stock issued to Aplus shareholders on the date the milestones are achieved.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c)) together with our senior management team within 90 days of the filing date of this report, have concluded that there was a significant deficiency in the design and operation of our internal controls that adversely
affected our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data. However, the deficiency was not considered to be a material weakness under the standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The
deficiency related to our inability to complete our quarterly and year-end financial close process without adjustments proposed by our independent auditor. Such adjustments related to matters such as revenue recognition, accounts payable, accrued
liabilities, prepaid commissions and strategic investments. The deficiency did not affect our reported financial results. (b) Changes in Internal Controls. As a result of the conclusions discussed above, under the direction of the Audit Committee
and the Board of Directors, we have taken corrective action to strengthen our internal controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
recorded, processed, summarized and accurately reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Specifically, in order to reduce the incidence of auditor-initiated adjustments, we have taken steps to hire additional
accounting personnel and have enhanced the effectiveness of existing finance personnel (particularly relating to the financial close process).

however , that every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by an assignment form and, if applicable, a transfer certificate each in the form included in Exhibit A ,

except that the Company or the Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto, and provided , that this sentence shall not apply to any exchange
pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.12(a), 3.5, 4.2 (last paragraph) or 11.5. Neither the Company, any Registrar nor the Trustee shall be required to exchange or register a transfer of any Securities or portions thereof in respect of which a Change in Control Purchase Notice has been delivered and not withdrawn by
the Holder thereof (except, in the case of the purchase of a Security in part, the portion thereof not to be purchased). All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt and entitled to the
same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange. (b) Any Registrar appointed pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof shall provide to the Trustee such information as the Trustee may reasonably require in
connection with the delivery by such Registrar of Securities upon transfer or exchange of Securities. (c) Each Holder of a Security agrees to indemnify the Company and the Trustee against any liability that may result from the transfer, exchange or

Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine
substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof. SECTION 2.7. REPLACEMENT SECURITIES. If any
mutilated Security is surrendered to the Company, a Registrar or the Trustee, or the Company, a Registrar and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security, and there is delivered to the
Company, the applicable Registrar and the Trustee such security or indemnity as will be required by them to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company, such Registrar or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired
by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute, and upon its written request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for any such mutilated Security or in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of
like tenor and principal amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be purchased by the Company pursuant to Article 3, the Company in its discretion may,
instead of issuing a new Security, pay or purchase such Security, as the case may be. Upon the issuance of any new Securities under this Section 2.7, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any
other reasonable expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the Trustee or the Registrar) in connection therewith. Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section 2.7 in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with
any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder. The
provisions of this Section 2.7 are (to the extent lawful) exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities. SECTION 2.8. OUTSTANDING SECURITIES. Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the
Trustee, except for those canceled by it, those converted pursuant to Article 4, those delivered to it for cancellation or surrendered for transfer or exchange and those described in this Section 2.8 as not outstanding. If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.7, it ceases to be
outstanding unless the Company receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser. If a Paying Agent (other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) holds on a Change in Control Purchase Date or the Final Maturity Date money
sufficient to pay the principal of (including 
 12 

premium, if any) and Additional Interest, if any, on Securities (or portions thereof) payable on that date, then on and after such Change in Control Purchase
Date or the Final Maturity Date, as the case may be, such Securities (or portions thereof, as the case may be) shall cease to be outstanding and Additional Interest, if any, on them shall cease to accrue. Subject to the restrictions contained in Section 2.9, a Security does not
cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security. SECTION 2.9. TREASURY SECURITIES. In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities have concurred in any notice, direction, waiver or consent, Securities owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities or
by any Affiliate of the Company or of such other obligor shall be disregarded, except that, for purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such notice, direction, waiver or consent, only Securities which a Trust
Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith shall not be disregarded if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee s right so
to act with respect to the Securities and that the pledgee is not the Company or any other obligor on the Securities or any Affiliate of the Company or of such other obligor. SECTION 2.10. TEMPORARY SECURITIES. Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and execute, and, upon receipt of a Company
Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company with the consent of the Trustee considers appropriate
for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver definitive Securities in exchange for temporary Securities. SECTION 2.11. CANCELLATION. 
 The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar, the Paying Agent and the Conversion Agent shall forward
to the Trustee or its agent any Securities surrendered to them for transfer, exchange, payment or conversion. The Trustee and no one else shall cancel, in accordance with its standard procedures, all Securities surrendered for transfer, exchange,
payment, conversion or cancellation and shall deliver the canceled Securities to the Company. All Securities which are purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Final Maturity Date shall be delivered to
the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company may not hold or resell such Securities or issue any new Securities to replace any such Securities or any Securities that any Holder has converted pursuant to Article 4. SECTION 2.12. LEGEND; ADDITIONAL TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS.
 (a) If Securities are issued upon the transfer, exchange
or replacement of Securities subject to restrictions on transfer and bearing the legends set forth on the forms of Securities attached hereto as Exhibit A (collectively, the Legend ), or if a request is made to remove the Legend on
a Security, the Securities so issued shall bear the Legend, or the Legend shall not be removed, as the case may be, unless 
 13 

there is delivered to the Company and the Registrar such satisfactory evidence, which shall include an opinion of counsel if requested by the Company or such
Registrar, as may be reasonably required by the Company and the Registrar, that neither the Legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth therein are required to ensure that transfers thereof comply with the provisions of Rule 144A, Rule 144 or
Regulation S under the Securities Act or that such Securities are not restricted within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act; provided that no such evidence need be supplied in connection with the sale of such
Security pursuant to a registration statement that is effective at the time of such sale. Upon (i) provision of such satisfactory evidence if requested, or (ii) notification by the Company to the Trustee and Registrar of the sale of such Security
pursuant to a registration statement that is effective at the time of such sale, the Trustee, at the written direction of the Company, shall authenticate and deliver a Security that does not bear the Legend. If the Legend is removed from the face of
a Security and the Security is subsequently held by an Affiliate of the Company, the Legend shall be reinstated. (b) A Global Security may not be transferred, in whole or in part, to any Person other than the Depositary or a nominee or any successor thereof, and no
such transfer to any such other Person may be registered; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit any transfer of a Security that is issued in exchange for a Global Security but is not itself a Global Security. No transfer of a
Security to any Person shall be effective under this Indenture or the Securities unless and until such Security has been registered in the name of such Person. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture or the Securities, transfers of a
Global Security, in whole or in part, shall be made only in accordance with this Section 2.12. (c) Subject to the succeeding paragraph, every Security shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer provided in the Legend other than a Restricted Global Security. Whenever any Restricted Security other than a
Restricted Global Security is presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange for a Security registered in a name other than that of the Holder, such Security must be accompanied by a certificate in substantially the form set
forth in Exhibit A , dated the date of such surrender and signed by the Holder of such Security, as to compliance with such restrictions on transfer. The Registrar shall not be required to accept for such registration of transfer or exchange
any Security not so accompanied by a properly completed certificate. (d) The restrictions imposed by the Legend upon the transferability of any Security shall cease and terminate when such Security has been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or transferred in
compliance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or any successor provision thereto) or, if earlier, upon the expiration of the holding period applicable to sales thereof under Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act (or any successor provision). Any
Security as to which such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in accordance with their terms or shall have terminated may, upon a surrender of such Security for exchange to the Registrar in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.12
(accompanied, in the event that such restrictions on transfer have terminated by reason of a transfer in compliance with Rule 144 or any successor provision, by, if requested by the Company or the Registrar, an opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Company and addressed to the Company in form acceptable to the Company, to the effect that the transfer of such Security has been made in compliance with Rule 144 or such successor provision), be exchanged for a new Security, of
like tenor and aggregate principal amount, which shall not bear the restrictive Legend. The Company shall inform the Trustee of the effective date of any registration statement registering the Securities under the Securities Act. The Trustee shall
not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the aforementioned opinion of counsel or registration statement. 
 14 

(e) As used in the preceding two paragraphs of this Section 2.12, the term transfer 
encompasses any sale, pledge, transfer, hypothecation or other disposition of any Security. (f) The provisions of clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) below shall apply only to Global Securities: (i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture or the Securities, a Global Security shall not be exchanged in whole or in part
for a Security registered in the name of any Person other than the Depositary or one or more nominees thereof, provided that a Global Security may be exchanged for Securities registered in the names of any person designated by the
Depositary in the event that (A) the Depositary has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or such Depositary has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the
Exchange Act, and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, (B) the Company has provided the Depositary with written notice that it has decided to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfer through the
Depositary or any successor Depositary or (C) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities. Any Global Security exchanged pursuant to clauses (A) or (B) above shall be so exchanged in whole and not in part, and
any Global Security exchanged pursuant to clause (C) above may be exchanged in whole or from time to time in part as directed by the Depositary. Any Security issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be a Global Security;
provided that any such Security so issued that is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary or a nominee thereof shall not be a Global Security. (ii) Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be issued in
definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons, shall have an aggregate principal amount equal to that of such Global Security or portion thereof to be so exchanged, shall be registered in such names and be in such authorized
denominations as the Depositary shall designate and shall bear the applicable legends provided for herein. Any Global Security to be exchanged in whole shall be surrendered by the Depositary to the Trustee, as Registrar. With regard to any Global
Security to be exchanged in part, either such Global Security shall be so surrendered for exchange or, if the Trustee is acting as custodian for the Depositary or its nominee with respect to such Global Security, the principal amount thereof shall
be reduced, by an amount equal to the portion thereof to be so exchanged, by means of an appropriate adjustment made on the records of the Trustee. Upon any such surrender or adjustment, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver the Security
issuable on such exchange to or upon the order of the Depositary or an authorized representative thereof. (iii) Subject to the provisions of clause (v) below, the registered Holder may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including
Agent Members and persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities. (iv) In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in clause (i) above, the Company will
promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of Certificated Securities in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons. (v) Neither Agent Members nor any other Persons on whose behalf Agent Members may act shall have any rights under this Indenture with
respect to any Global 
 15 

Security registered in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, or under any such Global Security, and the Depositary or such nominee, as the case
may be, may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and holder of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the
Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between the Depositary, its
Agent Members and any other Person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of customary practices of such Persons governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any Security. SECTION 2.13. CUSIP NUMBERS. The Company in issuing the Securities may use one or more CUSIP 
numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP numbers in notices of purchase as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the
correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a purchase and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such purchase shall not be
affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers. ARTICLE 3 REDEMPTION

or portions thereof that are to be purchased as of such Change in Control Purchase Date. The manner in which the deposit required by this Section 3.4 is made by the Company shall be at the option of the Company, provided that such
deposit shall be made in a manner such that the Trustee or a Paying Agent shall have immediately available funds on the Change in Control Purchase Date. 
 19 

If a Paying Agent holds, in accordance with the terms hereof, money sufficient to pay the Change in
Control Purchase Price of any Security for which a Change in Control Purchase Notice has been tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with this Indenture then, on the Change in Control Purchase Date, such Security will cease to be outstanding and
the rights of the Holder in respect thereof shall terminate (other than the right to receive the Change in Control Purchase Price as aforesaid). The Company shall publicly announce the principal amount of Securities purchased as a result of such
Change in Control on or as soon as practicable after the Change in Control Purchase Date. SECTION 3.5. SECURITIES PURCHASED IN PART. Any Security that is to be purchased only in part shall be surrendered at the office of a Paying Agent, and promptly after the Change in Control Purchase Date the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security, without service charge, a new Security or Securities, of such authorized denomination or denominations as may be requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to, and in
exchange for, the portion of the principal amount of the Security so surrendered that is not purchased. SECTION 3.6. COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS UPON PURCHASE OF SECURITIES. In connection with any offer to purchase or purchase of Securities under Section 3.2, the Company shall (a) comply with Rule
13e-4 and Rule 14e-1 (or any successor to either such Rule), if applicable, under the Exchange Act, (b) file the related Schedule TO (or any successor or similar schedule, form or report) if required under the Exchange Act, and (c) otherwise comply
with all federal and state securities laws in connection with such offer to purchase or purchase of Securities, all so as to permit the rights of the Holders and obligations of the Company under Sections 3.2 through 3.5 to be exercised in the time
and in the manner specified therein. SECTION 3.7. REPAYMENT
TO THE COMPANY. To the extent that the aggregate amount
of cash deposited by the Company pursuant to Section 3.4 exceeds the aggregate Change in Control Purchase Price together with Additional Interest, if any, thereon of the Securities or portions thereof that the Company is obligated to purchase, then
promptly after the Change in Control Purchase Date the Trustee or a Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall return any such excess cash to the Company. ARTICLE 4 CONVERSION 
 SECTION 4.1. CONVERSION PRIVILEGE Subject to the further provisions of this Article 4 and paragraph 6 of the
Securities, a Holder of a Security may convert the principal amount of such Security (or any portion thereof equal to 1,000 or any integral multiple of 1,000 in excess thereof) into Common Stock at any time prior to the close of business on the
Final Maturity Date, at the Conversion Price then in effect; provided , however , that, if such Security is submitted or presented for purchase pursuant to Article 3, such conversion right shall terminate at the close of business on the
Business Day immediately preceding the Change in Control Purchase Date for such Security 
 20 

or such earlier date as the Holder presents such Security for purchase (unless the Company shall default in making the Change in Control Purchase Price
payment when due, in which case the conversion right shall terminate at the close of business on the date such default is cured and such Security is purchased). The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a Security shall be
determined by dividing the principal amount of the Security or portion thereof surrendered for conversion by the Conversion Price in effect on the Conversion Date. The initial Conversion Price is set forth in paragraph 6 of the Securities and is
subject to adjustment as provided in this Article 4. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to conversion of all of a Security also apply to conversion of a portion of a Security. A Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Change in Control Purchase Notice pursuant to Section 3.2(c) exercising the option of such Holder
to require the Company to purchase such Security may be converted only if such Change in Control Purchase Notice is withdrawn by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to a Paying Agent prior to the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Change in Control Purchase Date in accordance with Section 3.3. A Holder of Securities is not entitled to any rights of a holder of Common Stock until such Holder has converted its Securities to Common Stock, and only to the extent such Securities are deemed to have been converted
into Common Stock pursuant to this Article 4. SECTION 4.2.
CONVERSION PROCEDURE. To convert a Security, a Holder
must (a) complete and manually sign the conversion notice on the back of the Security and deliver such notice to a Conversion Agent, (b) surrender the Security to a Conversion Agent, (c) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if
required by a Registrar or a Conversion Agent, and (d) pay any transfer or similar tax, if required. The date on which the Holder satisfies all of those requirements is the Conversion Date. As soon as practicable after the Conversion
Date, the Company shall deliver to the Holder through a Conversion Agent a certificate for the number of whole shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion and cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 4.3. Anything herein to
the contrary notwithstanding, in the case of Global Securities, conversion notices may be delivered and such Securities may be surrendered for conversion in accordance with the Applicable Procedures as in effect from time to time. The person in whose name the Common Stock certificate is registered shall be
deemed to be a stockholder of record on the Conversion Date; provided , however , that no surrender of a Security on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall be effective to constitute the person or
persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock upon such conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such surrender shall be effective to constitute the person or persons entitled to receive
such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open; provided , further , that such conversion shall be at
the Conversion Price in effect on the Conversion Date as if the stock transfer books of the Company had not been closed. Upon conversion of a Security, such person shall no longer be a Holder of such Security. No payment or adjustment will be made
for dividends or distributions on shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of a Security. Securities so surrendered for conversion (in whole or in part) during the period from the close of business on any regular record date to the opening of business on the next succeeding Additional Interest 
 
 21 

payment date, if any (excluding Securities or portions thereof presented for purchase upon a Change in Control on a Change in Control Purchase Date during
the period beginning at the close of business on a regular record date and ending at the opening of business on the first Business Day after the next succeeding Additional Interest payment date, if any, or if such Additional Interest payment date,
if any, is not a Business Day, the second such Business Day) shall also be accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company of an amount equal to the Additional Interest, if any, payable on such Additional Interest payment date on the
principal amount of such Security then being converted, and such Additional Interest, if any, shall be payable to such registered Holder notwithstanding the conversion of such Security, subject to the provisions of this Indenture relating to the
payment of defaulted Additional Interest, if any, by the Company. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.2, no payment or adjustment will be made for accrued Additional Interest, if any, on a converted Security. If the Company defaults in
the payment of Additional Interest, if any, payable on such Additional Interest payment date, the Company shall promptly repay such funds to such Holder. Nothing in this Section shall affect the right of a Holder in whose name any Security is registered at the close of business on a record date to receive
the Additional Interest, if any, payable on such Security on the related Additional Interest payment date, if any, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture, the Securities and the Registration Rights Agreement. If a Holder converts more than
one Security at the same time, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion shall be based on the aggregate principal amount of Securities converted. Upon surrender of a Security that is converted in part, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver to the Holder, a new Security equal in principal amount to the unconverted portion of the Security surrendered. SECTION 4.3. FRACTIONAL SHARES. The Company will not issue fractional shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Securities. In lieu thereof, the Company will pay an amount in cash for
the current market value of the fractional shares. The current market value of a fractional share shall be determined, (calculated to the nearest 1/1000 th of a share) by multiplying the Closing Price (determined as set forth in Section 4.6(d)) of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately prior to the Conversion Date by such fractional share and
rounding the product to the nearest whole cent. SECTION
4.4. TAXES ON CONVERSION. If a Holder converts a
Security, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of shares of Common Stock upon such conversion. However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests the shares
to be issued in a name other than the Holder s name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificate representing the Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder s name until the Conversion Agent receives a sum
sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the Holder s name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulation. 
 22 

SECTION 4.5. COMPANY TO PROVIDE STOCK. The Company shall, prior to issuance of any Securities hereunder, and from
time to time as may be necessary, reserve, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to permit the conversion of all outstanding Securities into shares of Common Stock. All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Securities shall
be newly issued shares, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and shall be free from preemptive or similar rights and free of any lien or adverse claim. The Company will endeavor promptly to comply with all federal and state securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of
shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Securities, if any, and will list or cause to have quoted such shares of Common Stock on each national securities exchange or on the Nasdaq National Market or other over-the-counter market or such other
market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted; provided , however , that if rules of such automated quotation system or exchange permit the Company to defer the listing of such Common Stock until the first conversion of the
Notes into Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, the Company covenants to list such Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes in accordance with the requirements of such automated quotation system or exchange at
such time. Any Common Stock issued upon conversion of a Security hereunder which at the time of conversion was a Restricted Security will also be a Restricted Security. SECTION 4.6. ADJUSTMENT OF CONVERSION PRICE. The conversion price as stated in paragraph 6 of the Securities (the Conversion Price shall be adjusted from
time to time by the Company as follows: (a) In case the
Company shall (i) pay a dividend on its Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, (ii) make a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, (iii) subdivide its outstanding Common Stock into a greater number of shares, or (iv) combine its
outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the Holder of any Security thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive that number of
shares of Common Stock which it would have owned had such Security been converted immediately prior to the happening of such event. An adjustment made pursuant to this subsection (a) shall become effective immediately after the record date in the
case of a dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of subdivision or combination. (b) In case the Company shall issue rights or warrants to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock entitling them (for a period of not more
than 60 days after such issuance) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) at a price per share (or having a Conversion Price per share) less than the Current Market Price per share of Common
Stock (as determined in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section 4.6) on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior thereto shall be
adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such
record date plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered (or the aggregate conversion price of the convertible securities so offered, which shall be determined by multiplying
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such convertible securities by the conversion price per share of 
 23 

Common Stock pursuant to the terms of such convertible securities) would purchase at the Current Market Price per share (as defined in subsection (d) of this
Section 4.6) of Common Stock on such record date, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered (or into which the convertible
securities so offered are convertible). Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights or warrants are issued, and shall become effective immediately after such record date. If at the end of the period during which such rights
or warrants are exercisable not all rights or warrants shall have been exercised, the adjusted Conversion Price shall be immediately readjusted to what it would have been based upon the number of additional shares of Common Stock actually issued (or
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of convertible securities actually issued). (c) In case the Company shall distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company (other than
Common Stock), evidences of indebtedness or other non-cash assets (including securities of any person other than the Company but excluding (1) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash or (2) dividends or distributions referred to in
subsection (a) of this Section 4.6), or shall distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any of its securities (excluding those rights and warrants referred to in subsection (b)
of this Section 4.6 and also excluding the distribution of rights to all holders of Common Stock pursuant to a Rights Plan (as defined below) adopted before or after the date of this Indenture), then in each such case the Conversion Price shall be
adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the current Conversion Price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Current Market Price per share (as defined in subsection (d) of this Section 4.6) of the Common
Stock on the record date mentioned below less the fair market value on such record date (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive evidence of such fair market value and which shall be evidenced by an
Officers Certificate delivered to the Trustee) of the portion of the capital stock, evidences of indebtedness or other non-cash assets so distributed or of such rights or warrants applicable to one share of Common Stock (determined on the
basis of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date), and of which the denominator shall be the Current Market Price per share (as defined in subsection (d) of this Section 4.6) of the Common Stock on such record date. Such
adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. In the event the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of
the capital stock, evidences of indebtedness or other non-cash assets so distributed or of such rights or warrants applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on such
record date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each holder of a Security shall have the right to receive upon conversion the amount of capital stock, evidences of indebtedness or other non-cash assets so
distributed or of such rights or warrants such holder would have received had such holder converted each Security on such record date. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Price shall again be
adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 4.6(c) by reference
to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Current Market Price of the Common Stock. With respect to any rights (the Rights that may be issued or
distributed pursuant to any rights plan that the Company implements after the date of this Indenture (any Rights that may be issued pursuant to any such future rights plan being referred to as, a Rights Plan ), upon conversion of the
Securities into Common 
 24 

Stock, to the extent that such Rights Plan is in effect upon such conversion, the holders of Securities will receive, in addition to the Common Stock, the
Rights described therein (whether or not the Rights have separated from the Common Stock at the time of conversion), subject to the limitations set forth in any such Rights Plan. Any distribution of rights or warrants pursuant to a Rights Plan
complying with the requirements set forth in the immediately preceding sentence of this paragraph shall not constitute a distribution of rights or warrants pursuant to this Section 4.6(c). Rights or warrants (other than rights issued pursuant to a Rights Plan)
distributed by the Company to all holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company s Capital Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the
occurrence of a specified event or events Trigger Event ): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be
deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 4.6 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Price under this Section 4.6 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be
deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Price shall be made under this Section 4.6(c). If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the
date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such
event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In
addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a
distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Price under this Section 4.6 was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants which shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the
Conversion Price shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price
received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the
case of such rights or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued. (1) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, at any time
distribute (a Triggering Distribution to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock cash in an aggregate amount that, together with the aggregate amount of (A) any cash and the fair market value (as determined by the Board of
Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive evidence thereof and which shall be evidenced by an Officers Certificate delivered to the Trustee) of any other consideration payable in respect of any tender offer by the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company for Common Stock consummated within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of the Triggering Distribution and in respect of which no Conversion Price adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.6 has been made and (B) all
other cash distributions to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock made within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of the Triggering Distribution and in respect of which no Conversion Price adjustment pursuant to this Section
4.6 has been made, exceeds an amount equal to 10.0 of the product of the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock (as determined in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section 4.6) on the Business Day (the Determination Date immediately preceding the day on which such Triggering Distribution is declared by the Company multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the 
 25 

Determination Date (excluding shares held in the treasury of the Company), the Conversion Price shall be reduced so that the same shall equal the price
determined by multiplying such Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the Determination Date by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock (as determined in accordance with subsection
(d) of this Section 4.6) on the Determination Date less the sum of the aggregate amount of cash and the aggregate fair market value (determined as aforesaid in this Section 4.6(c)(1)) of any such other consideration so distributed, paid or payable
within such 12 months (including, without limitation, the Triggering Distribution) applicable to one share of Common Stock (determined on the basis of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the Determination Date) and the denominator
shall be such Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock (as determined in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section 4.6) on the Determination Date, such reduction to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the
day following the date on which the Triggering Distribution is paid. (2) In case any tender offer made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for Common Stock shall expire and such tender offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall involve the payment of aggregate consideration in an amount
(determined as the sum of the aggregate amount of cash consideration and the aggregate fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive evidence thereof and which shall be evidenced by an
Officers Certificate delivered to the Trustee thereof) of any other consideration) that, together with the aggregate amount of (A) any cash and the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be
conclusive evidence thereof and which shall be evidenced by an Officers Certificate delivered to the Trustee) of any other consideration payable in respect of any other tender offers by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for Common
Stock consummated within the 12 months preceding the date of the Expiration Date (as defined below) and in respect of which no Conversion Price adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.6 has been made and (B) all cash distributions to all or
substantially all holders of its Common Stock made within the 12 months preceding the Expiration Date and in respect of which no Conversion Price adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.6 has been made, exceeds an amount equal to 10.0 of the product
of the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock (as determined in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section 4.6) as of the last date (the Expiration Date tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender offer (as it may
be amended) (the last time at which such tenders could have been made on the Expiration Date is hereinafter sometimes called the Expiration Time multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including tendered shares
but excluding any shares held in the treasury of the Company) at the Expiration Time, then, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the Expiration Date, the Conversion Price shall be reduced so that the same shall equal the
price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Expiration Date by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including
tendered shares but excluding any shares held in the treasury of the Company) at the Expiration Time multiplied by the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock (as determined in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section 4.6) on the
Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date and the denominator shall be the sum of (x) the aggregate consideration (determined as aforesaid) payable to stockholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender
offer) of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the Purchased Shares and (y) the product of the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding (less any Purchased Shares and excluding any shares held in the treasury of the Company) at the Expiration Time and the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock (as determined in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section
4.6) on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date, such reduction to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Expiration Date. In the event that the Company is obligated to purchase shares
pursuant to any such tender 
 26 

offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any or all such purchases or any or all such purchases are rescinded, the
Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would have been in effect based upon the number of shares actually purchased. If the application of this Section 4.6(c)(2) to any tender offer would result in an increase in
the Conversion Price, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer under this Section 4.6(c)(2). (3) For purposes of this Section 4.6(c), the term tender offer shall mean and include both tender offers and exchange offers, all references
to purchases of shares in tender offers (and all similar references) shall mean and include both the purchase of shares in tender offers and the acquisition of shares pursuant to exchange offers, and all references to tendered
shares (and all similar references) shall mean and include shares tendered in both tender offers and exchange offers. (d) For the purpose of any computation under subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 4.6, the current market price (the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices for the 30 consecutive Trading Days commencing 45 Trading Days before (i) the Determination Date or the Expiration Date, as the case may be, with
respect to distributions or tender offers under subsection (c) of this Section 4.6 or (ii) the record date with respect to distributions, issuances or other events requiring such computation under subsection (b) or (c) of this Section 4.6. The
closing price (the Closing Price for each day shall be the last reported sales price or, in case no such reported sale takes place on such date, the average of the reported closing bid and asked prices in either case on the Nasdaq
National Market or, if the Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on the Nasdaq National Market, on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading or, if not listed or admitted to
trading on the Nasdaq National Market or any national securities exchange, the last reported sales price of the Common Stock as quoted on NASDAQ or, in case no reported sales takes place, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as quoted on
NASDAQ or any comparable system or, if the Common Stock is not quoted on NASDAQ or any comparable system, the closing sales price or, in case no reported sale takes place, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, as furnished by any two
members of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. selected from time to time by the Company for that purpose. If no such prices are available, the Current Market Price per share shall be the fair value of a share of Common Stock as
determined by the Board of Directors (which shall be evidenced by an Officers Certificate delivered to the Trustee). (e) In any case in which this Section 4.6 shall require that an adjustment be made following a record date or a Determination Date or Expiration Date, as
the case may be, established for purposes of this Section 4.6, the Company may elect to defer (but only until five Business Days following the filing by the Company with the Trustee of the certificate described in Section 4.9) issuing to the Holder
of any Security converted after such record date or Determination Date or Expiration Date the shares of Common Stock and other capital stock of the Company issuable upon such conversion over and above the shares of Common Stock and other capital
stock of the Company issuable upon such conversion only on the basis of the Conversion Price prior to adjustment; and, in lieu of the shares the issuance of which is so deferred, the Company shall issue or cause its transfer agents to issue due
bills or other appropriate evidence prepared by the Company of the right to receive such shares. If any distribution in respect of which an adjustment to the Conversion Price is required to be made as of the record date or Determination Date or
Expiration Date therefor is not thereafter made or paid by the Company for any reason, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed or such effective date or
Determination Date or Expiration Date had not occurred. 
 27 

SECTION 4.7. NO ADJUSTMENT. No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be required if Holders may participate in the transactions set forth in Section
4.6 above without converting. No adjustment in the Conversion
Price shall be required unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1 in the Conversion Price as last adjusted; provided , however , that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 4.7 are not required
to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Article 4 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment need be made for issuances of Common Stock pursuant to a
Company plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest or for a change in the par value or a change to no par value of the Common Stock. To the extent that the Securities become convertible into the right to receive cash, no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the cash. Interest will
not accrue on the cash. SECTION 4.8. ADJUSTMENT FOR TAX
PURPOSES. The Company shall be entitled to make such
reductions in the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by Section 4.6, as it in its discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any stock dividends, subdivisions of shares, distributions of rights to purchase stock or
securities or distributions of securities convertible into or exchangeable for stock hereafter made by the Company to its stockholders shall not be taxable. SECTION 4.9. NOTICE OF ADJUSTMENT. Whenever the Conversion Price or conversion privilege is adjusted, the Company shall promptly mail to Securityholders a notice of the adjustment and file
with the Trustee an Officers Certificate briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it. Unless and until the Trustee shall receive an Officers Certificate setting forth an adjustment of the Conversion
Price, the Trustee may assume without inquiry that the Conversion Price has not been adjusted and that the last Conversion Price of which it has knowledge remains in effect. SECTION 4.10. NOTICE OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS. In the event that: (1) the Company takes any action which would require an adjustment in the Conversion Price; (2) the Company consolidates or merges with, or transfers all or substantially all of its property and assets to, another
corporation and stockholders of the Company must approve the transaction; or (3) there is a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Company shall mail to Holders and file with the Trustee a notice stating the proposed record or effective date, as the case may be. The Company shall mail the notice at least ten days before such date. Failure to
 
 28 

mail such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the validity of any transaction referred to in clause (1), (2) or (3) of this Section 4.10.
 SECTION 4.11. EFFECT OF RECLASSIFICATION, CONSOLIDATION,
MERGER OR SALE ON CONVERSION PRIVILEGE. If any of the
following shall occur, namely: (a) any reclassification or change of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a
result of a subdivision or combination, or any other change for which an adjustment is provided in Section 4.6); (b) any consolidation or merger or combination to which the Company is a party other than a merger in which the Company is the
continuing corporation and which does not result in any reclassification of, or change (other than in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination) in, outstanding
shares of Common Stock; or (c) any sale or conveyance as an entirety or substantially as an entirety of the property and assets of the Company, directly or indirectly, to any person, then the Company, or such successor, purchasing or transferee
corporation, as the case may be, shall, as a condition precedent to such reclassification, change, combination, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture providing that the Holder of each
Security then outstanding shall have the right to convert such Security into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, combination, consolidation, merger,
sale or conveyance by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such Security immediately prior to such reclassification, change, combination, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance. Such supplemental
indenture shall provide for adjustments of the Conversion Price which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments of the Conversion Price provided for in this Article 4. If, in the case of any such consolidation, merger,
combination, sale or conveyance, the stock or other securities and property (including cash) receivable thereupon by a holder of Common Stock include shares of stock or other securities and property of a person other than the successor, purchasing
or transferee corporation, as the case may be, in such consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other person and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the
interests of the Holders of the Securities as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing. The provisions of this Section 4.11 shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, combinations,
consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyances. In the event
the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 4.11, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee (x) an Officers Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefor, the kind or amount of shares of stock or other
securities or property (including cash) receivable by Holders of the Securities upon the conversion of their Securities after any such reclassification, change, combination, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, any adjustment to be made with
respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with and (y) an Opinion of Counsel that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Holders. SECTION 4.12. TRUSTEE S DISCLAIMER. The Trustee shall have no duty to determine when an adjustment under this
Article 4 should be made, how it should be made or what such adjustment should be, but may accept as conclusive evidence of that fact or the correctness of any such adjustment, and shall be protected in relying upon, an Officers Certificate
including the Officers Certificate with respect thereto which the Company is obligated to file with the 
 29 

Trustee pursuant to Section 4.9. The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or value of any securities or assets issued upon conversion of
Securities, and the Trustee shall not be responsible for the Company s failure to comply with any provisions of this Article 4. The Trustee shall not be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture executed pursuant
to Section 4.11, but may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness thereof, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, the Officers Certificate with respect thereto which the Company is obligated to file with the Trustee pursuant to
Section 4.11. SECTION 4.13. VOLUNTARY REDUCTION.
 The Company from time to time may reduce the Conversion
Price by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 days and if the reduction is irrevocable during the period if our Board of Directors determines that such reduction would be in the best interest of the Company or to avoid or
diminish income tax to holders of shares of our Common Stock in connection with a dividend or distribution of stock or similar event, and the Company provides 15 days prior notice of any reduction in the Conversion Price; provided , 
however , that in no event may the Company reduce the Conversion Price to be less than the par value of a share of Common Stock. ARTICLE 5 SUBORDINATION

 30 

for which there is a period of grace, in the event of such a default that continues beyond the period of grace, if any, specified in the instrument or lease
evidencing such Designated Senior Indebtedness), unless and until such default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist; or (ii) a default, other than a payment default, on a Designated Senior Indebtedness occurs and is continuing that then permits holders of such Designated

Securities to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness which may at the time be outstanding; provided that (i) the Senior Indebtedness is assumed by the new corporation, if any, resulting from any reorganization or readjustment, and (ii)
the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness (other than leases which are not assumed by the Company or the new corporation, as the case may be) are not, without the consent of such holders, altered by such reorganization or readjustment. The
consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company into, another corporation or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company following the conveyance, transfer or lease of its property as an entirety, or substantially as an entirety,
to another corporation upon the terms and conditions provided for in Article 7 shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section 5.2 if such other corporation shall, as a part of such
consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease, comply with the conditions stated in Article 7. In the event of the acceleration of the Securities because of an Event of Default, no payment or distribution shall be made to the Trustee or any Holder

such acceleration. In the event that, notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions, any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities (including, without limitation, by way of setoff or otherwise), prohibited by the foregoing, shall be
received by the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full, in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, or provision is made for such payment thereof in accordance with

this Article 5 (equally and ratably with the holders of all indebtedness of the Company which by its express terms is subordinated to other indebtedness of the Company to substantially the same extent as the Securities are subordinated and is
entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until the principal, premium, if
any, and Additional Interest, if any, on the Securities shall be paid in full in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of Senior Indebtedness; and, for the purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of the
Senior Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article 5, and no payment over pursuant to the provisions of this Article 5, to or for
the benefit of the holders of Senior Indebtedness by Holders of the Securities or the Trustee, shall, as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the Holders of the Securities, be deemed to be a payment by
the Company to or on account of the Senior Indebtedness; and no payments or distributions of cash, property or securities to or for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities pursuant to the subrogation provisions of this Article 5, which would
otherwise have been paid to the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company to or for the account of the Securities. It is understood that the provisions of this Article 5 are and are intended solely for the
purposes of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities, on the one hand, and the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand. Nothing contained in this Article 5 or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its

Additional Interest, if any, on the Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities and creditors of the Company
other than the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Security from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture, subject
to the rights, if any, under this Article 5 of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy. Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article 5, the Trustee, subject to the
provisions of Section 9.1, and the Holders of the Securities shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such bankruptcy, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings
are pending, or a certificate of the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of the Securities, for the purpose of ascertaining the
persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 5. SECTION 5.4. AUTHORIZATION TO EFFECT SUBORDINATION. Each Holder of a Security by the Holder s acceptance thereof authorizes
and directs the Trustee on the Holder s behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as

provided in this Article 5 and appoints the Trustee to act as the Holder s attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. If the Trustee does not file
a proper proof of claim or proof of debt in the form required in any proceeding referred to in Section 5.3 hereof at least 30 days before the expiration of the time to file such claim, the holders of any Senior Indebtedness or their representatives
are hereby authorized to file an appropriate claim for and on behalf of the Holders of the Securities. SECTION 5.5. NOTICE TO TRUSTEE. The Company shall give prompt written notice in the form of an Officers Certificate to a Trust Officer of the Trustee and to any Paying Agent of any
fact known to the Company which would prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee or any Paying Agent in respect of the Securities pursuant to the provisions of this Article 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 5
or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts which would prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities pursuant to the
provisions of this Article 5, unless and until a Trust Officer of the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof at the Corporate Trust Office from the Company (in the form of an Officers Certificate) or a Representative or a Holder or
Holders of Senior Indebtedness or from any trustee thereof; and before the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 9.1, shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts exist;
 provided that if on a date not less than one Business Day prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any such monies may become payable for any purpose (including, without limitation, the payment of the principal of, or premium,
if any, or Additional Interest, if any, on any Security) the Trustee shall not have received, with respect to such monies, the notice provided for in this Section 5.5, then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee
shall have full power and authority to receive such monies and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary which may be received by it on or after such prior date.
Notwithstanding anything in this Article 5 to the contrary, nothing shall prevent any payment by the Trustee to the Holders of monies deposited with it pursuant to Article 10, and any such payment shall not be subject to the provisions of Article 5.
 The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 9.1, shall
be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Representative or a person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a
Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness or a trustee on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any person as a holder of
Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 5, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such
Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article 5, and if such evidence is not furnished the Trustee may defer any
payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. SECTION 5.6. TRUSTEE S RELATION TO SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS. The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article 5 in respect of any
Senior Indebtedness at any time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness, and nothing in Section 9.11 or elsewhere in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.

such of its covenants and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article 5, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee
shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness and, subject to the provisions of Section 9.1, the Trustee shall not be liable to any holder of Senior Indebtedness if it shall pay over or deliver to Holders of
Securities, the Company or any other person money or assets to which any holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 5 or otherwise. SECTION 5.7. NO IMPAIRMENT OF SUBORDINATION. No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any
time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of
this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or otherwise be charged with. SECTION 5.8. CERTAIN CONVERSIONS DEEMED PAYMENT. For the purposes of this Article 5 only, (1) the issuance and delivery of junior securities upon conversion of Securities in accordance with Article 4

cash (except in satisfaction of fractional shares pursuant to Section 4.3), property or securities (other than junior securities) upon conversion of a Security shall be deemed to constitute payment on account of the principal of such Security. For

outstanding at the time of issuance or delivery of such securities to substantially the same extent as, or to a greater extent than, the Securities are so subordinated as provided in this Article. Nothing contained in this Article 5 or elsewhere in
this Indenture or in the Securities is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, the right, which is absolute and unconditional, of the Holder of any Security to
convert such Security in accordance with Article 4. SECTION
5.9. ARTICLE APPLICABLE TO PAYING AGENTS. If at any time
any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall have been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term Trustee as used in this Article shall (unless the context otherwise requires) be construed as extending to and
including such Paying Agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such Paying Agent were named in this Article in addition to or in place of the Trustee; provided , however , that the first paragraph of Section
5.5 shall not apply to the Company or any Affiliate of the Company if it or such Affiliate acts as Paying Agent. SECTION 5.10. SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS ENTITLED TO RELY. The holders of Senior Indebtedness (including, without limitation, Designated Senior Indebtedness) shall have the right to rely upon this Article 5, and

United States Code (or any successor thereto) or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors. The term Custodian means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law.
 A default under clause (3) above is not an Event of Default
until the Trustee notifies the Company, or the Holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding notify the Company and the Trustee, in writing of the default, and the Company does not cure the default within
60 days after receipt of such notice. The notice given pursuant to this Section 8.1 must specify the default, demand that it be remedied and state that the notice is a Notice of Default. When any default under this Section 8.1 is cured,
it ceases. The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of
any Event of Default unless written notice thereof shall have been given to a Trust Officer at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee by the Company, a Paying Agent, any Holder or any agent of any Holder. SECTION 8.2. ACCELERATION. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause
(7) or (8) of Section 8.1) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may, by notice to the Company and the Trustee, declare
all unpaid principal to the date of acceleration on the Securities then outstanding (if not then due and payable) to be due and payable upon any such declaration, and the same shall become and be immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default
specified in clause (7) or (8) of Section 8.1 occurs, all unpaid principal of the Securities then outstanding shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if (a) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of
the 
 40 

Securities which has become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived; (b) to the extent the payment of such interest is
lawful, interest at a rate of 3 per annum on overdue installments of Additional Interest, if any, and overdue principal, which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, has been paid; (c) the rescission would not conflict
with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction; and (d) all payments due to the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 9.7 have been made. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereto. SECTION 8.3. OTHER REMEDIES.

Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, pursue any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of the principal of or Additional Interest, if any, on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of
the Securities or this Indenture. The Trustee may maintain a
proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not
impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law. SECTION 8.4. WAIVER OF DEFAULTS AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT. Subject to Sections 8.7 and 11.2, the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Securities then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing default or Event of Default and its consequence, except a default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or
Additional Interest, if any, on any Security, a failure by the Company to convert any Securities into Common Stock or any default or Event of Default in respect of any provision of this Indenture or the Securities which, under Section 11.2, cannot
be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected. When a default or Event of Default is waived, it is cured and ceases. SECTION 8.5. CONTROL BY MAJORITY. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture, that the Trustee determines may be unduly
prejudicial to the rights of another Holder or the Trustee, or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability unless the Trustee is offered indemnity satisfactory to it; provided , however , that the Trustee may take any other action
deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction. SECTION 8.6. LIMITATIONS ON SUITS. A Holder may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities (except actions for payment of overdue principal, premium, if any, or Additional Interest, if any, for the conversion of the
Securities pursuant to Article 4) unless: 

(1) 
 
 the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default; 
 41 

(2) the Holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Securities make a
written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such
Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee reasonable indemnity to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity; and (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to
the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding. A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Securityholder or to obtain a preference or priority over such other
Securityholder. SECTION 8.7. RIGHTS OF HOLDERS TO RECEIVE
PAYMENT AND TO CONVERT. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Security to receive payment of the principal of and Additional Interest, if any, on the Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Security and this Indenture, to convert

of the Holder. SECTION 8.8. COLLECTION SUIT BY TRUSTEE.
 If an Event of Default in the payment of principal or
Additional Interest, if any, specified in clause (1) or (2) of Section 8.1 occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company or another obligor on the Securities for the
whole amount of principal and accrued Additional Interest, if any, remaining unpaid, together with, to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful interest on overdue principal and overdue installments of Additional Interest, if any, in each
case at a rate of 3 per annum and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
 SECTION 8.9. TRUSTEE MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.
 The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other
papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders

directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 9.7, and to the

 42 

distributions, dividends, money, securities and other property which the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceedings, whether in liquidation or
under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to, or, on behalf of any Holder, to authorize, accept or adopt any plan of reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

out the money in the following order: First, to the Trustee
for amounts due under Section 9.7; Second, to the holders of
Senior Indebtedness to the extent required by Article 5; Third, to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for principal and Additional Interest, if any, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for principal and

In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any
party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard

of this Indenture or the waiver of certain defaults under this Indenture; and (k) modify any of the provisions of this Section or Section 8.4, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the
Holder of each outstanding Security affected thereby. It shall
not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 11.2 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 11.2 becomes
effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect
the validity of any such amendment, supplement or waiver. An amendment or supplement under this Section 11.2 or under Section 11.1 may not make any change that adversely affects the rights under Article 5 of any holder of an issue of Senior
Indebtedness unless the holders of that issue, pursuant to its terms, consent to the change. SECTION 11.3. COMPLIANCE WITH TRUST INDENTURE ACT. Every amendment to or supplement of this Indenture or the Securities shall comply with the TIA as in effect at the date of such amendment or supplement. SECTION 11.4. REVOCATION AND EFFECT OF CONSENTS. Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the
Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder s Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent
Holder may revoke the consent as to its Security or portion of a Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind
every Securityholder, unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (a) through (k) of Section 11.2. In that case the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of
a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder s Security. 
 51 

SECTION 11.5. NOTATION ON OR EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES. If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Security, the
Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security about the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so
determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms. SECTION 11.6. TRUSTEE TO SIGN AMENDMENTS, ETC. The Trustee shall sign any amendment or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 11 if the amendment or supplemental indenture does not
adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may, in its sole discretion, but need not sign it. In signing or refusing to sign such amendment or supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall be
entitled to receive and, subject to Section 9.1, shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Company may not sign an
amendment or supplement indenture until the Board of Directors approves it. SECTION 11.7. EFFECT OF SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and
every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby. ARTICLE 12 MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 12.1. TRUST INDENTURE ACT CONTROLS. If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with the

[FORM OF REVERSE SIDE OF SECURITY] MAGMA DESIGN AUTOMATION, INC. ZERO COUPON CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE MAY 15, 2008 1. INTEREST Magma Design Automation, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company , which term shall include any successor corporation under the Indenture
hereinafter referred to), will not pay interest on the principal amount of this Note other than Additional Interest, if any, accrued or payable as provided in the Registration Rights Agreement. 2. METHOD OF PAYMENT The Company shall pay Additional Interest, if any, on this Note to the
person who is the Holder of this Note at the close of business on May 1 or November 1, as the case may be, preceding the related Additional Interest payment date. The Holder must surrender this Note to a Paying Agent to collect payment of principal.
The Company will pay principal and Additional Interest, if any, in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. The Company may, however, pay principal and Additional Interest, if
any, in respect of any Certificated Security by check or wire payable in such money; provided , however , that a Holder with an aggregate principal amount in excess of 2,000,000 will be paid by wire transfer in immediately available
funds at the election of such Holder if such Holder has provided wire transfer instructions to the Company. The Company may mail an Additional Interest check, if any, to the Holder s registered address. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as
this Note is registered in the name of a Depositary or its nominee, all payments hereon shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the Depositary or its nominee. 3. PAYING AGENT, REGISTRAR AND CONVERSION AGENT 
 Initially, U.S. Bank National Association (the Trustee , which
term shall include any successor trustee under the Indenture hereinafter referred to) will act as Paying Agent, Registrar and Conversion Agent. The Company may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Conversion Agent without notice to the Holder. The
Company or any of its Subsidiaries may, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Indenture, act as Paying Agent or Registrar. 4. INDENTURE, LIMITATIONS This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes Due May 15, 2008
(the Notes ), issued under an Indenture dated as of May 22, 2003 (together with any supplemental indentures thereto, the Indenture ), between the Company and the Trustee. The terms of this Note include those stated in the
Indenture and those required by or made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, as in effect on the date of the Indenture. This Note is subject to all such terms, and the Holder of this Note is referred to
the Indenture and said Act for a statement of them. The Notes
are subordinated unsecured obligations of the Company limited to 180,000,000 aggregate principal amount. The Indenture does not limit other debt of the Company, secured or unsecured, including Senior Indebtedness. 
 A-6 

5. PURCHASE OF NOTES AT OPTION OF HOLDER UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL At the option of the Holder and subject to the terms and conditions of the
Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to purchase all or any part specified by the Holder (so long as the principal amount of such part is 1,000 or an integral multiple of 1,000 in excess thereof) of the Notes held by such Holder on the
date that is 30 Business Days after the occurrence of a Change in Control, at a purchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount thereof together with accrued Additional Interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the Change in Control Purchase
Date. The Holder shall have the right to withdraw any Change in Control Purchase Notice (in whole or in a portion thereof that is 1,000 or an integral multiple of 1,000 in excess thereof) at any time prior to the close of business on the Business
Day next preceding the Change in Control Purchase Date by delivering a written notice of withdrawal to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. 6. CONVERSION A Holder of a Note may convert the principal amount of such Note (or any portion thereof equal to 1,000 or any integral multiple of 1,000 in excess
thereof) into shares of Common Stock at any time prior to the close of business on the Final Maturity Date; provided , however , that if the Note is subject to purchase upon a Change in Control, the conversion right will terminate at the
close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Change in Control Purchase Date for such Note or such earlier date as the Holder presents such Note for purchase (unless the Company shall default in making the Change in Control
Purchase Price, when due, in which case the conversion right shall terminate at the close of business on the date such default is cured and such Note is purchased). The initial Conversion Price is 22.86 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances as provided in the
Indenture. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a Note is determined by dividing the principal amount of the Note or portion thereof converted by the Conversion Price in effect on the Conversion Date. No fractional shares
will be issued upon conversion; in lieu thereof, an amount will be paid in cash based upon the Closing Price (as defined in the Indenture) of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately prior to the Conversion Date. To convert a Note, a Holder must (a) complete and manually sign the
conversion notice set forth below and deliver such notice to a Conversion Agent, (b) surrender the Note to a Conversion Agent, (c) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by a Registrar or a Conversion Agent, and (d) pay
any transfer or similar tax, if required. Notes so surrendered for conversion (in whole or in part) during the period from the close of business on any regular record date to the opening of business on the next succeeding Additional Interest payment
date, if any, (excluding Notes or portions thereof subject to purchase upon a Change in Control on a Change in Control Purchase Date, during the period beginning at the close of business on a regular record date and ending at the opening of business
on the first Business Day after the next succeeding Additional Interest payment date, if any, or if such Additional Interest payment date, if any, is not a Business Day, the second such Business Day) shall also be accompanied by payment in funds
acceptable to the Company of an amount equal to the Additional Interest, if any, payable on such Additional Interest payment date, if any, on the principal amount of such Note then being converted, and such Additional Interest, if any, shall be
payable to such registered Holder notwithstanding the conversion of such Note, subject to the provisions of this Indenture relating to the payment of defaulted interest, if any, by the Company. If the Company defaults in the payment of interest
payable on such Additional Interest payment date, if any, the Company shall promptly repay such funds to such Holder. A Holder may convert a portion of a Note equal to 1,000 or any integral multiple thereof. 
 A-7 

A Note in respect of which a Holder had delivered a Change in Control Purchase Notice exercising the
option of such Holder to require the Company to purchase such Note may be converted only if the Change in Control Purchase Notice is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. 7. SUBORDINATION The indebtedness evidenced by the Notes is, to the extent and in the manner
provided in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company. Any Holder by accepting this Note agrees to and shall be bound by such subordination provisions and
authorizes the Trustee to give them effect. In addition to all other rights of Senior Indebtedness described in the Indenture, the Senior Indebtedness shall continue to be Senior Indebtedness and entitled to the benefits of the subordination
provisions irrespective of any amendment, modification or waiver of any terms of any instrument relating to the Senior Indebtedness or any extension or renewal of the Senior Indebtedness. 8. DENOMINATIONS, TRANSFER, EXCHANGE The Notes are in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of 1,000 and integral multiples of 1,000. A Holder may
register the transfer of or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes or other governmental charges that
may be imposed in relation thereto by law or permitted by the Indenture. 9. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS The
Holder of a Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. 10. UNCLAIMED MONEY If money
for the payment of principal or Additional Interest, if any, remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent will pay the money back to the Company at its written request, subject to applicable unclaimed property law. After that,
Holders entitled to money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person. 11. AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, and an existing default or Event of Default and its consequence or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may be waived in a particular instance with the consent of the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Without the consent of or notice to any Holder, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes to, among other things, cure any
ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder. 
 A-8 

12. SUCCESSOR ENTITY When a successor corporation assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the Notes and the Indenture in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the predecessor corporation (except in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture) be released from those obligations. 13. DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES Under the Indenture, an Event of Default includes: (i) default for 30 days in payment of Additional Interest, if any, on any

the Notes; (iv) default in the payment of certain indebtedness of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary and (v) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary. If an Event of Default (other
than as a result of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare all unpaid
principal to the date of acceleration on the Notes then outstanding to be due and payable immediately, all as and to the extent provided in the Indenture. If an Event of Default occurs as a result of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization of the Company, unpaid principal of the Notes then outstanding shall become due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, all as and to the extent provided in the Indenture.
Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Notes. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal or Additional
Interest, if any) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interests. The Company is required to file periodic reports with the Trustee as to the absence of default. 14. TRUSTEE DEALINGS WITH THE COMPANY U.S. Bank National Association, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to,
accept deposits from and perform services for the Company or an Affiliate of the Company, and may otherwise deal with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company, as if it were not the Trustee. 15. NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall
not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture nor for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. The Holder of this Note by accepting this Note waives and
releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of this Note. 16. AUTHENTICATION This Note shall not be valid until the Trustee or an authenticating agent manually signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Note.

not reasonably object, as reasonably requested by (i) the Initial Purchasers in the event that it is participating in the Shelf Registration Statement or (ii) the Trustee on behalf of a majority in interest of the registered Holders.

The Company will bear its internal expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and
expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expenses of any annual audit and the fees and expenses of any person, including special experts, retained by the Company. (b) In connection with any Shelf Registration Statement required by this
Agreement, the Company will bear or reimburse the Notice Holders for the reasonable fees and disbursements of one firm of legal counsel, which shall initially be Wilson Sonsini Goodrich Rosati, P.C., but which may, with the written consent of
the Initial Purchasers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), be another nationally recognized law firm experienced in securities law matters designated by the Company. 4. Indemnification. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Registrable Securities and each person, if any, who controls such Holder within the
meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each Holder and such controlling persons are referred to collectively as the Indemnified Parties from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or
several, or any actions in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions relating to purchases and sales of the Registrable Securities) to which each Indemnified Party may become subject under
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Shelf Registration
Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus relating to a Shelf Registration, or arise out of, or are based 

upon, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and shall reimburse, as incurred, the Indemnified Parties for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof;
 provided , however , that (i) the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission made in a Shelf Registration Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus relating to a Shelf Registration in reliance upon and in conformity with written information pertaining
to such Holder and furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion therein and (ii) with respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in any preliminary prospectus
relating to a Shelf Registration Statement, the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the
Registrable Securities concerned, to the extent that a prospectus relating to such Registrable Securities was required to be delivered by such Holder under the Securities Act in connection with such purchase and any such loss, claim, damage or
liability of such Holder results from the fact that there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Registrable Securities to such person, a copy of the final prospectus if the Company had
previously furnished copies thereof to such Holder; provided further , however , that this indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to such Indemnified Party. The Company shall
also indemnify any underwriters, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the
Holders if requested by such Holders. (b) Each Holder of
Registrable Securities, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act from and against any losses, claims,
damages or liabilities or any actions in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions
arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Shelf Registration Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus relating to a
Shelf Registration, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or
omission or alleged untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information pertaining to such Holder and furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion therein; and,
subject to the limitation set forth immediately preceding this clause, shall reimburse, as incurred, the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such controlling person in connection with investigating or
defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Holder may otherwise have to the Company or any of its controlling persons. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 4 of
notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including a governmental investigation), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 4, notify the indemnifying
party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in
paragraph (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that
it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to
the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 4 for any legal
or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation, subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party s election to assume the defense of the indemnified
party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel) and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel (and local counsel) if (i) the
use of counsel chosen by 

the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in,
or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of
the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the
indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement
includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action, and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf
of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided
for in this Section 4 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsections (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the
indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the
one hand or such Holder or such other indemnified party, as the case may be, on the other, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid by
an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4(d), the Holders of Registrable Securities shall not be required to contribute any
amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such Holders from the sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement exceeds the amount of damages which such Holders have otherwise been required to
pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this subsection (d), each person, if any, who controls such indemnified party within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to
contribution as such indemnified party and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. (e) The agreements contained in this Section 4 shall survive the sale of the
Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 5. Additional Interest Under Certain Circumstances. 
 (a) Additional interest (the Additional 
Interest with respect to the Registrable Securities shall be assessed as follows if any of the following events occur (each such event in clauses (i) through (iv) below being herein called a Registration Default ):

(i) 
 
 the Initial Shelf Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not filed with the Commission on or prior to the Filing Deadline; 

(ii) 
 
 the Initial Shelf Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the Effectiveness Deadline Date;

(iii) 
 
 the Company has failed to perform its obligations set forth in Section 1(d) within the time period required therein; or 

(iv) 
 
 any Shelf Registration Statement required by this Agreement has been declared effective by the Commission but such Shelf Registration Statement or related prospectus thereafter
ceases to be effective or useable (subject to the Company s right to suspend the use of the Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus as set forth in Section 2(h)) in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and during the periods
specified herein and (A) the Company does not cure the Shelf Registration Statement within five (5) Business Days (which shall not be deemed to extend the incurrence and accrual of any obligation to pay Additional Interest beyond the time provided
for in the last sentence of Section 2(h)) after it ceases to be effective or useable by a post-effective amendment or additional Shelf Registration Statement being filed and declared effective or a report filed pursuant to the Exchange Act or (B) if
applicable, the Company does not terminate any Deferral Period within the time provided for in the last sentence of Section 2(h). Each of the foregoing will constitute a Registration Default whatever the reason for any such event and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is beyond the control of
the Company or pursuant to operation of law or as a result of any action or inaction by the Commission. Additional Interest shall accrue on the Registrable Securities from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but
excluding the date on which all such Registration Defaults have been cured, at a rate of 0.50 per annum (the Additional Interest Rate of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that are Registrable Securities. In the case of
Notes that have been converted into or exchanged for Underlying Common Stock, Additional Interest shall accrue at a per annum rate equal to 0.50 of the Applicable Conversion Price of such shares of Underlying Common Stock that are Registrable
Securities. In the case of Additional Interest accruing solely as a result of a Registration Default of the type described in Section 5(a)(iii), such Additional Interest shall be paid only to the Holders that have delivered Notice and Questionnaires
that caused the Company to incur the obligations set forth in Section 1(d) the non-performance of which is the basis of such Registration Default. Any Additional Interest accrued with respect to any Note or portion thereof converted into Underlying
Common Stock on a conversion date prior to the interest payment date as set forth in Section 5(b) below, shall, in any such event, be paid to the Holder who submitted such Note or portion thereof for conversion on the applicable conversion date (or
promptly following the conversion date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Additional Interest shall accrue as to any Registrable Security from and after the earlier of (x) the date such security is no longer a Registrable Security and (y) the
expiration of the Effectiveness Period. The rate of accrual of the Additional Interest with respect to any period shall not exceed the rate provided for in this paragraph notwithstanding the occurrence of multiple concurrent Registration Defaults.
Following the cure of all Registration Defaults requiring the payment by the Company of Additional Interest to the Holders of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section, the accrual of Additional Interest will cease (without in any way limiting
the effect of any subsequent Registration Default requiring the payment of Additional Interest by the Company). No other monetary damages shall be available to the Holders of Registrable Securities for a Registration Default. The Trustee shall be entitled, on behalf of Holders of Notes or Underlying
Common Stock, to seek any available remedy for the enforcement of this Agreement, including for the payment of any Additional Interest. All of the Company s obligations set forth in this Section 5 that are outstanding with respect to any Registrable Security at the time such security
ceases to be a Registrable Security shall survive until such time as all such obligations with respect to such security have been satisfied in full. The parties hereto agree that the Additional Interest provided for in this Section 5 constitutes a reasonable estimate of the damages that may be incurred
by Holders of Registrable Securities by reason of the failure of the Initial Shelf Registration Statement to be filed or declared effective or available for effecting resales of Registrable Securities in accordance with the provisions hereof.
 (b) Any amounts of Additional Interest due pursuant to Section
5(a) will be payable in cash semiannually in arrears with the first semiannual payment due on the first May 15 or November 15 on which such Additional Interest 

begins to accrue. The amount of Additional Interest will be determined by multiplying the applicable Additional Interest Rate by the principal amount of the
Registrable Securities or the Applicable Conversion Price of the Registrable Securities, as applicable, and further multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days such Additional Interest Rate was applicable during such
period (determined on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months), and the denominator of which is 360. The Registrable Securities entitled to payment of Additional Interest shall be determined as of the Business Day immediately
preceding the next payment date for Additional Interest with respect to the Registrable Securities. 6. Rules 144 and 144A . The Company shall use its best efforts to file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act in a timely manner and, if at any time the Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any Holder, make publicly available other information so long as necessary to permit sales of their securities
pursuant to Rules 144 and 144A. The Company covenants that it will take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration
under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rules 144 and 144A (including the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(4)). The Company will provide a copy of this Agreement to prospective purchasers of Notes identified to the
Company by the Initial Purchasers upon request. Upon the request of any Holder of Notes, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Section 6 shall be deemed to require the Company to register any of its securities pursuant to the Exchange Act. 7. Underwritten Registrations . If any of the Registrable Securities covered by any Shelf Registration are to be sold in an underwritten offering,
the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will administer the offering Managing Underwriters will be selected by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Registrable
Securities to be included in such offering (provided that Holders of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Notes shall not be deemed holders of Common Stock, but shall be deemed to be holders of the aggregate principal amount of Notes from
which such Common Stock was converted), provided , however , that such Managing Underwriters will be reasonably acceptable to the Company. No person may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person s Registrable Securities on
the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and
other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 8. Miscellaneous. (a)
 Remedies . The Company acknowledges and agrees that any failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under Section 1 and 2 hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no
adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce
the Company s obligations under Sections 1 and 2 hereof. The Company further agrees to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. (b) No Inconsistent Agreements . The Company will not on or after the
date of this Agreement enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof and will not enter into any agreement
granting the holders of Common Stock rights to participate in the Initial Shelf Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement. The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the
rights granted to the holders of the Company s securities under any agreement in effect on the date hereof, except that the holders of 9,366,947 shares of the Common Stock (on an as-converted basis) may have the right to participate in the
Initial Shelf Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement (the Piggy-Back Holders ). The Company represents and warrants that, other than Holders of Notes, the Piggy-Back Holders are the only holders of shares of
Common Stock (on an as-converted basis) that have the right to participate in the Initial Shelf Registrations Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement. The Company agrees to use all reasonable efforts 

to as soon as practicable obtain a waiver from the Piggy-Back Holders, pursuant to which such holders agree not to participate in the Initial Shelf
Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement; provided, that the Company shall not be required to pay the Piggy-Back Holders any consideration for such waiver. In the event the Company is unable to obtain such waiver and any Piggy-Back
Holders request that they participate in the Initial Shelf Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement, then the Company will use all reasonable efforts to file a new Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to which such Piggy-Back
Holders can participate. (c) Amendments and Waivers .
The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, except by the Company and the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Registrable Securities affected by such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consents (provided that Holders of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Notes shall not be deemed holders of Common Stock, but shall be deemed to
be holders of the aggregate principal amount of Notes from which such Common Stock was converted). (d) Notices . All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand delivery, first-class mail,

of Holders of a specified percentage of principal amount of Registrable Securities is required hereunder, Registrable Securities held by the Company or its affiliates (other than subsequent Holders of Registrable Securities if such subsequent
Holders are deemed to be affiliates solely by reason of their holdings of such Registrable Securities) shall not be counted in determining whether such consent or approval was given by the Holders of such required percentage.

Initial Purchasers a counterpart hereof, whereupon this instrument, along with all counterparts, will become a binding agreement between the Initial Purchasers and the Company in accordance with its terms.
