Item 1. Business
 --------

GENERAL

 Financial Express Corporation (the "Company") was originally incorporated
in the state of Nevada on January 5, 1989 as Harley Equities, Ltd., to purchase,
merge with or acquire any business or assets which management believed had the
potential for being profitable. During May of 1991, through a series of
transactions, Harley acquired all of the outstanding stock of Financial Express
Corporation, a company organized to develop and commercialize a distinctive
nationwide service for processing and clearing checks and related bank
transactions. The only assets of the acquired Company consisted of intangible
assets comprised of intellectual properties, vendor relationships and customer
relationships established during the development of the service.

 Concurrent with the acquisition, the Company changed the Corporate name to
Financial Express, Corporation. The Company expended all of its liquidity during
1991 in the search for financing in order to properly develop and market its
product.

 During 1995, the development of this business was abandoned and the
intangible assets were written off.

 The Company is currently in the process of searching for financing and/or
potential merger candidates to carry on the Company's existing or other business
opportunities.

 The Company currently has no employees.

Item 2. Properties
 ----------

 The Company does not currently own or lease any properties. The directors
provide office space at no charge to the Company.

 Related Stockholder Matters
 ---------------------------

 (a) Market Information

 There is no market information established for the Company.

 (b) Holders

The approximate number of shareholders of record of the Common Stock of the
Company as of December 31, 1995 was 35.

(c) Dividends

 The Company has never paid a cash dividend and intends to retain earnings,
if any, for use in its business and does not presently intend to pay any cash
dividends on its Common Stock.

 (d) Stock transactions

 On May 1, 1991, the Registrant issued 3,500,000 shares of its Common Stock
in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of Financial
Express Corporation, Westlake, California, a business recently organized to
develop and commercialize a distinctive nationwide service of processing the
clearance of checks and related bank items. Prior to the completion of such
transaction, there was issued and outstanding 138,000 Common Shares of the
Registrant. The shareholders of Financial Express Corporation acquiring the
shares of the Registrant are Phil E. Pearce, Frank G. Baldwin and D. Lee Falls,
who acquired 1,166,667, 1,166,666 and 1,166,666 shares, respectively of the
Registrant. Simultaneously with the completion of the transaction, Messrs.
Pearce, Falls and Baldwin were elected directors of the Company and following
completion of the transaction Howard Bronson, Isidor Friedenberg and Donald
Weinberger resigned as officers and directors of the Company. Such resignations
did not involve any disagreement with the Registrant. The Board of Directors has
elected Mr. Pearce, Chairman, Mr. Falls, President, and Mr. Baldwin, Executive
Vice President and Secretary of the Company. Following completion of the
transaction, each of them own 31.6 of the issued and outstanding Common Stock
of the Registrant.

(d) Stock transactions (continued)

In connection with these transactions, the holders of Underwriter's Unit
Purchase Warrant Agreements and Certificates issued by the Registrant in
connection with the Registrant's initial public offering in June, 1990, agreed
to cancel their demand registration rights and limit their piggy-back
registration rights such that they not be exercisable after expiration of the
Registrant's Class A or Class B Redeemable Stock Purchase Warrants. In addition,
Westminster Securities Corporation, who acted as underwriter in connection with
the Registrant's firm commitment public offering, agreed to a modification of
Section 5 of the Registrant's Underwriting Agreement respecting the
underwriter's "first right of refusal" on future offerings to limit such right
to public offerings of the securities of the Registrant in amounts not to exceed
 5,000,000.

The Company's activity during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995
consisted primarily of exploring various financing and investment opportunities.

 As discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements, the Company's continued
existence is dependent upon its ability to resolve its liquidity problems by the
acquisition of additional equity financing, or the achievement of profitable
operations. Management believes that profitable operations will be achieved
within the next two years, based upon the Company's current planned operating
activities made possible by various possible equity and debt capital options.

 Liquidity. The Company currently has a short-term liquidity problem, as
evidenced by its current working capital deficit of (8,300). However,
management is confident that it will able to raise additional equity capital,
due to the prospects for success with the possible new businesses.

 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 1994

 Operating expenses, exclusive of amortization, were insignificant due to
company's inactivity.

 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 1993

 Operating expenses, exclusive of amortization, were insignificant due to
the company's lack of working capital. The Company has no fixed operational
financial commitments and management was able to avoid incurring any significant
expenses during the year.

To the Board of Directors
Financial Express Corporation

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Financial Express Corporation
at December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the related statements of operations,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years ended December 31,
1995, 1994 and 1993. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Financial Express Corporation
at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of operations, changes in
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years ended December 31,
1995, 1994, and 1993 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

The accompanying 1995 financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in note 1, at December
31, 1995 the Company has no working capital and faces uncertainty with respect
to the prospects of acquiring and/or operating a successful business in the
future. These facts raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. Management's plans as to these matters are
described in note 1. The 1995 financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993

1. Summary of significant accounting principles
 --------------------------------------------

 General
 -------

 Financial Express Corporation (the "Company") was originally
 incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 5, 1989, as Harley
 Equities, Inc. ("Harley"), and was formed to purchase, merge with or
 acquire any business or assets which management believed had the
 potential for being profitable. Through a series or transactions, Harley
 acquired all of the stock of Financial Express Corporation, a Delaware
 corporation organized to develop and commercialize a distinctive
 nationwide service for processing and clearing checks and other bank
 transactions. The only assets of the acquired Company consisted of
 intangible assets comprised of intellectual properties, vendor
 relationships and customer relationships established during the
 development of the service. In connection with the transaction, the
 Company changed its name to Financial Express Corporation.

 During 1995, the development of the check clearing business was
 abandoned and the intangible assets were fully amortized.

 Presentation
 ------------

 The Company's 1996 financial statements have been presented on the
 basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of
 assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
 business. As shown in the financial statements, the Company has a
 working capital deficit, and currently has not been able to bring its
 product to the marketplace. While the Company expects profits over the
 long term, the Company is currently seeking additional working capital
 and equity capital to fund the marketing and further development of the
 Company's product. The Company is continuing to pursue various
 investment and merger opportunities in its efforts to reach its
 investment and business objectives.

 The Company's continued existence is dependent upon its ability to
 finance continued product development and marketing programs by the
 acquisition of additional equity or debt financing, or in the
 procurement of a suitable merger candidate. While pursuing such
 opportunities, the Company must continue to operate on the limited
 resources by the Company's officers.

 stock in exchange for all the issued and outstanding common stock of

 During 1990, the Company retained Howard Bronson and Co. to act as its

 stock to Howard Bronson and Co.
