Item
1. Description of Business. 

This
annual report contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements
relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some
cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may",
"should", "expects", "plans", "anticipates", "believes", "estimates",
"predicts", "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other
comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the
risks in the section entitled "Risk Factors", that may cause our company's or
our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements
to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements. 

Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are
reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance
or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the
securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the
forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual
results. 

Our
financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US and are prepared
in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles. 

In this
annual report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in
United States dollars and all references to "common shares" refer to the common
shares in our capital stock. 

As used
in this annual report, the terms "we", "us", "our", and "Victory Eagle" mean
Victory Eagle Resources Corp., unless otherwise indicated. 

Corporate
History 

We were
incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 18, 2004. We are engaged in the
acquisition and exploration of mining properties. We maintain our statutory
registered agent's office at Suite 880-50 West Liberty Street, Reno, Nevada
89501 and our business office is located at 133 Atlas Toronto, Ontario M6C
3P4. 

Other
than as set out herein, we have not been involved in any bankruptcy,
receivership or similar proceedings, nor have we been a party to any material
reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase or sale of a significant
amount of assets not in the ordinary course of our business. 

Our
Current Business 

We are an
exploration stage resource company, and are primarily engaged in the exploration
for and development in the properties in which we have acquired
interests. We do not currently have any properties. We are
actively pursuing an acquisition of a resource property. 

During
the year ended July 31, 2009, all mineral property options owned by the Company
expired. An impairment charge of 6,500 was recorded to reflect this,
and is included in general and administrative expenses. 

Product
Research and Development 

Our
business plan is focused on the long-term exploration and development of our
mineral properties. 

-3- 

We do not
anticipate that we will expend any significant funds on research and development
over the next twelve months ending July 31, 2010. 

Employees 

Currently
there are no full time or part-time employees of our company (other than our
directors and officer who, at present, have not signed employment or consulting
agreements with us). We do not expect any material changes in the number of
employees over the next 12 month period (although we may enter into employment
or consulting agreements with our officer or directors). We do and will continue
to outsource contract employment as needed. However, if we are successful in our
initial and any subsequent drilling programs we may retain additional
employees. 

Purchase
or Sale of Equipment 

We do not
intend to purchase any significant equipment over the next twelve months ending
July 31, 2010. 

Competition 

The gold
mining industry is fragmented. We compete with other exploration companies
looking for gold. We are one of the smallest exploration companies in existence.
We are an infinitely small participant in the gold mining market. While we
compete with other exploration companies, there is no competition for the
exploration or removal of minerals from our property. Readily available gold
markets exist in Canada and around the world for the sale of gold. 

We may
not have access to all of the supplies and materials we need to begin
exploration that could cause us to delay or suspend operations. Competition and
unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry could result in
occasional spot shortages of supplies, such as explosives, and certain equipment
such as bulldozers and excavators that we might need to conduct exploration. We
have not attempted to locate or negotiate with any suppliers of products,
equipment or materials. We will attempt to locate products, equipment and
materials after this offering is complete. If we cannot find the products and
equipment we need, we will have to suspend our exploration plans until we do
find the products and equipment we need. 

Government
Regulations and Supervision 

Our
future mineral exploration program will be subject to applicable rules and
regulations of the jurisdiction in which we hold properties. As of
July 31, 2009 we do not hold rights to any mineral properties. Our future
property will likely be subject to rules similar to the Mineral Tenure Act (British
Columbia) and Regulation. This act sets forth rules for: 

Locating
claims 

Posting
claims 

Working
claims 

Reporting
work performed 

We also
anticipate being subject to regulations similar to the British Columbia Mineral
Exploration Code (the 
"Code" that tells us how and where we can explore for minerals. We must
comply with these laws to operate our business. The purpose of the Code is to assist persons
who wish to explore for minerals in British Columbia to understand the process
whereby exploration activities are permitted and regulated. The Code establishes province
wide standards for mineral exploration and development activities. The Code also manages and
administers exploration and development activities to ensure maximum extraction
with a minimum of environmental disturbance. The Code does not apply to
certain exploration work we will be conducting. Specifically, work that does not
involve mechanical disturbance of the surface including: 

-4- 

Prospecting
using hand-held tools 

Geological
and geochemical surveying 

Airborne
geophysical surveying 

Hand-trenching
without the use of explosives 

The
establishment of gridlines that do not require the felling of trees 

Exploration
activities that we intend on carrying out which are subject to the provisions of
the Code are as
follows: 

Drilling,
trenching and excavating using machinery 

Disturbance
of the ground by mechanical means 

Compliance
with these rules and regulations will require us to meet the minimum annual work
requirements. Also, prior to proceeding with any exploration work subject to
the Code we must apply
for a notice of work permit. In this notice we will be required to set out the
location, nature, extent and duration of the proposed exploration activities.
The notice is submitted to the regional office of the Mines Branch, Energy
Division. 

We
currently do not have any pending applications for government approval of our
exploration program. We only require one permit for exploration and we have not
yet applied for it since it is not required until later stages of exploration
(i.e. drilling). We estimate that this exploration permit can be obtained within
2 weeks. 

Environmental
Law 

The Code
deals with environmental matters relating to the exploration and development of
mining properties. The goal of this Act is to protect the environment through a
series of regulations affecting: 

1. Health
and Safety 

2.
Archaeological Sites 

3.
Exploration Access 

We are
responsible to provide a safe working environment, to not disrupt archaeological
sites, and to conduct our activities to prevent unnecessary damage to the
property. 

We
anticipate no discharge of water into active stream, creek, river, lake or any
other body of water regulated by environmental law or regulation. No endangered
species will be disturbed. Restoration of the disturbed land will be completed
according to law. All holes, pits and shafts will be sealed upon abandonment of
the property. It is difficult to estimate the cost of compliance with the
environmental law since the full nature and extent of our proposed activities
cannot be determined until we start our operations and we know what that will
involve from an environmental standpoint. 

RISK
FACTORS 

Much of
the information included in this current report includes or is based upon
estimates, projections or other "forward looking statements". Such
forward looking statements include any projections or estimates made by us and
our management in connection with our business operations. While
these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based,
are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction
of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially,
from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future
performance suggested herein. 

-5- 

Such
estimates, projections or other "forward looking statements" involve various
risks and uncertainties as outlined below. We caution the reader that
important factors in some cases have affected and, in the future, could
materially affect actual results and cause actual results to differ materially
from the results expressed in any such estimates, projections or other "forward
looking statements". 

Our
common shares are considered speculative during the development of our new
business operations. Prospective investors should consider carefully
the risk factors set out below. 

Because
of the unique difficulties and uncertainties inherent in mineral exploration
ventures, we face a high risk of business failure. 

Potential
investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new
mineral exploration companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises.
The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses,
difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the
exploration of the mineral properties that we plan to undertake. These potential
problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to
exploration, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current
estimates. The expenditures to be made by us in the exploration of the mineral
claim may not result in the discovery of mineral deposits. Problems such as
unusual or unexpected formations and other conditions are involved in mineral
exploration and often result in unsuccessful exploration efforts. If the results
of our exploration do not reveal viable commercial mineralization, we may decide
to abandon our claim and acquire new claims for new exploration. The acquisition
of additional claims will be dependent upon us possessing capital resources at
the time in order to purchase such claims. If no funding is available, we may be
forced to abandon our operations. 

We
need to continue as a going concern if our business is to succeed, if we do not
we will go out of business. 

Our
independent accountant's report to our audited financial statements for the
period ended July 31, 2009 indicates that there are a number of factors that
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 Such factors identified in the report are our accumulated deficit since
inception, our failure to attain profitable operations and our dependence upon
adequate financing to pay our liabilities. If we are not able to continue
as a going concern, it is likely investors will lose their
investments. 

We
have limited operating history and losses that we expect to continue into the
future. 

We have
not yet realized any revenues. We have limited operating history upon which an
evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Our net loss since
inception is 135,032. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and
positive cash flow is dependent upon the following: 

Our
 ability to locate a profitable resource
 property; 

Our
 ability to generate revenues; and 

Our
 ability to reduce exploration
costs. 

Based
upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods. This
will happen because there are expenses associated with exploration of our
mineral properties. We may not be successful in generating revenues in the
future. Failure to generate revenues will cause us to go out of
business. 

If
we do not raise enough money for exploration we will have to delay exploration
or go out of business. 

We are in
the very early exploration stage and we need additional financing before we are
able to continue our exploration efforts. We have not made any arrangements for
financing and we may be unable to raise financing. If we are not able to raise
any financing we will have to delay our exploration or go out of
business. 

-6- 

We
may not have access to all of the supplies and materials we need to begin
exploration that could cause us to delay or suspend operations. 

Competition
and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry could result in
occasional spot shortages of supplies, such as explosives, and certain equipment
such as bulldozers and excavators that we might need to conduct exploration. We
have not attempted to locate or negotiate with any suppliers of products,
equipment or materials. We will attempt to locate products, equipment and
materials after this offering is complete. If we cannot find the products and
equipment we need, we will have to suspend our exploration plans until we do
find the products and equipment we need. 

Because
the SEC imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokers who deal in
our shares that are penny stocks, some brokers may be unwilling to trade them.
This means that you may have difficulty in reselling your shares and may cause
the price of the shares to decline. 

Our
shares qualify as penny stocks and are covered by Section 15(g) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which imposes additional sales practice
requirements on broker/dealers who sell our securities in this offering or in
the aftermarket. In particular, prior to selling a penny stock, broker/dealers
must give the prospective customer a risk disclosure document that: contains a
description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in
both public offerings and secondary trading; contains a description of the
broker/dealers' duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available
to the customer with respect to violations of such duties or other requirements
of Federal securities laws; contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a
dealer market, including "bid" and "ask" prices for penny stocks and the
significance of the spread between the bid and ask prices; contains the toll
free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions established pursuant
to section 15(A)(i); defines significant terms used in the disclosure document
or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and contains such other
information, and is in such form (including language, type size, and format), as
the SEC requires by rule or regulation. Further, for sales of our securities,
the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination and receive from
you a written agreement before making a sale to you. Because of the imposition
of the foregoing additional sales practices, it is possible that brokers will
not want to make a market in our shares. This could prevent you from reselling
your shares and may cause the price of the shares to decline. 

We
have no known ore reserves and we cannot guarantee we will find any gold or if
we find gold, that production will be profitable. 

We have
no known ore reserves. We have not identified any gold on the
property and we cannot guarantee that we will ever find any gold. We
did not rely upon any expert advice in selecting a prospective property for the
exploration. Even if we find that there is gold on a property, we
cannot guarantee that we will be able to recover the gold. Even if we
recover the gold, we cannot guarantee that we will make a profit. If
we cannot find gold or it is not economical to recover the gold, we will have to
cease operations. 

Because
we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our exploration and
consequently may not find mineralized material. If we do not find
mineralized material, we will cease operations. 

Because
we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our
exploration. Because we may have to limit our exploration, we may not
find mineralized material, although a property we acquire may contain
mineralized material. If we do not find mineralized material, we will
cease operations. 

Ludvik
Rolin, our former director, owns a total of 2,000,000 shares of our
company. He may sell some of his shares in the future, which could cause the
price of our common stock to fall, which will reduce the value of your
shares. 

Ludvik
Rolin, our former officer and director, owns a total of 2,000,000
shares of stock, which is 73 of the issued and
outstanding number of shares, as of October 15, 2009. Subject to all holding
periods under applicable securities laws, he will likely sell a portion or all
of his stock in the future. If he does sell his stock into the market, the sales
may cause the market price of the stock to drop. 

-7- 

As
we face intense competition in the mining industry, we will have to compete with
our competitors for financing and for qualified managerial and technical
employees. 

The
mining industry is intensely competitive in all of its phases. Competition
includes large established mining companies with substantial capabilities and
with greater financial and technical resources than we have. As a result of this
competition, we may be unable to acquire additional attractive mining claims or
financing on terms we consider acceptable. We also compete with other mining
companies in the recruitment and retention of qualified managerial and technical
employees. If we are unable to successfully compete for financing or for
qualified employees, our exploration and development programs may be slowed down
or suspended. 

Trading
of our stock may be restricted by the SEC's Penny Stock Regulations which may
limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock. 

The U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally
define "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as
defined) less than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per
share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by
the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on
broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and
"accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers
generally to institutions with assets in excess of 5,000,000 or individuals
with a net worth in excess of 1,000,000 or annual income exceeding 200,000 or
 300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a
broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from
the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared
by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and
level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must
provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock,
the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and
monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in
the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the
broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the
customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be
given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's
confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior
to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the
broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is
a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written
agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have
the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for
the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently,
these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our
securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor
interest in and limit the marketability of, our common stock. 

We do not expect to declare or pay
any dividends . 

We have
not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception, and
we do not anticipate paying any such dividends for the foreseeable
future. 

Anti-Takeover
Provisions 

We do not
currently have a shareholder rights plan or any anti-takeover provisions in our
By-laws. Without any anti-takeover provisions, there is no deterrent
for a take-over of our company, which may result in a change in our management
and directors. 

-8- 

Our
By-laws contain provisions indemnifying our officer and directors against all
costs, charges and expenses incurred by them. 

Our
By-laws contain provisions with respect to the indemnification of our officer
and directors against all costs, charges and expenses, including an amount paid
to settle an action or satisfy a judgement, actually and reasonably incurred by
him, including an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgement in a
civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding to which he is made a
party by reason of his being or having been one of our directors or
officer. 

Volatility of Stock
Price . 

Our
common shares are not currently publicly traded. In the future, the
trading price of our common shares may be subject to wide
fluctuations. Trading prices of the common shares may fluctuate in
response to a number of factors, many of which will be beyond our
control. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for
software technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and
volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the
operating performance of such companies. Market and industry factors
may adversely affect the market price of the common shares, regardless of our
operating performance. 

In the
past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's
securities, securities class-action litigation has often been
instituted. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in
substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and
resources. 

Item

Our
administrative mailing office is located at 133 Atlas Toronto, Ontario M6C
3P4. We currently do not have any exploration
properties. 

Item
3. Legal Proceedings. 

We know
of no material, active or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we
involved as a plaintiff in any material proceedings or pending
litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors,
officer or affiliates, or any registered beneficial shareholder are an adverse
party or has a material interest adverse to us. 

Item
4. Submissions of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders. 

There
were no matters submitted to a vote of our security holders either through
solicitation of proxies or otherwise in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2009.

There is
currently no market for our common stock. 

As of
October 31, 2009 there were 46 shareholders and 2,733,940 shares
outstanding. 

There are
no outstanding options or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into,

We have
not declared any dividends since incorporation and do not anticipate that we
will do so in the foreseeable future. Although there are no
restrictions that limit the ability to pay dividends on our common shares, our
intention is to retain future earnings for use in our operations and the

7. Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation. 

Overview 

You
should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of
operations together with the audited financial statements and the notes to
audited financial statements included elsewhere in this filing prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that
reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could
differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements. 

Plan
of Operations 

Cash
Requirements 

 Over the
twelve months ending July 31, 2010 we plan to expend a total of approximately
 140,000 in respect of acquiring new mineral properties. We estimate
that we will also require working capital of approximately 10,000 over the
twelve months ending July 31, 2010. 

Based on
our current plan of operations, we require immediate funds to commence our
exploration operations. For the year ended July 31, 2006 we successfully raised
 56,025 through the sale of 560,250 common shares pursuant to our SB-2
registration statement. This allowed us to complete Phase 1 of our proposed
exploration program. We will not undertake Phase 2 unless we obtain
additional funding. We will require additional financing before
we generate any significant revenues. We intend to raise the capital required to
meet any additional needs through sales of our securities in secondary offerings
or private placements. We have no agreements in place to do this at this time.
If we fail to raise sufficient funds, we may modify our operations plan
accordingly. Even if we do raise funds for operations, there is no assurance
that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an
investor to obtain a return on his investment in our common stock. Further, we
may continue to be unprofitable. 

There are
no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional funds required for our
continued operations. In such event that we do not raise sufficient additional
funds by secondary offering or private placement, we will consider alternative
financing options, if any, or be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our
operations. 

Over the
twelve months ending July 31, 2010 we intend to use all available funds to
commence exploration of our mineral properties, as follows:

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Since
inception on March 18, 2004, we have been engaged in exploration and acquisition
of mineral properties. Our principal capital resources have been acquired
through a shareholder loan and the issuance of common stock. 

-10- 

At July
31, 2009, we had a working capital deficit of 51,769 compared to working
capital deficit of 30,768 at July 31, 2008. 

At July
31, 2009, our total assets of 4,034 which consists of only cash. This compares
with our assets at July 31, 2008 of 17,918 which consisted of cash and mineral
property. 

At July
31, 2009, our total liabilities were 55,803 compared to our liabilities of
 42,186 as at July 31, 2008. 

We have
had no revenues from inception. There is currently insufficient capital to
explore and develop our mineral properties. We raised 56,025 from our SB-2
offering which we closed on November 30, 2005. A former director,
Ludvik Rolin has loaned us funds . Mr. Rolin has
loaned us 26,500 for the partial payment of costs associated with the SB-2
offering and for general and administrative expenses. If we do not
successfully raise 150,000, we will not be able to fully implement our
exploration program unless we obtain additional financing either through a
private placement or shareholder loan. There is no guarantee we will
be able to do this. 

We have
no long-term debt, other than the 26,500 owing to our former director, Ludvik
Rolin. 

Results
of Operations. 

We posted
losses of 43,239 for the year ending July 31, 2009, losses of 16,116 for the
year ended July 31, 2008, and losses of 135,032 since inception to July 31,
2009. Operating expenses for the year ending July 31, 2009 were 40,567 compared
to the year ending July 31, 2008 that were 13,459. 

Product
Research and Development 

Our
business plan is focused on the long-term exploration and development of our
mineral properties. 

Purchase
of Significant Equipment 

We do not
intend to purchase any significant equipment over the twelve months ending July
31, 2010. 

Employees 

Currently
there are no full time or part-time employees of our company (other than our
directors and officer who, at present, have not signed employment or consulting
agreements with us). We do not expect any material changes in the number of
employees over the next 12 month period (although we may enter into employment
or consulting agreements with our officer or directors). We do and will continue
to outsource contract employment as needed. However, if we are successful in our
initial and any subsequent drilling programs we may retain additional
employees. 

Going
Concern 

Due to
our being a development stage company and not having generated revenues, in
their report on the audited financial statements for the year ended July 31,
2009, our auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about
our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements
contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that led to
this disclosure. 

The
continuation of our business is dependent upon us raising additional financial
support. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could
result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current
stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would
be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash
commitments.- 

-11- 

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards 

Victory
Eagle does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements
to have a significant impact on Victory Eagle's results of operations, financial
position or cash flow. 

APPLICATION
OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Our
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected
by management's application of accounting policies. 

We have
historically incurred losses, and through July 31, 2009 have incurred losses of
 135,032 from our inception. During this period, we have
successfully raised 56,025 from an SB-2 offering. On August 18,
2008, we closed a private placement of 78,690 common shares for gross proceeds
of 15,738. 

We issued
the common shares to one non-U.S. person (as that term is defined in Regulation
S of the Securities Act of 1933) in an offshore transaction in which we relied
on Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. Because of these
historical losses, we will require additional working capital to develop our
business operations. 

We intend
to raise additional working capital through a private placement. We
may apply for quotation on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board and intend to
offer our stock in a private placement after obtaining such
quotation. 

There are
no assurances that we will be able to either (1) achieve a level of revenues
adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations; or (2) obtain
additional financing and/or bank financing necessary to support our
working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from
operations, our SB-2 public offerings and/or bank financing are insufficient, we
will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that
additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms
acceptable to us. If adequate working capital is not available we may not
increase our operations. 

These
conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to
continue as a going concern.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the
Board of Directors of 

 Victory
Eagle Resources Corp. 

 Vancouver,
British Columbia 

We have
audited the accompanying balance sheets of Victory Eagle Resources Corp. (the
 Company as of July 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related statements of
operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years
then ended and for the period from March 18, 2004 (inception) through July 31,
2009. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. 

In our
opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Victory Eagle Resources Corp. as of
July 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the years then ended and for the period from March 18, 2004 (inception)
through July 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

As
discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company's absence of
significant revenues, recurring losses from operations, and its need for
additional financing in order to fund its projected loss in 2010 raise
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The 2009
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.

VICTORY
EAGLE RESOURCES CORP. 

 (AN
EXPLORATION STAGE COMPANY) 

 NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS
AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

Victory
Eagle Resources Corp. (the "Company") was incorporated on March 18, 2004 under
the laws of Nevada with a fiscal year end of July 31. The Company is in the
business of acquisition and exploration of gold in British Columbia, Canada. In
October, 2008 the Company was listed on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol
VERC. 

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT POLICIES 

Exploration
stage company 

The
Company complies with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 7
 Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises in its
characterization of the Company as an exploration stage enterprise. 

Cash
and cash equivalents 

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. 

Use
of estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the period.
Actual results may differ from those estimates. 

Basic
loss per share 

Basic
loss per share has been calculated based on the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period. 

Income
taxes 

The asset
and liability approach is used to account for income taxes by recognizing
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets
and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce the
deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be
realized. 

Fair
value of financial instruments 

The
Company's financial instruments consist of cash, accounts payable and note
payable shareholder. Unless otherwise noted, it is management's opinion that the
Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising
from these financial instruments. Because of the short maturity of such assets
and liabilities the fair value of these financial instruments approximate their
carrying values, unless otherwise noted. 

F-6 

Mineral
Interests 

Mineral
property acquisition costs are capitalized in accordance with EITF 04-2. Mineral
property exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined
that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of
establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred to develop such
property are capitalized. To date the Company has not established any reserves
on its mineral properties. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

The
Company reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. If the review indicates that the carrying amount of the asset
may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured based on a
projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that is considered
to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the Company s current business
model. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a
long-lived asset is grouped with other assets at the lowest level for which
identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other
assets. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

During
the year ended July 31, 2009 and subsequently, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB has issued a number of financial accounting standards,
none of which did or are expected to have a material impact on the Company s
results of operations, financial position, or cash flows, with exception
of: 

New
Accounting Pronouncements (Adopted) 

SFAS
No. 157. In September 2006, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 157, Fair
Value Measurements SFAS No. 157 ). This statement defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements, but does not require any new fair
value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In
February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position, or FSP, No. FAS 157-2,
 Effective Date of FASB
Statement No. 157 FSP FAS 157-2 , which delayed the effective
date of SFAS No. 157 for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities to
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within
those fiscal years. We adopted SFAS No. 157 for the Company s financial
assets and liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, and provisions for
nonfinancial assets and liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which
did not result in recognition of a transaction adjustment to retained earnings
or have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows. 

SFAS
No. 165. In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 165, Subsequent
Events SFAS No. 165 ). This statement provides guidance to
establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that
occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are
issued or are available to be issued. This statement is effective for interim or
fiscal periods ending after June 15, 2009, and is applied prospectively. We
adopted SFAS No. 165 in the year ended July 31, 2009; this adoption did not
have any impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows. 

New
Accounting Pronouncements (Not yet adopted) 

SFAS
No. 168. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 168, The FASB
Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally of Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles a Replacement of FASB Statement
No. 162 SFAS No. 168 ). SFAS No. 168 establishes the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification as the source of authoritative accounting
principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. SFAS
No. 168 is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual
periods ending after September 15, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of
SFAS No. 168 will not have a material impact on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE 3 - GOING
CONCERN 

The
Company s financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a
going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred net
losses of 43,239 for the year ended July 31, 2009, and a cumulative loss of
 135,032 since its inception on March 18, 2004. This condition raises
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible
future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these
uncertainties. 

The
Company is working to secure additional financing to fund its mineral
exploration and development activities and to meet its obligations and working
capital requirements over the next twelve months. 

There are
no assurances that the Company will be able to either (1) achieve a level of
revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations; or (2)
obtain additional financing through either private placement, public offerings
and/or bank financing necessary to support the Company s working capital
requirements. To the extent that funds generated from operations and any private
placements, public offerings and/or bank financing are insufficient, the Company
will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that
additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms
acceptable to the Company. If adequate working capital is not available the
Company may be required to curtail its operations. 

NOTE 4 - RELATED PARTY
TRANSACTIONS 

In July
2004, the former president, who is still a shareholder, of the Company acquired
eight mineral claims by arranging the staking of the same through a third party.
He paid 1,100 to stake the claims, and has agreed to contribute the claims to
the Company in order for the Company to mine these claims. As of July 31, 2009
the claims were still in the former President s name. The claims are expected to
be transferred to the Company at the shareholder's basis 1,100) when the
Company determines it is economical to mine the claims. 

NOTE 5 - NOTE PAYABLE -
SHAREHOLDER 

In April
2004 the majority shareholder of the Company, loaned the company 26,500.
Interest is being accrued on this note at the rate of 10 per annum. As of July
31, 2009, the interest accrued on the loan is 14,078. The note payable and
accrued interest are payable on demand. 

NOTE 6 MINERAL PRORTY
RIGHTS 

During
the year ended July 31, 2009, the Company was unable to comply with the terms of
its mineral property rights agreements and the options expired. As a
result, an impairment charge of 6,500 was recorded in general and
administrative expense. 

NOTE 7 - INCOME
TAXES 

The
Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 109 (SFAS
109), "Accounting for Income Taxes." Deferred income taxes reflect the net
effect of (a) temporary difference between carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting
purposes, and (b) net operating loss carryforwards. No net provision for
refundable Federal income tax has been made in the accompanying statement of
loss because no recoverable taxes were paid previously. Similarly, no deferred
tax asset attributable to the net operating loss carryforward has been
recognized, as it is not deemed likely to be realized. 

F-8 

The
provision for refundable Federal income tax consists of the
following: 

July
 31, 2009 

July
 31, 2008 

Federal
 income tax attributable to: 

Current
 operations 

14,700 

5,400 

Less,
 change in valuation allowance 

(14,700) 
 
 (5,400) 

Net amount 

- 

- 

The
cumulative tax effect at the expected rate of 34 of significant items
comprising our net deferred tax amount is as follows: 

July
 31, 2009 

July
 31, 2008 

Deferred
 tax asset attributable to: 

Net
 operating loss carryover 

45,650 

30,950 

Less,
 valuation allowance 

(45,650) 
 
 (30,950) 

Net
 deferred tax asset 

- 

- 

As of
July 31, 2009, the Company had an unused net operating loss carryover
approximating 135,000 that is available to offset future taxable income, and
expires beginning in 2024. 

NOTE 8 - COMMON
STOCK 

In March
2004, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of stock to its founding shareholder
for 2,000 cash. 

In
January 2006, the Company issued 560,250 shares of stock for total cash proceeds
of 56,025. 

In April
2007, the Company issued 50,000 shares as partial consideration for acquiring a

property option. 

In August
18, 2008, the Company issued 78,690 common shares for total cash proceeds of
 15,738. 

NOTE 9-SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS 

The
Company has evaluated subsequent events for recognition or disclosure through
the date these financial statements were available to be issued, November 3,
2009. 

F-9 

Item
9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial
Disclosure 

None. 

Item
9A(T). Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management to allow for timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure
controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our
management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

Our
management does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls
over financial reporting will prevent all error and fraud. A control system, no
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of a control system are met. Further,
any control system reflects limitations on resources and the benefits of a
control system must be considered relative to its costs. These limitations also
include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls
can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two
or more people or by management override of a control. A design of a control
system is also based upon certain assumptions about potential future conditions;
over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be
detected. 

As of
July 31, 2009, the year end period covered by this report, we carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures. Based on the foregoing, we have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by
this annual report. There have been no changes in our internal controls over
financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2009
that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
controls over financial reporting. 

Management's Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act. Management has employed a framework consistent with
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c), to evaluate internal control over financial
reporting described below. Internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principals. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management
conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of our internal control over
financial reporting as of and for the year ended July 31, 2009. As a result of
this assessment, management concluded that, as of and for the year ended July
31, 2009, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in
providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles as of and for the year and quarter
ended July 31, 2009. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the company's registered
public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Management's report was not subject to attestation by the company's registered
public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management's report
in this annual report.

None of

us during the last fiscal year or the current fiscal year in an amount exceeding
 60,000.

On March
19, 2004, we issued a total of 2,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to
Mr. Rolin, an officer and director of our company for subscription proceeds of
 2,000. On April 12th, 2004, Mr. Rolin loaned us 26,500 for the partial payment
of offering expenses and general administrative expenses. The loan bears
interest at a rate of 10 per annum and is not convertible into shares of the
Company. Under the terms of the loan agreement, Mr. Rolin was entitled to
repayment if the company raised a minimum of 50,000 in our SB-2
offering. The company successfully raised this amount, however, Mr.
Rolin waived his right to repayment. The loan is now repayable upon
demand. 

Mr. Rolin
has indicated that he may loan us additional funds, as needed, to pay
administrative costs and for operating capital. We do not, however, have any
formal agreement from Mr. Rolin to provide such funding. 

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Compliance 

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires our executive officer and
directors, and persons who own more than 10 of our common stock, to file
reports regarding ownership of, and transactions in, our securities with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and to provide us with copies of those
filings. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms
received by us, or written representations from certain reporting persons, we
believe that during fiscal year ended July 31, 2009, all filing requirements
applicable to its officer, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial
owners were complied with. 

Code
of Ethics 

Effective
October 22, 2005, our company's board of directors adopted a Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics that applies to, among other persons, our company's president
(being our principal executive officer) and our company's secretary (being our
principal financial and accounting officer and controller), as well as persons
performing similar functions. As adopted, our Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics sets forth written standards that are designed to deter
wrongdoing and to promote: 

(1)
honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent
conflicts of interest between personal and professional
relationships; 

(2) full,
fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents
that we file with, or submit to, the Securities and Exchange Commission and in
other public communications made by us; 

(3)
compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and
regulations; 

(4) the
prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics to an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics; and 

(5)
accountability for adherence to the Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics. 

Our Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics requires, among other things, that all of our
company's personnel shall be accorded full access to our president and secretary
with respect to any matter which may arise relating to the Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics. Further, all of our company's personnel are to be
accorded full access to our company's board of directors if any such matter
involves an alleged breach of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by our
president or secretary. 

-16- 

In
addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes that all employees,
and particularly managers and/or supervisors, have a responsibility for
maintaining financial integrity within our company, consistent with generally
accepted accounting principles, and federal, provincial and state securities
laws. Any employee who becomes aware of any incidents involving financial or
accounting manipulation or other irregularities, whether by witnessing the
incident or being told of it, must report it to his or her immediate supervisor
or to our company's president or secretary. If the incident involves
an alleged breach of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by the president or
secretary, the incident must be reported to any member of our board of
directors. Any failure to report such inappropriate or irregular
conduct of others is to be treated as a severe disciplinary
matter. It is against our company policy to retaliate against any
individual who reports in good faith the violation or potential violation of our
company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by another. 

Our Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics is filed herewith with the Securities and
Exchange Commission as Exhibit 14.1 to this annual report. We will
provide a copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to any person without
charge, upon request. Requests can be sent to: Victory Eagle
Resources Corp., 133 Atlas Toronto, Ontario M6C 3P4 

Audit
Committee Financial Expert 

Our Board
of Directors has determined that it does not have a member of its audit
committee that qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in
Item 401(e) of Regulation S-B, and is "independent" as the term is used in Term
7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. 

We
believe that the members of our Board of Directors are collectively capable of
analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal
controls and procedures for financial reporting. In addition, we
believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an "audit
committee financial expert" would be overly costly and burdensome and is not
warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the
fact that we have not generated revenues to date. 

Item
11. Executive Compensation. 

There has
not been any compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to our directors and
executive officer for the last three completed financial years. 

Employment/Consulting
Agreements 

There are
no written employment or consulting agreements between us and any of our
directors and executive officer. 

Long-Term
Incentive Plans 

There are
no arrangements or plans in which we provide pension, retirement or similar
benefits for directors or executive officer, except that our directors and
executive officer may receive stock options at the discretion of our board of
directors. We do not have any material bonus or profit sharing plans pursuant to
which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or
executive officer, except that stock options may be granted at the discretion of
our board of directors. 

We have
no plans or arrangements in respect of remuneration received or that may be
received by our executive officer to compensate such officer in the event of
termination of employment (as a result of resignation, retirement, change of
control) or a change of responsibilities following a change of control, where
the value of such compensation exceeds 60,000 per executive
officer. 

Stock
Option Plan 

Currently,
there are no stock option plans in favour of any officer, directors, consultants
or employees of ours. 

-17- 

Stock
Options/SAR Grants 

There
were no grants of stock options or stock appreciation rights to any officer,
directors, consultants or employees of ours during the fiscal year ended July
31, 2009. 

Aggregated
Option Exercises in Last Fiscal Year and Fiscal Year End Values 

There
were no stock options outstanding as at July 31, 2009. 

Directors
Compensation 

We
reimburse our directors for expenses incurred in connection with attending board
meetings but did not pay director's fees or other cash compensation for services
rendered as a director in the year ended July 31, 2009. 

We have
no present formal plan for compensating our directors for their service in their
capacity as directors, although in the future, such directors are expected to
receive compensation and options to purchase shares of common stock as awarded
by our board of directors or (as to future options) a compensation committee
which may be established in the future. Directors are entitled to
reimbursement for reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with attendance at meetings of our board of directors. The
board of directors may award special remuneration to any director undertaking
any special services on behalf of our company other than services ordinarily
required of a director. Other than indicated in this annual report,
no director received and/or accrued any compensation for his or her services as
a director, including committee participation and/or special
assignments. 

Report
on Executive Compensation 

Our
compensation program for our executive officer is administered and reviewed by
our board of directors. Historically, executive compensation consists
of a combination of base salary and bonuses. Individual compensation
levels are designed to reflect individual responsibilities, performance and
experience, as well as the performance of our company. The
determination of discretionary bonuses is based on various factors, including
implementation of our business plan, acquisition of assets, development of
corporate opportunities and completion of financing. 

Item
11. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and
Related Stockholder Matters. 

The
following table sets forth, as at October 15, 2009, certain information with
respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock by each shareholder
known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent (5 of our
common stock, and by each of our current directors and executive
officer. Each person has sole voting and investment power with
respect to the shares of common stock, except as otherwise
indicated. Beneficial ownership consists of a direct interest in the
shares of common stock, except as otherwise indicated.

 with the rules of the SEC and generally includes voting or investment
 power with respect to securities. Shares of common stock
 subject to options or warrants currently exercisable, or exercisable
 within 60 days, are deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the

Item
14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services 

Audit
Fees 

The
aggregate fees billed by LBB Associates Ltd., LLP for professional
services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements included in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2009 were
estimated to be 5,000. 

-19- 

Audit
Related Fees 

For the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2009, the aggregate fees billed for assurance and
related services by LBB Associates Ltd., LLP relating to the performance
of the audit of our financial statements which are not reported under the
caption "Audit Fees" above, was 4,500. 

Tax
Fees 

For the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2009, the aggregate fees billed by LBB 
Associates Ltd., LLP for other non-audit professional services, other than those
services listed above, totalled 0. 

We do not
use LBB Associates Ltd., LLP for financial information system design and
implementation. These services, which include designing or
implementing a system that aggregates source data underlying the financial
statements or generates information that is significant to our financial
statements, are provided internally or by other service providers. We
do not engage LBB Associates Ltd., LLP to provide compliance outsourcing
services. 

Effective
May 6, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules that require
that before LBB Associates Ltd., LLP is engaged by us to render any
auditing or permitted non-audit related service, the engagement be: 

approved
 by our audit committee (which consists of entire Board of Directors);
 or 

entered
 into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established by the
 audit committee, provided the policies and procedures are detailed as to
 the particular service, the audit committee is informed of each service,
 and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of the audit
 committee's responsibilities to
management. 

The audit
committee pre-approves all services provided by our independent
auditors. The pre-approval process has just been implemented in
response to the new rules, and therefore, the audit committee does not have
records of what percentage of the above fees were
pre-approved. However, all of the above services and fees were
reviewed and approved by the audit committee either before or after the
respective services were rendered. 

The audit
committee has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by LBB 
Associates Ltd., LLP and believes that the provision of services for activities
unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining LBB Associates Ltd.,
LLP's independence.

 quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or
 is reasonably likely to materially affect, the small business issuer's
 internal control over financial reporting;
and 

5. 

The
 small business issuer's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed,
 based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
 reporting, to the small business issuer's auditors and the audit committee
 of the small business issuer's board of directors (or persons performing
 the equivalent functions): 

(a) 

All
 significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
 operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
 reasonably likely to adversely affect the small business issuer's ability
 to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
 and 

(b) 

Any
 fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
 employees who have a significant role in the small business issuer's
 internal control over financial
reporting.
