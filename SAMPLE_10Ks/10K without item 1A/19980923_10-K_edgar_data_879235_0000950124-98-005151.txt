ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

The Company designs and manufactures close-tolerance, specialty metal-alloy
components sold to the transportation, medical device and computer electronics
industries. These components are used primarily in gasoline and diesel fuel and
braking systems, devices for surgical procedures, and computer rigid disk
drives. The Company's production equipment consists of high-precision, automatic
cam-driven turning machines and computer numerically-controlled turning, milling
and grinding machines capable of high-volume production while maintaining close
tolerances.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

The Company's sales have grown from 18 million in fiscal 1990 to 90 million in
fiscal 1998. The Company's management attributes its growth to the following
factors: (i) increased sales of domestically-produced automobiles and the trend
toward more environmentally efficient port electronic fuel injectors; (ii)
increased sales of braking system components reflecting the acquisition of a
leading supplier of braking system components in fiscal 1997 and increased
demand and acceptance of anti-lock braking systems as a safety feature; (iii)
the introduction of precision-machined medical devices to its product offerings;
and, (iv) the proliferation of personal computers and their need for precise
machined components. The Company's growth and profitability reflect its business
strategy to:

 - Identify Products Which are Early in Their Life Cycles - The Company
 selectively pursues new sales opportunities based primarily on
 identifying products early in their product life cycles that have
 strong unit growth potential. The Company believes these components can
 be manufactured with unit price structures and quality standards that
 favor the Company in its highly competitive environment. By identifying
 products early in their life cycles and building strong customer
 relationships, sales growth has been enhanced through sole source,
 long-term supply contracts with selected customers. In fiscal 1998, 55 
 of the Company's total sales were to two customers, Delphi Automotive
 Systems ("DAS"; a division of General Motors Corporation), and Robert
 Bosch Corporation ("Bosch").

 - Provide Technologically High Quality Products on a Timely Basis - The
 Company believes that the reputation it has achieved in supplying high
 quality components has been instrumental in allowing it to achieve new
 business and maintain existing business. The Company's manufacturing
 strategy is to produce high-volume, close-tolerance, high-precision
 components that have excellent growth prospects. To this end, the
 Company has identified products in the transportation industry, such as
 fuel and braking systems components, the medical devices industry, such
 as minimally invasive ophthalmic and cardiovascular surgery equipment
 components, and the computer electronics industry, such as rigid disk
 drive fasteners and motor and microprocessor heat dispersion
 components. The Company's manufacturing expertise includes process
 flexibility and product quality to meet customer demands. The Company
 was one of 41 of General Motors' worldwide supplier base of over 30,000
 companies to receive the General Motors Supplier of the Year Award in
 June 1998, 1997 and 1996. In fiscal 1998, the Company also received the
 1997 Partnership in Quality award from Hitachi Automotive Products, the
 top quality award bestowed by Hitachi on its suppliers. The Company has
 used in the past and expects to use in the future this experience and
 knowledge to diversify its industry, customer and product bases.

- Focus on Aggressively Reducing Cost - Since its inception, the Company
 has emphasized a continuous improvement program involving all
 employees. The Company believes that this ongoing program, in
 conjunction with the capital expenditures it has made, allows it to be
 the low-cost producer of the products it manufactures. The Company
 believes that there are future opportunities to increase efficiency,
 improve productivity and reduce costs.

The Company intends to continue focusing on manufacturing components requiring
high-volume, close-tolerance, high-precision production, which have excellent
growth prospects. The Company's strategy is to expand its base of transportation
customers as well as diversify its product mix to that market. Current and
future supplier consolidation within the industry will require the Company to
provide high-tolerance machining capability for the production of many more
products in order to maintain its position as a premier supplier to the
industry. In addition, the Company plans to increase its penetration of
non-transportation markets, such as medical devices, by identifying products
consistent with its business strategy. These expansion plans will be realized
through strategic acquisitions. The Company is continually seeking to acquire
businesses that complement and expand its product offerings. Such opportunities
should be created as original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") continue to
consolidate their supplier bases.

MARKETS

The Company currently sells its products in the transportation, medical devices
and computer electronics industries as described below.

Transportation Industry. The transportation parts industry is composed of two
major segments -- the OEM market and the transportation aftermarket. The Company
sells substantially all of its products to tier-one and tier-two suppliers to
OEMs for installation as original equipment on new cars, trucks and heavy
equipment. The market for new cars and light trucks in North America, the
largest user of Company products, is large and cyclical, with new vehicle demand
tied closely to the overall strength of the North American economy. Developments
within the industry, including consolidation among suppliers and increased
outsourcing of components by OEMs, have substantially altered the competitive
environment for transportation suppliers and have had a favorable impact on the
Company's growth.

Due to ever-increasing global competition, OEMs are continually revising their
supplier requirements. OEMs are requiring suppliers to meet increasingly strict
standards of quality, overall cost reductions and increased support for up-front
design, engineering and project management. These requirements are continually
accelerating the trend toward consolidation of the OEMs' supplier bases. For
more capable suppliers, the new environment will continue to create the
opportunity to grow rapidly by obtaining business previously provided by other
suppliers.

In addition, automotive manufacturers are producing vehicles with more features
designed for convenience, vehicle performance, and, in response to both state-
and federally-imposed standards related to safety and the environment such as
the Federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy Requirements, emission standards and
passive restraint requirements. As a result, new, more sophisticated systems
have been added to automobiles that require components of the type produced by
the Company. As the OEMs follow this trend, significant opportunities should
develop for the Company.

The Company believes it will continue to be well positioned as a supplier to
this market.

Medical Devices Industry. The health care industry continues to undergo a major
transformation affecting all segments of the industry. While the final outcome
of this transformation is unknown, certain identifiable developments have
already impacted this industry. Cost concerns are increasing the trend toward
outpatient and non-physician attended facilities. These facilities will require
more compact, mobile and user-friendly diagnostic and surgical devices. The
industry is also demanding suppliers that enhance quality while lowering costs.

The Company believes it can capitalize on its transportation manufacturing
expertise by applying these skills to similar manufacturing processes used
within the medical devices industry. The Company has already made positive
impressions on companies within this market who were skeptical about a
transportation company's ability to meet the expectations of the medical
industry.

Computer Electronics Industry. Computer electronics is a dynamic, innovative
industry that encompasses a wide range of products. The Company has focused on
the manufacture of precision components used in suspension assemblies for rigid
disk drives, microprocessor heat dispersion units and rigid disk drive motors.
These and other personal computer subassemblies require high-precision
metal-machined components of the type manufactured by the Company. This industry
also experiences frequent product changes with short lead times from development
to market as a result of technology advances and increasing demand for a variety
of product configurations. The Company believes its ability to make rapid
product changeovers while maintaining high-volume production has, and will
continue to, enable it to take advantage of certain opportunities as they arise.

PRODUCT APPLICATIONS

A summary of the Company's sales and percentage of total sales by product
application for each of the last three fiscal years is presented on page E-3 of
the Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

Fuel Systems. Sales of fuel system components represented 57 , 74 and 63 
of the Company's sales for the years ended June 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. Sales of such components to DAS represented 47 , 62 and 74 of
total fuel system component sales for each of the respective periods presented.
Sales of such components to Bosch represented 26 , 20 and 11 of total fuel
system component sales for each of the respective periods presented. Fuel
systems meter fuel flow more precisely than traditional carburation, and
therefore, permit engines to burn less fuel cleaner. The Company expects fuel
system components to be its primary product for the near-term. The Company has
built a strong reputation in the industry for lowest total cost, which it has
earned through continuous process improvement and equipment and labor
adaptability. The Company believes that most light vehicles manufactured in
North America are equipped with multi-port fuel injection systems, and it does
not expect meaningful growth in North American light vehicle production in the
foreseeable future. Management expects Company sales to grow in the face of
these market conditions through employing a market diversification strategy. The
Company has established relationships with several new customers in this market,
including two that manufacture diesel fuel injectors, which should provide a
majority of its fuel system sales growth in the near future. In addition,
management expects that its focus on global expansion, through acquisition, will
provide additional growth opportunities as it enters new markets.

Braking Systems. Sales of braking system components represented 20 , 11 and 22 
of the Company's sales for the years ended June 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. The Company manufactures several production components for
anti-lock braking systems ("ABS"), including components of pistons, sensors,
plugs, solenoids and valve bodies. It also manufactures valve rods and push rod
assemblies used in the assembly of ABS and conventional braking systems. The
Company expects to benefit from a market diversification strategy in this area
through exploiting core competencies for consistently holding to increasingly
tight machining tolerances and stringent requirements for cleanliness.

Other Automotive. Other automotive components sales represented 3 , 2 and 2 of
the Company's sales for the years ended June 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. The Company manufactures components used in automotive electronic
motors, which allow the remote operation power windows, door locks and seats.
The Company believes that the consumer-desired safety and convenience of these
features will lead to increased sales of these systems and corresponding
increased sales of components manufactured by the Company.

Medical Devices. Medical device components sales represented 11 , 10 and 7 of
the Company's sales for the years ended June 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. The Company manufactures components sold to the ophthalmic and
cardiovascular surgical device industries. It continues to benefit from
increased penetration by its largest ophthalmic surgical device customer into
foreign markets. During late fiscal 1996, the Company began manufacturing
precision-machined metal components for innovative cardiovascular surgical
device manufacturers, including those that sell stents.

 7

Computer Electronics. Sales of computer electronics components represented 7 ,
3 and 7 of the Company's sales for the years ended June 30, 1998, 1997 and
1996, respectively. During fiscal 1996 and 1997, these components were primarily
machined, precision fastening devices, known as baseplates, used to join certain
components of rigid disk drives used on personal computers. Baseplate sales
dropped during fiscal 1997 as the Company fell victim to characteristic life
cycle shifts; specifically, demand for suspension assemblies that featured
machined baseplates produced by the Company were replaced by those featuring
stamped baseplates. The Company reversed this decline in sales in fiscal 1998
through the sale of high-volume, high-precision metal components used in the
production of thermoplates for computer microprocessors.

MANUFACTURING

The Company manufactures its products using turning, grinding and milling
processes. Substantially all of the Company's production machinery has been
acquired new since 1985 and consists of high-precision, automatic cam-driven
turning machines and computer numerically-controlled turning, milling and
grinding machines. These machines are capable of high-volume production while
maintaining close tolerances. Products are typically produced from bar stock
using multi-spindle cam automatic bar machines or centerless grinders. Secondary
machining in some cases is necessary. Parts are then deburred, cleaned, in some
cases, plated or heat treated at outsource locations, packaged and shipped
directly to the customer.

On a new job, the first parts produced are used to establish process capability
and sent to the customer for approval. After approval, the part is placed in the
Company's production planning systems and, as production begins, statistical
process control techniques are employed to maintain quality and gather data for
the Company's continuous improvement efforts. The continuous improvement process
focuses the attention of all employees on improving each step of the process in
order to increase quality, lower cost and improve customer service. In the
manufacturing area, this focus emphasizes reducing dimensional variation to
narrow the tolerance range for a given process, increasing perishable tool life,
reducing scrap, and increasing both human and equipment productivity.

The Company anticipates that additional manufacturing equipment will be
necessary if firm orders are received during fiscal 1999 and 2000 in quantities
currently contemplated under its existing contracts and purchase orders. The
Company has entered into commitments to purchase certain of such equipment (See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources" and "Business - Contracts and
Purchase Orders").

Raw materials and other resources used by the Company are generally not
restricted in availability; however, the Company obtains 70 of its supply of
metal alloys from one supplier. While these materials are available from several
other sources, the Company could experience production delays and lost sales
while qualifying a new supplier.

MARKETING AND SALES

The Company markets its products primarily by bidding upon component
specifications submitted by the customer. In addition, the Company makes direct
calls on potential customers, domestically by its internal sales department and
internationally through independent sales representatives. It is the Company's
objective to establish long-term sole source contracts in order to strengthen
its position in the marketplace. In addition, the Company continues to expand
its base of customers in order to reduce its dependence on any particular
customer or industry.

CONTRACTS AND PURCHASE ORDERS

The Company's transportation customers typically award blanket purchase orders
for each calendar year, and is occasionally successful in receiving
life-of-the-product supplier agreements, as is the case with most of its current
business with DAS. The remainder of its components may be subject to an annual
rebidding process.

Additionally, the Company is currently operating with open and blanket purchase
orders from approximately 40 customers primarily covering transportation fuel
and braking systems, medical devices, and computer electronics components.
Orders are not firm under blanket purchase orders until specific releases are
granted.

BACKLOG AND SEASONALITY

The Company's business is relatively consistent throughout the year, except for
slowness traditionally experienced in July and August due to automotive model
changeovers and during late December as its customers in the transportation
industry typically shut down around the Christmas and New Year holidays.

The Company does not reflect an order in backlog until it has received a
purchase order and release committing to a quantity and delivery date.
Generally, orders are shipped within three months of a release and as a result,
the Company does not believe backlog is a material concept to its business.

COMPETITION

The markets in which the Company competes are highly competitive, and the
Company believes that it competes within the above industries on the basis of
price, quality and technology. The Company believes that there are approximately
40 companies in the United States that have the equipment to be manufacturers of
precision metal parts in competition with the Company. Certain of the Company's
competitors have greater resources than the Company and could move components
currently manufactured by the Company in-house. The Company also competes with
approximately 10 companies in Europe and Asia. Some of the components currently
manufactured by the Company can also be manufactured using alternative
technologies including stamping and coldheading processes which, in some cases,
can process high-precision parts as efficiently as those technologies utilized
by the Company.

EMPLOYEES

The Company had 953 full-time employees as of June 30, 1998. Those 
employees can be segregated into the following disciplines:

Sales increased 28,375,000, or 46 , from fiscal 1997 to fiscal 1998, and
 4,275,000, or 7 , from fiscal 1996 to fiscal 1997. The Company experienced
sales growth over the three-year period ended June 30, 1998 in all product
lines. Fiscal 1997 interruptions in sales growth to the computer electronics and
braking systems industries were followed by strong gains in fiscal 1998.

Sales of components for fuel system applications were 51,672,000 during the
year ended June 30, 1998, an increase of 13 over fiscal 1997 sales, and fiscal
1997 sales of fuel system components increased 27 over fiscal 1996 levels.
Combined sales of components to the Company's two largest fuel systems customers
represented 73 , 82 and 85 of total fuel system component sales for the fiscal
years ended June 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Both of these customers
have embarked on new fuel injector programs during the periods presented
resulting in increased sales. In addition, during fiscal 1998, the Company
gained market share through the sale of 4,969,000 of diesel fuel injection
components by acquiring a controlling interest in Qualipart Industria E
Comercio, Ltda. ("Qualipart"), subsequently renamed, Autocam do Brasil Usinagem,
Ltda. ("Autocam do Brasil") in January 1998.

Sales of braking system components for the year ended June 30, 1998 were
 18,226,000, almost three times fiscal 1997 levels, and fiscal 1997 sales were
approximately one-half those reported in fiscal 1996. The increase in sales of
these components during fiscal 1998 can be attributed to the June 1997
acquisition of The Hamilton Group ("Hamilton"), a precision metal machining
company primarily supplying brake system components. During fiscal 1997, a large
braking system customer eliminated certain components manufactured by the
Company, which were no longer utilized on its new generation system, thereby
explaining the decrease in sales from fiscal 1996 to 1997.

Sales of components for medical device applications were 9,907,000 during
fiscal 1998, an increase of 57 over fiscal 1997 levels, and fiscal 1997 sales
were 63 greater than fiscal 1996 sales. The Company manufactures components
sold to the ophthalmic and cardiovascular surgical device industries. During
fiscal 1997 and 1998, the Company reaped the benefits of increased penetration
by its largest ophthalmic surgical device customer into foreign markets. During
late fiscal 1996, the Company began manufacturing precision-machined metal
components for innovative cardiovascular surgical device manufacturers,
including those that sell stents. Sales to these customers increased 3,596,000
and 1,539,000 during fiscal 1998 and 1997, respectively, over the preceding
years.

Sales of components for computer electronic applications were 6,458,000 during
the year ended June 30, 1998, a four-fold increase over fiscal 1997 levels, and
fiscal 1997 sales were 53 lower than fiscal 1996 sales. The increase in sales
of computer electronic components from fiscal 1997 to 1998 was attributable to
the production and sale of key components used in computer microprocessor
subassemblies. No such components were produced during fiscal 1997. Fiscal 1997
sales decreased from fiscal 1996 levels as the Company's major customer for
baseplates, a specialty metal fastener used in the manufacture of suspension
assemblies for rigid disk drives, began purchasing precision-stamped baseplates
which are more economical to manufacture than the Company's turned baseplates.

 E-3

Management believes that year-over-year sales growth in fiscal 1999 will exceed
20 , in spite of the negative impact presented by the protracted strike at
General Motors Corporation ("GM") during July and August of 1998. Growth is
expected to be generated primarily from increased sales of fuel and braking
system components, while the Company expects declines in the sale of computer
electronic components. The Company expects to see continued expansion of fuel
system component sales as new injector programs move toward full production in
fiscal 1999, and it reports a full year of sales from its Brazilian operations.
Sales of high-precision metal components used in the production of thermoplates
for computer microprocessors will decrease substantially in fiscal 1999 versus
fiscal 1998 levels due to an anticipated change in design of the customer's heat
dispersion system that eliminates the need for components produced by the
Company.

GROSS PROFIT

Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, for the years ended June 30, 1998, 1997
and 1996 was 23.2 , 21.6 and 23.4 , respectively. The increase in gross profit
margin from fiscal 1997 to 1998 can be attributed to several factors, the most
significant of which were:

 - Increased contribution from the sale of medical device and
 computer electronic components as these products typically
 generate higher margins than the Company's overall gross
 margins.
 - Growth in demand for new fuel system components that allowed
 for improved labor and equipment utilization.
 - The integration of Hamilton's operations and the
 implementation of continuous improvement concepts resulted in
 better than average margins on new braking system products.

The decrease in gross profit margin between fiscal 1997 and 1996 can be
attributed primarily to project start-up costs associated with new fuel system
programs during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1997. Although it is
common for margins to be lower on new program start-ups, fiscal 1997 third and
fourth quarter margins were adversely affected by machine tools which were not
only delivered late, but did not perform as expected. In order to meet customer
demand for these components, the Company was forced to employ less efficient,
work-around manufacturing processes in lieu of production processes that relied
on the machine tools in question. The machine tools were in place and qualified
for production as of the end of fiscal 1997. The negative impact on margins
caused by these factors was partially offset by increased production of medical
device components that allowed for improved utilization of existing equipment
and labor.

Management expects that fiscal 1999 gross profit, as a percentage of sales, will
decline from fiscal 1998 levels, particularly in the first quarter of the year
due primarily to the negative implications of the GM strike. The significant
reduction in demand for fuel injector components from GM's Delphi Automotive
Systems unit, and the Company's unwillingness to lay off employees in the face
of extremely low unemployment rates for skilled machinists in the West Michigan
area, are expected to reduce fiscal 1999 first quarter gross profit margins by
approximately 3 percentage points below levels reported in the first quarter of
fiscal 1998. Gross profit margins for the remainder of fiscal 1999 are expected
to return to levels reported for the full fiscal year of 1998.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were
6.5 , 5.8 and 5.9 in fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. These expenses
increased monetarily during all periods presented commensurate with the growth
in business. They increased as a percentage of sales due to the following
factors:

 - Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales,
 were higher than historical Company levels at the former Hamilton
 facilities and Autocam do Brasil.
 - Royalty expense increased during fiscal 1998 commensurate with the 
 increase in sales of stents (see Sales).

E-4
 5

Management expects that selling, general and administrative expenses, as a
percentage of sales, will fall slightly in fiscal 1999 from fiscal 1998 levels
as further integration of the former Hamilton and Brazilian operations occurs.

OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES

Other operating expenses represent the straight-line amortization of employment
and deferred compensation agreements between the Company and a key employee.

INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSES, NET

Net interest and other expenses increased 1,373,000 between fiscal 1997 and
1998 primarily as a result of interest incurred on notes issued by the Company
to fund the Hamilton and Qualipart acquisitions. Management expects fiscal 1999
interest expense to increase over fiscal 1998 levels, both monetarily and as a
percentage of sales. The Company will report a full year of interest expense on
debt issued in connection with its acquisition of a majority interest in
Qualipart, and the building and equipping of its Marshall, Michigan facility,
thereby resulting in a combined increase in expense of 769,000 over fiscal 1998
levels. This increase in expense is expected to be partially offset by a
decrease in interest expense on all other term debt as the Company satisfies its
normal monthly principal obligations.

MINORITY INTEREST IN NET INCOME

Minority interest in net income represents Propart Corporation's ("Propart") 49 
interest in the net income of Autocam do Brasil.

TAX PROVISION

United States Federal income tax has been provided on the earnings of its U.S.
operations at effective tax rates of 34.0 , 33.7 and 33.9 for the years ended
June 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The tax provision for fiscal 1998
includes provisions for Brazilian Federal and South Carolina state income taxes.
All years presented include provisions for California Unitary taxes. Management
does not expect the Company's effective income tax rate to change materially in
fiscal 1999 from fiscal 1998 levels.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company spent 17.5 million for fixed assets (excluding assets acquired in
connection with business combinations) during the year ended June 30, 1998,
including 1.5 million in facilities and 16 million in other fixed assets. All
of these assets were financed through operating cash flows, bank borrowings 625,000), and a portion of the funds raised through the issuance of Industrial
Revenue Bonds 9 million).

E-5

 6

In order to meet demand primarily from transportation customers, management will
purchase 20.1 million of equipment and invest 2.1 million in facilities over
the next year (on which deposits of 3.7 million and 1.5 million, respectively,
had been placed as of June 30, 1998). Management expects to finance these
purchases with cash on hand (some of which was generated from the issuance of
Industrial Revenue Bonds), operating cash flows, operating leases, and/or bank
borrowings, including its equipment line of credit 6,000,000 in availability
as of June 30, 1998) which allows the Company to retire borrowings over a period
not to exceed six years with either variable or fixed interest rates. In
December 1997, the Company issued Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling 9 million
through the Michigan Strategic Fund in order to fund the construction of a new
manufacturing facility in Marshall, Michigan and to purchase new equipment for
that facility. Principal payments are due annually (amortizing over a 15-year
period), with variable interest payments due monthly. The interest rate on the
bonds resets weekly and was set at 3.7 per annum as of June 30, 1998.

The January 1998 Qualipart acquisition was financed through bank borrowings and
a note to Propart of 5.2 million and 5 million, respectively. Bank borrowings
will be retired in 60 equal monthly principal installments, plus interest at
7.1 per annum. The note to Propart bears interest at 12 per annum to be paid
quarterly. Annual principal obligations under the note are required to begin in
2004, but may be prepaid through a capital contribution made directly to Autocam
do Brasil.

Management believes that the Company has adequate credit facilities and cash
available to meet its working capital needs through fiscal 1999. As of June 30,
1998, the Company had 4,119,200 in availability under its revolving line of
credit. Management anticipates retiring current maturities of long-term
obligations with future operating cash flows. As of June 30, 1998, 17 million
of the Company's long-term debt was subject to variable interest rates.

IMPACT OF YEAR 2000 ISSUE

The Company recognizes the importance of the Year 2000 issue and has been giving
high priority to it. In July 1998, the Company created a Year 2000 project team
to supervise a comprehensive risk-based assessment of the Company's Year 2000
readiness. The team's objective is to ensure an uninterrupted transition into
the Year 2000. The scope of the Year 2000 readiness effort includes software,
hardware, electronic data interchange, manufacturing and lab equipment,
environmental and safety systems, facilities, utilities and supplier readiness.
Since the Company makes predominate use of packaged computer applications in its
business and believes such applications to be Year 2000 compliant, management
considers the risk of a material adverse effect on the operations of the Company
to be remote. As of June 30, 1998, the Company had not spent any amounts in
connection with the planned assessment.

The Company is utilizing both internal and external resources to remediate and
test all applications and computer, manufacturing and facilities equipment that
may be adversely impacted by Year 2000 issues. It is the objective of Company
management to complete the most serious Year 2000 compliance issues for
information systems resident in United States facilities by December 1998 and
for foreign facilities by July 1999. Management expects to contract with an
outside consultant to assist in the assessment during the first quarter of
fiscal 1999 at a cost not expected to exceed 50,000. Costs to test and
remediate its systems, if any, are not expected to exceed 200,000.

In addition to internal Year 2000 software and equipment remediation activities,
the Company is in contact with its suppliers and electronic commerce customers
to assess their compliance. There can be no absolute assurances that there will
not be a material adverse effect on the Company if third parties do not convert
their systems in a timely manner and in a way that is compatible with the
Company's systems. The Company believes that its diligent actions with suppliers
and customers will minimize these risks.

 E-6

 7

The Company's current estimates of the amount of time and costs necessary to
remediate and test its computer systems are based on the facts and circumstances
existing at this time. The estimates were derived utilizing multiple assumptions
of future events including the continued availability of certain resources,
third-party modification plans and implementation success, and other factors.
New developments may occur that could affect the Company's estimates of the
amount of time and costs necessary to modify and test its systems for Year 2000
compliance. These developments include, but are not limited to: (i) the
availability and cost of personnel trained in this area; (ii) the ability to
locate and correct all relevant computer code and equipment; and, (iii) the
planning and modification success attained by the Company's suppliers and
customers.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

The Company derived 7 of its sales during fiscal 1998 from manufacturing
operations in Brazil. The financial position and results of operations of the
Company's subsidiary in Brazil is measured in Brazilian Reais and translated
into U.S. Dollars. With respect to 65 of this subsidiary's sales, expenses
associated therewith are generally incurred in Brazilian Reais, but sales are
generated in U.S. Dollars. As such, results of operations with regard to these
sales are directly influenced by a weakening or strengthening of the Brazilian
Real versus the U.S. Dollar. The effects of foreign currency fluctuations are
somewhat mitigated on the remainder of this subsidiary's sales by the fact that
such sales and expenses associated therewith are generally incurred in Brazilian
Reais and the reported income thereon will be higher or lower depending on a
weakening or strengthening of the U.S. Dollar.

One percent of the Company's net assets at June 30, 1998 are based in Brazil and
are translated into U.S. Dollars at the rate in effect as of that date (1.1501
Brazilian Reais per U.S. Dollar). Accordingly, the Company's consolidated
shareholders' equity will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or
strengthening of the U.S. Dollar.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Autocam Corporation and its subsidiaries (the
"Company"). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Nature of operations - The Company designs and manufactures close-tolerance,
specialty metal alloy components for mechanical and electromechanical systems
using turning, grinding and milling processes. Currently, the company
manufactures components for use on fuel and braking systems, medical devices and
computer electronics. It has six manufacturing facilities in the United States
and three in Brazil. Its customers are located primarily in North America,
Brazil, Austria and Germany.

Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Although management believes the estimates are reasonable,
actual results could differ from those estimates.

Financial instruments of the Company consist principally of cash, accounts
receivable and payable, and debt. The carrying amounts of all financial
instruments approximate estimated fair value. The Company has determined the
estimated fair value amounts using available market information and valuation
methodologies (see note 5).

Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates actual
cost, on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market.

Property is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings and improvements 31 years
Leasehold improvements 3 to 12 years
Machinery and equipment 3 to 12 years
Furniture and fixtures 5 to 10 years

Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the
respective assets are charged to expense. When properties are retired or sold,
the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and
any gain or loss on disposition is recognized in the results of operations.
Gains arising from sale and leaseback transactions are deferred for amortization
to income over the lives of the related operating leases.

Goodwill and other intangible assets consists primarily of amounts paid in
excess of the fair value of acquired net assets and are being amortized over
estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 40 years, on a straight-line basis.
The amounts are shown net of accumulated amortization of 447,500 and 17,100 as
of June 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Amortization expense totaled 448,700,
 3,700 and 3,700 for the years ended June 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.

Restricted cash and equivalents consists of highly-liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase, restricted
for use in connection with the building of a new manufacturing facility and
purchasing equipment for such facility.
 
 E-12
 13

Other long-term assets consists primarily of the cash surrender value of keyman
life insurance policies, receivables from officers and certain key employees
under split-dollar life insurance agreements, and a payment for an option to
purchase real estate (see Note 9).

Deferred compensation - Unearned deferred compensation, recorded as an offset to
shareholders' equity, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the
ten-year life of the associated employment agreement.

Revenue recognition - sales are recognized at the time product is shipped.

Income taxes - Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future.
Such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted
tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Income tax
expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change
during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities (see Note 7).

Net income per share - The Company has Adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 128, Earnings Per Share. As required by this standard, basic net
income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented.
Diluted net income per share assumes the issuance of common stock for options
outstanding under the Company's incentive stock option plan. Weighted average
shares outstanding were determined as follows:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the year ended 6.30.98 6.30.97 6.30.96
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Weighted average shares outstanding 6,040,147 5,989,674 5,968,619
Dilutive effect of common stock options 205,564 77,225 98,596
 --------- --------- ---------
Shares applicable to diluted net income 6,245,711 6,066,899 6,067,215
 ========= ========= =========

All share and per share amounts have been adjusted for the effects of share
dividends and splits.

Derivatives - The Company has only limited involvement with derivative financial
instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. They are used to manage
foreign currency rate risks arising out of the Company's purchases of certain
machinery and equipment (see Note 6). Gains or losses on foreign currency
futures contracts are deferred and included in the cost of machinery and
equipment purchased.

Stock-based compensation - The Company has adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 123 ("SFAS 123"), Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and as permitted by this standard, will continue to apply the
recognition and measurement principles prescribed under Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, to its
stock-based compensation (see Note 10).

New Accounting Standards - In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 ("SFAS 130"),
Reporting Comprehensive Income, and No. 131 ("SFAS 131"), Disclosures About
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS 130 establishes
standards for the reporting and presentation of comprehensive income and its
components. SFAS 131 establishes standards for defining operating segments and
the reporting of certain information regarding operating segments. Because these
statements only impact how financial information is disclosed in interim and
annual reports, the adoption will have no impact on the Company's financial
condition or results of operations. Both accounting standards are effective for
the Company's fiscal year ending June 30, 1999.

Reclassifications - Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1996
financial statements to conform to the 1997 presentation.

2. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Effective January 1, 1998, the Company purchased 51 of the common stock of
Qualipart Industria E Comercio, Ltda. ("Qualipart"; subsequently renamed,
Autocam do Brasil Usinagem, Ltda., or "Autocam do Brasil") from its parent,
Propart Corporation ("Propart"). The purchase price was satisfied through the
payment of 5.2 million in cash and the issuance of a 5 million note payable to
Propart, which remains as the minority shareholder of Autocam do Brasil. Autocam
do Brasil is a contract manufacturer of precision-machined gasoline and diesel
fuel injection components to the transportation industry. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase, and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated
to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their relative fair market
values. Cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired (goodwill)
of 7,462,300 is being amortized over 40 years on a straight-line basis. The
final purchase price could be reduced by a maximum of 2,500,000 if earnings
before interest and taxes during the eighteen months ending June 30, 1999 do not
meet agreed-upon levels, and accordingly, may affect the preliminary purchase
price allocation.

Autocam-Pax, Inc. ("Autocam-Pax"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was
formed in June 1997, solely for the purpose of acquiring certain assets and
assuming certain liabilities of Dowagiac Manufacturing Company and Hamilton-Pax,
Inc. Autocam-Pax is engaged primarily in the manufacture of close-tolerance,
specialty metal alloy components for automotive braking systems. On June 30,
1997, the acquisition was consummated for 18,081,000 in cash consideration and
the assumption of 699,000 in liabilities. Of the total purchase price,
 1,000,000 was held in escrow as contingent consideration until the related
contingencies were discharged. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase,
and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based upon their relative fair market values. During fiscal
1998, the parties agreed to certain amendments to the purchase agreement, and as
a result, the purchase price allocation changed. Such amounts were finalized
during fiscal 1998 resulting in cost in excess of the fair value of the net
assets acquired (goodwill) of 7,196,600, which is being amortized over 20 years
on a straight-line basis.

The Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 1998 include the results of
Autocam-Pax as the transaction was consummated on the last day of fiscal 1997.
The Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 1998 include the results of
Autocam do Brasil subsequent to January 1, 1998. The following unaudited pro
forma information presents summary Consolidated Statements of Operations data of
the Company as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest
period presented below. These pro forma results are based upon assumptions
considered appropriate by management and include adjustments as considered
necessary in the circumstances. Such adjustments include interest expense that
would have been incurred to finance the purchase, less depreciation expense
based on the fair market value of the property, plant and equipment acquired,
and the amortization of intangibles arising from the transaction. These pro
forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not
purport to be indicative of results which would have actually been reported had
the acquisitions taken place on July 1, 1996 or which may be reported in the
future.

The Company has a master loan agreement (the "Agreement") with a bank which
includes a 13.5 million revolving credit note, a 10 million acquisition term
note, a 6 million equipment line of credit, and a 1.2 million acquisition
mortgage note. Terms of the Agreement require that the Company maintain minimum
levels of net worth and not exceed certain leverage ratios. Substantially all
machinery and equipment of the Company have been offered as collateral for loans
under the Agreement.

The following portions of the revolving credit note have been reserved:
 1,500,000 for foreign currency futures contracts, and 880,000 for two letters
of credit. As of June 30, 1998, the remaining availability under the revolving
line of credit was 4,119,200. No amounts are outstanding as of June 30, 1998
under the equipment line of credit. Borrowings under the equipment line of
credit may be retired over a period not to exceed six years with either variable
or fixed interest rates.

In January 1998, the Company issued a 5.2 million term note payable to a bank
and issued a 5 million note payable to Propart in connection with the Company's
acquisition of a 51 ownership interest in the common stock of Qualipart.

In December 1997, the Company issued Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling 9
million through the State of Michigan Strategic Fund in order to partially fund
the construction of a new manufacturing facility in Marshall, Michigan and to
purchase certain new equipment for that facility. The net proceeds from this
bond offering are included in Restricted Cash and Equivalents. Certain land and
equipment, a building and an irrevocable letter of credit issued by the Company
through its bank have been offered as collateral for the bonds.

At June 30, 1998, the annual aggregate maturities of long-term obligations for
each of the five years subsequent thereto were as follows:

operating leases. The operating leases generally contain renewal and purchase
options at fair market value at the end of the lease terms. The Company also
leased certain equipment under a capital lease. Such assets were purchased and
the associated debt retired in November 1997. The cost and accumulated

As of June 30, 1998, the Company had noncancellable purchase commitments for
machinery and equipment totaling 8,159,600. In accordance with terms of the
purchase agreements, final acceptance of such equipment is contingent upon the
equipment demonstrating certain capabilities as documented in Company purchase
orders. The Company has entered into two foreign currency futures contracts to
reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency rates on firm commitments to
purchase equipment. Under the contracts, the Company is obligated to purchase
1,345,400 Swiss Francs at a weighted-average rate of 1.50 Swiss Francs per U.S.

On July 1, 1998, the Company established a foreign sales corporation, and in
conjunction therewith, intends to terminate its interest-charged domestic
international sales corporation in the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Upon
dissolution, Federal income tax expense of 265,000 will be recognized.

Undistributed earnings of the Company's Brazilian subsidiary amounted to
 170,600 at June 30, 1998. All of these earnings are considered to be
indefinitely reinvested, and accordingly, a provision for Federal and state
income taxes has not been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings
in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to both U.S.
income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding
taxes in Brazil. In the event that its Brazilian subsidiary's earnings were
distributed, U.S. income taxes, net of foreign credits, would be immaterial.

9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company leases certain production equipment from its majority shareholder
under a long-term operating lease agreement. The lease, which expires in May
2001, grants the Company an option to purchase the equipment at the expiration
of the lease term. Total lease expense, including amortization of a 234,800
initial payment over the lease term, was 351,000 for each period presented.

The Company leases a building from a partnership in which a director has a 50 
interest under a ten-year, noncancellable operating lease expiring in March
2005. Annual rentals under the lease are 300,000, and for a consideration of
 630,000 paid in March 1995, the Company obtained an option to purchase the
building for 3,125,000 at the end of the lease term. The Company subleases a
portion of this facility to Conway Products Corporation ("Conway"), an affiliate
by virtue of the majority shareholder's 100 ownership of Conway. Income and
reimbursement for utility costs under this sublease was 285,200, 259,600 and
 231,500 in fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

E-19

During fiscal 1996, the Company chartered its leased aircraft to the majority
shareholder and others through AMR Executive Charters, Inc. ("AMR"), an
affiliate by virtue of the majority shareholder's then 100 ownership interest
of AMR. The Company received 96,000 in charter revenue from AMR during the year
ended June 30, 1996, and 15,100, 7,800 and 10,800 in charter revenue from its
majority shareholder during the years ended June 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. The Company paid AMR 68,900 during fiscal 1996 for various
services and merchandise consisting primarily of the purchase of aviation fuel
at AMR's cost. The majority shareholder sold his interest in AMR during November
1995.

The Company has stock redemption agreements with its majority shareholder
whereby the Company is obligated to redeem up to 23,000,000 of common shares
following his and his spouse's death. The Company maintains joint life insurance
policies in order to fund its obligations under the agreements.

The Company has receivables from its officers and certain key employees in
connection with a life insurance program, collateralized by the cash surrender
value of the related insurance policies. Amounts receivable from such employees,
included in Other Long-Term Assets, were 1,217,200, 1,080,000 and 901,000 at
June 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively, including 811,200, 713,000 and
 617,000, respectively, due from the majority shareholder.

10. COMMON STOCK

The Board of Directors approved and distributed five-percent common share
dividends in each year during the three-year period ended June 30, 1998. The
Board of Directors also approved 2 cent per share quarterly cash dividends in
each fiscal quarter beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 1997.

The Company has reserved 787,500 common shares for issuance to employees under
the 1991 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"). Options are not exercisable
prior to twelve months from or ten years after the grant date. Options granted
vest at a rate of twenty percent annually over a five-year period. At June 30,
1998, 113,300 shares were available for future grants. Had the Company accounted
for the Plan based on the fair value of awards at the grant dates as prescribed
by SFAS 123, the Company's net income and net income per share would have been
decreased as indicated below.

The effects of applying SFAS 123 on a pro forma basis may not be representative
of the effects on reported pro forma net income for future years as the
estimated compensation costs reflect only options vesting after June 30, 1995.
Under the methodology of SFAS 123, the fair value of the Company's fixed stock
options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. The multiple option approach was used, with the following
weighted-average assumptions: dividend yield, .48 ; expected volatility, 45.09 ;
risk-free interest rate, 4 ; and, expected life of options, 10 years.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Autocam Corporation,

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Autocam
Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1998 and 1997, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and of cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1998. These financial
statements are the responsibility of Autocam's management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based upon our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Autocam Corporation and subsidiaries at June
30, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1998, in conformity with

TABLE OF MAXIMUM ANNUAL PREMIUMS PER 1,000 OF TERM INSURANCE
 USED FOR CALCULATION OF ADDITIONAL PROTECTION PREMIUMS
 SEE SECTION 3.2

 NOT APPLICABLE

SECTION 1. THE CONTRACT

 1.1 LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT

 The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company will pay a benefit on the
death of the second of the Insureds to die (the "second death"). No benefit is
payable on the death of the first of the Insureds to die. Subject to the terms
and conditions of the policy:

 - payment of the death proceeds will be made after proof of the deaths of
 both Insureds is received at the Home Office; and 
 - payment will be made to the beneficiary or other payee under Sections 10 
 and 11.

 The amount of the death proceeds when all premiums due have been paid will
 be:

 - the Basic Amount shown on page 3; plus
 - the amount of Additional Protection then in force under Section 3; plus 
 - the amount of any paid-up additions then in force under Section 6.3; plus
 - the amount of any premium refund (Section 4.1) and any dividend at death
 (Section 5.3); less the amount of any policy debt (Section 8.3).

 These amounts will be determined as of the date of the second death.

 The amount of the death proceeds when the second death occurs during the
grace period following the due date of any unpaid premium will be:

 - the amount determined above assuming the overdue premium had been paid; 
 less 
 - the amount of the unpaid premium.

 The amount of the death proceeds when the second death occurs while the
policy is in force as paid-up insurance will be determined under Section 7.2.

1.2 NOTICE AND PROOF OF DEATH

 Written notice and proof of the death of each Insured must be given to the
Company as soon as reasonably possible after each death.

1.3 ENTIRE CONTRACT; CHANGES

 This policy with the attached application is the entire contract. Statements
in the application are representations and not warranties. A change in the
policy is valid only if it is approved in writing by an officer the Company. The
Company may require that the policy be sent to it for endorsement to show a
change. No agent has the authority to change the policy or to waive any of its
terms.

E-43

1.4 INCONTESTABILITY

 The Company will not contest insurance under this policy after the insurance
has been in force during the lifetime of at least one Insured for two years from
the Date of Issue. In issuing the insurance, the Company has relied on the
application. While the insurance is contestable, the Company, on the basis of a
material misstatement in the application, may rescind the insurance or deny a
claim.

 1.5 SUICIDE

 If either Insured dies by suicide within one year from the Date of Issue, the
policy will terminate. The amount payable by the Company will be limited to the
premiums paid, less the amount of any policy debt, and less the cash value of
any paid-up additions surrendered.

1.6 DATES

 Policy months, years and anniversaries are computed from the Policy Date. The
contestable and suicide periods begin with the Date of Issue. These dates are
shown on Sage 3. The Date of Issue for any insurance issued under Scheduled
Additional Premiums After Issue (Section 4.2) or Unscheduled Additional Premium
Option (Section 4.3) will be shown on an amendment to the Schedule of Benefits
and Premiums.

1.7 MISSTATEMENT OF AGE OR SEX

 If the age or sex of either Insured has been misstated, the amount payable
will be the amount which the premiums paid would have purchased at the correct
age and sex.

1.8 PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY

 All payments by the Company under this policy are payable at its Home Office.

1.9 INSURABILITY REQUIREMENTS

 To make some changes under this policy, the Insureds (or the surviving
Insured) must meet the Company's insurability requirements. These requirements
are as follows:

 - evidence of insurability must be given that is satisfactory to the
 Company; and
 - under the Company's underwriting standards, the Insureds are (or the
 surviving Insured is) in an underwriting classification that is the same
 as, or is better than, the one for this policy.

 SECTION 2. OWNERSHIP

2.1 THE OWNER

 The Owner is named on page 3. The Owner, or the Owner's successor or
transferee, may exercise policy rights without the consent of any beneficiary.
After the second death, policy rights may be exercised only as provided in
Sections 10 and 11.

2.2 TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP

 The Owner may transfer the ownership of this policy. Written proof of
transfer satisfactory to the Company must be received at its Home Office. The
transfer will then take effect as of the date that it was signed. The Company
may require that the policy be sent to it for endorsement to show the transfer.

E-44

 9

2.3 COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT

 The Owner may assign this policy as collateral security. The Company is not
responsible for the validity or effect of a collateral assignment. The Company
will not be responsible to an assignee for any payment or other action taken by
the Company before receipt of the assignment in writing at its Home Office.

 The interest of any beneficiary will be subject to any collateral assignment
made either before or after the beneficiary is named.

 A collateral assignee is not an Owner. A collateral assignment is not a
transfer of ownership. Ownership can be transferred only by complying with
Section 2.2.

 SECTION 3. ADDITIONAL PROTECTION

3.1 ADDITIONAL PROTECTION

 Description. Additional Protection consists of one year term insurance
payable on the second death and paid-up additions payable on the second death.
The amount of one-year term insurance will be reduced by the amount of paid-up
additions purchased under Section 6.2 by dividends or by the payment of
additional premiums.

 If the Company determines that the premium for Additional Protection is
greater than the premium for the one year term insurance portion of Additional
Protection, the amount by which the premium for Additional Protection exceeds
the premium for one year term insurance will be treated as an additional premium
under Section 6.2.

 Amount. The amount of Additional Protection for each policy year will be the
amount shown on page 3 so long as premiums are paid when due unless:

 - the amount of Additional Protection is reduced by the Company under
 Section 3.2; or
 - the amount of Additional Protection is reduced by the Owner under Section
 3.3.

3.2 REDUCTION BY COMPANY; OWNER'S RIGHT TO CONTINUE EXISTING PROTECTION

 If, on any policy anniversary, any part of Additional Protection is one year
term insurance, the Company may reduce the one year term insurance. The Company
will determine annually, based on the mortality, investment earnings and expense
factors then being used to determine dividends payable on the policy, whether
the Basic Amount and Additional Protection will generate sufficient values to
pay the cost of one year term insurance. if the cost of one-year term insurance
is greater than these values, the one year term insurance will be reduced so
that its cost equals these values. The reduction of one-year term insurance will
cause a like reduction in the amount of Additional Protection, so that the
amount of Additional Protection will be less than the amount shown on page 3.
The Company will send written notice of the reduction.

 The Owner may prevent a reduction that would otherwise occur by the payment
of an increased premium for the portion of one-year term insurance that is part
of Additional Protection. The premium rates for one-year term insurance will not
be more than the rates shown on page 6.

 The increased premium for Additional Protection will be payable for the
remainder of the premium paying period. The premium must be received at the Home
Office within 31 days of the date the reduction would take effect.

 The right of the Owner to continue the amount of Additional Protection will
terminate as of the first policy anniversary on which the Owner fails to pay an
increased premium when due, or, if earlier, when the Owner reduces Additional
Protection under Section 3.3.

E-45

10

3.3 OTHER REDUCTIONS OF ADDITIONAL PROTECTION

 Reduction if Dividend Option Other Than Paid-Up Additions. If the Owner
directs that dividends be used other than to purchase paid-up additions, any one
year term insurance in force will terminate. The amount of Additional Protection
will then be the amount of paid-up additions in force under Section 6.2.

 Reduction If Additions To Reduce Term Insurance Surrendered. If additions
under Section 6.2 are surrendered, any one-year term insurance will terminate.
The amount of Additional Protection will then be the amount of paid-up additions
in force under Section 6.2. However, if the Company determines, based on the
mortality, investment earnings and expense factors then being used to determine
dividends on the policy, that the Basic Amount and Additional Protection, after
the surrender of these additions, would generate sufficient values to pay the
cost of one year term insurance, then:

 - one year term insurance will not terminate; and
 - the amount of Additional Protection will be reduced by the amount of
 paid-up additions under Section 6.2 that are surrendered 

 SECTION 4. PREMIUMS AND REINSTATEMENT

 4.1 PREMIUM PAYMENT

 Payment. All premiums after the first are payable at the Home Office or to an
authorized agent upon delivery of a receipt signed by an officer of the Company.
A premium must be paid on or before its due date. The date when each premium is
due and the number of years for which premiums are payable are described on page
3.

 No premiums may be paid while this policy is in force as paid-up insurance
under Section 7.2, except as provided in Reinstatement (Section 4.4).

 Frequency. Premiums are payable annually. Premiums may be paid on any other
frequency with the consent of the Company.

 Grace Period. A grace period of 31 days will be allowed to pay a premium that
is not paid on its due date. The policy will be in full force during this
period. If the second death occurs during the grace period, any overdue premium
will be paid from the proceeds of the policy.

 If a premium is not paid within the race period, the policy will terminate as
of the due gate unless it continues as paid-up insurance under Section 7.2.

 Premium Refund At Second Death. The Company will refund a portion of a
premium which was due and was paid for the policy year in which the second death
occurs. The refund will be the amount by which the premium paid is more than the
premium on an annual basis multiplied by the fraction of the policy year that
has elapsed at the time of the second death. Any premium amount used to purchase
a paid-up addition will not be included in determining the refund. The refund
will be part of the policy proceeds.

4.2 AMOUNT OF PREMIUM; ADJUSTMENTS

 Scheduled Premiums. The premium due on this policy is the scheduled premium.
The scheduled premium is the sum of the premium for the Basic Amount, any
premium for Additional Protection, any scheduled additional premium used to
purchase additions under Section 6.3, and any premium that is due for any
additional benefit that is a part of this policy. These premium amounts at issue
are shown on page 3.

 An increased premium for Additional Protection will be based on the attained
ages of both Insureds and the amount of one year term insurance that is in force
as part of Additional Protection as of the date used to determine the increased
premium.

E-46

11

Scheduled Additional Premiums At issue. This policy may have been issued with
additional premiums. The amount of these additional premiums is shown on page 3.

 Scheduled Additional Premiums After Issue. The Owner may pay additional
premiums by requesting that the premium payable on the policy be increased and
paying any required fees. An increase in the level amount may be made at any
time before the policy anniversary that is nearest to the 75th birthday of the
older (or of the surviving) Insured. Additional premiums may be scheduled only
if, at the time the increases are applied for:

 - the insurance in force after applying the scheduled additional premiums
 will be within the Company's issue limits;
 - the Company's insurability requirements are met (Section 1.9); and
 - the total amount of the scheduled additional premiums and other premiums
 paid to the Company under any policy for purchases of paid-up life
 insurance on the life of each Insured is within the Company's limits for
 such premiums; however, the Company may not set a limit below 1,000 per
 calendar year.

 Owner's Right To Decrease Scheduled Additional Premiums. The Owner may
decrease the scheduled additional premium amount used to purchase paid-up
additions under Section 6.3. This may be done at any time by written request
sent to the Home Office. Later increases in the amount may be made only as
provided in the preceding paragraph.

 Effective Date. A premium change will take effect on the first premium due
date that follows the receipt at the Home Office of the Owner's written request
for change. When the Owner increases or decreases premiums, the Company will
send an amendment to the Schedule of Benefits and Premiums.

 Scheduled Additional Premiums Used To Purchase Paid-Up Additions. Each
scheduled additional premium paid will be used, as of the due date of the
premium, to purchase a paid-up addition as described in Section 6.

4.3 UNSCHEDULED ADDITIONAL PREMIUM OPTION

 Unscheduled additional premiums may be paid to the Company at any time before
the policy anniversary that is nearest to the 75th birthday of the older (or of
the surviving) Insured. An unscheduled additional premium may be paid only if,
at the time the premium and any required fees are paid:

 - the insurance in force after applying the unscheduled additional premium
 will within the Company's issue limits;
 - the Company's insurability requirements are met; and
 - the total amount of unscheduled additional premiums and other premiums
 paid to the Company under any policy for purchases of paid-up life
 insurance on the life of each Insured is within the Company's limits for
 such premiums; however, the Company may not set a limit below 1,000 per
 calendar year.

 Each unscheduled additional premium may not be less than the minimum amount
shown on page 3. Each unscheduled additional premium will be used, as of the
date the premium is paid, to purchase a paid-up addition as described in Section
6.

4.4 REINSTATEMENT

 This policy may be reinstated within three years after the due date of the
overdue premium. All unpaid premiums (except premiums that would purchase
paid-up additions) and interest as required below must e received by the
Company:

 - while both Insureds are alive; or

 - while one insured is alive if only that Insured was alive on the due date
 of the overdue premium.

 The policy may not be reinstated if the policy was surrendered for its cash
surrender value. Any policy debt on the due date of the overdue premium, with
interest from that date at the policy loan interest rate, must be repaid or
reinstated.

E-47

 12

SECTION 5. DIVIDENDS

5.1 ANNUAL DIVIDENDS

 This policy will share in the divisible surplus of the Company. This surplus
is determined each year. This policy's share will be credited as a dividend on
the policy anniversary.

5.2 USE OF DIVIDENDS

 Annual dividends may be paid in cash or used for one of the following:

 - Paid-Up Additions. Dividends will purchase paid-up additional insurance as
 described in Section 6.
 - Premium Payment. Dividends will be used to reduce premiums. If the balance
 of a premium is not paid, or if this policy is in force as paid-up
 insurance, the dividend will purchase paid-up additions.

 Other uses of dividends may be made available by the Company.

 If no direction is given for the use of dividends, they will purchase paid-up
additions.

5.3 DIVIDEND AT DEATH

 A dividend payable for the period from the beginning of the policy year to
the date of the second death will be payable as part of the policy proceeds.

 SECTION 6. PAID-UP ADDITIONS

6.1 PURCHASE OF ADDITIONS; CHARGES

 Paid-up additions are purchased by additional premiums and by dividends.
Paid-up auditions can be used to reduce term insurance (Section 6.2) or to
increase coverage (Section 6.3). Paid-up additions increase the policy's cash
value and will share in divisible surplus. They may be surrendered, subject to
the limitations of Section 3.3, unless they are used for a loan.

 The Company may deduct a charge for expenses for each additional premium that
is used to purchase a paid-up addition. The charge will be 9 for additional
premiums that were scheduled at issue or that are applied for before the 20th
policy anniversary. The charge will be 9 for unscheduled additional premiums
that are paid before the 20th policy anniversary.

6.2 ADDITIONS TO REDUCE TERM INSURANCE

 This type of paid-up addition will be part of the Additional Protection. Each
addition will reduce the amount of one-year term insurance that is in force as
part of Additional Protection, and the amount of Additional Protection will
remain unchanged.

6.3 ADDITIONS TO INCREASE COVERAGE

 This type of paid-up addition will be used to provide paid-up insurance that
is not included in Additional Protection. Each addition will immediately
increase the death proceeds payable under Section 1.1.

E-48

13

6.4 ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL PREMIUMS AND DIVIDENDS

 When there is no one year term insurance in force as part of Additional
Protection, the dividends and the additional premiums will be applied under
Section 6.3. When there is one-year term insurance in force, dividends and any
part of the premium for Additional Protection treated as an additional premium
will be applied under Section 6.2. Scheduled additional premiums which are not
part of the premium for Additional Protection will be applied under Section 6.3.

 Subject to the preceding paragraph, the Owner may change the allocation of
additional premiums between Sections 6.2 and 6.3. This may be done by written
request that is sent to the Home Office, if the Company's insurability
requirements are met (Section 1.9). An allocation must e made in whole dollars.
An increase in the amount of premium allocated to the Purchase of additions
under Section 6.2 will be reflected as an increase in the amount of the premium
payable for Additional Protection.

 In addition, for the policy to be reinstated more than 31 days after the end
of the grace period:

 - evidence of insurability must be given that is satisfactory to the
 Company:

 a. for both Insureds; or 
 b. for one Insured if only that Insured was alive on the due date of the
 overdue premium; and

 - all unpaid premiums (except premiums that would purchase paid-up
 additions) must be paid with interest from the due date of each premium.
 Interest is at an annual effective rate of 6 .

 SECTION 7. CASH VALUES AND PAID-UP INSURANCE

7.1 CASH VALUE

 The cash value for this policy, when all premiums due have been paid, will be
the sum of:

 - the cash value from the Table of Guaranteed Values on page 4; and 
 - the cash value of any paid-up additions.

 The cash value within three months after the due date of any unpaid premium
will be the cash value on that due date reduced by any later surrender of
paid-up additions. After that, the cash value will be the cash value of the
insurance then in force.

 The cash value of any paid-up insurance or paid-up additions will be the net
single premium for that insurance at the attained ages of both Insureds.

7.2 PAID-UP INSURANCE

 If any premium is unpaid at the end of the grace period, this policy will be
in force as paid-up insurance. The amount of paid-up insurance will be
determined by using the cash value from the Table of Guaranteed Values as a net
single premium at the attained ages of both Insureds. Any paid-up additions and
any policy debt will continue.

 Paid-up insurance will share in divisible surplus.

 The amount of the death proceeds when this policy is in force as paid-up
insurance will be:

 - the amount of paid-up insurance determined above; plus
 - the amount of any in force paid-up additions; plus
 - the amount of any dividend at death (Section 5.3); less
 - the amount of any policy debt (Section 8.3).

E-49

14

These amounts will be determined as of the date of the second death.

 If paid-up insurance is surrendered within 31 days after a policy
anniversary, the cash value will not be less than the cash value on that
anniversary reduced by any later surrender of paid-up additions.

7.3 CASH SURRENDER

 The Owner may surrender this policy for its cash surrender value. The cash
surrender value is the cash value less any policy debt. A written surrender of
all claims, satisfactory to the Company, will be required. The date of surrender
will be the date of receipt at the Home Office of the written surrender. The
policy will terminate and the cash surrender value will be determined as of the
date of surrender. The Company may require that the policy be sent to it.

7.4 TABLE OF GUARANTEED VALUES

 Cash values and paid-up insurance for the Basic Amount are shown on page 4
for the end of the policy years indicated. These values assume that all premiums
due have been paid for the number of years. They do not reflect paid-up
additions or policy debt. Values during a policy year will reflect the time
elapsed in that year.

 Cash values for paid-up additions are shown on page 5. Each cash value is
equal to the net single premium at the attained ages of both Insureds. Values
during a policy year reflect the time elapsed in that year.

 Values for policy years not shown are calculated on the same basis as those
on page 4. A list of these values will be furnished on request. All values are
at least as great as those required by the state in which this policy is
delivered.

7.5 BASIS OF VALUES

 The cash value for each policy year not shown on page 4 equals the reserve
the Basic Amount for that year calculated on the Commissioners Reserve Valuation
Method. Cash values and net single premiums are calculated using the basis of
values shown on page 4. Calculations assume the continuous payment of premiums
and the immediate payment of claims.

 For unscheduled additional premiums or increases in scheduled additional
premiums applied for after the 20th anniversary, the Company may base cash
values an premiums on the interest rates and mortality tables being used as the
basis of values for whole life insurance then being issued by the Company.

 SECTION 8. LOANS

8.1 POLICY AND PREMIUM LOANS

 The Owner may obtain a loan from the Company in an amount that is not more
than the loan value.

 Policy Loan. The loan may be obtained on written request. The Company may
defer making the loan for up to six months unless the loan is to be used to pay
premiums due the Company.

 Premium Loan. If the premium loan provision is in effect on this policy, a
loan will be made to pay an overdue scheduled premium. If the loan value is not
large enough to pay the overdue scheduled premium on a quarterly frequency, the
policy will continue in force or terminate as provided in Grace Period (Section
4.1). The Owner may elect or revoke the premium loan provision by written
request received at the Home Office.

E-50

 15

8.2 LOAN VALUE

 The loan value is the smaller of a. or b., less any policy debt and any
scheduled premium then due or billed; a. and b. are defined as:

 a. the cash value one year after the date of the loan, assuming all scheduled
 premiums due within that year are paid, less interest to one year from the
 date of the loan. 
 b. the cash value on the due date of the first scheduled premium not yet
 billed that is due after the date of the loan, less interest from the date
 of the loan to that premium due date.

8.3 POLICY DEBT

 Poll debt consists of all outstanding loans and accrued interest. It may be
paid to the Company at any time. Any policy debt will be deducted from the
policy proceeds. If the policy debt equals or exceeds the cash value, this
policy will terminate. Termination occurs 31 days after a notice has been mailed
to the Owner and to any assignee on record at the Home Office.

8.4 LOAN INTEREST

 Interest accrues on a daily basis from the date of the loan on policy loans
and from the premium due date on premium loans. Unpaid interest is added to the
loan. Interest is payable at an annual effective rate that is set by the Company
annually and applied to new or outstanding policy debt during the year beginning
each January 1. The highest loan interest rate that may be set by the Company is
the greater of:

 - a rate 1 higher than the rate shown on page 4 used to calculate cash
 values and net single premiums; and
 - a rate based on the Corporate Bond Yield Averages -- Monthly Average
 Corporate for the immediately preceding October. This Average is published
 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. If it is no Conger published, the
 highest loan rate will be based on some other similar average established
 by the insurance supervisory official of the state in which this policy is
 delivered.

 The loan interest rate set by the Company will not exceed the maximum rate
permitted by the laws of the state in which this policy is delivered. The loan
interest rate may be increased only if the increase in the annual effective rate
is at least 1/2 . The loan interest rate will be decreased if the decrease in
the annual effective rate is at least 1/2 .

 The Company will give notice:

 - of the initial loan interest rate in effect at the time a policy or
 premium loan is made.
 - of an increase in loan interest rate on outstanding policy debt no later
 than 30 days before the January 1st on which the increase takes effect.

 This policy will not terminate during a policy year as the sole result of an
increase in the loan interest rate during that policy year.

 SECTION 9. CHANGE OF POLICY

9.1 CHANGE OF PLAN

 The Owner may reduce the amount of this policy, subject to the Company's
minimum policy amount rules. The Owner may also change this policy to any
permanent life insurance plan agreed to by the Owner and the Company by:

 - paying the required costs; and
 - meeting any other conditions set by the Company.

E-51

16
9.2 POLICY SPLIT

 Policy Split Right. While both Insureds are alive, the Owner may exchange
this policy for two policies (the "new policies"), one on the life of each
Insured, if there is a change in federal estate tax law which results in either:

 a. the repeal of the unlimited marital deduction provision; or 
 b. at least a 50 reduction in the maximum percentage rate set forth in the
 federal estate tax schedule in effect on the Date of Issue of this Policy.

 This exchange may be made without evidence of insurability.

 Conditions. The exchange may be made by meeting any conditions set by the
 Company, including the following:

 a. the Company must receive a written request from the owner no more than 180
 days after the earlier of the date of enactment of the law repealing the
 unlimited marital deduction or the date of enactment of the law reducing
 the maximum percentage rate of federal estate tax by 50 ; and

 b. any required costs are paid. These costs include the first premiums on the
 new policies and any difference in cash values between this policy and the
 new policies.

 Terms Of The New Policies. The new policies will be issued on the Whole Life
Paid Up at 90 plan. The new policies will have the same Date of Issue and Policy
Date as this policy. The new policies will take effect on the date the written
request to exchange this policy for the new policies is received at the Home
Office. This policy will terminate when the new policies take effect.

 The amount of the death benefit of each new policy will be one-half the
amount of the death benefit this policy, including the amount of any additions
purchased under Section 6.3. The cash value of this policy will be allocated to
each new policy as determined appropriate by the Company. Any policy debt will
be divided between the new policies in proportion to the cash value. Any
assignment will continue on the new policies.

 The premium for each new policy will be based on the Company's premium rates
in effect on the Policy Date of this policy, the Insured's sex, the Insured's
age on the Policy Date of this policy, and the insured's underwriting
classification for this policy.

 A new policy may have the Waiver of Premium Benefit if the Insured under the
new policy is a Covered insured under the Waiver of Premium Benefit on this
policy. If premiums are waived on this policy at the time of the exchange,
premiums will continue to be waived on the new policy insuring the disabled
Covered insured for as long as they would have been waived under this policy.

 If the sum of the cash values of the new policies is less than the cash value
of this policy, the excess cash value will be used to purchase paid-up additions
on the new policies.

 SECTION 10. BENEFICIARIES

10.1 DEFINITION OF BENEFICIARIES

 The term "beneficiaries" as used in this policy includes direct
beneficiaries, contingent beneficiaries and further payees.

10.2 NAMING AND CHANGE OF BENEFICIARIES

 By Owner. The Owner may name and change the beneficiaries of death proceeds:

 - before the second death.

E-52

17

- during the first 60 days after the date of the second death, if the second
 insured was not the Owner immediately prior to the second death. A change
 made during this 60 days may not be revoked.

 By Direct Beneficiary. A direct beneficiary may name and change the
contingent beneficiaries and further payees of the direct beneficiary's share of
the proceeds:

 - if the direct beneficiary is the Owner;
 - if, at any time after the second death, no contingent beneficiary or
 further payee of that share is living: or
 - if, after the second death, the direct beneficiary elects a payment plan.
 The interest of any other beneficiary in the share of that direct
 beneficiary will end.

 These direct beneficiary rights are subject to the Owner's rights during the
60 days after the second death.

 Effective Date. A naming or change of a beneficiary will be made on receipt
at the Home Office of a written request that is acceptable to the Company. The
request will then take effect as of the date it was signed. The Company is not
responsible for any payment or other action that is taken by it before the
receipt of the request. The Company may require that the policy be sent to it to
be endorsed to show the naming or change.

10.3 SUCCESSION IN INTEREST OF BENEFICIARIES

 Direct Beneficiaries. The proceeds of this policy will be payable in equal
shares to the direct beneficiaries who survive and receive payment. If a direct
beneficiary dies before receiving all or part of the direct beneficiary's full
share, the unpaid portion will be payable in equal shares to the other direct
beneficiaries who survive and receive payment.

 Contingent Beneficiaries. At the death of all of the direct beneficiaries,
the proceeds, or the present value of any unpaid payments under a payment plan,
will be payable in equal shares to the contingent beneficiaries who survive and
receive payment. If a contingent beneficiary dies before receiving all or part
of the contingent beneficiary's full share, the unpaid portion will be payable
in equal shares to the other contingent beneficiaries who survive and receive
payment.

 Further Payees. At the death of all of the direct and contingent
beneficiaries, the proceeds, or the present value of any unpaid payments under a
payment plan, will be paid in one sum:

 - in equal shares to the further payees who survive and receive payment; or
 - if no further payees survive and receive payment, to the estate of the
 last to die of all of the direct and contingent beneficiaries.

 Owner Or The Owner's Estate. If no beneficiaries are alive on the date of the
second death, the proceeds will be paid to the Owner or to the Owner's estate.

10.4 GENERAL

 Transfer Of Ownership. A transfer of ownership of itself will not change the
interest of a beneficiary.

 Claims Of Creditors. So far as allowed by law, no amount payable under this
policy will be subject to the claims of creditors of a beneficiary.

 Succession Under Payment Plans. A direct or contingent beneficiary who
succeeds to an interest in a payment plan will continue under the terms of the
plan.

E-53

18

SECTION 11. PAYMENT OF POLICY BENEFITS

11.1 PAYMENT OF PROCEEDS

 Death proceeds will be paid under the payment plan that takes effect on the
second death. The Interest Income Plan (Option A) will be in effect if no
payment plan has been elected. Interest will accumulate from the date of the
second death until a payment plan is elected or the proceeds are withdrawn in
cash.

 Surrender proceeds will be the cash surrender value as of the date of
surrender. These proceeds will be paid in cash or under a payment plan that is
elected. The Company may defer paying the surrender proceeds for up to six
months from the date of surrender. If payment is deferred for 30 days or more,
interest will be paid on the surrender proceeds from the date of surrender to
the date of payment. Interest will be at the annual effective interest rate
shown on page 4 used to calculate cash values and net single premiums.

11.2 PAYMENT PLANS

 Interest Income Plan (Option A). The proceeds will earn interest, which may e
received each month or accumulated. The first payment is due one month after the
date on which the plan takes effect. Interest that has accumulated may be
withdrawn at any time. Part or all of the proceeds may be withdrawn at any time.

 Installment Income Plans. Payments will be made each month on the terms of
the plan that is elected. The first payment is due on the date that the plan
takes effect.

 - Specified Period (Option B). The proceeds with interest will be paid over
 a period of from one to 30 years. The present value of any unpaid
 installments may be withdrawn at any time. 
 - Specified Amount (Option D). Payments of not less than 10 per 1,000 of
 proceeds will be made until all of the proceeds with interest have been
 paid. The balance may be withdrawn at any time.

 Life Income Plans. Payments will be made each month on the terms of the plan
that is elected. The first payment is due on the date that the plan takes
effect. Proof of the date of birth, acceptable to the Company, must be furnished
for each person on whose the payments are based.

 - Single Life Income (Option C). Payments will be made for a chosen period
 and, after that, for the life of the person on whose life the payments are
 based. The choices for the period are:

 a. zero years; 
 b. 10 years; 
 c. 20 years; or 
 d. a refund period which continues until the sum of the payments that have
 been made is equal to the proceeds that were placed under the plan.

 - Joint And Survivor Life Income (Option E). Payments are based on the lives
 of two persons. Level payments will be made for a period of 10 years and,
 after that, for as long as one or both of the persons are living.
 - Other Selections. The Company may offer other selections under the Life
 Income Plans.
 - Withdrawal. The present value of any unpaid payments that are to be made
 for the chosen period (Option C) or the 10 year period (Option E) may be
 withdrawn only after the death of all of the persons on whose lives the
 payments are based.
 - Limitations. A direct or contingent beneficiary who is a natural person
 may be paid under a Life Income Plan only if the payments depend on that
 beneficiary's life. If a direct or contingent beneficiary is not a natural
 person, the Company's approval of the payment plan is required.

 Payment Frequency. On request, payments will be made once every 3, 6 or 12
months instead of each month.

E-54

19

Transfer Between Payment Plans. A beneficiary who is receiving payment under
a plan which includes the right to withdraw may transfer the amount withdrawable
to any other plan that is available.

 Minimum Payment The Company may limit the election of a payment plan to one
that results in payments of at least 50.

 If payments under a payment plan are or become less than 50, the Company may
change the frequency of payments. If the payments are being made once every 12
months and are less than 50, the Company may pay the present value or the
balance of the payment plan.

11.3 PAYMENT PLAN RATES

 Interest Income And Installment Income Plans. Proceeds will earn interest at
rates declared each year by the Company. None of these rates will be less than
an annual effective rate of 2 . Interest of more than 2 will increase the
amount of the payments or, for the Specified Amount Plan (Option D), increase
the number of payments. The Company may offer guaranteed rates of interest
higher than 2 with conditions on withdrawal.

 The present value of the amount of any unpaid installments will be based on
the rate of interest used to determine the amount of the payment.

 Life Income Plans. Payments will be based on rates declared by the Company.
These rates will provide at least as much income as would the Company's rates,
on the date that the payment plan takes effect, for a single premium immediate
annuity contract. Payments under these rates will not be less than the amounts
that are described in Minimum Payment Rates.

 Minimum Payment Rates. The minimum payment rates for the Installment Income
Plans (Options B and D) and the Life Income Plans (Options C and E) are shown in
the Minimum Payment Rate Tables.

 The Life Income Plan payment rates in those tables depend on the sex and on
the adjusted age of each person on whose life the payments are based. The
adjusted age is:

 - the age on the birthday that is nearest to the date on which the payment
 plan takes effect; plus 
 - the age adjustment shown below for the number of policy years that have
 elapsed from the Policy Date to the date that the payment plan takes
 effect. A part of a policy year is counted as a full year.

 9 to 16 -1 41 to 48 -5
 17 to 24 -2 49 or more -6
 25 to 32 -3

11.4 EFFECTIVE DATE FOR PAYMENT PLAN

 A payment plan that is elected for death proceeds will take effect on the
date of the second death if:

 - the plan is elected by the Owner; and 
 - the election is received at the Home Office before the second death.

 In all other cases, a payment plan that is elected will take effect:

E-55

20

- on the date the election is received at the Home Office; or
 - on a later date, if requested.

11.5 PAYMENT PLAN ELECTIONS

 For Death Proceeds By Owner. The Owner may elect payment plans for death
proceeds:

 - before the second death.
 - during the first 60 days after the date of the second death, if the second
 insured to die was not the Owner immediately prior to the second death. An
 election made during those 60 days may not be changed.

 For Death Proceeds By Direct Or Contingent Beneficiary. A direct or
contingent beneficiary may elect payment plans for death proceeds payable to
that beneficiary if no payment plan that has been elected is in effect. This
right is subject to the Owner's rights during the 60 days after the date of the
second death.

 For Surrender Proceeds. The Owner may elect payment plans for surrender
proceeds. The Owner will be the direct beneficiary.

11.6 INCREASE OF MONTHLY INCOME

 A direct beneficiary who is to receive proceeds under a payment plan may
increase the amount of the monthly payments. This is done by the
payment of an annuity premium to the Company at the time the payment plan
elected under Section 11.5 takes effect. The amount that will be applied under
the payment plan will be the net premium. The net premium is the annuity premium
less a charge of not more than 2 and less an any. The net premium will be
applied under the same payment plan and at the same rates as the proceeds. The
Company may limit this net premium to an amount that is equal to the direct
beneficiary's share of the proceeds payable under this Policy.

and AUTOCAM CORPORATION, a Michigan corporation ("Lessee").

 INTRODUCTION:
 ------------

 Lessor and Lessee have heretofore entered into that certain Master
Equipment Lease Agreement dated as of July 10, 1995 (the "Master Lease"; the
Master Lease and this Schedule hereinafter collectively referred to as, this
"Lease"). 'Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall
have the meanings specified in the Master Lease. The Master Lease provides for
the execution and delivery of a Schedule substantially in the form hereof for
the purpose of confirming the acceptance and lease of the Equipment under this
Lease as and when delivered by Lessor to Lessee in accordance with the terms
thereof and hereof.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and
sufficient consideration, Lessor and Lessee hereby agree as follows:

 1. EQUIPMENT. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Lease,

5. TAX INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Lessee acknowledges that Lessor has
executed this Lease, and that the Rent payable by Lessee under this Lease has
been computed, upon the assumptions that Lessor will (i) be entitled to
depreciation or cost recovery deductions ("MACRS Deductions") for Federal income
tax purposes under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System provided for in
Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and
depreciation or cost recovery deductions ("State Depreciation Deductions") for
state income tax purposes for the State of New York ("New York"), in each case
on the basis that (1) each Item of Equipment constitutes '7-year property"
within the meaning of Section 168(e) of the Code, (2) the initial tax basis for
each Item of Equipment will be equal to the Total Cost, (3) deductions for each
Item of Equipment will be computed by using the method specified in Section
168(b)(1) of the Code over the 7-year recovery period described in Section
168(c) of the Code, and (4) the applicable convention for each Item of Equipment
under Section 168(d) of the Code is the half-year convention; (ii) be entitled
to deductions for Federal income tax purposes (available in the manner and as
provided by Section 163 of the Code) for interest payable with respect to any
indebtedness incurred by Lessor in connection with any financing by Lessor of
any portion of the Total Cost of each Item of Equipment ("Interest Deductions");
and (iii) be subject to tax for each year at a composite Federal and New York
corporate income tax rate equal to the then highest marginal rate for
corporations provided for under the Code and the laws of New York (the "Highest
Marginal Tax Rate"). The MACRS Deductions, State Depreciation Deductions and
Interest Deductions are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Tax
Benefits".

 (b) Lessee represents and warrants to Lessor that (i) each Item
of Equipment constitutes 7-year property" within the meaning of Section 168(e)
of the Code, (ii) Lessee shall not attempt to claim such Tax Benefits, (iii) at
and after the time of delivery of the Equipment to Lessee pursuant to this
Lease, the Equipment shall be owned by Lessor for Federal income tax purposes
and Lessee shall not claim any ownership or title in and to the Equipment, and
(iv) Lessee has not, and will not, at any time after such delivery throughout
the Term of this Lease, take any action or omit to take any action (whether or
not the same is permitted or required hereunder) which will result in the loss
by Lessor of all or any part of such Tax Benefits.

 (c) If, as a result of any act, omission or misrepresentation of
Lessee, (x) the Tax Benefits are lost, disallowed, deferred, eliminated,
reduced, recaptured, compromised or otherwise unavailable to Lessor, (y) for
Federal, foreign, state or local income tax purposes, any item of income, loss
or deduction with respect to any Item of Equipment is treated as derived from,
or allocable to, sources outside the United States, or (z) there shall be
included in the gross income of Lessor for Federal, state or local income tax
purposes any amount on account of any addition, modification, substitution or
improvement to or in respect of any Item of Equipment made or paid for by Lessee
(any of the foregoing being hereinafter a "Tax Loss",), then, within thirty (30)
days of Lessee's receipt of written notice from Lessor that such a Tax Loss has
occurred, Lessee shall pay to Lessor an amount which, after deduction therefrom
of all taxes to be paid in respect of the receipt thereof, will enable Lessor to
receive the same Net Economic Return (as hereinafter defined) that Lessor would
have realized on this Lease had such Tax Loss (together with any interest,
penalties or additions to tax) not occurred. Any event which, by the terms of
this Lease, requires payment by Lessee to Lessor of the Stipulated Loss Value of
the Equipment shall not constitute the act of Lessee for purpose of the
foregoing sentence.

 (d) As used in this Section, the term "Net Economic Return" shall
mean Lessor's net after-tax yield, aggregate after-tax cash flow and return on
assets, based on (i) the assumptions used by Lessor in originally calculating
Rent and Stipulated Loss Value percentages, including the assumptions set forth
above (as such assumptions may have been revised pursuant to the last sentence
of this subsection) and (ii) the Highest Marginal Tax Rate actually in effect
during each year from the date of such original calculations to the date of
such Tax Loss, both dates inclusive. In the event Lessor shall suffer a Tax
Loss with respect to which Lessee is required to pay an indemnity hereunder,
and the full amount of such indemnity has been paid or provided for hereunder,
the aforesaid assumptions, without further act of the parties hereto, shall
thereupon be and be deemed to be amended, if and to the extent appropriate, to
reflect such Tax Loss.

6. TRUE LEASE TRANSACTION. (a) It is the express intent of the
parties that this Lease constitutes a true lease and not a sale of the
Equipment. Title to the Equipment shall at all times remain in Lessor, and
Lessee shall acquire no ownership, title, property, right, equity, or interest
in the Equipment other than its leasehold interest solely as Lessee subject to
all the terms and conditions hereof. To the extent that Article 2A ("Article 2X)
of the Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC") applies to the characterization of this
Lease, the parties hereby agree that this Lease is a "Finance Lease" as defined
therein. Lessee acknowledges: (i) that Lessee has selected the "Supplier" (as
defined in the UCC) and has directed Lessor to purchase the Equipment from the
Supplier in connection with this Lease, and (ii) that Lessee has been informed
in writing in this Lease, before Lessee's execution of this Lease, that Lessee
is entitled under Article 2A to the promises and warranties, including those of
any third party, provided to Lessor by the Supplier in connection with or as
part of the Purchase Agreement, and that Lessee may communicate with the
Supplier and receive an accurate and complete statement of those promises and
warranties, including any disclaimers and limitations of them or of remedies.
The filing of UCC financing statements pursuant to Section 34 of the Master
Lease is precautionary and shall not be deemed to have any effect on the
characterization of this Lease.

 (b) Notwithstanding the express intent of Lessor and Lessee that
this agreement constitute a true lease and not a sale of the Equipment, should a
court of competent jurisdiction determine that this agreement is not a true
lease, but rather one intended as security, then solely in that event and for
the expressly limited purposes thereof, Lessee shall be deemed to have hereby
granted Lessor a security interest in the Equipment and all accessions,
substitutions and replacements thereto and therefor, and proceeds (cash and
non-cash), including, without limitation, insurance proceeds thereof (but
without power of sale), to secure the prompt payment and performance as and when
due of all obligations and indebtedness of Lessee, now existing or hereafter
created, to Lessee pursuant to this Lease or otherwise. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Lessee shall execute and deliver to Lessor, to be recorded at
Lessee's expense, Uniform Commercial Code financing statements, statements of
amendment and statements of continuation as reasonably may be required by Lessor
to perfect and maintain perfected such security interest.

 (c) In the event that the Supplier erroneously invoices Lessee
for the Equipment, Lessee agrees to forward said invoice to Lessor immediately.
Lessee acknowledges that the Equipment is, and shall at all times remain, the
property of Lessor, and that Lessee has no right, title or interest therein or,
thereto except as expressly set forth in the Lease.

5. TAX INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Lessee acknowledges that Lessor has
executed this Lease, and that the Rent payable by Lessee under this Lease has

within the meaning of Section 168(e) of the Code, (2) the initial tax basis for
each Item of Equipment will be equal to the Total Cost, (3) deductions for each
Item of Equipment will be computed by using the method specified in Section
168(b)(1) of the Code over the seven-year recovery period described in Section
168(c) of the Code, and (4) the applicable convention for each Item of Equipment
under Section 168(d) of the Code is the half-year convention, (ii) be entitled

indebtedness incurred by Lessor in connection with any financing by Lessor of
any portion of the Total Cost of each item of Equipment ("Interest Deductions");

Interest Deductions are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Tax
Benefits".

Equipment, and (iv) Lessee has not, and will not, at any time after such
delivery throughout the Term of this Lease, take any action or omit to take any
action (whether or not the same is permitted or required hereunder) which will
result in the loss by Lessor of all or any part Of Such Tax Benefits.

 (c) If, as a result of any act, omission or misrepresentation of
Lessee, (x) the Tax Benefits are lost, disallowed, deferred, eliminated,
reduced, recaptured, compromised or otherwise unavailable to Lessor, (y) for
Federal, foreign, state or local income tax purposes, any item of income, loss
or deduction with respect to any Item of Equipment is treated as derived from,
or allocable to, sources outside the United States, or (z) there shall be
included in the gross income of Lessor for Federal, state or local income tax
purposes any amount on account of any addition, modification, substitution or
improvement to or in respect of any Item of Equipment made or paid for by Lessee
(any of the foregoing being hereinafter a "Tax Loss"), then, within thirty (30)
days of Lessee's receipt of written notice from Lessor that such a Tax Loss has
occurred, Lessee shall pay to Lessor an amount which, after deduction therefrom
of all taxes to be paid in respect of the receipt thereof, will enable Lessor to
receive the same Net Economic Return (as hereinafter defined) that Lessor would
have realized on this Lease had such Tax Loss (together with any interest,
penalties or additions to tax) not occurred. Any event which, by the terms of
this Lease, requires payment by Lessee to Lessor of the Stipulated Loss Value of
the Equipment shall not constitute the act of Lessee for purpose of the
foregoing sentence.

 (d) As used in this Section, the term "Net Economic Return"
shall mean Lessor's net after-tax yield, aggregate after-tax cash flow and
return on assets, based on (i) the assumptions used by Lessor in originally
calculating Rent and Stipulated Loss Value percentages, including the
assumptions set forth above (as such assumptions may have been revised pursuant
to the last sentence of this subsection) and (ii) the Highest Marginal Tax Rate
actually in effect during each year from the date of such original calculations
to the date of such Tax Loss, both dates inclusive. In the event Lessor shall
suffer a Tax Loss with respect to which Lessee is required to pay an indemnity
hereunder, and the full amount of such indemnity has been paid or provided for
hereunder, the aforesaid assumptions, without further act of the parties hereto,
shall thereupon be and be deemed to be amended, if and to the extent
appropriate, to reflect such Tax Loss.

 (e) For purposes of this Section, the term "Lessor" shall
include the entity or entities, if any, with which Lessor consolidates any tax
return. Lessee acknowledges that it has neither sought nor received tax advice
from Lessor as to the availability to Lessee of any tax benefits with respect to
the Equipment. All of Lessor's rights and privileges arising from the
indemnities contained in this Lease will survive the expiration or other
termination or cancellation of this Lease. Such indemnities are expressly made
for the benefit of, and are enforceable by, Lessor and its successors and
assigns.

parties that this Lease constitutes a true lease and not a sale of the
Equipment. Title to the Equipment shall at all times remain in Lessor, and
Lessee shall acquire no ownership, title, property, right, equity, or interest
in the Equipment other than its leasehold interest solely as Lessee subject to

connection with or as part of the Purchase Agreement, and that Lessee may
communicate with the Supplier and receive an accurate and complete statement of
those promises and warranties, including any disclaimers and limitations of them
or of remedies. The filing of UCC financing statements pursuant to Section 34 of

the characterization of this Lease.

 (b) Notwithstanding the express intent of Lessor and Lessee that
this agreement constitute a true lease and not a sale of the Equipment, should a
court of competent jurisdiction determine that this agreement is not a true
lease, but rather one intended as security, then solely in that event and for
the expressly limited purposes thereof, Lessee, shall he deemed to have hereby
granted Lessor a security interest in the Equipment and all accessions,
substitutions and replacements thereto and therefor, and proceeds (cash and
non-cash), including, without limitation, insurance proceeds thereof (but

due of all obligations and indebtedness of Lessee, now existing or hereafter
created, to Lessee pursuant to this Lease or otherwise. In furtherance of the
foregoing Lessee shall execute and deliver to Lessor, to be recorded at Lessee's
expense, Uniform Commercial Code financing statements, statements of amendment
and statements of continuation as reasonably may be required by Lessor to
perfect and maintain perfected such security interest.

for the Equipment, Lessee agrees to forward said invoice to Lessor immediately.
Lessee acknowledges that the Equipment is, and shall at all times remain, the
property of Lessor, and that Lessee has no right, title or interest therein or
thereto except as expressly set forth in the Lease.

Equipment Lease Agreement dated as of July 10, 1995 (the "Master Lease"; the
Master Lease mid this Schedule hereinafter collectively referred to as, this
"Lease"). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall

 5. TAX INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Lessee acknowledges that Lessor has
executed this Lease, and that the Rent payable by Lessee under this Lease has
been computed, upon the assumptions that Lessor win (i) be entitled to
depreciation or cost recovery deductions ("MACRS Deductions") for Federal income
tax purposes under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System provided for in
Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and
depreciation or cost recovery deductions ("State Depreciation Deductions") for
state income tax purposes for the State of New York ("New York"), in each case
on the basis that (1) each Item of Equipment constitutes seven-year property"
within the meaning of Section 168(e) of the Code, (2) the initial tax basis for
each Item of Equipment will be equal to the Total Cost, (3) deductions for each
Item of Equipment will be computed by using the method specified in Section
168(b)(1) of the Code over the seven-year recovery period described in Section
168(c) of the Code, and (4) the applicable convention for each Item of Equipment
under Section 168(d) of the Code is the half-year convention, (ii) be entitled
to deductions for Federal income tax purposes (available in the manner and as
provided by Section 163 of the Code) for interest payable with respect to any
indebtedness incurred by Lessor in connection with any financing by Lessor of
any portion of the Total Cost of each item of Equipment ("Interest Deductions");
and (iii) be subject to tax for each year at a composite Federal and New York
corporate income tax rate equal to the then highest marginal rate for
corporations provided for under the Code and the laws of New York (the "Highest
Marginal Tax Rate"). The MACRS Deductions, State Depreciation Deductions and
Interest Deductions are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Tax
Benefits".

E-82

18

(b) Lessee represents and warrants to Lessor that (i) each Item
of Equipment constitutes seven-year property" within the meaning of Section
168(e) of the Code, (ii) Lessee shall not attempt to claim such Tax Benefits,
(iii) at and after the time of delivery of the Equipment to Lessee pursuant to
this Lease, the Equipment shall be owned by Lessor for Federal income tax
purposes and Lessee shall not claim any ownership or title in and to the
Equipment, and (iv) Lessee has not, and will not, at any time after such
delivery throughout the Term of this Lease, take any action or omit to take any
action (whether or not the same is permitted or required hereunder) which will
result in the loss by Lessor of all or any part Of Such Tax Benefits.

 (c) If, as a result of any act, omission or misrepresentation of
Lessee, (x) the Tax Benefits are lost, disallowed, deferred, eliminated,
reduced, recaptured, compromised or otherwise unavailable to Lessor, (y) for
Federal, foreign, state or local income tax purposes, any item of income, loss
or deduction with respect to any Item of Equipment is treated as derived from,
or allocable to, sources outside the United States, or (z) there shall be
included in the gross income of Lessor for Federal, state or local income tax
purposes any amount on account of any addition, modification, substitution or
improvement to or in respect of any Item of Equipment made or paid for by Lessee
(any of the foregoing being hereinafter a "Tax Loss"), then, within thirty (30)
days of Lessee's receipt of written notice from Lessor that such a Tax Loss has
occurred, Lessee shall pay to Lessor an amount which, after deduction therefrom
of all taxes to be paid in respect of the receipt thereof, will enable Lessor to
receive the same Net Economic Return (as hereinafter defined) that Lessor would
have realized on this Lease had such Tax Loss (together with any interest,
penalties or additions to tax) not occurred. Any event which, by the terms of
this Lease, requires payment by Lessee to Lessor of the Stipulated Loss Value of
the Equipment shall not constitute the act of Lessee for purpose of the
foregoing sentence.

 (d) As used in this Section, the term "Net Economic Return"
shall mean Lessor's net after-tax yield, aggregate after-tax cash flow and
return on assets, based on (i) the assumptions used by Lessor in originally
calculating Rent and Stipulated Loss Value percentages, including the
assumptions set forth above (as such assumptions may have been revised pursuant
to the last sentence of this subsection) and (ii) the Highest Marginal Tax Rate
actually in effect during each year from the date of such original calculations
to the date of such Tax Loss, both dates inclusive. In the event Lessor shall
suffer a Tax Loss with respect to which Lessee is required to pay an indemnity
hereunder, and the full amount of such indemnity has been paid or provided for
hereunder, the aforesaid assumptions, without further act of the parties hereto,
shall thereupon be and be deemed to be amended, if and to the extent
appropriate, to reflect such Tax Loss.

 (e) For purposes of this Section, the term "Lessor" shall
include the entity or entities, if any, with which Lessor consolidates any tax
return. Lessee acknowledges that it has neither sought nor received tax advice
from Lessor as to the availability to Lessee of any tax benefits with respect to
the Equipment. All of Lessor's rights and privileges arising from the
indemnities contained in this Lease will survive the expiration or other
termination or cancellation of this Lease. Such indemnities are expressly made
for the benefit of, and are enforceable by, Lessor and its successors and
assigns.

parties that this Lease constitutes a true lease and not a sale of the
Equipment. Title to the Equipment shall at all times remain in Lessor, and
Lessee shall acquire no ownership, title, property, right, equity, or interest
in the Equipment other than its leasehold interest solely as Lessee subject to
all the terms and conditions hereof. To the extent that Article 2A ("Article
2A") of the Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC") applies to the characterization of
this Lease, the parties hereby agree that this Lease is a "Finance Lease" is

Lease, that Lessee is entitled under Article 2A to the promises and warranties,
including those of any third party, provided to Lessor by the Supplier in
connection with or as part of the Purchase Agreement, and that Lessee may
communicate with the Supplier and receive an accurate and complete statement of
those promises and warranties, including any disclaimers and limitations of them
or of remedies. The filing of UCC financing statements pursuant to Section 34 of
the Master Lease is precautionary and shall not be deemed to have any effect on
the characterization of this Lease.

E-83

 19

(b) Notwithstanding the express intent of Lessor and Lessee that
this agreement constitute a true lease and not a sale of the Equipment, should a
court of competent jurisdiction determine that this agreement is not a true
lease, but rather one intended as security, then solely in that event and for
the expressly limited purposes thereof, Lessee, shall he deemed to have hereby
granted Lessor a security interest in the Equipment and all accessions,
substitutions and replacements thereto and therefor, and proceeds (cash and
non-cash), including, without limitation, insurance proceeds thereof (but

due of all obligations and indebtedness of Lessee, now existing or hereafter
created, to Lessee pursuant to this Lease or otherwise. In furtherance of the

for the Equipment, Lessee agrees to forward said invoice to Lessor immediately.

property of Lessor, and that Lessee has no right, title or interest therein or
thereto except as expressly set forth in the Lease.

 PREMISES

 The Issuer is empowered under the Act to assist any person, firm or
corporation in the financing of certain projects and facilities, through the
issuance of its limited obligation revenue bonds. The Obligor has proposed the
acquisition and construction of the Project and as an inducement therefor has
requested the Issuer to assist in the financing of the Project and certain other
expenses incidental thereto, as provided in the Act.

E-93

The Issuer has determined that making the Loan to the Obligor will
promote and serve the intended purposes of, and in all respects will conform to
the provisions and requirements of the Act. In order to grant the Loan and
thereby assist in the financing of the Project, the Issuer is issuing the Bonds.
The Issuer, the Trustee and the Obligor understand and intend that the financing
of the Project through issuance of the Bonds and the making of the Loan will be
structured in the following general manner, as detailed in the Indenture and in
the Agreement: The Issuer will issue the Bonds under the Act and use the
principal amount thereof to make the Loan to the Obligor. The Loan shall be
repaid by the Obligor in Loan Repayments sufficient to pay the principal,
premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds as the same become due. From the
proceeds of the Loan, the Obligor will complete the Project. Under the terms of
the Agreement, the Obligor will make Loan Repayments, and will be responsible
for paying any costs of the Project which exceed the principal amount of the
Bonds, for maintaining and insuring the Project, and for paying all taxes and
expenses relating to the Project. The Issuer's obligation with respect to the
Bonds is subject to the limitations therein contained, viz., that the principal,
premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds and any other costs or pecuniary
liability relating to the Bonds, the Loan, the Project or the implementation
thereof or any proceeding, document, or certification incidental to the
foregoing, shall never be payable from tax revenues or public funds of the State
or any agency thereof or general funds or assets of the Issuer, but shall be
payable with Available Moneys solely and only from the Security. The Bonds shall
not be secured by any interest in the Project or other assets of the Obligor.

 In addition, as part of the Security for the Loan Repayments, the
Obligor will cause the Credit Facility to be delivered to the Trustee. The
Trustee is instructed in the Indenture to draw under the Credit Facility up to
(a) the principal amount of the Bonds (i) to enable the Trustee to pay the
principal amount of the Bonds when due at maturity, by acceleration of maturity
or otherwise or upon redemption or (ii) to enable the Trustee to pay the portion
of the Purchase Price of Bonds delivered to the Trustee and not remarketed by
the Remarketing Agent equal to the principal amount of such Bonds, plus (b) an
amount equal to 56 days' (or, if required pursuant to Section 208 of the
Indenture, 210 days') interest on the Bonds calculated at the Maximum Rate to
enable the Trustee to pay interest on the Bonds plus (c) if the Credit Facility
is so amended, any premium on the Bonds.

 The Issuer's participation in the financing of the Project is intended
to enable the Obligor to utilize certain provisions of the Code. Section 103 of
the Code encourages the construction of certain types of facilities and the
public financing thereof through issuance of limited obligation revenue bonds by
providing that the interest on such bonds, as contrasted with any bonds which
might be issued by the Obligor itself, will be excluded from gross income for
federal income tax purposes. This tax exclusion enables the purchasers of the
Bonds to accept a lower rate of interest than they would otherwise require, and
thereby further reduces the interest cost to the Obligor of financing the
Project.

obligations which are not disclosed in writing to the Bank.

 (i) All representations and warranties in the Reimbursement
Agreement are incorporated herein as set forth therein.

Obligor intends to have the Project operated as such during the term of this
Agreement.

 (k) The financing of the Project will result in the creation
of approximately 200 new jobs and will not result in the transfer of employment
of more than 20 full-time employees from another municipality to the
Municipality in violation of the Act.

 (l) All the net Bond proceeds from the sale of the Bonds will
be expended on the Project to be owned by the Obligor, except for proceeds used

 (p) None of the Bond proceeds is to be used for the
acquisition of any property (or an interest therein) the first use of which
property is not pursuant to such acquisition unless certain rehabilitation
requirements as provided in Code Section 147(d) are met.

 (q) Substantially all (at least 95 of the net proceeds of
the Bonds (face amount) and all of the earnings on Bond proceeds deposited in
the Project Fund will be used to provide manufacturing facilities within the
meaning of Code Section 144(a)(12)(C). For this purpose, the term "manufacturing
facility" means any facility which is used in the manufacturing or production of
tangible personal property (including the processing resulting in a change in
the condition of such property). The term "manufacturing facility" includes
facilities which are directly related and ancillary to a manufacturing facility
(determined without regard to this sentence) if a) such facilities are located
on the same site as the manufacturing facility and b) not more than 25 of the
net proceeds of the Bonds are used to provide such facilities. The Obligor, for
purposes of this representation, is able to meet all of the criteria below
regarding manufacturing facilities. Office space is directly related and
ancillary to a manufacturing facility where such office is located on the
premises of the manufacturing facility and not more than a de minimis (5 portion of the functions to be performed at such office is not directly related
to the day-to-day operations at such manufacturing facility. Facilities for the
short-term warehousing of raw materials incidental to production or the
temporary warehousing of finished product constitute facilities directly related
and ancillary to a manufacturing facility. An on-site laboratory whose purpose
is to test the manufactured product for quality or to experiment with different
materials which might be used as raw materials for the product may be directly
related and ancillary to a manufacturing facility. Loading docks or rail spurs
to unload raw materials or load finished products may be directly related and
ancillary. Forklifts or similar equipment are directly related and ancillary to
a manufacturing facility, but trucks or vans to deliver the final product are
not. A showroom staffed with full-time sales personnel is outside the scope of a
manufacturing facility.

 (r) Except as is permitted by Code Section 149(b), the Bonds
are not federally guaranteed within these provisions; specifically the payment
of principal or interest with respect to the Bonds is not guaranteed in whole or
in part by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof; the Bonds
are not issued as part of an issue a significant portion of the proceeds of
which is to be used in making loans the payment of principal or interest with
respect to which is to be guaranteed in whole or in part by the United States or
any agency or instrumentality thereof, or invested directly or indirectly in
federally insured deposits or accounts; and the payment of principal or interest
on the Bonds is not otherwise indirectly guaranteed in whole or in part by the
United States or an agency or instrumentality thereof.

 (s) The sum of the authorized face amount of the Bonds
allocable to each test-period beneficiary (as defined in Code Section
144(a)(10)) plus the respective aggregate face amount of all tax-exempt
facility-related bonds presently outstanding (not including any obligations
which are to be redeemed from the proceeds of the Bonds) which are allocable to
each such test-period beneficiary does not exceed 40,000,000. The Obligor will
not sell, lease or enter any other arrangement having the effect of causing
another person to become a beneficiary of the Bond financed facility during the
test-period which would have the effect of making interest on the Bonds
includable in the gross income for federal income tax purposes of the holder
thereof.

 (t) No more than 2 of the proceeds of the Bonds will be
 used for any Issuance Costs.

 (u) The weighted average maturity of the Bonds does not exceed
120 of the weighted average reasonably expected economic life of the Project
financed with the net proceeds of the Bonds pursuant to Code Section 147(b).

 (v) No more than 25 of the net proceeds of the Bonds will be
used to provide a facility the primary purpose of which is one of the following:
retail food and beverage service, automobile sales or service, or the provision
of recreation or entertainment pursuant to Code Section 144(a)(8)(A).

 (w) No portion of the proceeds of the Bonds will be used to
provide any of the following: any private or commercial golf course, country
club, massage parlor, tennis club, skating facility (including roller skating,
skateboard, and ice skating), racquet sports facility (including any handball or
racquetball court), hot tub facility, suntan facility, or racetrack pursuant to
Code Section 144(a)(8)(B).

 E-96
 10

(x) There are no "private activity bonds" as defined in
Section 103 of the Code outstanding on the Effective Date, the proceeds of which
have been or shall be used with respect to any facility located in the
Municipality of which the Obligor or a related person to the Obligor is a
principal user.

 (y) The face amount of the Bonds, plus the aggregate amount of
capital expenditures (excluding capital expenditures paid for with proceeds of
the Bonds) by the Obligor, any "related person" thereto, any principal user of
the Project, and any "related person" thereto (all within the meaning ascribed
in Code Section 144(a)(4)) in the Municipality and areas contiguous thereto or
attributed to the Municipality beginning three years before the Effective Date
and ending three years after the Effective Date do not and will not exceed
 10,000,000. In addition, the Obligor will not violate any other provisions of
the Code relating to the foregoing.

 (z) No expenditures for the Project were made prior to 60 days
before the Issuer adopted its official intent resolution for the Project on the
Inducement Date.

months prior to the date of issuance of the Bonds and no expenditure to be
reimbursed with proceeds of the Bonds was made more than three years prior to

 (bb) Other than the Bonds, there are no other tax exempt
obligations issued for the benefit of the Obligor or any "related person" which
were or are to be sold (a) within 15 days of the Effective Date, (b) pursuant to
the same plan of financing as the Bonds, and (c) payable from the same source of
funds as the Bonds.

 (cc) All representations and warranties of the Obligor set
forth in the Non-Arbitrage Certificate and the Borrower's Questionnaire of the
Obligor, each dated the Effective Date (including exhibits thereto) will be true
and correct as of that date.

 Section 1.2 Additional Covenants. The Obligor hereby covenants that,
unless advised otherwise by Bond Counsel, the Obligor will comply with the
following:

 (a) Any proceeds received upon the sale of any of the property
which is included in the Project (i) will be invested at a yield not in excess
of the yield on the Bonds and used for the purpose of redeeming the Bonds at the
first subsequent call date, or (ii) will be used for the purpose of acquiring
property performing the same function as the disposed Project property.

 (b) If part or all of the Project wears out or becomes
obsolete so that it is no longer functional to the Obligor and the Obligor deems
it appropriate to dispose of such portion of the Project and, only if, the
Obligor or any related party thereto receives no economic benefit from the
disposal thereof, then the Obligor may dispose of such property other than as
provided in (a) above.

 (c) The Obligor will not use accelerated depreciation for
federal income tax purposes for any part of the Project financed with proceeds
of the Bonds.

 Section 1.3 Issuer Findings and Representations.

duly taken all action on its part required to authorize, execute and deliver the

instrument by which the Issuer or its properties are bound.

 (b) All of the proceedings approving the Agreement and the
Indenture relating to the Bonds were conducted by the Issuer at meetings which
complied with Act No. 267, Michigan Public Acts, 1976, as amended.

 11

 (c) No member of the Board of Directors of the Issuer is
directly or indirectly a party to or in any manner whatsoever interested in the
Agreement, the Indenture, the Bonds or the proceedings related thereto.

 Section I.4 Additional Bonds. At the request of the Obligor the Issuer

making Improvements to the Project; (ii) the refunding of all or any part of the
Bonds; and (iii) the Issuance Costs relating to the Additional Bonds and other
costs reasonably related to the financing as shall be agreed upon by the Obligor
and the Issuer. Any Improvements to the Project acquired with the proceeds of
the Additional Bonds shall become a part of the Project and shall be included
under the Agreement. Refusal for any reason by the Issuer to issue Additional

 Section II.2 Issuer Action on Redemption. The Issuer shall, at the
request of the Obligor in the case of an optional redemption, or at the request
of the Trustee in the case of a mandatory redemption on expiration of the Credit
Facility, a mandatory redemption on Determination of Taxability or mandatory
redemption from Surplus Bond Proceeds, forthwith take all steps as may be
necessary under the Indenture to effect the earliest practicable redemption, as
provided under the Indenture, of any or all of the Bonds or portions thereof as
may be specified by the Obligor or Trustee, as the case may be.

 In the event of an optional redemption, mandatory redemption on
Determination of Taxability or mandatory redemption on expiration of the Credit
Facility, unless such redemption is effected in connection with a refunding, the
Obligor will pay or cause to be paid pursuant to a draw on the Credit Facility
(or, with respect to any premium, if premium is not covered by the Credit
Facility, with Available Moneys) an amount equal to the applicable redemption
price as a prepayment of the principal amount of the Loan corresponding to such
Bonds or portions thereof and interest accrued to the redemption date.

 In the case of an extraordinary optional redemption, the Obligor's
direction to the Issuer to redeem shall be given, if at all, within six months
following the occurrence of the event giving rise to such redemption.

 In the event the Obligor receives notice under the provisions in the
Bond Forms Appendix entitled Mandatory Redemption on Determination of Taxability
that a proceeding has been instituted which could lead to a determination that
interest on the Bonds is includable in gross income for federal income tax
purposes and the resultant Mandatory Redemption on Determination of Taxability,
the Obligor shall promptly notify the Trustee, the Bank and the Issuer of such

make no use of the proceeds of the Bonds, or any funds which may be deemed to be
proceeds of the Bonds pursuant to Section 148 of the Code and the applicable
regulations thereunder, which, if such use had been reasonably expected on the
date of issuance of the Bonds, would have caused the Bonds to be "arbitrage
bonds" within the meaning of such Section and such regulations, and the Obligor
shall comply with the requirements of such Section and such regulations
throughout the term of the Bonds as provided by and required in the
Non-Arbitrage Certificate, the terms of which are incorporated herein and made a

pursuant to Section 208 of the Indenture, 210 days') interest thereon calculated
at the Maximum Rate; (b) provide for payment to the extent of the amount
specified in the preceding clause (a) in immediately available funds to the
Trustee (upon receipt of the Trustee's request for payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, and/or interest on the Bonds then outstanding on any Bond
Payment Date, proposed Conversion Date, Conversion Date, Substitution Date,
Purchase Date or redemption date pursuant to the Indenture); and (c) provide an

Bank of funds authorized to be drawn thereunder so that there are no outstanding
Bonds (ii) the honoring by the Bank of a draft on the Credit Facility for all
outstanding Bonds, (iii) a stated expiration date, (iv) the day after any

to Section 801(d) of the Indenture. The Obligor will cause any extension of the
Credit Facility to be deposited by the Bank with the Trustee at least 60 days
prior to the last Interest Payment Date prior to the expiration of the Credit
Facility or Substitute Credit Facility then in effect. Each extension of the
Credit Facility shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Trustee. Upon
the conversion of the Bonds to Fixed Rate Bonds, the Bonds may, but need not, be
secured by a Credit Facility. The Obligor shall have the right to provide a
Substitute Credit Facility in accordance with Section 210 of the Indenture.

 Section II.5 Tender. The Issuer agrees to cause the Trustee in the
Indenture to act as tender agent for the Obligor in connection with certain
tenders of Variable Rate Bonds and as tender agent for the Bank in connection

and without written approval by the Bank, it will not change the Remarketing
Agent.

 Section II.7 Right to Exercise Conversion Option. Subject to the
ability of the Obligor to satisfy certain conditions described in the Indenture,
the right is reserved to the Obligor, upon receipt of prior approval from the
Bank (but only if the existing Credit Facility will remain in effect following
the proposed conversion or, in any event, if a draw may be made on the existing
Credit Facility in connection with the proposed conversion), to exercise the
conversion option in accordance with the Indenture.

 Section II.8 Rebate Account. The Obligor covenants and agrees that it
will create and maintain on its books and records a "Rebate Account" as required

 Section III.1 The Loan. Concurrently with the delivery of the Bonds,
the Issuer will, upon the terms and conditions of the Agreement, lend to the
Obligor, by deposit of the proceeds thereof with the Trustee in the Project
Fund, an amount equal to the principal amount of the Bonds for application to
Project Costs. The accrued interest, if any, received by the Issuer upon the
sale of the Bonds shall be deposited into the Bond Fund and shall be applied to
the first interest due on such Bonds.

 Section III.2 Loan Repayments; Credit Facility. Except as hereinafter
provided, the Obligor shall pay or cause to be paid, in immediately available
funds, to the Trustee, for the account of the Issuer, loan repayments
corresponding to the principal, premium, if any, Purchase Price and interest
payments on the Bonds when due (the "Loan Repayments"); in lieu of such
payments, the Trustee shall draw on the Credit Facility, pursuant to Section 209
of the Indenture, amounts equal to such Loan Repayments. So long as the Credit
Facility is in effect, the Loan Repayments representing principal of, premium,
if any (if the Credit Facility then covers such premium), Purchase Price and
interest payments on the Bonds shall be made by deposits of the proceeds of
drawings under the Credit Facility and the Obligor shall reimburse the Bank in
accordance with the Reimbursement Agreement.

 Payments of the principal and Purchase Price of, premium, if any, or
interest on the Bonds shall be made solely from the Security, including draws
under the Credit Facility (except with respect to premium unless the Credit
Facility has been amended to cover premium on the Bonds). The Obligor's
obligation to make Loan Repayments is and shall remain unconditional regardless
of the sufficiency and availability of Available Moneys to make such payments.

 With the prior written approval of the Bank and written notice to the
Issuer and the Trustee, the Obligor may prepay in whole or in part amounts due
on account of the Loan Repayments or for the redemption of Bonds prior to
maturity or purchase, but such prepayment shall not in any way alter or suspend
any of the obligations of the Obligor under the terms of the Agreement and the
Obligor shall continue to perform and be responsible for the performance of all
other terms and provisions. Such notice shall be given at least 10 Business Days
before the Trustee is to give notice of any related redemption pursuant to
Article IV of the Indenture.

 The Issuer agrees that the Trustee may accept such prepayments when the
same are tendered by the Obligor and that such prepayments may be directed by
the Obligor to be used for credit on Loan Repayments or for the redemption or
purchase of Bonds in the manner and to the extent provided herein and in the
Indenture.

 In the event the Obligor prepays Loan Repayments in the following
manner and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture: (a) in Available
Moneys, after delivering the No Act of Bankruptcy Certificate attached hereto as
Exhibit D to the Trustee or (b) by causing the Trustee to draw on the Credit
Facility, for deposit in the Bond Fund an amount of money which, together with
amounts then on deposit in the Bond Fund and available therefor, shall be
sufficient (i) to retire and redeem at the earliest date(s) permitted under the
Indenture all of the then outstanding Bonds and (ii) to pay any interest
accruing on the Bonds to maturity or redemption and shall also make provision
satisfactory to the Issuer and the Trustee for all fees, costs and expenses
specified in Article V hereof accruing through the final payment of the Bonds,
then the Loan shall be deemed fully repaid and canceled, and the lien of the
Indenture shall be discharged, except for the provisions providing for payment
of principal and Purchase Price of, premium, if any, and interest to the
Bondholders.

 THE PROJECT

 Section IV.1 Project Fund Disbursements. There is established with the
Trustee under the Indenture the Project Fund, the moneys in which, subject to
the terms hereof and of the Indenture, and subject to the security interest
therein granted by the Obligor to the Issuer, shall be the property of the
Obligor. Unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing which the
Trustee is required to take notice of or is deemed to have notice of pursuant to
Section 901(h) of the Indenture, the Trustee, as authorized by the Bank pursuant
to the Indenture, shall disburse to or for the benefit of the Obligor out of the
Project Fund the lesser of (a) the Project Costs, or (b) the proceeds of the
Bonds deposited in the Project Fund and investment income in the Project Fund.
Such disbursements shall be made from time to time to pay Project Costs so long
as there are moneys in the Project Fund, upon presentation of Requisition
Certificate(s) executed by the Obligor and approved for payment in writing by
the Bank. The Trustee may also disburse moneys out of the Project Fund to or for
the benefit of the Issuer upon the Obligor's failure to pay the fees, costs and
expenses of the Trustee or Issuance Costs as required by Section 5.2 hereof.

 Disbursements from the Project Fund shall be made upon the Trustee's
receipt of an executed and approved Requisition Certificate.

 The Obligor shall also deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee
with a Requisition Certificate such other documents and certificates as may be
required by the Bank, it being understood that the Trustee shall have no duty to
review or approve such documents and certificates.

 Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Indenture, any
moneys in the Project Fund shall be transferred by the Trustee to the Bond Fund.

 Upon request and with reasonable notice, the Obligor shall permit the
Trustee or the Issuer or its authorized agents to audit the records of the
Obligor relating to Project Costs during normal business hours.

 Section IV.2 Obligation of the Obligor to Complete the Project. The
Obligor shall proceed with reasonable dispatch to complete the Project
substantially in accordance with the Plans. The Obligor may revise the Plans,
subject to the General Limitations and under the conditions contained in this
section.

 The Issuer makes no warranty, either express or implied, and offers no
assurance as to the condition of the Project or that the Project is or will be
suitable for the Obligor's purposes, or that the proceeds derived from the sale
of the Bonds will be sufficient to pay all Project Costs, and the Issuer shall
not be liable to the Obligor if for any reason the Project is not completed. In
the event moneys in the Project Fund are insufficient to pay all Project Costs,
the Obligor will complete the Project and pay the Project Costs in excess of the
sum of moneys available in the Project Fund. By reason of the payment of any
such portion of the Project Costs, the Obligor shall not be entitled to any
reimbursement from the Issuer, the Trustee or the holders of the Bonds in
respect thereof or to any diminution or abatement in the Loan Repayments payable
under the Agreement.

 Section IV.3 Completion Certificate. The Obligor shall as promptly as
practicable file with the Trustee, the Issuer and the Bank a certificate
substantially in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto when the Project is
complete. All moneys deposited in the Project Fund and not needed, as of the
Completion Date, to pay or reimburse Project Costs (which moneys shall be used
for such purposes if needed), shall, upon receipt of such certificate, and in
any event on the third anniversary hereof, be deemed Surplus Bond Proceeds and
shall be immediately transferred to the Bond Fund to be applied by the Trustee
in the manner provided in Section 4.4 of this Agreement.

 Section IV.4 Use of Surplus Bond Proceeds. All moneys transferred to
the Bond Fund pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.3, Section 6.1 and Article
VII hereof ("Surplus Bond Proceeds") shall be applied by the Trustee for
redemption of the Bonds pursuant to Mandatory Redemption from Surplus Bond
Proceeds as provided in the Bond Forms Appendix to the Indenture or
reimbursement of the Bank for honoring a drawing under the Credit Facility for
such purpose, or may be used for any other purpose approved in writing by the
Bank which is permitted by the Act and which, in the opinion of Bond Counsel,
will not affect the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes
of interest on the Bonds. Prior to such use, such Surplus Bond Proceeds shall
not be invested at a yield in excess of the yield on the Bonds, unless, in the
opinion of Bond Counsel, the investment of Surplus Bond Proceeds at a yield in
excess of the yield on the Bonds will not affect the exclusion from gross income
for federal income tax purposes of the interest on the Bonds.

 In no event shall Surplus Bond Proceeds so transferred to the Bond Fund
or the investment income thereon be used to pay interest on the Bonds.

 EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

 Section X.1 Events of Default. The term "Event of Default" shall mean,
whenever used in the Agreement, any one or more of the following events:

 (a) Failure by the Obligor to pay any Loan Repayments in the
amounts and at the times provided in the Agreement, but if and only if the Bank
has, after demand under the Credit Facility, failed to pay the amount of such
Loan Repayment as and when due.

 (b) Failure by the Obligor to observe and perform any other
obligations in this Agreement on its part to be observed or performed for a
period of 30 days after written notice specifying such failure and requesting
that it be remedied, given to the Obligor by the Issuer, the Bank or the
Trustee; provided, however, that if such Default shall be such that it cannot be
corrected within such period, it shall not constitute an Event of Default if the
Default is correctable without material adverse effect on the Bonds and if
corrective action is instituted by the Obligor within such period and is
diligently pursued until the Default is corrected.

 (c) Any representation or warranty made by the Obligor in any
document delivered by the Obligor to the initial purchasers, the Trustee, the
Bank or the Issuer in connection with the issuance, sale and delivery of the
Bonds is untrue in any material adverse respect.

 (d) The occurrence of an Event of Default under the Indenture.

 (e) The occurrence of an Event of Default under the
 Reimbursement Agreement.

E-106
 20

The Events of Default described in subsection (b) above are also
subject to the following limitation: If the Obligor by reason of force majeure
is unable to carry out or observe the obligations described in such subsection
(b), the Obligor shall not be deemed to be in breach or violation of this
Agreement or in default during the continuance of such inability. The term
"force majeure" as used herein shall include, without limitation, acts of public
enemies; insurrections; riots; epidemics; landslides; lightning; earthquake;
fire; hurricanes; tornadoes; storms; floods; washouts; droughts; arrests; civil
disturbances; labor disturbances or strikes; explosions; breakage or accident to
machinery, transmission pipes or canals; partial or entire failure of utilities;
or any other cause or event other than financial inability not reasonably within
the control of the Obligor. The Obligor agrees, however, insofar as possible, to
remedy with all reasonable dispatch the causes preventing it from carrying out
its agreement; provided, however, that the settlement of strikes, lockouts and
other industrial disturbances shall be entirely within the exercise of the
reasonable discretion of the Obligor.

 Section X.2 Remedies upon Event of Default. Whenever any Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Issuer, with the consent of
the Trustee, or the Trustee acting alone, shall have and may exercise any one or
more of the following remedial powers:

 (a) If the principal of and interest accrued on the Bonds
shall have been declared immediately due and payable pursuant to the Indenture,
to declare all Loan Repayments payable under Section 3.2 for the remainder of
the term of the Agreement to be immediately due and payable, whereupon the same
shall become immediately due and payable; provided, however, that, if the
Trustee shall annul any such declaration pursuant to the Indenture, the
declaration provided for in this clause (a) shall be deemed annulled;

 (b) If the principal of and interest accrued on the Bonds
shall have been declared immediately due and payable pursuant to the Indenture,
to institute any actions or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection
of Loan Repayments or other sums due and unpaid under the Agreement, to
prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and to
enforce any such judgment or final decree and collect in the manner provided by
law any moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable; and

 (c) In case there shall be pending proceedings for the
bankruptcy or for the reorganization of the Obligor under the federal bankruptcy
laws or any other applicable law, or in case a receiver or trustee shall have
been appointed for the property of the Obligor, to file and prove a claim or
claims for the whole amount owing under the Agreement plus interest owing and
unpaid in respect thereof and, in case of any judicial proceedings, to file such
proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable
in order to have the claims of the Trustee allowed in such judicial proceedings
relative to the Obligor, its creditors, or its property, and to collect and
receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims,
and to distribute the same after the deduction of its charges and expenses.

 In case the Trustee or the Issuer shall have proceeded to exercise or
enforce any right or remedy under the Agreement and such proceeding shall have
been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined
adversely, then and in every such case, the Obligor, the Issuer and the Trustee
shall be restored to their respective rights and positions hereunder and all
rights and remedies of the Obligor, the Issuer and the Trustee shall continue as
though no such proceeding had been taken, but subject to the limitations of any
such adverse determination.

 Any amounts collected pursuant to action taken under this Section shall
be paid into the Bond Fund and applied in accordance with the Indenture, except
amounts collected pursuant to Article V for the benefit of the Issuer or the
Issuer's Agents, which shall be paid to and retained by the Issuer.

 Section X.3 Payment of Attorneys' Fees and Other Expenses. In the event
the Obligor should default under any of the provisions of the Agreement and the
Issuer and/or the Trustee should employ attorneys or incur other expenses for
the collection of the Loan or for the enforcement of performance or observance
of any obligation of the Obligor in the Agreement or any other document related
to the issuance of and security for the Bonds, the Obligor shall on demand
therefor pay to the Issuer or the Trustee, or both, as the case may be, the
reasonable fees of such attorneys and such other reasonable expenses so
incurred.

E-107
 21

Section X.4 Waivers and Limitation on Waivers. By reason of the
assignment of the Issuer's rights and interest in the Agreement to the Trustee,
the Trustee shall have the power with the consent of the Bank to, and shall if
requested by the Bank, waive or release the Obligor from any Event of Default or
the performance or observance of any obligation or condition of the Obligor
under the Agreement, provided such waiver or release is not prohibited by the
Indenture and the Trustee and the Issuer receive an opinion of Counsel that such
action will not impose any pecuniary obligation or liability or adverse
consequence upon the Issuer or the Trustee and the Issuer and the Trustee shall
have each been provided such indemnification from the Obligor as the Issuer or
the Trustee shall deem necessary, and provided that, with respect to a waiver of
an Event of Default such waiver shall be limited to the particular Event of
Default so waived and shall not be deemed to waive any other Event of Default
hereunder nor a waiver of a similar Event of Default on a future occasion.

 No delay or omission to exercise any right occurring upon any Event of
Default shall impair any such right or shall be construed to be a waiver
thereof, but any such right may be exercised from time to time and as often as
may be deemed expedient. In order to exercise any remedy reserved to the Issuer
or the Trustee in this Agreement, it shall not be necessary to give any notice
other than such notice as may be herein expressly required. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Obligor does not waive any
statute of limitations under applicable law.

 ARTICLE XI

 OBLIGATIONS OF OBLIGOR UNCONDITIONAL

 Section XI.1 Obligor Obligations. The obligation of the Obligor to make
Loan Repayments and the payments required by Article V hereof and to perform its
other covenants hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be
subject to any diminution by right of set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or
otherwise. During the term hereof, the Obligor (i) shall not suspend or
discontinue its Loan Repayments, (ii) shall perform and observe all of its other
obligations contained herein and (iii) except as explicitly permitted herein,
shall not terminate the Agreement for any cause including, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, defect in title to the Project, failure to complete
the Project, any acts or circumstances that may constitute failure of
consideration, eviction or constructive eviction, destruction or damage to or
condemnation of the Project, commercial frustration of purpose, any change in
the tax or other law by the United States of America or the State or any
political subdivision of either, or any failure of the Issuer to perform and
observe any obligation or condition arising out of or connected with the
Agreement. This shall not be construed to release the Issuer from the
performance of any of its obligations under the Agreement; and in the event the
Issuer shall fail to perform any such obligation, the Obligor may institute such
action against the Issuer as the Obligor may deem necessary to compel
performance; provided, however, that no such action shall violate this Section
or diminish Loan Repayments. The Obligor may at its own cost and expense and in
its own name or in the name of the Issuer, prosecute or defend any action or
proceedings or take any other action involving third persons which the Obligor
deems reasonably necessary in order to secure or protect its rights under the
Agreement, and in such event the Issuer shall cooperate fully with the Obligor.

"Execution Date") by and between Autocam Corporation, a Michigan corporation,
whose address is 4070 East Paris Avenue, S.E., Kentwood, MI 49512 (the

WITNESSETH:

 WHEREAS, the Obligor has requested the Michigan Strategic Fund (the
"Issuer") to finance a part of the cost of the acquisition, construction and
equipping of new production facilities (including machinery and equipment) to be
located in the L. ALTA Brooks Industrial Park in the City of Marshall, Michigan
(the "Project"), by the issuance and sale, pursuant to a Trust Indenture, dated
as of December 1, 1997 (the "Indenture"), naming Norwest Bank Wisconsin, N.A. as
trustee (the "Trustee"), of 9,000,000 principal amount of the Issuer's Variable
Rate Demand Limited Obligation Revenue Bonds, Series 1997 (Autocam Corporation
Project) (the "Bonds") to the purchaser or purchasers thereof (the "Bond
Purchasers"); and

 WHEREAS, in order to induce the Bond Purchasers to purchase the Bonds, the
Obligor has requested that the Bank issue an irrevocable letter of credit (such
letter of credit and any successor letter of credit as described in Section 2 of
this Agreement being herein called the "Letter of Credit"), in an amount not to
exceed 9,138,082.19 (such amount being herein called the "Letter of Credit
Amount") to secure payment of the principal of, purchase price of, and interest
on, the Bonds.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the Obligor and the Bank
hereby agree as follows:

E-121
 35

SECTION 1. Reimbursement and Other Payments.

 (a) The Obligor hereby agrees with the Bank as follows: (i) to pay the
 Bank, following payment by the Bank of any draft presented under a
 Letter of Credit other than a "Purchase Draft" (as defined in the
 Letter of Credit), and on the same day on which such draft is so paid,
 a sum (and interest on such sum as provided in clause (iii) below)
 equal to the amount so paid under the Letter of Credit plus any and all
 reasonable charges and expenses which the Bank may pay or incur
 relative to such Letter of Credit; (ii) to pay the Bank, following
 payment by the Bank of a Purchase Draft, and on the same day on which a
 Purchase Draft is paid, an amount equal to the accrued interest paid by
 such payment, plus sums from time to time in installments sufficient to
 maintain the amortization schedule for the Bonds, which schedule is
 attached hereto as Exhibit B, together with interest on such moneys
 outstanding at a fluctuating interest rate per annum (computed on the
 basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days elapsed) as shall
 be in effect from time to time, which rate per annum shall be equal to
 the rate publicly announced by the Bank as its "Prime Rate" (the "Prime
 Rate"), but such interest rate shall in no event be higher than the
 maximum rate permitted by law, which interest shall be payable monthly;
 and (iii) to pay the Bank, interest on any and all amounts remaining
 unpaid by the Obligor hereunder, other than the principal portion of a
 Purchase Draft following a Purchase Draft, at any time from the date
 any such amount becomes payable until payment in full, payable on
 demand, at a fluctuating interest rate per annum (computed on the basis
 of a 360 day year for the actual number of days elapsed) as shall be in
 effect from time to time, which rate per annum shall be equal to three
 percent (3 above its Prime Rate, provided that such fluctuating
 interest rate shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate
 permitted by law and, in addition, upon demand by the Bank any and all
 reasonable expenses including but not limited to legal expenses
 incurred by the Bank in enforcing any rights under this Agreement or
 any other collateral agreement entered into in conjunction herewith.

 (b) In addition, the Obligor hereby agrees to pay to the Bank a commission
 with respect to the Letter of Credit, computed (on the basis of a year
 of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed) at the rate of
 five-eighths percent (5/8 per annum on the Letter of Credit Amount
 (or, in the event, and effective the date, of any reduction in the
 maximum amount available under the Letter of Credit in accordance with
 the terms thereof, on such smaller amount to which the maximum amount
 available under the Letter of Credit may have been so reduced from time
 to time) from and including the date of issuance of the Letter of
 Credit to but excluding the last day a drawing is available under the
 Letter of Credit (the "Expiration Date"), payable in advance in annual
 installments, on the first day of December of each year until the
 Expiration Date; provided, that the first installment shall be payable
 on the date of issuance of the Letter of Credit for the period from and
 including such date of issuance until December 1, 1998. If the
 Expiration Date occurs on a day before the date to which commission has
 been prepaid under this Section 1(b), the Bank agrees to repay to the
 Obligor, promptly after the Expiration Date, such portion of such
 commission as is allocable to the period from and including the
 Expiration Date until the day to which such commission has been
 prepaid; provided, that the Bank shall not be obligated to repay any
 portion of such commission at any time if at the close of the Bank's
 business on the Expiration Date there exists an Event of Default under
 this Agreement.

 (c) In addition, a 100 fee shall be payable by the Obligor at the time of
 each drawing on the Letter of Credit and a fee of 1,500 shall be paid
 by the Obligor upon the transfer of the Letter of Credit to a new
 trustee, except for a transfer at the request of the Bank.

 (d) If any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof
 by any court or administrative or governmental authority charged with

Attention: Corporate Trust Department

Dear Sirs:

 We hereby establish, at the request and for the account of Autocam
Corporation, a Michigan corporation, whose address is 4070 East Paris Avenue,
S.E., Kentwood, MI 49519 (the "Obligor"), in your favor, as Trustee under the
Trust Indenture, dated as of December 1, 1997 (the "Indenture") between the
Michigan Strategic Fund (the "Issuer") and you, pursuant to which 9,000,000 in
aggregate principal amount of the Issuer's Variable Rate Demand Limited
Obligation Revenue Bonds, Series 1997 (Autocam Corporation Project) (the
"Bonds"), are being issued, our Irrevocable Letter of Credit No. _____________,
in the total amount of 9,138,082.19 (Nine Million One Hundred Thirty-Eight
Thousand Eighty-Two and 19/100 U.S. Dollars) effective immediately and expiring
on December 16, 2000 (the "Expiration Date") or earlier terminating as
hereinafter provided.

 We hereby irrevocably authorize you to draw on us upon presentation of the
certificate(s) in the forms of Annex A, B and C, as appropriate, attached
hereto, as provided below:

 A. One or more drawings, each an "Interest Drawing" under Annex A, with
 respect to payment of interest on the Bonds, such Interest Drawing to
 be in an amount not exceeding 138,082.19 [56 days interest on the
 Bonds assuming an annual rate of 10 for a year of 365 days]; and

 B. One or more drawings, each a "Principal Drawing" under Annex B, with
 respect to payment of principal payments on the Bonds, whether by
 maturity, acceleration, optional redemption, or mandatory redemption,
 such Principal Drawing to be in an amount not exceeding 9,000,000; and

 C. One or more drawings, each a "Purchase Drawing" under Annex C, with
 respect to payment of the purchase price of the Bonds (based on a
 purchase at par plus accrued interest to the date of purchase), such
 Purchase Drawing to be in an amount not exceeding 9,138,082.19
 [principal plus 56 days interest on the Bonds assuming an annual rate
 of 10 for a year of 365 days].

 The amount available for payments with respect to Interest Drawings shall
be automatically reinstated by the amount of any payment made by us of an
Interest Drawing, unless you have received notice from us that we will not
reinstate such amount, and thereupon you shall again be irrevocably authorized
to draw on us Interest Drawings in the amount and in accordance with the terms
and conditions set forth herein. This procedure for the automatic reinstatement
of the amount available with respect to Interest Drawings shall be applicable to
successive Interest Drawings, so long as this Letter of Credit shall not have
been terminated as set forth below.

E-134

 The amount available under this Letter of Credit shall be automatically and
immediately reduced by the amount of payment of a Principal Drawing or the
principal portion of a Purchase Drawing. The amount of such reduction in the
case of the payment of a Purchase Drawing shall be subject to reinstatement as
set forth in the next paragraph.

 Reinstatement of amounts by which this Letter of Credit was reduced in
connection with drawings made by presentation of Purchase Drawings shall be
effective after you have been notified by the Bank in writing under the Pledge
and Security Agreement, dated as of December 1, 1997, by and among the Obligor,
the Bank and you (the "Pledge and Security Agreement"), that the conditions
precedent to release of the Bonds as to which the Letter of Credit is to be
reinstated (the "Bonds to be Released") have been satisfied. Prior to such
notification and release you shall not draw on the Letter of Credit with respect
to Bonds held by you under the Pledge and Security Agreement. After you have
been notified of the satisfaction of such conditions, the reinstatement of the
Letter of Credit shall be effective and irrevocable in the amount of the face
amount of the Bonds to be Released.

 If we receive your Interest Drawing or Principal Drawing certificate(s) at
such office, all in strict conformity with the terms and conditions of this
Letter of Credit, we will honor the same by 11:30 a.m., Detroit time on the next
business day with respect to such Drawings presented prior to 12:00 noon Detroit

available funds to your account as provided in the respective certificate. We
agree that all payments made by us hereunder will be made with our own funds and
not with any funds which could be deemed to belong to the Obligor or the Issuer,
and will be made by us prior to any reimbursement thereof.

 As used herein "business day" means any day other than (i) a Saturday, (ii)

acknowledged, the Pledgor and Agent hereby agree with the Bank as follows:

 1. Defined Terms. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the
 Reimbursement Agreement shall have such defined meanings when used
 herein.

 2. Pledge. The Pledgor hereby pledges, assigns, hypothecates, transfers,
 and delivers to the Bank or its designee all its right, title and
 interest in the Pledged Bonds as the same may be from time to time
 delivered to the Agent, by the holders thereof or by the Remarketing
 Agent and held by the Agent as agent for the Bank, and hereby grants to
 the Bank, a first lien on, and security interest in, its right, title
 and interest in and to the Pledged Bonds, together with all payments of
 principal, premium and interest thereon and all proceeds thereof,
 including without limitation remarketing proceeds (collectively, the
 "Collateral"), as collateral security for (a) the prompt and complete
 payment of all amounts payable to the Bank under the Reimbursement
 Agreement, (b) performance and observance of all covenants, terms and
 conditions upon which the Letter of Credit is issued, including without
 limitation the covenants, terms and conditions set forth in the
 Reimbursement Agreement, and (c) the performance of the covenants
 herein contained and any monies expended by the Bank in connection
 therewith (collectively, the "Obligations").

E-143
 57

 3. Payments on the Pledged Bonds. Payments received by the Agent in
 respect of the Pledged Bonds shall be held by the Agent in trust for
 the benefit of the Bank, and the Agent shall pay the same forthwith to
 the Bank. Upon receipt by the Bank, such amounts shall be credited
 against the Obligations to the Bank.

 4. Release of Pledged Bonds. Upon reinstatement of the amount available
 under the Letter of Credit to be drawn as a Purchase Draft following
 payment by the Bank of a Purchase Draft under such Letter of Credit
 (which would occur following repayment to the Bank of all amounts owed
 by the Pledgor to the Bank in connection with payment by the Bank of
 such Purchase Draft or upon satisfaction of such other requirements as
 may be agreed to by Pledgor and the Bank), the Agent automatically
 shall release and deliver to the Pledgor or its designee Pledged Bonds
 (of the Bonds secured by such Letter of Credit) in a principal amount
 up to but not exceeding the amount by which the stated amount of the
 applicable Letter of Credit shall have been so increased; provided,
 however, that in any event, if all existing and future liabilities and
 obligations of Pledgor to the Bank under the Reimbursement Agreement
 are fully paid and fully secured, all Pledged Bonds shall be released
 and delivered to the Pledgor or its designee. The foregoing
 notwithstanding, all Pledged Bonds shall be released and delivered to
 the Trustee for cancellation at redemption or maturity.

 5. Rights of the Bank. The Bank shall not be liable for failure to collect
 the Obligations or for failure to realize upon any collateral security
 or guarantee therefor, or any part thereof, or for any delay in so
 doing nor shall the Bank be under any obligation to take any action
 whatsoever with regard thereto. If an Event of Default under the
 Reimbursement Agreement has occurred and is continuing, the Bank may
 thereafter without notice exercise all rights, privileges or options
 pertaining to any Pledged Bonds as if it were the absolute owner
 thereof, upon such terms and conditions as it may determine, including,
 without limitation, the right to direct the agent as Trustee to cancel
 said Pledged Bond under the Indenture, all without liability except to
 account for property actually received by it, but the Bank shall have
 no duty to exercise any of the aforesaid rights, privileges or options
 and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so
 doing.

 6. Remedies. In the event that any portion of the Obligations has been
 declared due and payable, the Bank, without demand of performance or
 other demand, advertisement or notice of any kind (except the notice
 specified below of time and place of public or private sale) to or upon
 the Pledgor or any other person (all and each of which demands,
 advertisements and notices are hereby expressly waived), may forthwith
 collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any
 part thereof, and may forthwith sell, assign, give option or options to
 purchase, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of and deliver said
 Collateral, or any part thereof, in one or more parcels at public or
 private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker's board or at any of the
 Bank's offices, or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may
 deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on
 credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk,
 with the right to the Bank, upon any such sale or sales, public or
 private, to purchase the whole or any part of said Collateral so sold,
 free of any right or equity of redemption in the Pledgor, which right
 or equity is hereby expressly waived or released. The Bank shall apply
 the net proceeds of any such collection, recovery, receipt,
 appropriation, realization or sale, after deducting all reasonable
 costs and expenses of every kind incurred therein or incidental to the
 care, safekeeping or otherwise of any and all of the Collateral or in
 any way relating to the rights of the Bank hereunder, including
 reasonable attorney's fees and legal expenses, to the payment in whole
 or in part of the Obligations in such order as the Bank may elect, the
 Pledgor remaining liable for any deficiency remaining unpaid after such
 application, and only after so paying over such net proceeds and after
 the payment by the Bank of any other amount required by any provision
 of law, including, without limitation, Section 9504(1)(c) of the
 Uniform Commercial Code of the State of Michigan, and after expiration
 of the Letter of Credit, need the Bank account for the surplus, if any,
 to the Pledgor. The Bank agrees to give the Pledgor, the Agent and the
 Issuer not less than ten days' written notice of the time and place of
 any public sale and of the time after which a private sale or other
 intended disposition is to take place. The Pledgor agrees that such
 notice is reasonable notification of such matters. No notification need
 be given to the Pledgor if it has signed after default a statement
 renouncing or modifying any right to notification of sale or other
 intended disposition. In addition to the rights and remedies granted to
 it in this Agreement and in any other instrument or agreement securing,
 evidencing or relating to any of the Obligations, the Bank shall have
 all the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform
 Commercial Code of the State of Michigan. The Pledgor further agrees to
 waive and agrees not to assert any rights or privileges which it may
 acquire under Section 9112 of the Uniform Commercial Code and the
 Pledgor shall be liable for the deficiency if the proceeds of any sale
 or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all
 amounts to which the Bank is entitled, and the fees of any attorneys
 employed by the Bank to collect such deficiency.

7. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Pledgor. The Pledgor
 represents and warrants that: (a) on the date of delivery to the Bank
 or its designee of any Pledged Bonds in accordance with Section 2
 hereof, neither the Issuer, the Remarketing Agent nor the Agent will
 have any right, title or interest in and to the Pledged Bonds; (b) it
 has, and on the date of delivery to the Bank or its designee of any
 Pledged Bonds will have, full power, authority and legal right to
 pledge all of its right, title and interest in and to the Pledged Bonds
 pursuant to this Agreement; (c) this Agreement has been duly
 authorized, executed and delivered by the Pledgor and constitutes a
 legal, valid and binding obligation of the Pledgor enforceable in
 accordance with its terms; (d) no consent of any other party
 (including, without limitation, any creditors of the Pledgor) and no
 consent, license, permit, approval or authorization of exemption by,
 notice or report to, or registration, filing or declaration with, any
 governmental authority, domestic or foreign, is required to be obtained
 by the Pledgor in connection with the execution, delivery or
 performance of this Agreement; (e) the execution, delivery and
 performance of this Agreement will not violate any provision of any
 applicable law or regulation or of any order, judgment, writ, award or
 decree of any court, arbitrator or governmental authority, domestic or
 foreign, or of the charter documents of the Pledgor or of any
 securities issued by the Pledgor, or of any mortgage, indenture, lease,
 contract, or other agreement, instrument or undertaking to which the
 Pledgor is a party or which purports to be binding upon the Pledgor or
 upon any of its assets and will not result in the creation or
 imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance on or security interest
 in any of the assets of the Pledgor except as contemplated by this
 Agreement; and (f) the pledge, assignment and delivery of such Pledged
 Bonds pursuant to this Agreement will create a valid first lien on, and
 a first perfected security interest in, all right, title or interest of
 the Pledgor in or to such Pledged Bonds, and the proceeds thereof,
 subject to no prior pledge, lien, mortgage, hypothecation, security
 interest, charge, option or encumbrance or to any agreement purporting
 to grant to any third party a security interest in the property or
 assets of the Pledgor which would include the Pledged Bonds. The
 Pledgor covenants and agrees that it will defend the Bank's right,
 title and security interest in and to the Pledged Bonds and the
 proceeds thereof against the claims and demands of all persons
 whomsoever; and covenants and agrees that it will have like title to
 and right to pledge any other property at any time hereafter pledged to
 the Bank as Collateral hereunder and will likewise defend the Bank's
 right thereto and security interest therein.

 8. No Disposition, etc. Except as otherwise provided in the Remarketing
 Agreement with respect to Pledged Bonds sold to or by the Remarketing
 Agent, the Pledgor agrees that it will not, without the prior written
 consent of the Bank sell, assign, transfer, exchange, or otherwise
 dispose of, or grant any option with respect to, the Collateral, nor
 will it create, incur or permit to exist any pledge, lien, mortgage,
 hypothecation, security interest, charge, option or any other
 encumbrance with respect to any of the Collateral, or any interest
 therein, or any proceeds thereof, except for the lien and security
 interest provided for by this Agreement.

 9. Sale of Collateral. (a) The Pledgor recognizes that the Bank may be
 unable to effect a public sale of any or all of the ledged Bonds by
 reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933,
 as amended, and applicable state securities laws, but may be compelled
 to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of
 purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire
 such securities for their own account for investment and not with a
 view to the distribution or resale thereof. The Pledgor acknowledges
 and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other
 terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale
 and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private
 sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable
 manner. The Bank shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of
 the Pledged Bonds for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer
 of such securities to register such securities for public sale under
 the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if
 the issuer would agree to do so.

 (b) The Pledgor further agrees to do or cause to be done all such other
 acts and things as may be necessary to make such sale or sales of any
 portion or all of the Pledged Bonds valid and binding and in compliance
 with any and all applicable laws, regulations, orders, writs,
 injunctions, decrees or awards of any and all courts, arbitrators or
 governmental instrumentalities, domestic or foreign, having
 jurisdiction over any such sale or sales, all at the Pledgor's expense.

E-145

59

10. Further Assurances. The Pledgor agrees that at any time and from time
 to time upon the written request of the Bank, it will execute and
 deliver such further documents and do such further acts and things as
 the Bank may reasonably request in order to effect the purposes of this
 Agreement.

 11. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or
 unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
 ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability
 without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such
 prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not
 invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
 jurisdiction.

 12. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. The Bank shall not by any act, delay,
 omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any of its rights or
 remedies hereunder and no waiver shall be valid unless in writing,
 signed by the Bank, and then only to the extent therein set forth. A
 waiver by the Bank of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion
 shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the Bank
 would otherwise have on any future occasion. No failure to exercise nor
 any delay in exercising on the part of the Bank, any right, power or
 privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
 single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder
 preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
 other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein
 provided are cumulative and may be exercised singly or concurrently,
 and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

 13. Waivers, Amendments; Applicable Law. None of the terms or provisions of
 this Agreement may be waived, altered, modified or amended except by an
 instrument in writing, duly executed by all parties hereto. This
 Agreement and all obligations of the Pledgor hereunder shall be binding
 upon the successors and assigns of the Pledgor, and shall, together
 with the rights and remedies of the Bank hereunder, inure to the
 benefit of the Bank and its successors and assigns. This Agreement
 shall be governed by, and be construed and interpreted in accordance
 with, the laws of the State of Michigan.

 14. Fees and Expenses. Pledgor agrees to pay and reimburse the Agent and
 the Bank for and indemnify and hold them harmless against all costs,
 expenses, taxes and fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
 disbursements) and any liability incurred in connection with the
 administration and enforcement of this Agreement. Such undertaking of
 Pledgor shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 15. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate upon the expiration of the
 Letter of Credit and payment in full and the performance and
 satisfaction of all Obligations, and upon such termination the Bank and
 the Trustee shall assign, transfer and deliver without recourse and
 without warranty the Collateral to Pledgor (and any property received
 in respect thereof) as has not theretofore been sold or otherwise
 applied pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

 16. Waiver. The Bank hereby agrees to waive any and all claims, liabilities
 and causes of action against the Agent which may arise by reason of or
 in connection with any and all of the Agent's obligations, duties and
 responsibilities set forth in this Pledge Agreement, including but not
 limited to holding the Pledged Bonds and any payments with respect
 thereto as agent for the Bank and the release and delivery of the
 Pledged Bonds to the Pledgor or its designee; provided, however, that
 the Bank shall not be required to waive any claim, liability or cause
 of action against the Agent to the extent, but only to the extent,
 arising as a result of the willful and wrongful failure or willful and
 wrongful misconduct or gross negligence of the Agent.

 17. Captions/Counterparts. Captions in this Agreement are included herein
 for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of
 this Agreement for any other purpose. This Agreement may be executed in
 any number of counterparts and if so executed shall be read and
 interpreted as a single agreement.

REMARKETING AGREEMENT

between

AUTOCAM CORPORATION
 (the "Obligor")

and

ROBERT W. BAIRD & CO. INCORPORATED
 (the "Remarketing Agent")

Dated as of December 1, 1997

Relating to

9,000,000
 MICHIGAN STRATEGIC FUND
 Variable Rate Demand Limited Obligation
 Revenue Bonds, Series 1997
 (Autocam Corporation Project)

62

 REMARKETING AGREEMENT

THIS REMARKETING AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") dated as of December 1, 1997
by and between AUTOCAM CORPORATION, a Michigan corporation (the "Obligor") and
ROBERT W. BAIRD & CO. INCORPORATED (the "Remarketing Agent").

 WHEREAS, the Michigan Strategic Fund (the "Issuer") has appointed the
Remarketing Agent (and the Remarketing Agent hereby accepts the appointment) as
Remarketing Agent under the Trust Indenture dated as of the date of this
Agreement (the "Indenture") between the Issuer and Norwest Bank Wisconsin, N.A.,
as trustee (the "Trustee"), relating to the Issuer's 9,000,000 principal amount
Variable Rate Demand Limited Obligation Revenue Bonds, Series 1997 (Autocam
Corporation Project) (the "Bonds"); and

 WHEREAS, the Obligor has entered into a Loan Agreement dated as of the date
of this Agreement (the "Loan Agreement") between the Issuer and the Obligor; and

 WHEREAS, the Remarketing Agent has been appointed by the Issuer to use its
best efforts to remarket the Bonds subject to optional or mandatory purchase and
to determine the interest rate necessary to remarket the Bonds at par; and

 WHEREAS, the Obligor and Remarketing Agent desire to make additional
provisions regarding the Remarketing Agent's role as Remarketing Agent for the
Bonds with respect to its obligations described in Section 203 of the Indenture.
Terms used in this Agreement without being defined have the meanings given them
in the Indenture.

 NOW, THEREFORE, the Obligor and Remarketing Agent hereby agrees as follows:

 Section 1. Duties.

 (a) The Remarketing Agent will perform the duties specified as
Remarketing Agent under the Indenture, including, but not limited to, the
determination of interest rates as set forth in Section 110 of the Indenture and
the remarketing of the Bonds as set forth in Section 203 of the Indenture.
Unless the Remarketing Agent is otherwise directed in writing by the Obligor and
except as provided in the next paragraph, the Remarketing Agent shall use its
best efforts to remarket Bonds subject to optional or mandatory purchase under
Sections 201 and 202 of the Indenture, respectively. Bonds which are subject to
mandatory purchase on the Conversion Date, a proposed Conversion Date or a
Substitution Date shall be remarketed by the Remarketing Agent only to a buyer
to whom the Remarketing Agent has delivered, at the time of such remarketing, a
copy of the notice of conversion or notice of delivery of a Substitute Credit
Facility, as applicable, pursuant to Section 113(b) of the Indenture. In the
event the Bonds are remarketed pursuant to a mandatory purchase on the
Conversion Date, a proposed Conversion Date or a Substitution Date, the
Remarketing Agent shall be entitled to a fee (mutually agreed upon with the
Obligor prior to the commencement of the remarketing) in addition to the annual
remarketing fee received pursuant to Section 4 hereof. In acting as Remarketing
Agent, the Remarketing Agent will act as agent and not as principal except as
expressly provided in this Section 1.

 (b) The Remarketing Agent may, if it determines to do so in its sole
discretion, buy as principal, but it will not in any event be obligated to do
so, and if it buys Bonds it will have the same rights as would any other person
holding the Bonds.

E-149

 63

 Section 2. Disclosure Statement. If the Remarketing Agent determines
that it is necessary or desirable to use a disclosure statement in connection
with its offering of Bonds (a "Disclosure Statement"), and in any event upon
conversion of the interest rate on the Bonds to a Fixed Rate, the Remarketing
Agent will notify the Obligor and the Obligor will provide the Remarketing Agent
with a Disclosure Statement satisfactory to the Remarketing Agent and its
Counsel in respect of the Bonds. The Obligor will supply the Remarketing Agent,
at the Obligor's expense, with such number of copies of the Disclosure Statement
as the Remarketing Agent requests from time to time and will amend the document
with respect to the Obligor and any summary of documents the amendment of which
was approved by the Obligor (and/or the documents incorporated by reference in
it) so that at all times the document will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
in the document, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 Section 3. Indemnification and Contribution.

 (a) The Obligor will indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing 
Agent, each of its directors, officers, employees and agents and each person
who controls the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (such Act being herein called the "Act" and
any such person being herein sometimes called for purposes of this paragraph
(a) an "Indemnified Party"), against any and all losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several, to which such Indemnified Party may become
subject under any statute or at law or in equity or otherwise, and will
reimburse any such Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses incurred
by it in connection with investigating any claims against it and defending any
actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise
out of or are based upon any untrue statements, or alleged untrue statement, of
a material fact with respect to the Obligor contained in any Disclosure
Statement referred to in Section 2 hereof or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or any portion of the Disclosure Statement under the headings
"Introductory Statement," "The Obligor and the Use of Proceeds," "The Bonds"
(other than the information under the sub-heading "Book-Entry System"),
"Sources of Payment and Security," "The Letter of Credit," "The Loan
Agreement," "The Trust Indenture," "The Reimbursement Agreement," and "The
Pledge and Security Agreement," or the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein with respect
to the Obligor or under such headings not misleading. This indemnity agreement
will not be construed as a limitation on any other liability which the Obligor
may otherwise have to any Indemnified Party, but in no event shall the Obligor
be obligated for double indemnification. The duty of the Obligor to indemnify
and hold the Issuer and its directors, officers, employees and agents harmless
shall be governed by Section 5.4 of the Loan Agreement, the provisions of which
are incorporated herein by this reference.

 (b) The Remarketing Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the 
Obligor, each of its directors, officers, partners, employees and agents and
each person who controls the Obligor within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Act (for purposes of this paragraph (b), an "Indemnified Party") to the
same extent as the foregoing indemnity in paragraph (a) from the Obligor to the
Remarketing Agent, but only with reference to written information, if any,
relating to the Remarketing Agent furnished to the Obligor by the Remarketing
Agent specifically for use in the preparation of a Disclosure Statement. This
indemnity agreement shall not be construed as a limitation on any other
liability which the Remarketing Agent may otherwise have to any Indemnified
Party, but in no event shall the Remarketing Agent be obligated for double
indemnification.

 E-150

 64

 (c) An Indemnified Party (as defined in paragraph (a) or paragraph 
(b) of this Section 3) will, promptly after receiving notice of the
commencement of any action against such Indemnified Party in respect of which
indemnification may be sought against the Obligor or the Remarketing Agent, as
the case may be (the "Indemnifying Party"), notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing of the commencement of the action. Failure of the Indemnified Party to
give such notice will reduce the liability of the Indemnifying Party under this
Agreement by the amount of the damages attributable to the failure to give the
notice; but the failure will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party otherwise than under the
indemnity agreement in this Section 3. If such action is brought against an
Indemnified Party and such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party of
the commencement of the action, the Indemnifying Party may, or if so requested
by the Indemnified Party shall, participate in it or assume its defense, with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and after notice from
the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of an election so to assume the
defense, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party
under this Section 3 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by
such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense other than reasonable
costs of investigation. If the Indemnifying Party does not employ counsel to
take charge of the defense or if any Indemnified Party reasonably concludes
that there may be defenses available to it which are different from or in
addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party (in which case the
Indemnifying Party will not have the right to direct the defense of such action
on behalf of such Indemnified Party), legal and other expenses reasonably
incurred by such Indemnified Party will be paid by the Indemnifying Party.

 (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of this
Section 3 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a
court to be unavailable from the Obligor on grounds of policy or otherwise, the
Obligor and Remarketing Agent shall contribute to the total losses, claims,
damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred
in connection with investigating or defending the same) to which the Obligor and
Remarketing Agent may be subject in such proportion so that the Remarketing
Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the fee
to be paid to the Remarketing Agent under Section 4 hereof bears to the
principal amount of the Bonds remarketed under this Agreement and the Obligor is
responsible for the balance; but (i) in no case will the Remarketing Agent be
responsible for any amount in excess of the fee applicable to the Bonds
remarketed by the Remarketing Agent under this Agreement and (ii) no person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of
the Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 3(d), each
person who controls the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Act will have the same rights to contribution as the Remarketing Agent and
each person who controls the Obligor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act
and each officer, each director and each partner of the Obligor will have the
same rights to contribute as the Obligor, subject in each case to clause (i) and
(ii) of this Section 3(d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly
after receiving notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against
such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made under this
Section 3(d), notify each party from whom contribution may be sought, but the
failure to notify such party shall not relieve any party from whom contribution
may be sought from any other obligation it may have under this Agreement or
otherwise than under this Section 3(d).

 Section 4. Fees and Expenses. In consideration of the Remarketing Agent's
services under this Agreement, the Obligor will pay the Remarketing Agent a fee
of 1/8 of 1 of the aggregate principal amount of Bonds at closing. Thereafter,
the Obligor will pay a non-refundable fee of 1/8 of 1 per annum of the
aggregate principal amount of the Bonds outstanding payable on December 1 of
each year commencing December 1, 1998. The Obligor will also pay all expenses in
connection with the delivery of remarketed Bonds and with preparing a disclosure
document under Section 2 hereof and will reimburse the Remarketing Agent for all
of its direct out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it as Remarketing Agent or
otherwise under this Agreement, including reasonable Counsel fees and
disbursements.

 Section 5. Remarketing Agent Not Liable for Failures by Purchasers of
Bonds. The Remarketing Agent will not be liable to the Obligor on account of the
failure of any person to whom the Remarketing Agent has sold a Bond to pay for
it or to deliver any document in respect of the sale.

 Section 6. Representations and Warranties of the Obligor. The Obligor
represents, warrants and covenants to and with the Remarketing Agent as follows:

E-151

 65

 (a) All representations and warranties of the Obligor in the Bond
Purchase Agreement dated December 15, 1997, among Robert W. Baird & Co.
Incorporated, as underwriter, the Issuer and the Obligor (the "Bond Purchase
Agreement") are true and correct as though made at and as of the date hereof.

 (b) The Obligor is fully empowered to enter into and perform all
agreements on its part herein contained; the Obligor has been authorized to
enter into and deliver this Agreement (by all necessary and proper legal
action); and the execution and delivery by it of this Agreement and the
performance of the agreements herein contained do not contravene or constitute a
default under any agreement, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, commitment,
provision of its charter documents, or other existing requirements of law or
regulation or any other agreement of any kind to which it is a party or by which
it is or may be bound.

 Section 7. Termination. This Agreement will terminate upon the effective
resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent as Remarketing Agent in
accordance with Section 912 of the Indenture. The Remarketing Agent may
voluntarily resign as Remarketing Agent under this Agreement, and shall resign
as Remarketing Agent under this Agreement if requested by the Obligor in
