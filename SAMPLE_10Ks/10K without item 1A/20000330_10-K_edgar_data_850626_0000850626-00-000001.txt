Item 1. Business.

Description of the Company

 Fulton Bancshares Corporation (the "Company"), a
Pennsylvania business corporation, is a bank holding company
registered with and supervised by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board").
The Company was incorporated on March 29, 1989 under the
business corporation law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
for the purpose of becoming a bank holding company. Since
commencing operations, the Company's business has consisted
primarily of managing and supervising the Fulton County
National Bank and Trust Company (the "Bank"), and its
principal source of income has been dividends paid by the
Bank. The Company has two wholly-owned subsidiaries - the
Bank, and Fulton County Community Development Corporation
("FCCDC"), which was formed on June 7, 1996 to support
efforts of the local downtown business revitalization project
by making low interest loans to eligible small businesses for
the purpose of facade improvement. FCCDC had minimal
activity in 1999, and has no employees.
 The principal executive office of the Company is
located at 100 Lincoln Way East, McConnellsburg, Fulton
County, Pennsylvania 17233. The telephone number of the
Company is (717) 485-3144.
 The Company has no employees.
- -2-

Supervision and Regulation - The Company
 The Company is subject to the provisions of the
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "Bank
Holding Company Act"), and to supervision by the Federal
Reserve Board. The Bank Holding Company Act requires the
Company to secure the prior approval of the Federal Reserve
Board before it owns or controls, directly or indirectly,
more than five percent (5 of the voting shares or
substantially all of the assets of any institution, including
another bank. The Bank Holding Company Act prohibits
acquisition by the Company of more than five percent (5 of
the voting shares of, or interest in, all or substantially
all of the assets of any bank located outside of Pennsylvania
unless such acquisition is specifically authorized by the
laws of the state in which such bank is located.
 A bank holding company is prohibited from engaging
in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than five
percent (5 of the voting shares of any company engaged in
nonbanking activities unless the Federal Reserve Board, by
order or regulation, has found such activities to be so
closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks
as to be a proper incident thereto.

- -3-

 The Company is required to file an annual report
with the Federal Reserve Board and any additional information
that the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the
Bank Holding Company Act. The Federal Reserve Board may also
make examinations of the Company and any or all of its
subsidiaries.
 Federal law prohibits acquisitions of control of a
bank holding company without prior notice to certain federal
bank regulators. Control is defined for this purpose as the
power, directly or indirectly, to direct the Management or
policies of the bank or bank holding company or to vote 25 
or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding
company. A person or group holding revocable proxies to vote
25 or more of the stock of a bank or its holding company
would presumably be deemed to control the institution for
purposes of this federal law.
 Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are
subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal
Reserve Act on any extensions of credit to the bank holding
company or any of its subsidiaries, on investments in the
stock or other securities of the bank holding company and on
taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to
any borrower.

- -4-

Permitted Activities
 The Federal Reserve Board permits bank holding
companies to engage in activities so closely related to
banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper
incident thereto. The Company does not at this time engage
in any of the permissible activities described below, nor
does the Company have any current plans to engage in these
activities in the foreseeable future.
 While the types of permissible activities are
subject to a variety of limitations and to change by the
Federal Reserve Board, the principal activities that
presently may be conducted by a bank holding company and may
in the future be engaged by the Company are: (1) making,
acquiring or servicing loans and other extensions of credit
for its own account or for the account of others, such as
would be made by consumer finance, credit card, mortgage,
commercial finance and factoring companies; (2) operating as
an industrial bank or similar entity in the manner authorized
by state law so long as the institution does not both accept
demand deposits and make commercial loans; (3) operating as a
trust company in the manner authorized by federal or state
law so long as the institution does not make certain types of
loans or investments or accept deposits, except as may be
permitted by the Federal Reserve Board; (4) acting as an
investment or financial advisor to investment companies and
- -5-

other persons; (5) leasing personal and real property or
acting as agent, broker or advisor in leasing property; (6)
making equity and debt investments in corporations or
projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; (7)
providing to others financially oriented data processing or
bookkeeping services; (8) acting as an insurance agent or
broker in relation to insurance for itself and its
subsidiaries or for insurance directly related to extensions
of credit; (9) acting as underwriter for credit life
insurance and credit accident and health insurance: (10)
providing courier services of a limited character; (11)
providing management consulting advice to nonaffiliated banks
and nonbank depository institutions; (12) selling money
orders, travelers' checks and United States savings bonds;
(13) performing appraisals of real estate; (14) acting as
intermediary for the financing of commercial or industrial
income-producing real estate by arranging for the transfer of
the title, control and risk of such a real estate project to
one or more investors; (15) providing securities brokerage
services, related securities credit activities and incidental
activities such as offering custodial services, individual
retirement accounts and cash management services, if the
securities brokerage services are restricted to buying and
selling securities solely as agent for the account of

- -6-

customers and do not include securities underwriting or
dealing or investment advice or research services; (16)
underwriting and dealing in obligations of the United States,
general obligations of states and their political
subdivisions such as bankers' acceptances and certificates of
deposit; (17) providing general information, advisory
services and statistical forecasting with respect to foreign
exchange markets; (18) acting as a futures commission
merchant in the execution and clearance on major commodity
exchanges of futures contracts and options on futures
contracts for bullion, foreign exchange, government
securities, certificates of deposit and other money market
instruments; (19) performing personal property appraisals
that require expertise regarding all types of personal and
business property, including intangible property such as
corporate securities; (20) providing commodity trading and
futures commission merchant advice; (21) providing consumer
financial counseling to individuals on consumer-oriented
financial management matters, including debt consolidation,
mortgage applications, bankruptcy, budget management, real
estate tax shelters, tax planning, retirement and estate
planning, insurance and general investment management, so
long as this activity does not include the sale of specific
products or investments; (22) providing tax planning and

- -7-

preparation advice to corporations and individuals; (23)
providing check guaranty services to subscribing merchants;
(24) operating a collection agency and credit bureau; and
(25) acquiring and operating thrift institutions, including
savings and loan associations, building and loan associations
and FDIC-insured savings banks.
Certain Provisions of Pennsylvania Banking Law
 Under the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as
amended, (the "Code"), the Company has been permitted since
March 4, 1990 to control an unlimited number of banks.
However, the Company would be subject to the requirements of
the Bank Holding Company Act as discussed in the "Supervision
and Regulation - The Company" section above.
 Also since March 4, 1990, the Code authorizes
reciprocal interstate banking without any geographic
limitation. Reciprocity between states exists when a foreign
state's law authorizes Pennsylvania bank holding companies to
acquire banks or bank holding companies located in that state
on terms and conditions substantially no more restrictive
than those applicable to such an acquisition by a bank
holding company located in that state. For a further
discussion of interstate banking and branching, see the
section entitled "Legislation and Regulatory Changes" below.

- -8-

Legislation and Regulatory Changes
 From time to time, legislation is enacted which
has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business,
limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the
competitive balance between banks and other financial
institutions. Proposals to change the laws and regulations
governing the operations and taxation of banks, bank holding
companies and other financial institutions are frequently
made in Congress, and before various bank regulatory
agencies. No prediction can be made as to the likelihood of
any major changes or the impact such changes might have on
the Company and its subsidiary, the Bank. Certain changes of
potential significance to the Company which have been enacted
recently are discussed below.
 The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching
Efficiency Act of 1994 (the "Interstate Banking and Branch
Act") permits interstate banking to occur. Bank holding
companies, pursuant to an amendment to the Bank Holding
Company Act, can acquire a bank located in any state, as long
as the acquisition does not result in the bank holding
company controlling more than 10 of the deposits in the
United States, or 30 of the deposits in the target bank's
state. The legislation permits states to waive the
concentration limits and require that the target institution

- -9-

be in existence for up to five years before it can be
acquired by an out-of-state bank or bank holding company.
Interstate branching and merging of existing banks is
permitted after September 29, 1997 if the bank is adequately
capitalized and demonstrates good management.
 The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and
Enforcement Act of 1989 ("FIRREA") was enacted in August of
1989. This law was enacted primarily to improve the
supervision of savings associations by strengthening capital,
accounting and other supervisory standards. In addition,
FIRREA reorganized the FDIC by creating two deposit insurance
funds to be administered by the FDIC: The Savings
Association Insurance Fund and the Bank Insurance Fund.
Customers' deposits held by the Bank are insured under the
Bank Insurance Fund. FIRREA also regulates real estate
appraisal standards and the supervisory/enforcement powers
and penalty provisions in connection with the regulation of
the Bank.

- -10-

Effects of Inflation
 Inflation has some impact on the Company's, the
Bank's, and FCCDC's operating costs. Unlike many industrial
companies, however, substantially all of the Bank's and
FCCDC's assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a
result, interest rates have a more significant impact on the
Company's, the Bank's, and FCCDC's performance than the
general level of inflation. Over short periods of time,
interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction
or in the same magnitude as prices of goods and services.
Monetary Policy
 The earnings of the Company, the Bank, and FCCDC
are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary
and fiscal policies of the United States Government and its
agencies. An important function of the Federal Reserve
System is to regulate the money supply and interest rates.
Among the instruments used to implement those objectives are
open market operations in United States government securities
and changes in reserve requirements against member bank
deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations
to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans,
investments and deposits, and their use may also affect rates
charged on loans or paid for deposits.

- -11-

 The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System
and, therefore, the policies and regulations of the Federal
Reserve Board have a significant effect on its deposits,
loans and investment growth, as well as the rate of interest
earned and paid, and are expected to affect the Bank's
operations in the future. The effect of such policies and
regulations upon the future business and earnings of the
Company, the Bank, and FCCDC cannot be predicted.
Environmental Regulation
 There are several federal and state statutes which
regulate the obligations and liabilities of financial
institutions pertaining to environmental issues. In addition
to the potential for attachment of liability resulting from
its own actions, a bank may be held liable under certain
circumstances for the actions of its borrowers, or third
parties, when such actions result in environmental problems
on properties that collateralize loans held by the Bank.
Further, the liability has the potential to far exceed the
original amount of the loan issued by the Bank. Currently,
the Company, the Bank, and FCCDC are not party to any pending
legal proceeding pursuant to any environmental statute, nor
is the Company, the Bank, or FCCDC aware of any circumstances
which may give rise to liability under any such statute.

- -12-

Description of the Bank
 The Bank was organized on February 24, 1887 as a
Pennsylvania state-chartered banking institution. It
converted to a national banking association on September 5,
1933, and is presently under the supervision of the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency (the "Comptroller"). The
Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Customers'
deposits held by the Bank are insured by the FDIC to the
maximum extent permitted by law. The Bank's legal
headquarters are located at 100 Lincoln Way East,
McConnellsburg, Fulton County, Pennsylvania 17233.
 The Bank engages in a full service commercial and
consumer banking business, including the acceptance of time
and demand deposits and the making of secured and unsecured
commercial and consumer loans, and offering trust services.
The Bank's primary service area is located in Fulton County,
Pennsylvania. Specifically, the main office of the Bank is
located in McConnellsburg, the county seat. Within the
defined service area of the Bank's main office, the banking
business is highly competitive. In addition to local
community banks, the Bank competes with regionally-based
commercial banks, all of which have greater assets, capital
and lending limits. The Bank also competes with savings
banks, savings and loan associations, money market funds,
insurance companies, stock brokerage firms, regulated small

- -13-

loan companies, credit unions and with the issuers of
commercial paper and other securities.
 In order to compete effectively in this market and
to obtain business from individuals, small and medium-sized
businesses and professionals, the Bank offers specialized
services such as extended hours of operation and personal and
business checking accounts at competitive rates in addition
to traditional commercial and consumer banking and trust
services. The Bank accepts time, demand and savings
deposits, including passbook accounts, statement savings
accounts, NOW accounts, money market accounts, certificates
of deposit and club accounts. The Bank makes secured and
unsecured commercial, consumer, mortgage and construction
loans. Consumer loans include revolving credit lines. The
following support services are offered by the Bank to make
financial management more efficient and convenient for its
customers: bank by mail, direct deposit, drive-in banking,
Federal Tax Depository, automatic teller machine, night
deposit services, notary public services, payroll deduction
plan, bond coupon collections, foreign money exchange, safe
deposit boxes, signature guarantees, travelers checks, money
orders, cashiers checks, treasury securities, U.S. Savings
Bonds, individual retirement accounts, and utility and
municipal payments. The Bank also offers its customers
access to discount brokerage services, mutual funds, and
other alternative investment products through its affiliation
- -14-

with Sentry Trust Company. The Bank expects to experience a
modest increase in growth.
Lending Activities
 It is the Bank's general policy to grant all of
its loans in its primary trade area. This trade area
includes all of Fulton County, southern Huntington County,
western Franklin County, and the Hancock, Maryland area. The
Bank's lending objectives are as follows: (1) to establish a
diversified loan portfolio composed of a predetermined mix of
mortgage loans, commercial loans, consumer loans and all
other loan types; (2) to provide a satisfactory rate of
return to its shareholders by properly pricing loans to
include the cost of funds, administrative costs, bad debts,
local economic conditions, competition, customer
relationships, the term of the loan, credit risk, and
collateral quality; and, (3) to provide protection for its
depositors by maintaining a predetermined level of loans to
deposits to ensure liquidity. The Bank recognizes that the
lending of money is a community responsibility which involves
a degree of credit risk and is willing to undertake such
risks by utilizing standard banking procedures and making
prudent judgments when extending credit.
 The Bank makes loans to both individual consumers
and commercial entities. The types of loans offered include:
(1) loans for businesses and individuals on a short term or
- -15-

seasonal basis; (2) mortgage and construction loans, (3)
loans to individuals for consumer purchases such as
appliances, furniture, vacations, etc.: (4) loans secured by
marketable stock and bonds providing adequate margins for
market fluctuations; (5) short term working capital loans
secured by the assignment of accounts receivable and
inventory; (6) automobile loans, (7) second liens on
commercial and residential real estate, (8) home equity lines
of credit, and (9) PHEAA student loans. Loans of these types
will be considered desirable by the Bank provided such loans
meet the test of sound credit.
 The Bank has adopted the following loan-to-value
ratios, in accordance with standards adopted by its bank
supervisory agencies:

Loan Category
 Loan-to-Value Limit
 Raw land 65 
 Land development 75 
 Construction:
 Commercial, multifamily, and other
 nonresidential 80 
 1 to 4-family residential 85 
 Improved property 85 
 Owner-occupied 1 to 4 family and
 home equity 90 
 
The Bank does not assume undue risk on any loan within the
loan portfolio, and takes appropriate steps to secure all
loans as necessary.

- -16-

Concentration
 The Bank is neither dependent upon deposits from
nor exposed to loan concentrations to a single customer, the
loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition of the Bank. Although the Bank has a
diversified loan portfolio, a significant portion of its
customers' ability to honor their contracts is dependent upon
the agribusiness economic sector (approximately 20 of loan
portfolio).
Employees
 As of December 31, 1999, the Bank has forty-four
(44) full-time equivalent employees.
Supervision and Regulation - The Bank
 The operations of the Bank are subject to federal
and state statutes applicable to banks chartered under the
banking laws of the United States, to members of the Federal
Reserve System and to banks whose deposits are insured by the
FDIC. The operations of the Bank are also subject to
regulations of the Comptroller, the Federal Reserve Board and
the FDIC. The primary supervisory authority of the Bank is
the Comptroller, which regulates and examines the Bank. The
Comptroller has authority to prevent national banks from
engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their
businesses.
 Federal and state banking laws and regulations
govern, among other things, the scope of a bank's business,
the investments a bank may make, the reserves against
deposits a bank must maintain, loans a bank makes and
- -17-

collateral it takes, the maximum interest rates a bank may
pay on deposits, the activities of a bank with respect to
mergers and consolidations and the establishment of branches.
 Under Pennsylvania law, the Bank may establish or acquire
branch offices, subject to certain limitations, in any county
of the state. National bank branches, however may be
established within the permitted area only after approval by
the Comptroller.
 As a subsidiary bank of a bank holding company,
the Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the
Federal Reserve Act on any extensions of credit to the bank
holding company or its subsidiaries, or investments in the
stock or other securities as collateral for loans. The
Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Board regulations
also place certain limitations and reporting requirements on
extensions of credit by the Bank to principal shareholders of
its parent holding company, among others, and to related
interests of such principal shareholders. In addition, such
legislation and regulations may affect the terms upon which
any person becoming a principal shareholder of a holding
company may obtain credit from banks with which the
subsidiary Bank maintains a correspondent relationship.
FDIC
 Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the
Comptroller possesses the power to prohibit institutions
- -18-

regulated by it (such as the Bank) from engaging in any
activity that would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice
or would otherwise be in violation of the law. Moreover, the
Financial Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control
Act of 1978 ("FIRA") generally expanded the circumstances
under which officers or directors of a bank may be removed by
the institution's federal supervisory agency, restricts
lending by a bank to its executive officers, directors,
principal shareholders or related interests thereof and
restricts management personnel of a bank from serving as
directors or in other management positions with certain
depository institutions whose assets exceed a specified
amount or which have an office within a specified geographic
area, and restricts management personnel from borrowing from
another institution that has a correspondent relationship
with their bank. Additionally, FIRA requires that no person
may acquire control of a bank unless the appropriate federal
supervisory agency has been given sixty (60) days prior
written notice and within that time has not disapproved the
acquisition or otherwise extended the period for disapproval.
 Control for purposes of FIRA, means the power, directly or
indirectly, to direct the management or policies or to vote
twenty-five percent (25 or more of any class of outstanding
stock of a financial institution or its respective holding
- -19-

company. A person or group holding revocable proxies to vote
twenty-five percent (25 or more of the outstanding common
stock of a financial institution or holding company such as
the Company, would presumably be deemed to control the
institution for purposes of FIRA.
Garn-St Germain
 The Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of
1982 ("1982 Act") removed certain restrictions on a bank's
lending powers and liberalized its depository capabilities.
The 1982 Act also amended FIRA (see above) by changing the
statutory limits on lending by a bank to its executive
officers, directors, principal shareholders or related
interests thereof and by relaxing certain reporting
requirements. The 1982 Act, however, also tightened FIRA
provisions respecting management interlocks and correspondent
bank relationships involving a bank's management personnel.
CRA
 Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as
amended ("CRA"), the Comptroller is required to assess the
record of all financial institutions regulated by it to
determine if these institutions are meeting the credit needs
of the community (including low and moderate income
neighborhoods) which they serve and to take this record into
account in its evaluation of any application made by any of
such institutions for, among other things, approval of a
- -20-

branch or other deposit facility, office relocation, a merger
or an acquisition of bank shares. The Financial Institutions
Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 amended the CRA
to require, among other things, that the Comptroller make
publicly available the evaluation of a bank's record of
meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including
low and moderate income neighborhoods. This evaluation will
include a descriptive rating and a statement describing the
basis for the rating, which is publicly disclosed.
BSA
 Under the Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA"), banks and
other financial institutions are required to report to the
Internal Revenue Service currency transactions of more than 
10,000 or multiple transactions of which the Bank is aware in
any one day that aggregate in excess of 10,000. Civil and
criminal penalties are provided under the BSA for failure to
file a required report, for failure to supply information
required by the BSA or for filing a false or fraudulent
report.
CEBA
 An omnibus federal banking bill, known as the
Competitive Equality Banking Act ("CEBA"), was signed into
law in August of 1987. Included in the legislation were
measures: (1) imposing certain restrictions on transactions
- -21-

between banks and their affiliates; (2) expanding the powers
available to Federal bank regulators in assisting failed and
failing banks; (3) limiting the amount of time banks may hold
certain deposits prior to making such funds available for
withdrawal and any interest thereon; and (4) requiring that
any adjustable rate mortgage loan secured by a lien on a one-
to-four family dwelling include a limitation on the maximum
rate at which interest may accrue on the principal balance
during the term of such loan.
FDICIA
 Capital Categories
 In December of 1991 the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") became law.
Under FDICIA, institutions must be classified, based on their
risk-based capital ratios into one of five defined
categories, as illustrated below:

Total Tier 1 Tier 1 Under a
 Risk-Based Risk-Based Leverage Capital Order
 Ratio Ratio Ratio or Directive
CAPITAL CATEGORY
Well capitalized > 10.0 > 6.0 > 5.0 No

 For additional information concerning liquidity, refer to statistical
disclosures applicable to the investment and loan portfolio.
 Closely related to the management of liquidity is the management of rate
sensitivity which focuses on maintaining stability in the net interest margin.
 As
illustrated in the table below the tax equivalent net interest margin ranged
 from 3.9 to
4.0 of average earning assets during the past 3 years. An asset/liability
 committee
monitors and coordinates the overall asset/liability strategy.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

Board of Directors
Fulton Bancshares Corporation
McConnellsburg, Pennsylvania

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of the Fulton
 Bancshares
Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998
 and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
 of the three years ended
December 31, 1999. These consolidated financial statements are the
 responsibility of the corporation's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
 financial statements based on
our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
 standards. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
 assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
 includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
 financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
 by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
 audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present
 fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Fulton Bancshares Corporation
 and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their
 cash flows for each of the three
years ended December 31, 1999 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
 principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies

 Nature of Operations

 Fulton Bancshares Corporation's primary activity consists of owning and
 supervising its subsidiaries:

 ? Fulton County National Bank and Trust Company, which is engaged in
providing
 banking and bank
related services, principally in Fulton, southern Huntingdon and western
 Franklin Counties. Its seven
branches are located in McConnellsburg (2), Shade Gap, Warfordsburg, Hustontown,
 Orbisonia and St.
Thomas. The Orbisonia and St. Thomas branches were added in 1999.

 ? Fulton County Community Development Corporation, which was formed on
June 7,
 1996 to
 support efforts of the local downtown business revitalization project
by
 making low interest
 loans to eligible small businesses for the purpose of facade
improvement.
 Future projects are
 expected to include small business marketing, new business creation,
small
 business
 education, and housing for low-to-moderate income individuals.

 Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the corporation
 and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, the Fulton County National Bank and Trust Company and the Fulton
 County Community
Development Corporation. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts
 have been eliminated.

 See Note 13 for parent company financial statements.

 Basis of Accounting

 The corporation uses the accrual basis of accounting.

 Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
 accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
 amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
 of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period
 .
 Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change
 relate to the determination of
the allowance for losses on loans and the valuation of real estate acquired in
 connection with
foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans. In connection with the determination
 of the allowances for
losses on loans and foreclosed real estate, management obtains independent
 appraisals for significant
properties.

 While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans and
 foreclosed real
 estate, future additions to the allowances may be necessary based on
changes in
 local economic
 conditions. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their
 examination process,
 periodically review the corporation's allowances for losses on loans and
 foreclosed real estate.
 Such agencies may require the corporation to recognize additions to the
 allowances based on
 their judgments about information available to them at the time of their
 examination. Because of
 these factors, management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan
 portfolio and the related
 allowance may change in the near term. However, the amount of the change
that
 is reasonably
 possible cannot be estimated.

Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

 Investment Securities

Under SFAS 115, the corporation's investments in securities are classified in
 three categories and
accounted for as follows:

 ? Trading Securities. Securities held principally for resale in the
near term
 are classified as
 trading securities and recorded at their fair values. Unrealized
gains and
 losses on trading
 securities are included in other income. The Bank had no trading
securities
 in 1999 or 1998.

 ? Securities to be Held to Maturity. Bonds and notes for which the Bank
has
 the
positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are reported at cost, adjusted
 for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, which are recognized in interest income
 using the
interest method over the period to maturity.

 ? Securities Available for Sale. Securities available for sale consist
of
 bonds and notes not
classified as trading securities nor as securities to be held to maturity, and
 FNMA and FHLMC
preferred stock. These are securities that management intends to use as a part
 of its asset and
liability management strategy and may be sold in response to changes in interest
 rates, resultant
prepayment risk and other related factors.

Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, on securities available for
 sale are reported as a net
amount in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses on the sale of
 securities available for
sale are determined using the specific-identification method. Fair values for
 investment securities
are based on quoted market prices.

The corporation has classified all of its investment securities as "available
 for sale" at
December 31, 1999 and 1998.

 Loans and Reserve for Possible Loan Losses

Loans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, reduced by a reserve for
 loan losses and increased or
decreased by net deferred loan origination fees and costs. Interest on loans is
 calculated by using the simple
interest method on daily balances of the principal amount outstanding. The
 reserve for loan losses is
established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. Loans are
 charged against the reserve for
loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is
 unlikely. The reserve is an
amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb possible losses on
 existing loans that may
become uncollectible, based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans and
 prior loan loss experience. The
evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and
 volume of the loan portfolio,
overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current
 economic conditions that may affect
the borrowers' ability to pay. Accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan
 when management believes, after
considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the
 borrowers' financial condition
is such that collection of interest is doubtful. Interest accrued but not
 collected as of the date of placement
on nonaccrual status is reversed and charged against current income unless fully
 collateralized.

- -8-

Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Interest income generally is not recognized on specific impaired loans unless
 the likelihood of further
loss is remote. Interest payments received on such loans are applied as a
 reduction of loan principal
balance. Interest income on other impaired loans is recognized only to the
 extent of interest payments
received.

Loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and
 the net amount
amortized as an adjustment of the related loan's yield. These amounts are
 amortized over the
contractual life of the related loans.

 Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
 Depreciation is calculated
on both straight-line and accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of
 the various assets as
follows:

 Years

 Computer software 3 - 5
 Premises 5 - 50
 Equipment and vehicles 3 - 25

 Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred.

 Assets Received in Foreclosure

Assets received in foreclosure are recorded at the lower of the outstanding
 principal balance of the
related loans or the estimated fair value of collateral held, less costs to
 sell. Any adjustment required
to write down the property to net realizable value is charged to the allowance
 for loan losses. Costs of
holding and maintaining the property and subsequent adjustments to the carrying
 amount of the
property are charged to expense when incurred.

 Earnings per Share

Earnings per common share were computed based on: 495,000 shares of common
 stock outstanding
in 1999, 1998 and 1997.

 Federal income taxes

 As a result of certain timing differences between financial statement and
 federal income tax
reporting, including depreciation, loan losses, deferred compensation, and loan
 costs, deferred income
taxes are provided in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and
 liabilities are included in the
financial statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the
 period in which the
deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As
 changes in tax laws or
rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the
 provision for income
taxes. See Note 9 for further details.

 Statements of Cash Flows

For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents include
 those amounts in the
balance sheet captions "cash and due from banks" and "federal funds sold". As
 permitted by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 104, the corporation has elected
 to present the net
change in interest bearing deposits with banks, deposits, and loans in the
 Statements of Cash Flows.

- -9-

Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

 Fair values of financial instruments

 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, Disclosures About Fair
 Value of Financial
Instruments, requires disclosure of fair value information about financial
 instruments, whether or not
recognized in the balance sheet. In cases where quoted market prices are not
 available, fair values are
based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those
 techniques are
significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and
 estimates of future
cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be
 substantiated by comparison to
independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate
 settlement of the
instruments. Statement No. 107 excludes certain financial instruments and all
 nonfinancial
instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair
 value amounts
presented do not represent the underlying value of the corporation.

 The following methods and assumptions were used by the corporation in
 estimating fair values of
 financial instruments as disclosed herein:

 Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and short-term
 instruments
 approximate their fair value.

 Securities to be Held to Maturity and Securities Available for Sale.
Fair
 values for
 investment securities are based on quoted market prices.

 Loans Receivable. For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and
have no
 significant
 change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values. Fair
values
 for fixed rate
 loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using
interest rates
 currently being
 offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit
quality.
 Fair values for
 impaired loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses or
underlying
 collateral
 values, where applicable.

 Deposit Liabilities. The fair values disclosed for demand deposits
are, by
 definition, equal
 to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (that is, their
carrying
 amounts). The
 carrying amounts of variable-rate, fixed-term money market accounts and
 certificates of
 deposit approximate their fair values at the reporting date. Fair
values for
 fixed-rate
 certificates of deposits and IRA's are estimated using a discounted
cash flow
 calculation that
 applies interest rates currently being offered to a schedule of
aggregated
 expected monthly
 maturities on time deposits.

 Short-Term Borrowings. The carrying amounts of federal funds
purchased and
 other short-
 term borrowings maturing within 90 days approximate their fair values.
 Fair
 values of other
 short-term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow
analyses based
 on the Bank's
 current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing
 arrangements.

 Accrued Interest. The carrying amounts of accrued interest
approximate their
 fair values.

 Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments. The Bank generally does not charge
commitment
 fees. Fees
 for standby letters of credit and their off-balance-sheet instruments
are not
 significant.

 Advertising

 The Bank expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expenses for
the
 years ended
 December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were 81,904, 70,719 and 56,327,
 respectively.

Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

 Comprehensive income

In 1998 the corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
 (SFAS) No. 130 -
Reporting Comprehensive Income. Under SFAS No. 130, comprehensive income is
 defined as the
change in equity from transactions and other events from nonowner sources. It
 includes all changes
in equity except those resulting from investments by stockholders and
 distributions to stockholders.
Comprehensive income includes net income and certain elements of "other
 comprehensive income"
such as foreign currency transactions; accounting for futures contracts;
 employers accounting for
pensions; and accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.

The corporation has elected to report its comprehensive income in the statement
 of stockholders'
equity. The only element of "other comprehensive income" that the corporation
 has is the
unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities. The 1997 financial
 statements have been
reclassified to reflect these changes in reporting format.

The components of the change in net unrealized gains (losses) on securities were
 as follows:

1999 1998 1997
 Gross unrealized holding gains/(losses) arising during
 the year 1,154,797) 5,278 457,616

The amortized cost and fair value of investment securities available for sale at
 December 31, 1999, by
contractual maturity, are shown below. Contractual maturities will differ from
 expected maturities because
borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call
 or prepayment penalties.

Proceeds from sales of securities available for sale during 1999 were
 3,906,168. Gross gains and
losses on those sales were 8,989 and 3,071, respectively. Proceeds from
 maturities of investment
securities during 1999 were 3,171,671, resulting in no gains or losses.
 Included in stockholders'
equity at December 31, 1999 is 683,467 of unrealized holding losses on
 securities available for sale,
net of 352,089 in deferred taxes.

Proceeds from sales of securities available for sale during 1998 were
 5,375,879. Gross gains and
losses on those sales were 17,200 and 13,529, respectively. Proceeds from
 maturities of
investment securities during 1998 were 5,208,580, resulting in no gains or
 losses. Included in
stockholders' equity at December 31, 1998 is 82,605 of unrealized holding
 gains on securities
available for sale, net of 42,554 in deferred taxes.

The corporation is required to maintain minimum investments in certain stocks,
 which are recorded at
cost since they are not actively traded and therefore, have no readily
 determinable market value.
Consequently, the corporation owns the following equity securities at December
 31:
 1999 1998

 Federal Home Loan Bank 788,800 496,000
 Atlantic Central Bankers Bank 10,000 10,000

 8,750,000 (fair value of
 8,769,380) at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, were pledged to secure
 public funds and
for other purposes as required or permitted by law.

 December 31, 1997
was restructured in early 1998. As a result, 37,393 in foregone interest at
 December 31, 1997 was
realized as interest income in 1998. This loan had an outstanding balance of
 280,023 and 286,000
at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and is on a current payment status.

Loan balances are stated net of deferred loan origination (fees) costs. These
 net (fees) costs amounted
to the following at December 31:
 1999 1998

 Installment 11,541 12,613
 Time and demand 1,571 8,085
 Mortgage 57,349) 78,268)
 44,237) 57,570)

At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the total recorded investment in impaired loans
 was 0. The
average recorded investment in impaired loans amounted to approximately 0 and
 23,000 for 1999
and 1998, respectively.

Note 6. Loans to Related Parties

The Bank has granted loans to the officers and directors of the corporation and
 its subsidiary and to
their associates. Related party loans are made on substantially the same terms,
 including interest rates
and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with
 unrelated persons and
do not involve more than normal risk of collectibility. The aggregate dollar
 amount of these loans
was 1,040,715 and 1,019,727 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
 During 1999,
 222,431 of new loans were made and repayments totaled 201,443. During 1998,
 995,310 of
new loans were made and repayments totaled 801,811.

 Outstanding loans to employees totaled 739,510 and 808,569 at Decemb
er 31,
 1999 and 1998,
respectively.

Note 7. Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk/Commitments

The corporation is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk
 in the normal course of
business to meet the financial needs of its customers and to reduce its own
 exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments to extend
 credit and standby letters
of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit
 and interest rate risk in
excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets. The contract amounts of
 those instruments
reflect the extent of involvement the corporation has in particular classes of
 financial instruments.

- -14-

Note 7. Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk/Commitments
 (Continued)

The corporation's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
 other party to the
financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of
 credit and financial
guarantees written is represented by the contractual amounts of those
 instruments. The corporation
uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations
 as it does for on-
balance-sheet instruments.
 Contract or
 Notional Amount
 1999 1998
 Financial instruments whose contract amounts
 represent credit risk at December 31:
 Commitments to extend credit 14,215,598 12,986,325
 Standby letters of credit and financial
 guarantees written 322,500 229,500

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of
any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed
 expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the
 commitments are expected
to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not
 necessarily represent
future cash requirements.

Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written are conditional
 commitments issued by the
corporation to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those
 guarantees are
primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The
 credit risk involved in
issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending
 loans to customers. The
corporation holds collateral supporting those commitments when deemed necessary
 by management.

Note 8. Retirement Plan

The corporation maintains a 401-K profit-sharing plan covering substantially all
 full-time employees.
The plan allows contributions of up to 15 by employees. Additional
 contributions can be made at
the discretion of the board of directors. The corporation contributions made to
 the plan were 60,000
for 1999, 52,735 for 1998 and 53,291 for 1997.

Note 9. Federal Income Taxes

 The components of federal income tax expense are summarized as follows:

 1999 1998 1997

 Current year provision 507,944 455,085 422,864
 Deferred income taxes (benefits) 114,841) 50,535) 39,851)
 Income tax effect of securities transactions 2,012
1,248
 1,038
 Applicable income taxes 395,115 405,798 384,051

Federal income taxes were computed after reducing pretax accounting income for
 nontaxable interest
and dividend income in the amount of 516,446, 550,702 and 494,737 for
 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.

- -15-

Note 9. Federal Income Taxes (Continued)

 A reconciliation of the effective income tax rate to the federal statutory
rate
 is as follows:

 1999 1998 1997

 Applicable federal income tax rate 34.0 34.0 34.0 

 Reductions resulting from:
 Nontaxable investment income and other items,
 net of nondeductible expenses (12.8) (11.9) (11.3)
 Effective income tax rate 21.2 22.1 22.7 

Deferred tax liabilities have been provided for taxable temporary differences
 related to accumulated
depreciation and deferred loan costs. Deferred tax assets have been provided
 for deductible
temporary differences related to the allowance for loan losses and unrealized
 losses on available for
sale securities. The net deferred tax assets (liabilities) included in other
 assets (other liabilities) in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets include the following components:

 1999 1998 1997

 Total deferred tax assets 684,995 225,970 159,363
 Total deferred tax liabilities 130,661) 181,120) 164,502)
 Net deferred tax asset (liability) 554,334 44,850 
5,139)

The corporation has not recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax
 assets as management
believes that it is more likely than not that they will be ultimately realized.

Note 10. Leases

The Bank is party to real estate leases with base monthly rental charges of
 3,254. These charges are
to be adjusted on specified dates and by agreed upon amounts or by the net
 change in the consumer
price index. The original leases expire on January 7, 2001 and December 31,
 2003, respectively.
Each lease contains a provision for renewal under various terms at the Bank's
 option. In addition, the
Bank leases certain equipment on a 54 month lease which expires in 2001. Total
 rental expense
charged to operations for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was
 59,573, 59,435
and 60,635, respectively.

Based on the current monthly rent, future minimum rental payments for the next
 five years are as
follows:
 2000 59,947
 2001 49,500
 2002 39,053
2003 39,053

Note 12. Deposits

Included in interest-bearing deposits at December 31 are NOW and Money Market
 Account balances
totaling 16,281,186 and 18,049,411 for 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Time deposits of 100,000 and over aggregated 12,462,940 and 12,030,190
 at December 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively. Interest expense on time deposits of 100,000 and
 over was 624,000,
 617,000 and 571,000 for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

The amount of time deposits maturing over the next 5 years is as follows:

 2004 1,824,370
 61,044,157

 its subsidiaries on the
same terms, including interest rates, as those prevailing at the time for
 comparable transactions with
unrelated persons. The aggregate dollar amount of deposits of officers and
 directors totaled
 3,125,902 and 3,486,275 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Note 14. Compensating Balances

The corporation is required to maintain certain compensating balances with its
 correspondent banks to
cover processing costs and service charges. Required compensating balances were
 125,000 at
December 31, 1999 and 1998.

Note 15. Regulatory Matters

Dividends paid by Fulton Bancshares Corporation are generally provided from the
 Fulton County
National Bank and Trust Company's dividends to it. The Federal Reserve Board,
 which regulates
bank holding companies, establishes guidelines which indicate that cash
 dividends should be covered
by current year earnings and the debt to equity ratio of the holding company
 must be below thirty
percent.
- -18-

Note 15. Regulatory Matters (Continued)

Fulton County National Bank and Trust Company, as a National Bank, is subject to
 the dividend
restrictions set forth by the Comptroller of the Currency. Retained earnings
 available for the payment
of dividends without approval of the Comptroller amounted to 3,223,813,
 2,964,040, and
 2,685,625 at December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The Bank is also
 subject to various
regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies.
 Failure to meet minimum
capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional
 discretionary actions by
regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the
 Bank's financial statements.
Under capital adequacy guidelines, the Bank is required to maintain minimum
 capital ratios. The
"leverage ratio", which compares capital to adjusted total balance sheet assets
 is required to be at least
4 . "Tier I" and "Tier II" capital ratios compare capital to risk-weighted
 assets and off-balance sheet
activity. The Tier I ratio is required to be at least 4 . The combined Tier I
 and Tier II ratio is
required to be at least 8 .

At December 31 the corporation's actual ratios and required levels were as
 follows:
 - - - - Actual - - - -
 Required 1999 1998
 Leverage (total capital/total assets) 4.0 10.0 10.3 
 Tier 1 (Tier 1 core capital/risk weighted assets) 4.0 14.5 15.8 
 Total capital (total capital plus allowance for loan losses/
 risk weighted assets) 8.0 15.3 16.7 

As of December 31, 1999 the most recent notification from the Comptroller of the
 Currency
categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for
 prompt corrective action.
There are no conditions or events since that notification that management
 believes have changed the
Bank's category.

Note 16. Liabilities for Borrowed Money

At December 31, 1998 the Bank had an outstanding five year loan with Federal
 Home Loan Bank of
Pittsburgh of 5,000,000. Interest is payable monthly at a floating rate of
 4.54 with the principal
maturing September 24, 2003. During 1999 the borrowing was refinanced with a
 10,000,000 ten
year loan with Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. The floating interest rate
 was 5.16 at
December 31, 1999 and is payable monthly. The loan matures on September 24,
 2009.

The Bank has established credit at Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Pittsburgh
 to improve
liquidity. The Bank may borrow up to approximately 34 million from FHLB under
 the terms of
certain commitment agreements, less any borrowings outstanding. The rates and
 terms of the
commitments are flexible and are not fixed until the funds are withdrawn, but
 funds may not be
borrowed for more than one year. Borrowings were 1,475,000 and 0 at December
 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively. The variable interest rate was 4.06 at December 31, 1999.
 Collateral for the
borrowings consists of certain investments and mortgages approximating 34
 million at
December 31, 1999.

Note 18. Deferred Compensation and Other Benefit Programs

 The Bank has adopted several benefit programs, some of which result in the
 deferral of payments for
services rendered:

 (1) The Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan - This Plan is funded by
single
 premium life
 insurance on the CEO and certain other Bank executives, with the Bank
as
 beneficiary.
 Actual payments to the executives will not begin until their
retirement.

 (2) The Director Emeritus Program - This plan, funded by life insurance,
will
 allow the Bank to
 reward its directors for longevity of service to the Board. Directors
who
 qualify would be
 eligible at age 75 to receive 4,000 annually for up to 10 years
under this
 program.

 (3) The Director Deferred Compensation Plan - This plan, also funded by
life
 insurance, will
 allow directors to defer up to 100 of directors fees annually. The
amounts
 deferred will
 be paid out over a period of up to 10 years beginning when the director
 reaches the age of
 75.

 (4) The Officer Supplemental Life Insurance Plan provides for officer life
 insurance coverage of
 generally double their current salary level, and is also funded by
single
 premium life
 insurance.

 As a result of these plans, the following items are recognized in the
financial
 statements:

 1999 1998 1997
 Asset
 Cash surrender value of life insurance 3,028,486 3,165,957

Note 19. Concentrations of Credit Risk

The corporation grants agribusiness, commercial and residential loans to
 customers primarily in
Fulton County, Pennsylvania and adjoining counties in Pennsylvania and Maryland.
 Although the
Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, a significant portion of its customers'
 ability to honor their
contracts is dependent upon the agribusiness economic sector (approximately 20 
 of loan portfolio).

Management evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
 The amount of
collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon the extension of credit, is based
 on management's credit
evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but generally includes
 equipment and real estate.

The corporation maintains deposit balances at correspondent banks, which provide
 check collection
and item processing services to the corporation. At times, the balances with
 these correspondent
banks may exceed federally insured limits, which management considers to be a
 normal business risk.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the
 selected supplementary
financial information presented in this report.

 OPERATING RESULTS

 Net income was 1,467,000 for 1999, compared to 1,427,000 for 1998,
 representing an increase of
 40,000, or 2.8 . Net income on an adjusted per share basis for 1999 was
 2.96, up .08 from the 2.88 per
share realized during 1998.

 Interest income for 1999 was 8,804,000, up 612,000, or 7.5 more than
1998.
 The increase was
due primarily to higher average balances of loans, which typically produce
 higher yields than investments,
compared to 1998.

 Average earning assets increased 11.6 and 5.1 in 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
 Average loan
demand, which typically produces higher yields than investments, increased 16.3 
 in 1999. Net loans at
December 31, 1999 stood at 90,995,000 compared to 80,214,000 as of December
 31, 1998, an increase of
13.4 . Average investment securities decreased .5 in 1999, with the decrease
 concentrated in mortgage-
backed securities and obligations of state and political subdivisions, while
 U.S. Government Agency securities
increased.

 Total interest expense was 4,325,000 for 1999, an increase of 174,000,
or
 4.2 from the
 4,151,000 for 1998. Average time deposits, which pay higher yields, increased
 3.3 in 1999. Interest-bearing
deposits stood at 90,957,000 at December 31, 1999 compared with 87,788,000
 as of December 31, 1998, an
increase of 3.6 . Average interest-bearing demand deposits and other savings
 deposits increased 1.0 and
1.6 , respectively. Average borrowed funds increased 166.7 .

 Management continues to competitively price its interest-bearing deposits to
 maintain a favorable net
interest margin.

 Net interest income is the difference between total interest income and
total
 interest expense. Interest
income is generated through earning assets, which include loans, deposits with
 other banks, and investments.
Interest income is dependent on many factors including the volume of earning
 assets, the level of interest rates
and the changes in interest rates, and volumes of nonperforming loans. The cost
 of funds varies with the volume
of funds necessary to support earning assets, the rates paid to maintain
 deposits, rates paid on borrowed funds,
and the level of interest-free deposits.

 Net interest income for 1999 totaled 4,479,000, up 10.8 from 1998.
 Management continuously
monitors liquidity and interest rate risk through its Asset-Liability Committee
 reporting and reprices products to
maintain a desired net interest margin.

 Other income represents service charges on deposit accounts, commissions on
 loan insurance, fees for
travelers' checks and other services, safe deposit box rents, fees for trust
 services, securities gains (losses), gains
(losses) on sales of other real estate owned, and earnings on cash surrender
 value of directors and officers life
insurance.

 Other income increased 133,000 from 1998 to 1999. The increase in 1999
 resulted primarily from a
 178,000 gain on sale of other real estate owned reported in 1998 which was
 partially offset by a 114,000
directors and officers life insurance benefit income in 1999, and a 76,000
 decrease in fiduciary fees, since,
effective January 4, 1999, the Bank's Trust Department was serviced by an agent.

- -27-

 The noninterest expenses are classified into four main categories:
salaries,
 fees and employee
benefits; occupancy expenses and furniture and equipment expenses that include
 depreciation, maintenance,
utilities, taxes, insurance and rents; FDIC insurance premiums; and other
 operating expenses that include all
other expenses incurred in daily operations.

 Employee related expenses increased 5.8 and 5.4 for 1999 and 1998,
 respectively, primarily due
to salary and related benefit increases. Occupancy and furniture and equipment
 expenses increased 13.8 and
22.4 in 1999 and 1998, respectively. These increases were due primarily to
 increased equipment and building
maintenance costs and expense associated with the addition of two new full-
service banking facilities during
1999. Other operating expenses increased 12.3 in 1999 compared to a decrease
 of 4.9 in the previous year,
primarily due to increases in advertising, printing and supplies, shares tax and
 other overhead expenses.

 Applicable income taxes changed between 1997, 1998 and 1999 because of
changes
 in pretax
accounting income and taxable income. The effective income tax rate for 1999
 was 21.2 compared to 22.1 
and 22.7 for 1998 and 1997, respectively. The decrease in the effective income
 tax rate for 1999 and 1998
was due primarily to an increase in tax-exempt interest on obligations of state
 and political subdivisions, the
dividends received deduction for FNMA and FHLMC preferred stock, and the
 nontaxable income related to the
increase in the cash surrender value of directors and officers life insurance.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION

 Total assets at December 31, 1999 were 128,478,000, a 7.4 increase over
 December 31, 1998.
Net loans at December 31, 1999 totaled 90,995,000, an increase of 13.4 over
 December 31, 1998.

 The provision for loan losses was 195,000 in 1999 compared to 185,000
in
1998. The provisions
were based on management's evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve balance and
 represent amounts
necessary to maintain the reserve at the appropriate level based on the quality
 of the loan portfolio and economic
conditions. The bank's history of net charge-offs has traditionally been better
 than peer group performance with
an average rate of less than .10 of average loans outstanding over the past
five years. Though this trend is
expected to continue, management intends to maintain the reserve at appropriate
 levels based on an ongoing
evaluation of the loan portfolio.

 Loans 90 days or more past due (still accruing interest) and those on
 nonaccrual status were as
follows at December 31 (in thousands):
 90 Days or More
 Past Due Nonaccrual Status
 1999 1998 1999 1998

 Real estate mortgages 168 405 0 0
 Installment loans 0 37 0 0
 Demand and time loans 0 0 0 0
 Total 168 442 0 0

 A mortgage loan in the amount of 310,000 and listed on nonaccrual status
at
 both December 31,
1997 and 1996 was restructured in early 1998. As a result, 37,393 in foregone
 interest at December 31, 1997
was realized as interest income in 1998. This loan has an outstanding balance
of 280,000 at December 31,
1999 and is on a current payment status.

 Total deposits increased to 103,311,000 at December 31, 1999 compared with
 99,341,000 at
December 31, 1998. Noninterest bearing deposits and interest-bearing deposits
 increased 6.9 and 3.6 ,
respectively.

- -28-

 Stockholders' equity reached 12,753,000 at December 31, 1999 for a 2.2 
 increase over the prior
year. Accumulated earnings for 1999 were partially offset by dividends declared
 and paid of 426,000 and a
 766,000 decrease in net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities (net
 of deferred tax). Total
stockholders' equity represented 9.9 and 10.4 of total assets at the end of
 1999 and 1998, respectively. Cash
dividends paid in 1999 were up 69,000, or 19.4 over 1998. It is the
 intention of management and the Board
of Directors to continue to pay a fair return on the stockholders' investment
while retaining adequate earnings to
allow for continued growth.

 LIQUIDITY

 Liquidity and interest rate sensitivity are related but distinctly different
 from one another.

 Liquidity involves the bank's ability to meet cash withdrawal needs of
 customers and their credit
needs in the form of loans. Cash provides liquidity on hand and transaction
 balances held at correspondent
banks. Liquidity available to meet credit demands and/or adverse deposit flows
 is also made available from
sales or maturities of short-term assets. Additional sources of funds to meet
 credit needs is provided by access
to the marketplace to obtain interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings
, including special programs
available through Federal Home Loan Bank.

 Interest rate sensitivity is the matching or mismatching of the maturity and
 rate structure of the
interest-bearing assets and liabilities. It is the objective of management to
 control the difference in the timing of
the rate changes for these assets and liabilities to preserve a satisfactory net
 interest margin. The following
table approximately reflects the matching of assets and liabilities maturing
 within one year and thereafter,
which management feels is adequate to meet customer cash and credit needs while
 maintaining a desired
interest rate spread.

 Loan rates have generally increased over the past twelve months. Based on
 current economic
indicators and predictions, management anticipates that interest rates will
 increase during early 2000 and
remain relatively stable over the remainder of the year. As a result,
 management has assessed probabilities to
each time period and proportionately included variable rate loans in rate
 sensitive assets of one year or less.
- -29-

 LIQUIDITY (CONTINUED)

 In monitoring and evaluating liquidity, management generally does not
consider
 regular savings or
interest-bearing checking accounts to be particularly rate sensitive since it is
 highly improbable that 100 of
these deposits will be withdrawn within the next 360 days. Therefore,
 management has assessed probabilities to
each time period and proportionately included these funds in rate sensitive
 liabilities of one year or less.

 CAPITAL FUNDS

 Internal capital generation has been the primary method utilized by Fulton
 Bancshares Corporation to
increase its capital stock. Stockholders' equity exceeded 12.75 million at
 December 31, 1999. Regulatory
authorities have established capital guidelines in the form of the "leverage"
 and "risk-based capital" ratios. The
leverage ratio compares capital to total balance sheet assets, while the risk-
based ratios compare capital to risk-
weighted assets and off-balance-sheet activity in order to make capital levels
 more sensitive to risk profiles of
individual banks. A comparison of Fulton Bancshares Corporation's capital
 ratios to regulatory minimums at
December 31 is as follows:
 Fulton Bancshares Corporation Regulatory Minimum
 1999 1998 Requirements

 Leverage ratio 10.0 10.3 4 

 Risk-based capital ratio
 Tier I (core capital) 14.5 15.8 4 
 Combined Tier I and Tier II
 (core capital plus allowance
 for loan losses) 15.3 16.7 8 

 Fulton Bancshares Corporation has traditionally been well above required
levels
 and expects equity
capital to continue to exceed regulatory guidelines and industry averages.
 Certain ratios are useful in measuring
the ability of a company to generate capital internally.

 MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

 The Bank has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to
market
 risk, and works
diligently to take advantage of profit opportunities available in interest rate
 movements.

 Management continuously monitors liquidity and interest rate risk through
its
 Asset-Liability
Committee reporting, and reprices products in order to maintain desired net
 interest margins. Management
expects to continue to direct its marketing efforts toward attracting more low
cost retail deposits while
competitively pricing its time deposits in order to maintain favorable interest
 spreads, while minimizing
structural interest rate risk.

- -30-

 MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

 The following table sets forth the projected maturities and average rates
for
 all rate sensitive assets and
liabilities based on the following assumptions. All fixed and variable rate
 loans were based on original maturities
since the bank has not experienced, and does not expect, a significant rewriting
 of loans. Investments are based on
maturity date except certain long-term agencies, which are classified by call
 date. The bank has historically
experienced very little deposit runoff and has generally had net gains in
 deposits over the years. Based on this
experience, it was estimated that maximum runoff of noninterest-bearing
 checking, NOW checking and other
savings would be 10 , and maximum runoff of money market deposits would be 33 .
 It was estimated that
maximum runoff of time deposits would be 25 and these deposits are classified
 by original maturity date.

 Significant Events

 Trust and estate services previously provided by the Fulton County National
 Bank & Trust Company
(Bank) are now serviced by Sentry Trust Company (Sentry) acting as agent for the
 Bank's trust assets. Pursuant to
the service agreement entered into by the Bank and Sentry, Sentry opened a
 branch office in the Penn's Village
Shopping Center in McConnellsburg, PA.

 Local business people and bankers in Franklin County, PA, formed Sentry in
 1997. It is an independent,
nondepository trust company chartered by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking.
 To date, Sentry manages
approximately 250 million in assets and its staff of professionals have an
 average of 15 years of experience.

 It is the Bank's goal to continue to provide quality trust services to its
 customers and to offer, through
Sentry, additional services such as investment management, estate planning, cash
 management, employee benefit
planning, financial and business planning, discount brokerage, and tax planning.
 The Bank refers customers to
Sentry as a full service provider. Sentry will have the full authority to act
 as agent for the Bank with respect to
investment management, personal trust administration, estate planning, estate
 settlement services, cash management,
qualified retirement plans, and financial planning. The authority to act as
 agent for the Bank shall extend only to
those matters that have been vested in the Bank by reason of a trust, plan or
 other document appointing the Bank as a
fiduciary to the individual, entity or plan.

 Now that the Bank has completed its first year with Sentry, we believe the
 trust services arrangement
expanded services and benefits to the customers of the Bank and make this a
 successful arrangement. The Bank and
Sentry working together serves the people of Fulton, southern Huntingdon and
 western Franklin counties. The Bank
does not anticipate a significant impact to future net income as a result of
 this change.

 FUTURE IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

 In June, 1998 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS
No.
 133 - "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" effective for fiscal years
 beginning after June 15, 1999. This
Statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
 instruments and hedging activities, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and requires that an
 entity recognize all derivatives as
assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure them at fair value. If
 certain conditions are met, an entity may
elect to designate a derivative as follows: (a) a hedge of the exposure to
 changes in the fair value of a recognized
asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, (b) a hedge of the
 exposure to variable cash flows of a
forecasted transaction, or (c) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of an
 unrecognized firm commitment, an
available-for-sale security, a foreign currency denominated forecasted
 transaction, or a net investment in a foreign
operation. The statement generally provides for matching the timing of the
 recognition of the gain or loss on
derivatives designated as hedging instruments with the recognition of the
 changes in the fair value of the item being
hedged. Depending on the type of hedge, such recognition will be in either net
 income or other comprehensive
income. For a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, changes in
fair value will be recognized in net
income in the period of change. Management is currently evaluating the impact
 of adopting this Statement on the
consolidated financial statements, but does not anticipate that it will have a
 material impact.
