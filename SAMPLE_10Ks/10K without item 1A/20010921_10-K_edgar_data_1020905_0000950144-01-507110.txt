 PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION

 Boca Resorts, Inc. (the "Company") is an owner and operator of five luxury
resorts located in Florida with hotels, conference facilities, golf courses,
spas, marinas and private clubs (the "leisure and recreation business"). The
Company owned an entertainment and sports business, which primarily included the
operations of the Florida Panthers Hockey Club (the "Panthers") and related
arena management operations. This business was sold on July 25, 2001 and,
accordingly, the entertainment and sports business has been accounted for as
discontinued operations.

 The Company's resorts include the Boca Raton Resort and Club (Boca Raton),
the Registry Resort at Pelican Bay (Naples), the Edgewater Beach Hotel (Naples),
the Hyatt Regency Pier 66 Hotel and Marina (Fort Lauderdale) and the Radisson
Bahia Mar Resort and Yachting Center (Fort Lauderdale). The Company also owns
and operates two championship golf courses located in Florida (the Grande Oaks
Golf Club in Davie and Naples Grande Golf Club in Naples) that serve as
additional amenities to the Company's resorts as well as components of the
Company's exclusive social club, known as the Premier Club. Previously, the
Company owned the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa, however, this property was sold
on December 22, 2000.

 The Company's resorts possess numerous competitive and operational
strengths. The resorts are unique, irreplaceable assets in desirable locations
with strong recognition and positioning in their markets. The facilities and
amenities at the Company's resorts provide multiple and diverse revenue streams
and attract upscale business and leisure customers. In addition, through the
development of additional guestrooms and/or resort amenities, the resorts have
opportunities to significantly increase revenue and cash flow.

 For a discussion of the Company's revenue, profits and assets, see
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" and the Consolidated Financial Statements included later herein. The
Company was incorporated in Florida in 1996 and re-incorporated in Delaware in
1997.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

 While management continuously evaluates ownership, acquisition and
divestiture alternatives, its current strategy is to focus on internal expansion
and development opportunities of its existing properties. The Company's
objective is to maximize the cash flow from, and the value of, the Company's
leisure and recreation business by:

 - Continuing Internal Growth Through Capital Improvements at the
 Resorts. Management believes that the Company's resorts have the
 opportunity for continued internal growth. In addition to normal
 recurring capital expenditures, during the past five years over 200
 million has been invested (or is committed to be invested) in the resorts
 on capital projects including the Boca Raton Resort and Club marina wing
 complex (consisting of 112 new water-view luxury guestrooms), spa
 complex, golf clubhouse, marina slips, retail and restaurant space,
 conference center, golf course, tennis and fitness center, parking garage
 and accelerated guestroom renovation; the Registry Resort at Pelican Bay
 with a new pool complex, additional meeting space and beachfront
 improvements; the construction of Grande Oaks Golf Club and Naples Grande
 Golf Club; as well as room renovations at the Hyatt Regency Pier 66 Hotel
 and Marina, the Radisson Bahia Mar Resort and Yachting Center and the
 Edgewater Beach Hotel.

 Management believes that these capital expenditures have resulted in, and
will continue to produce, increases to the average daily room rates at its
resorts. Management also believes that the high quality of the Company's resorts
will continue to attract higher spending corporate groups, which in turn will
increase total revenue per available room. For the year ended June 30, 2001, the
average daily room rate was 209.79, room revenue per available room was 150.42
and total revenue per available room was 353.97, excluding the

 1
 4

Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa. For the year ended June 30, 2000, the average
daily room rate was 201.08, room revenue per available room was 141.09 and
total revenue per available room was 326.58, excluding the Arizona Biltmore
Resort & Spa.

 - Continued Focus on Upscale Business and Leisure Customers. Management
 believes that its focus on corporate group customers and upscale business
 and leisure customers allows the Company to maximize total revenue per
 available room. It has been management's experience that these customers
 are more likely to use the additional amenities and facilities available
 at the resorts, thereby increasing revenue. Additionally, group customers
 tend to book reservations 12 to 36 months in advance of their stay, thus
 enabling management to better estimate future revenue streams and manage
 corresponding expenses. Group business has also been used by the Company
 to fill off-peak leisure periods. Management believes that by targeting
 upscale customers the Company is well positioned to take advantage of
 demographic trends (which include an aging "baby-boom" population with
 increasing disposable income) that are creating increased demand for
 luxury resorts and related amenities. Management also believes the
 resorts will be able to capitalize on these trends given the properties'
 unique nature and locations. The Company's ability to capitalize on these
 trends is enhanced by the high barriers of entry into the luxury resort
 industry.

 - Continuing to Capitalize on Integration and Cost-Saving
 Opportunities. Management believes the integration of certain aspects of
 the resort operations will allow the Company to realize significant
 operating efficiencies. Management is focusing on integrating the
 operations of all of its resorts, including reservations, purchasing,
 training, information systems, insurance and marketing, in order to
 achieve greater operating efficiencies and improved profit margins. In
 addition, management believes that managing all of the resorts by a
 single management team with established practices and systems will
 improve the efficiency of the resort operations and will offer employees
 internal promotional opportunities.

 - Expanding Premier Club Concept. The Company continues to expand and
 develop its Premier Club concept, which was first introduced in 1991 at
 the Boca Raton Resort and Club. Membership in the Boca Raton Resort
 Premier Club allows Premier Club members' access to the Boca Raton Resort
 and Club grounds, restaurants, recreational facilities and other private
 social functions, which are otherwise restricted to resort guests. The
 Company expanded its Premier Club operations, with the opening of Grande
 Oaks Golf Club in June 1999 and Naples Grande Golf Club in February 2000.
 In addition to attracting new club members who provide an additional
 revenue stream, the Company is able to offer guests of the Company's Fort
 Lauderdale and Naples resorts play at these new 18-hole championship
 facilities and is able to offer reciprocal amenities to the Boca Raton
 Resort and Club Premier Club members. With its Premier Clubs, the Company
 generates substantial incremental revenue from its existing facilities
 and services. Management anticipates that the Premier Club will continue
 to be successful in marketing resort amenities, including restaurants,
 pools, and where available, tennis, golf, spas and other leisure and
 recreational facilities to residents in local communities in a country
 club/social club setting.

(1) Excludes 112 rooms currently under construction in a new marina wing.
(2) Boca Raton Resort and Club maintains one 18-hole golf course on premises and
 another at the resort's country club location. In addition, the resort has
 access to two 18-hole golf courses through use agreements.
(3) Guests at the Registry Resort at Pelican Bay and the Edgewater Beach Hotel
 have access to the new 18-hole Naples Grande Golf Club, which is owned by
 the Company, and to three 18-hole golf courses through use agreements.
(4) Edgewater Beach Hotel guests have access to the tennis courts at the
 Registry Resort at Pelican Bay.
(5) Hyatt Regency Pier 66 Hotel and Marina and Radisson Bahia Mar Resort and
 Yachting Center have access to Grande Oaks Golf Club, which is owned by the
 Company.
(6) Excludes the acreage associated with Grande Oaks and Naples Grande Golf
 Clubs.

 Amenities and services at the resorts include conference facilities, golf
courses, tennis facilities, spas, fitness centers, marinas, restaurants, retail
outlets, swimming pools, and other activities and services. The diversity and
number of amenities and services at the facilities provide the Company with
substantial non-room revenue. For the year ended June 30, 2001, approximately
58 of resort revenue was generated from non-room sources. In addition, these
luxury amenities and services allow the Company to maintain premium pricing for
its rooms.

 The resorts' conference facilities and other amenities make them attractive
locations for group functions. The conference facilities include over 235,000
square feet of conference space. The Company maintains its own in-house planning
and logistics capabilities that allow sales and marketing personnel to market
multiple resort locations to corporate and association groups that prefer to
change conference locations from year to year.

 The Company continues to expand and develop the Premier Club concept, which
was first introduced in 1991 at the Boca Raton Resort and Club. Membership in
the Boca Raton Resort Premier Club allows Premier Club members' access to the
Boca Raton Resort and Club grounds, restaurants, recreational facilities and
other private social functions, which are otherwise restricted to resort guests.
The Boca Raton Resort Premier Club currently requires an initial membership fee
of 50,000 and annual social dues starting at 3,150. Additional dues are
required for members who wish to use the resort's golf and tennis facilities. In
addition, Premier Club members generate revenue through the use of existing
resort facilities and services, which are available on a fee-for-use basis. The
Company opened Grande Oaks Golf Club in June 1999 and Naples Grande Golf Club in
February 2000 offering members and guests of the Company's Fort Lauderdale and
Naples resorts play at these championship golf facilities as well as reciprocal
amenities to the Boca Resort Premier Club member. The Company currently charges
 33,500 and 30,000 for membership initiation fees at Grande Oaks Golf Club and
Naples Grande Golf Club, respectively, and annual golf dues of 5,356 and 4,700
at Grande Oaks Golf Club and Naples Grande Golf Club, respectively.

 square foot conference facility, a state-of-the-art tennis and fitness
 center complex and a new Bates-designed 18-hole golf course, replacing
 one of its previous 18-hole golf courses. The completion of the
 conference center allows the Boca Raton Resort and Club to accommodate

 renovation of its guestrooms in November 1998.

 - Distinctions. In 2001, the general manager of Hyatt Regency Pier 66 was

 - Franchise Agreement. Upon the acquisition of Hyatt Regency Pier 66, the
 Company assumed the rights under a 20-year franchise agreement with Hyatt
 Franchise Corporation. The Hyatt franchise agreement terminates in
 November 2014. The Hyatt franchise agreement provides for the payment of

 4
 7

 monthly royalty fees equal to 5 of gross room revenue. The Hyatt
 franchise agreement also provides for the payment to Hyatt of certain
 Hyatt "allocable chain expenses" relating to sales and marketing costs
 based on the total number of guestrooms at Hyatt Regency Pier 66 compared
 to the average number of guestrooms in all Hyatt hotels in the United
 States, and the Hyatt franchise agreement provides for the payment of a
 fee for using the Hyatt reservation system. The Hyatt franchise agreement
 requires that Hyatt Regency Pier 66 maintain a reserve, equal to 4 of
 gross room revenue, for replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment
 and for those repairs and maintenance costs that are capitalizable under
 generally accepted accounting principles. The franchise agreement
 requires significant renovations of guestrooms, corridors and other
 public areas every five to six years. The replacement of other furniture,
 fixtures and equipment, as defined in the agreement, is required every 10
 to 12 years.

RADISSON BAHIA MAR RESORT AND YACHTING CENTER

 - Renovations/Expansion. Radisson Bahia Mar completed a comprehensive room
 renovation in 2000.

 - Distinctions. Radisson Bahia Mar has consistently received the Mobil
 Travel Guide's Three Star Award and the AAA's Three Diamond Award and was
 previously awarded the Radisson Hotels Worldwide President's Award and
 the Anchor Award presented by Marine Industries Association of South
 Florida. Each Fall, the Radisson Bahia Mar marina is host to the
 International Boat Show, an annual six-day boating and marine event,
 which is believed to be the world's largest in-water boat show.

 - License Agreement. Upon the acquisition of Radisson Bahia Mar, the
 Company assumed the rights under the Radisson license agreement with
 Radisson Hotels International, Inc., which expires in July 2004. The
 terms of the Radisson license agreement allow the Company to operate the
 hotel using Radisson's proprietary hotel management system. Annual fees
 payable to Radisson pursuant to the Radisson license agreement are 5 of
 gross room sales.

 - Leases. The site of the resort is subject to a land lease that expires
 in 2062.

 In addition to the resort properties discussed above, the Company also owns
Grande Oaks Golf Club and Naples Grande Golf Club. Grande Oaks Golf Club was
formerly known as Rolling Hills Golf Club, site of the hit comedy "Caddy Shack".
The property now features a redesigned 18-hole championship golf course designed
by Raymond Floyd, a 35-acre, newly designed practice facility and a newly
constructed clubhouse. Naples Grande Golf Club, which opened in February 2000,
was designed by golf architect Rees Jones. He created an optimum environment for
golfers, relying on the natural surroundings and existing foliage.

CUSTOMERS AND MARKETING

 The core customer base for the Company's business consists of corporate and
other group customers, affluent local residents, upscale leisure travelers and
individual business travelers. The Company's marketing efforts involve (1) use
of a sales force to develop national corporate and other group business for the
resort facilities by focusing on identifying, obtaining and maintaining
corporate and other group accounts whose employees conduct business nationwide,
and (2) the use of advertisements that target individual business travelers and
upscale leisure travelers in magazines such as Conde Nast Traveler, Travel and
Leisure, Travel Weekly and Meetings and Conventions as well as newspapers such
as The New York Times. The Company's franchised resorts also benefit from the
strong distribution resulting from the national reservation systems of the
franchisors of the Hyatt and Radisson brands. The Company continues to focus on
expanding its Internet presence and sales capabilities to increase revenue and
improve customer service. In addition, the Company is enhancing its marketing
efforts by integrating the Company's proprietary customer databases, in order to
sell additional products and services to existing customers, improve occupancy
rates and create additional marketing opportunities.

COMPETITION

 The resort and hotel industry is highly competitive. Competitive factors
include room rates, quality of accommodations, service levels, convenience of
location, reputation, reservation systems, name recognition, and availability of
alternative resort and hotel operations in local markets. While some of the
Company's competitors are private management firms, several are large national
and international chains that own and operate hotels or manage hotels owned by
third parties. A variety of brands compete directly with the Company.

INSURANCE

 The Company maintains comprehensive insurance on its properties, including
liability, business interruption, fire and extended coverage including windstorm
and flood, in the types and amounts management believes are customary for the
resort and hotel industry. Management uses its discretion in determining
amounts, coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance, with a view
to obtaining appropriate insurance on its properties at a reasonable cost and on
suitable terms. This may result in insurance coverage that, in the event of
loss, might not be sufficient to pay the full current market value of the
property. In addition, in the event of such loss, the insurance proceeds
received by the Company might not be adequate to restore its economic position.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations,
an owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or
remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on such real property, as
well as for the costs of complying with environmental laws regulating on-going
operations. In connection with the ownership and operation of its properties,
the Company may be potentially liable for such costs. The Company has obtained
Phase I environmental site assessments for the real property on which each of
the resorts is located. In addition, Phase II environmental assessments have
been conducted at several properties. Phase I assessments are intended to
identify existing, potential and suspected environmental contamination and
regulatory compliance concerns, and generally include historical reviews of the
property, reviews of certain public records, preliminary visual investigations
of the site and surrounding properties and the preparation and issuance of
written reports. Phase II assessments involve the sampling of environmental
media, such as subsurface soil and groundwater, to confirm whether contamination
is present at areas of concern identified during the course of a Phase I
assessment.

 The Phase I and Phase II assessments have not revealed any environmental
liability or compliance concerns that management believes would have a material
adverse effect on the business, nor is management aware of any such material
liability or concern. Phase I and Phase II assessments cannot provide full and
complete knowledge of environmental conditions and compliance matters.
Therefore, management cannot assure you that: (1) material environmental
liabilities or compliance concerns do not exist; (2) an identified matter that
does not appear reasonably likely to be material will not result in
significantly greater expenditures than is currently anticipated; or (3) there
are no material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns of which
management is unaware.

EMPLOYEES

 At June 30, 2001, the Company employed 3,334 full-time and 392 part-time
employees in connection with its leisure and recreation business. In addition,
the Company employs 15 corporate administrative personnel. None of the employees
are subject to any collective bargaining agreement and the Company believes that
its relationship with its employees is good.

SEASONALITY

 The Company's revenue and income are seasonal in nature and are directly
affected by the strength and seasonality of the tourism and leisure industry.
Tourism is dependent upon weather and the traditional seasons for travel.
Because of this variability in demand, the Company's revenue fluctuates
quarter-to-quarter, and
 6
 9

revenue for the first quarter of each year can be expected to be lower than the
remaining quarters. Although historically the trend in quarterly revenue for the
second, third and fourth quarters of each year is generally higher than the
first quarter, there can be no assurance that this will occur in future periods.
Accordingly, quarterly or other interim results should not be considered
indicative of results to be expected for any quarter or for the full year.

TRADEMARKS

 The Company has registered trademarks and service marks, some of which,
including several relating to the Boca Resort name, are of material importance
to the Company's business. The Company's other related marks, while valuable,
are not material to its business. Trademarks are valid as long as they are in
use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been
found to be generic. The Company presently uses two national trade names for two
of its resorts pursuant to licensing arrangements with national franchisors. The
duration for use pursuant to the licensing arrangements is disclosed under
"Franchise Agreement" and "License Agreement."

DISPOSITION OPPORTUNITIES AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

 Management periodically reviews the Company's business with the view to
identifying properties or other assets that no longer complement its operations.
On July 25, 2001, the Company sold its entertainment and sports business after a
thorough examination of its strategic relationship to the core leisure and
recreation operations. The purchase price for the business, which incorporated
certain working capital adjustments, consisted of 83.5 million in cash, an
 11.2 million secured promissory note and the assumption by the purchasers of
certain off-balance sheet contingencies including a 10 million construction
obligation secured by a performance bond. The net proceeds from the sale of the
business after payment of disposal costs and income taxes is estimated to be
between 67.0 million and 69.0 million, and the gain on disposition, which will
be recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2001, is estimated to be
between 23.0 million and 25.0 million. Accordingly, the Company's
entertainment and sports business has been accounted for as discontinued
operations and the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements presented
herein have been restated to report separately the net assets and liabilities
and operating results of this discontinued operation.

 On December 22, 2000, the Company executed a definitive agreement and
closed on the sale of the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa for 335.0 million, plus
certain working capital adjustments. The Company received 283.0 million in
gross cash proceeds and the buyer of the property assumed 59.4 million in
indebtedness. The net proceeds from the asset sale amounted to 279.0 million
and was substantially used to repay indebtedness.

RISK FACTORS

 The business, financial condition, results of operations and future
prospects of the Company, and the prevailing market price and performance of the
Company's Class A Common Stock, may be adversely affected by a number of
factors, including the matters discussed below. Such factors, among other items,
include:

 The Company faces risks relating to travel. The Company's customers
 consist of corporate and other group customers, upscale leisure travelers
 and individual business travelers, many of which are dependent upon
 commercial airlines as a primary means of transportation. A change in
 travel patterns resulting from slowing economic conditions, a change in
 corporate policies relating to group meetings, air or other travel
 disruption, third party increases in travel costs or disruption caused by
 natural disaster, war or political unrest could have a material adverse
 effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

 The Company faces a variety of risks associated with operating
 resorts. The Company may encounter risks common to the operations of
 resorts, including over-building (which may lower room rates), increases in
 operating costs due to inflation or other factors and decreases in revenue
 due to moderate or severe economic downturns. The Company may also face
 risks relating to the concentration
 7
 10

 of the resorts in South Florida. Any of these risks could have a material
 adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of
 operations.

 The Company may make significant capital expenditures to further
 develop the resorts and these expenditures involve risks. The Company's
 growth strategy contemplates expanding the infrastructure at certain of its
 resorts or expanding its presence within one or more markets. The resorts
 may also need periodic renovations or other capital improvements to keep
 them well maintained and competitive. Unexpected excessive costs of any
 expansion or needed renovation or capital improvements could have a
 material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of
 operations. Also, any capital expenditure for expansion, renovation or
 improvement of the resorts may not generate the financial returns expected.
 Such capital expenditures could involve certain risks, including the
 possibility of environmental problems; the possibility that cash to fund
 renovations will not be available or that financing for renovations will
 not be available on favorable terms; uncertainties as to market demand or
 deterioration in market demand after commencement of renovations; the
 emergence of unanticipated zoning and regulatory requirements; so called
 "acts of God" such as hurricanes that could adversely impact a project and
 competition from other resorts, hotels and alternative lodging facilities.

 The Company may need to make substantial capital expenditures in order
 to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The resorts and other
 properties are subject to the requirements of the Americans with
 Disabilities Act (the "ADA"), which generally requires that public
 accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons. Management believes
 that the resorts and other properties are in substantial compliance with
 the ADA and that the Company will not be required to make substantial
 capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However,
 compliance with the ADA could require removal of access barriers and
 noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal
 government or the award of damages to private litigants. If the Company
 were required to make substantial alterations in one or more of the resorts
 or the other properties in order to comply with the ADA, it's financial
 condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

 The Company may become subject to liabilities under environmental
 laws. Operating costs may be affected by the obligation to pay for the
 cost of complying with existing environmental laws, ordinances and
 regulations, including the cleanup of contamination, as well as the cost of
 complying with future legislation. In connection with the acquisition of
 the resorts and other properties, Phase I, and in some instances Phase II,
 environmental site assessments were obtained in order to evaluate potential
 environmental liabilities at these properties. Although these assessments
 have identified certain matters that will require the Company to incur
 costs to remedy, based on current information, none of these matters
 appears likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets,
 results of operations or liquidity. However, because these assessments
 cannot give full and complete knowledge of environmental liability and
 compliance matters, management cannot assure you that the costs of
 complying with environmental laws and of defending against claims of
 liability arising under environmental laws will not have a material adverse
 effect on the financial condition and results of operations.

 The Company's resort business is seasonal. The resort operations are
 generally seasonal. The resorts historically experience greater revenue,
 costs and profits in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year ended
 June 30 due to increased occupancy and room rates during the winter months.

 The Company competes for customers. The hotel and leisure industry is
 highly competitive. The Company's properties compete for customers with
 other hotel and resort properties, and, with respect to its Premier Club,
 with other operators of social clubs and golf courses. Some of the
 Company's competitors may have substantially greater marketing and
 financial resources and they may improve their facilities, reduce their
 prices or expand or improve their marketing programs in ways that adversely
 affect the Company's operating results.

 The Company's financing agreements limit operating flexibility.
 Certain of the Company's loan agreements restrict, among other things,
 the ability to borrow money; pay dividends on stock or make certain other
 restricted payments; use assets as security in other transactions; make
 investments; enter into certain transactions with the affiliates; and sell
 certain assets or merge with other companies. These
 8
 11

 debt instruments also require the Company to maintain specified
 consolidated financial ratios and satisfy certain consolidated financial
 tests. Although management is confident that the Company will satisfy all
 of these requirements, the Company's ability to meet those financial ratios
 and financial tests may be affected by events beyond its control, and
 management cannot assure you that the Company will meet those tests.

 Control by H. Wayne Huizenga. The Company has two classes of common
 stock, Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. On each matter
 submitted for stockholder approval each share of Class A Common Stock is
 entitled to one vote, and each share of Class B Common Stock is entitled to
 10,000 votes. As of June 30, 2001, Mr. Huizenga, the Company's Chairman,
 beneficially owned voting stock of the Company with the power to vote
 approximately 98.5 of the total votes entitled to be cast on any matter
 submitted to a vote of stockholders. As the sole owner of Class B Common
 Stock, Mr. Huizenga has the ability to indirectly control the management
 and policies as well as the outcome of substantially all non-extraordinary
 matters submitted to the stockholders for approval, including the election
 of directors.

 Nothing in the charter or bylaws restricts the transfer of Class B
 Common Stock. As a result, Mr. Huizenga may sell his controlling interest
 without the approval of the holders of Class A Common Stock and Mr.
 Huizenga may receive a substantial premium price for selling his
 controlling interest in the Company.

 The Company depends on key personnel. For the foreseeable future, the
 Company will be materially dependent on the services of Mr. Huizenga. The
 loss of Mr. Huizenga's services could have a material adverse effect on the
 business. The Company does not carry key man life insurance on Mr. Huizenga
 or on any of the officers or directors.

 The Company may face a variety of risks if it enters into business
 acquisitions, joint ventures and/or divestitures in the future. The
 Company may pursue acquisitions of resort-related or other types of
 businesses. In addition, the Company may pursue joint ventures and/or
 divestitures in the future. The Company's success will depend upon the
 ability to identify and finance attractive alternative business
 acquisitions, ventures and/or divestitures. The risks related to
 acquisitions, joint ventures and/or divestitures include: potential
 diversion of management; unanticipated liabilities or contingencies from
 acquired businesses or ventures; environmental and other regulatory costs;
 suitability of a joint venture partner; increased interest costs and costs
 related to integration of acquisitions; integrating the businesses that the
 Company acquires; need to manage growth of acquired businesses or joint
 ventures; potential corporate reorganization and reallocation of resources
 due to divestitures and potential one-time losses on divestitures.

 The Company may seek additional financing. Management believes that
 the cash flow from operations, together with cash received from the sale of
 the entertainment and sports business, will be sufficient to finance the
 business operations, meet the debt obligations and fund the short-term
 growth strategy of the Company. However, management cannot assure you that
 the business will generate the level of cash flow from operations that it
 expects or that future borrowings under credit facilities will be available
 to the Company. If the plans or assumptions change or if the Company
 experiences unanticipated costs or competitive pressures, or if the Company
 cannot reduce its cost of borrowing or increase its borrowing base it may
 seek additional capital. Management believes the Company can obtain
 additional capital by selling debt (provided certain incurrence tests are
 met pursuant to existing debt agreements) or equity securities and/or by
 borrowing money, although no assurances can be provided that it will be
 able to do so. If additional capital is not obtained when it is needed,
 this may have a material adverse effect on the Company.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

 The Company's corporate headquarters are located at the Boca Raton Resort
and Club. The Company considers its resorts to be leading establishments with
respect to desirability of location, size of facilities, physical condition,
quality and variety of services offered in the areas in which they are located.

description of properties under "Business". Certain of the Company's resorts
serve as security under a revolving credit facility. See Note 8 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 The Company is not involved in any material legal proceedings. However, the
Company may from time to time become a party to legal proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business, which are incidental to its business.

 Since its inception, the Company has not paid any cash dividends on the
Class A Common Stock or the Class B Common Stock. The Company does not intend to
pay any cash dividends with respect to its common stock in the foreseeable
future. Certain of the Company's credit facilities restrict the ability of the
Company to pay dividends. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

 The financial data set forth below should be read in conjunction with the
Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto contained in Part
II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On July 25, 2001, the Company
sold its entertainment and sports business, which primarily consisted of the
operations of the Florida Panthers Hockey Club and related arena management
operations. Accordingly, the Company's entertainment and sports business has
been accounted for as discontinued operations and the accompanying selected
financial data has been restated to report separately the net assets and
operating results of this discontinued operation.

(1) The Company acquired substantially all of its properties comprising the
 leisure and recreation business during fiscal 1997 and 1998.
(2) EBITDA represents earnings before interest expense, interest income, income
 taxes, depreciation, amortization, extraordinary items and discontinued
 operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (see below) are used by management
 and certain investors as indicators of the Company's historical ability to
 service debt, to sustain potential future increases in debt and to satisfy
 capital requirements. However, neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is
 intended to represent cash flows for the period. In addition, they have not
 been presented as alternatives to either (a) operating income (as determined
 by GAAP) as an indicator of operating performance or (b) cash flows from
 operating, investing and financing activities (as determined by GAAP) and
 are thus susceptible to varying calculations. EBITDA as presented may not be
 comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
(3) Represents the annual change in deferred revenue from the Company's Premier
 Clubs. The Premier Clubs currently require a non-refundable initial
 membership fee. Initial membership fees are recorded as revenue over the
 estimated life of the membership. Unrecognized portions of the initial
 membership fees are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying
 Consolidated Balance Sheets.
(4) Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the amount of the Company's Premier
 Club net membership fees deferred during the period.
(5) EBITDA margin is defined as EBITDA divided by revenue.
(6) Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by the sum of
 revenue plus the Company's Premier Club net membership fees deferred during
 the period.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto of the Company, which are
included elsewhere herein.

PRO FORMA RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 The accompanying tables and associated discussion are set forth on a pro
forma basis, which excludes the operating results from the Arizona Biltmore
Resort & Spa which was sold in December 2000 and the entertainment and sports
business which was sold in July 2001 and gives effect to the application of the
related proceeds as if such assets were sold at the beginning of each period
presented. Management believes the pro forma data provides a more meaningful
comparison of the periods presented.

PRO FORMA BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

 The accompanying table outlines pro forma operating data for the year ended
June 30 (in 000's) as adjusted to exclude the operating results from the Arizona

SEASONALITY

 The resort operations are generally seasonal. The resorts historically
experience greater revenue, costs and profits in the second and third quarters
of the fiscal year ended June 30 due to increased occupancy and room rates
during the winter months.

 14
 17

IMPACT OF INFLATION

 Inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on the
Company's revenue and results of operations. Based on the current economic
climate, the Company does not expect that inflation and changing prices will
have a material impact on the Company's revenue or earnings during fiscal 2002.
Many of the costs of operating the resorts can be fixed for certain periods of
time, reducing the short-term effects of changes in the rate of inflation. Room
rates, which are set on a daily basis, can be rapidly changed to meet changes in
inflation rates (as well as other changing market conditions). The Company has
less flexibility in changing group rates since guest reservations are typically
made 12 to 36 months in advance of the stay. To the extent inflationary trends
affect short-term interest rates, a portion of the Company's debt service costs
may be adversely affected. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CONSOLIDATED PRO FORMA RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 Pro forma income from continuing operations before income taxes was 32.5
million, and 26.4 million and 28.7 million during the years ended June 30,
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

 The increases in pro forma income from continuing operations before income
taxes during the year ended June 30, 2001 over the prior years was primarily due
to improved leisure and recreation business operating results arising from
higher revenue and slightly improved profit margins, partially offset by an
increase in depreciation expense. Specifically, both consolidated EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA margins improved two percentage points during the year ended
June 30, 2001 compared to the year ended June 30, 2000 because of growth in
revenue and certain efficiencies in direct room labor costs. Additional
information relating to the operating results of the Company's business is set
forth below.

 Select pro forma operating data for the Company's leisure and recreation
business for the year ended June 30 is set forth below (in 000's except
operating statistics):

2001 CHG. 2000 CHG. 1999

 Total leisure and recreation revenue
 per available room.................. 353.97 8 326.58 5 309.92

PRO FORMA REVENUE

 Pro forma leisure and recreation revenue totaled 289.3 million, 267.7
million and 253.4 million during the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The leisure and recreation business generates a diversified stream
of revenue. Pro forma non-room revenue, which represented over 56 of leisure
and recreation revenue for each period presented, was derived from sources such
as food and beverage sales, yachting and marina revenue, golf revenue, club
membership fees and dues, retail sales and other resort amenities. The increase
in non-room revenue during the year ended June 30, 2001 over the year ended June
30, 2000 and 1999 was primarily associated with increases in golf related
revenue at Naples Grande and Grande Oaks Golf Clubs. As outlined above, the
resort portfolio also yielded increases in the average daily room rate ("ADR")
and occupancy during the year ended June 30, 2001 compared to the prior year
periods. Increases to ADR and occupancy were primarily attributable to an
expanded amenity base at the Company's resorts coupled with certain room
renovations. The decrease in available rooms nights during the year ended

 15
 18

June 30, 2001 versus the prior year period was primarily because the prior year
period included one additional room night due to leap year.

PRO FORMA OPERATING EXPENSES

 Pro forma cost of leisure and recreation services totaled 126.9 million,
or 44 of pro forma revenue, during the year ended June 30, 2001, compared to
 121.1 million, or 45 of pro forma revenue, during the year ended June 30, 2000
and 113.0 million, or 45 of pro forma revenue, during the year ended June 30,
1999. Pro forma cost of services, as a percent of pro forma revenue, decreased
during the year ended June 30, 2001 compared to the prior year periods primarily
because of an increase in ADR together with room labor cost efficiencies.

 Pro forma selling, general and administrative expenses ("S,G&A") of the
leisure and recreation business totaled 70.8 million, 66.0 million and 63.7
million during the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and
was 25 of pro forma revenue for each of the periods presented despite an
increase in energy and insurance during the year ended June 30, 2001. Pro forma
S,G&A of the leisure and recreation business includes, among other items,
administrative payroll costs, selling and marketing expenses, energy and
property costs, insurance, real estate taxes, franchise agreement fees and other
administrative expenses.

 Pro forma amortization and depreciation expense for the leisure and
recreation business totaled 30.7 million, 25.6 million and 21.1 million
during the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase
during the year ended June 30, 2001 compared to the year ended June 30, 2000 was
primarily due to the completion of several capital projects at the Boca Raton
Resort and Club and Registry Resort resulting in additional depreciation
expense. The increase during the year ended June 30, 2000 compared to the year
ended June 30, 1999 was primarily due to the completion of Naples Grande and
Grande Oaks Golf Clubs and several capital projects at the Boca Raton Resort and
Club.

PRO FORMA OPERATING INCOME

 Pro forma operating income for the leisure and recreation business totaled
 61.0 million, 55.1 million and 55.6 million during the years ended June 30,
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in pro forma operating income
during the year ended June 30, 2001 compared to the year ended June 30, 2000 was
primarily the result of an increase in revenue and profit margins, partially
offset by additional depreciation expense associated with recently completed
capital projects. While revenue and gross profits increased during the year
ended June 30, 2000 over the year ended June 30, 1999, a larger increase in
depreciation expense caused a decrease in operating income.

PRO FORMA CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

 Pro forma corporate general and administrative expenses totaled 8.2
million, 8.5 million and 7.8 million during the years ended June 30, 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. Pro forma corporate general and administrative
expenses decreased during the year ended June 30, 2001 because certain
non-recurring legal fees were incurred during the year ended June 30, 2000.

PRO FORMA INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME

 Pro forma interest and other income totaled 9.2 million, 7.3 million and
 6.1 million during the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The increase in pro forma interest and other income during the year ended June
30, 2001 compared to the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 was primarily
because of higher interest-bearing cash balances on hand throughout the 2001
period.

PRO FORMA INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE

 Pro forma interest and other expense totaled 29.1 million, 27.4 million
and 25.1 million during the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Pro forma interest and other expense relates to the remaining
outstanding 273.0 principal amount of 9.875 Senior Subordinated Notes, an
unused fee equal to

 16
 19

 .5 on the Company's 146.0 million secured revolving credit facility and
amortization of related debt issuance costs, offset by capitalized interest. The
change in pro forma interest and other expense during the periods presented was
primarily the result of fluctuations in the amount of capitalized interest on
qualifying projects. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included later herein.

PRO FORMA EBITDA

 Pro forma EBITDA represents earnings before extraordinary items, interest
expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and discontinued
operations. Pro forma EBITDA totaled 83.4 million, 72.1 million and 68.9
million during the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The
increase in pro forma EBITDA during the year ended June 30, 2001 over the prior
year periods was primarily due to an increase in revenue and profit margins. See
discussion of business segment financial performance above for additional
information on comparative operating results. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (see
below) are used by management and certain investors as indicators of the
Company's historical ability to service debt, to sustain potential future
increases in debt and to satisfy capital requirements. However, neither EBITDA
nor Adjusted EBITDA is intended to represent cash flows for the period. In
addition, they have not been presented as alternatives to either (a) operating
income (as determined by GAAP) as an indicator of operating performance or (b)
cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities (as determined by
GAAP) and are thus susceptible to varying calculations. EBITDA as presented may
not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

PRO FORMA ADJUSTED EBITDA

 Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the amount of net
membership fees deferred during the periods presented. The net membership fees
deferred represents the annual change in deferred revenue arising from the
Premier Clubs at the Boca Raton Resort and Club, Naples Grande and Grande Oaks
Golf Clubs. Net memberships deferred totaled 11.8 million, 12.5 million and
 8.2 million during the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The Company opened Naples Grande Golf Club in February 2000, which resulted in
strong introductory membership sales during the year ended June 30, 2000.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND DIVESTITURES

 The Company sold its entertainment and sports business in July 2001.
Accordingly, the operations have been accounted for as discontinued operations.
The loss from discontinued operations was 8.9 million, 3.8 million and
 436,000, for the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The
figures for the year ended June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2000 are net of a 5.4
million and 805,000 benefit for income taxes, respectively. The figure for the
year ended June 30, 1999 is net of a provision for income taxes of 328,000. The
decrease in operating results before income taxes during the periods presented
was primarily due to a decline in average paid attendance at Panther home games
and higher players' salaries.

 The Company sold the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa in December 2000.
Operating income for the period in which the Company owned the resort during
fiscal 2001 (July 1, 2000 through December 21, 2000) totaled 8.0 million.
Operating income totaled 25.1 million and 14.6 million during the years ended
June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

 A portion of the Company's interest expense has been allocated to
discontinued operations based upon its average borrowing cost and the average
funds the discontinued operations borrowed from the parent. A portion of the
Company's interest expense has been allocated to the Arizona Biltmore Resort &
Spa based upon the debt balance attributable to it operations. Certain selling,
general and administrative expenses incurred by the Company have been allocated
to discontinued operations and the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa based upon the
specific identification method.

IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

 Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business
Combinations" prohibits the pooling method of accounting for business
combinations and requires business combinations to be accounted
 17
 20

for using the purchase method of accounting. The requirements of this statement
should be applied to business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The
Company believes the adoption of SFAS No. 141 will not have a material impact on
its results of operations or financial position.

 SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" addresses financial
accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and
supercedes APB Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets". SFAS No. 142 addresses how
intangible assets that are acquired individually, or with a group of assets,
should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition. It also
addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after
they have been initially recognized in the financial statements. Under SFAS No.
142, goodwill shall not be amortized. Goodwill shall be tested for impairment at
a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit. If the carrying amount of
reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an
impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The
provisions of this statement are required to be applied starting with fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2001. Early adoption is permitted for
entities with fiscal years beginning after March 15, 2001, provided that the
first interim financial statements have not previously been issued. This
statement is required to be applied at the beginning of an entity's fiscal year
and to be applied to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in its
financial statements at that date. Impairment losses for goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets that arise due to the initial application of
this statement (resulting from a transitional impairment test) are to be
reported as resulting from a change in accounting principle. The Company is
currently evaluating whether it will early adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 142
and will not be able to determine the ultimate impact of this statement on its
results of operations or financial position until such time as the Company
applies its provisions. Amortization of goodwill totaled 1.7 million for the
year ended June 30, 2001, however, this is not intended to be indicative of the
expected impact on the Company's future results of operations.

 SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" addresses
financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs. SFAS No. 143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company believes the adoption of SFAS
No. 143 will not have a material impact on its results of operations or
financial position and will adopt such standards on July 1, 2002, as required.

LIQUIDITY

 Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents increased to 9.9 million at June
30, 2001, from 7.8 million at June 30, 2000 and 7.9 million at June 30, 1999.
The major components of the change are discussed below.

 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

 Net cash provided by operating activities totaled 37.0 million, 40.0
million and 71.6 million during the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The decrease in cash flow from operations during the year ended
June 30, 2001 compared to the year ended June 30, 2000 was primarily the result
of an increase of 9.8 million in income taxes paid, partially offset by an
increase in cash derived from the leisure and recreation business. The income
taxes paid during 2001 included certain estimated quarterly tax payments for
fiscal 2001 as well as actual income taxes incurred for fiscal 2000. Income
taxes paid for fiscal 1999 were nominal because the Company had available net
operating losses to offset taxable income for that year. The decrease in cash
flow from operations during the year ended June 30, 2000 compared to the year
ended June 30, 1999 was due to a combination of factors including having an
increase in accounts receivable for the leisure and recreation business due to
the timing of collection on certain group contracts and incurring an increase in
cash paid for certain corporate professional fees (a significant portion of such
professional fees were accrued but unpaid as of June 30, 1999).

 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities

 Net cash provided by investing activities amounted to 222.3 million during
the year ended June 30, 2001 compared to cash used in investing activities of
 36.9 million and 115.4 million during the years ended

 18
 21

June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The significant change was primarily the
result of the sale of the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa during the year ended
June 30, 2001, which yielded net proceeds to the Company of 279.0 million.

 Capital expenditures totaled 60.8 million, 63.1 million and 98.5 million
during the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. During the
year ended June 30, 2001, capital spending at the Boca Raton Resort and Club
commenced on new projects including an eight-story marina wing complex
consisting of 112 water-view luxury guestrooms, a spa complex, a golf clubhouse
and marina slips, as well as continued spending on room renovations, with 80 of
the guestrooms completed. In addition, at the Boca Raton Resort and Club the
Company completed a new Tuscan style restaurant and retail pavilion, which
opened in November 2000. During the year ended June 30, 2001, the Company also
completed a new pool/aquatic center, 6,000 square feet of additional conference
space and enhancements to the beach facility and boardwalk at the Registry
Resort and renovated its 296 guestrooms at the Bahia Mar Resort and Yachting
Center.

 During the year ended June 30, 2000, capital spending primarily related to
the construction of a guest parking facility and commencement of a luxury
guestroom renovation at the Boca Raton Resort and Club, golf related
improvements at the Naples Grande golf course and the acquisition of commercial
property located near the Company's Fort Lauderdale resorts.

 During the year ended June 30, 1999, capital spending related to continued
development and construction at Grande Oaks Golf Club, continued construction of
a 120 guestroom addition at the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa, the acquisition
of land in Naples and Plantation, Florida and other recurring furniture, fixture
and equipment improvements at the resorts.

 Restricted cash totaled 500,000, 10.2 million and 31.7 million at June
30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The change in restricted cash primarily
related to escrow accounts maintained in accordance with the terms of
mortgage-note agreements, which notes were subsequently paid by the Company.

 Cash used in investing activities from discontinued operations totaled 2.3
million during the year ended June 30, 2001 and 3.5 million during the year
ended June 30, 1999. Cash provided by investing activities from discontinued
operations totaled 8.7 million during the year ended June 30, 2000 and included
a 10.5 million termination fee pursuant to the termination of the Miami Arena
Contract, a portion of which was paid to vendors and outside minority interest
holders. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included later
herein.

 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities

 Net cash used in financing activities totaled 257.3 million and 3.2
million during the years ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net cash
provided by financing activities totaled 19.6 million during the year ended
June 30, 1999. Cash flows for each period primarily represent borrowings under
credit facilities, net of the repayment of indebtedness (including the
repurchase of senior subordinated notes) and sales/repurchases of Class A Common
Stock. During the year ended June 30, 2001 a substantial amount of indebtedness
was repaid, and Class A Common Stock repurchased, using a portion of the
proceeds from the sale of the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

 The Company's capital resources are provided from both internal and
external sources. The primary capital resources from internal operations include
(1) room rentals, food and beverage sales, retail sales, golf revenue, tennis
revenue, marina and conference services at the resorts and (2) Premier Club
memberships. The primary external sources of liquidity have been the issuance of
debt securities and borrowing under term loans and credit lines.

 As of August 31, 2001, the Company had immediate availability of 144.7
million under its revolving credit line, which matures in April 2002. While
management expects to renew/replace its existing revolving credit line upon
maturity, no assurances can be given that management will be successful in doing
so. As a result of the current availability under this credit line, combined
with cash on hand due to the sale of the
 19
 22

entertainment and sports business in July 2001 which is estimated to be between
 67.0 million and 69.0 million and expected cash from operations, management
believes the Company has sufficient funds to continue its capital maintenance
and expansion plans and support on-going operations, including meeting debt
service obligations as they come due.

WORKING CAPITAL

 Current assets exceeded current liabilities by 45.5 million at June 30,
2001. Current liabilities exceeded current assets by 28.3 million at June 30,
2000. The improvement from June 30, 2000 to June 30, 2001 was primarily because
the Company sold the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa and received net proceeds of
 279.0 million. A portion of such proceeds was used to repay indebtedness.

RECENT EVENTS

 On September 11, 2001, there were terrorist attacks on New York's two World
Trade Center towers as well as the Pentagon, which involved the hijacking of
four U.S. commercial aircraft. Management is currently evaluating the impact of
these events on its near-term results of operations and financial condition.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders of Boca Resorts, Inc.:

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boca
Resorts, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2001 and
2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Boca Resorts, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of June 30, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 JUNE 30, 2001

1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS

 Boca Resorts, Inc. (the "Company") is an owner and operator of five luxury
resorts located in Florida with hotels, conference facilities, golf courses,
spas, marinas and private clubs. The Company's resorts include the Boca Raton
Resort and Club (Boca Raton), the Registry Resort at Pelican Bay (Naples), the
Edgewater Beach Hotel (Naples), the Hyatt Regency Pier 66 Hotel and Marina (Fort
Lauderdale), and the Radisson Bahia Mar Resort and Yachting Center (Fort
Lauderdale). The Company also owns and operates two championship golf courses
located in Florida, Grande Oaks Golf Club in Davie and Naples Grande Golf Club
in Naples.

 As discussed in Note 5, the Company sold the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa
on December 22, 2000. In addition, on July 25, 2001, the Company sold its
entertainment and sports business, which primarily consisted of the operations
of the Florida Panthers Hockey Club (the "Panthers") and related arena
management operations. Accordingly, the Company's entertainment and sports
business has been accounted for as discontinued operations and the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein have been restated to report
separately the net assets and operating results of this discontinued operation.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 Principles of Consolidation

 The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after the elimination of
significant intercompany accounts and transactions.

 Use of Estimates

 The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. Actual results may
differ from those estimates.

 Cash and Cash Equivalents/Restricted Cash

 Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash in banks and highly
liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. At June 30,
2001, restricted cash consisted of purchased guarantees (letters of credit) that
ensure the Company's payment to third parties under certain lease agreements. At
June 30, 2000, restricted cash primarily consisted of escrow accounts maintained
in accordance with the terms of mortgage-note agreements, which notes were
subsequently paid by the Company. Concentration of credit risk and market risk
associated with cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are considered low
due to the credit quality of the issuers of the financial instruments held by
the Company and due to their short-term nature.

 Accounts Receivable

 Accounts receivable are primarily from major credit card companies and
other large corporations. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
significant customers and generally does not require collateral or a significant
allowance for uncollectible balances.

 Inventory

 Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value and primarily
consists of food, beverages, marina fuel, retail merchandise and operating
supplies. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method.

 BOCA RESORTS, INC.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

 Premier Club Notes Receivable

 Premier Club notes receivable are carried at cost. The accrual of interest
income is suspended on all notes receivable when principal or interest payments
are more than three months contractually past due and is not resumed until such
loans become contractually current. The amount of loans more than three months
contractually past due was not material at June 30, 2001. The Company performs
credit evaluations of customers who finance their Premier Club membership and
generally does not require additional security or establish a significant
allowance for uncollectible balances.

 Property and Equipment

 Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and renewals of relatively
minor items are charged to expense as incurred. Significant additions, along
with interest incurred during the construction period for expansion at the
Company's resorts, are capitalized. Interest has been capitalized using the
average borrowing rate of the Company. Interest capitalized for the years ended
June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999 totaled 1.1 million, 2.8 million and 5.2
million, respectively. Depreciation and amortization has been computed using the
straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

YEARS
 -----
 
Building and improvements................................... 40
Land improvements........................................... 15
Leasehold improvements...................................... 5-20
Furniture, fixtures and equipment........................... 3-7

Debt Issuance Costs

 Costs associated with obtaining financing have been capitalized and are
amortized on a straight-line basis (which approximates the effective interest
method) over the terms of the related debt. Debt issuance costs are included in
other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Intangible Assets

 Intangible assets consist of goodwill, which represents the excess of the
cost over the fair value of net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is
stated at amortized cost and is amortized on a straight-line basis over 40
years. Accumulated amortization at June 30, 2001 and 2000 totaled 3.6 million
and 4.4 million, respectively. The Company continually evaluates whether events
and changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives or
recognition of an impairment loss of unamortized goodwill. The conditions that
would trigger an impairment assessment of unamortized goodwill include a
significant negative trend in the Company's operating results or cash flows, a
decrease in demand for the Company's services, change in the competitive
environment and other industry and economic factors. The Company measures
impairment of unamortized goodwill utilizing the discounted cash flow method.
The present value of those estimated cash flows is then compared to the
Company's net book value; if the book value exceeds the present value of those
cash flows, the excess of the unamortized goodwill is written off. The discount
rate used in determining the present value of those cash flows would be based on
the Company's weighted average cost of capital commensurate with the risk
involved. As of June 30, 2001, the Company determined that there has been no
impairment of goodwill.

 Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

 The carrying value of long-lived assets is reviewed if the facts and
circumstances suggest that it may be impaired. If this review indicates that
long-lived assets will not be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash

 28
 31
 BOCA RESORTS, INC.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

flows of the entity acquired over the remaining amortization period, the
carrying value of the long-lived assets will be reduced by the amount by which
the carrying value exceeds fair value. Fair value is determined using
management's best estimate of the discounted net operating cash flows over the
remaining life of the assets.

 Financial Instruments

 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 107, "Disclosures
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments" requires disclosure of the fair value
of financial instruments held by the Company. The carrying amounts of cash and
cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
short-term debt approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The
carrying amounts of Premier Club notes receivable and long-term debt
approximates fair value based on discounted future cash flows. The carrying
amount of the Company's senior subordinated notes payable is 273.0 million,
compared to an estimated fair value of 276.9 million, which is based on the
quoted market price as of June 30, 2001 in the over-the-counter bond market. The
fair value of Premier Club refundable membership fees cannot be reasonably
estimated based on the uncertainty of the maturity.

 Revenue Recognition

 Revenue associated with room rentals, food and beverage sales and other
recreational amenity use at the Company's resort properties is recognized when
services are rendered. Deferred revenue arises as a normal part of business for
advance payments for resort accommodations, club membership dues and club
initiation fees. Annual membership dues from the Company's Premier Clubs are
recognized ratably over the membership year. Initiation fees associated with
Premier Club memberships originating after December 31, 1997 are non-refundable
and are deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated life of the
membership. Initiation fees relating to club memberships originating prior to
December 31, 1997 are fully refundable and, accordingly, are reflected as a
liability captioned Premier Club refundable membership fees in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 10.

 Advertising Expense

 The Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising takes
place. Advertising expense was 5.3 million, 7.0 million and 6.4 million for
the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Prepaid advertising
for each of the periods presented was not material.

 Costs of Start-Up Activities

 Pre-operating, pre-opening, research and development and organization costs
are expensed as incurred.

 Income Taxes

 The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method
in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". See Note 15.

 Stock-Based Compensation

 The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees
with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of
grant. The Company has elected to account for stock option grants in accordance
with APB No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and as interpreted in
FASB Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation" and, accordingly, recognizes no compensation expense in connection
with stock option grants made to employees. See Note 11.

 Earnings Per Common Share

 SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share" requires a dual presentation of basic
and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share equals net income
divided by the number of weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted
earnings per share includes the effects of common stock equivalents to the
extent they are dilutive. Warrants totaling 325,000 for both the years ended
June 30, 2001 and 2000 were antidilutive and have been excluded. Warrants
totaling 1,259,905 for the year ended June 30, 1999 were antidilutive and have
been excluded. Options totaling 5,513,553, 5,135,273 and 4,357,476 for the years
ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, were antidilutive and have
been excluded. The following table sets forth weighted average shares used to
compute basic and diluted earnings per share (in 000's):

2001 2000 1999
 ------ ------ ------
 
Basic weighted average shares outstanding................... 40,317 40,861 36,993
Stock options............................................... 641 7 153
 ------ ------ ------
Diluted weighted average shares outstanding................. 40,958 40,868 37,146
 ====== ====== ======

Shareholders' Equity

 The Company has two classes of common stock, Class A Common Stock and Class
B Common Stock. On each matter submitted for stockholder approval each share of
Class A Common Stock is entitled to one vote, and each share of Class B Common
Stock is entitled to 10,000 votes.

 In connection with the acquisition of the Boca Raton Resort and Club, the
Company issued rights to the predecessor owners of the property entitling them
to acquire 4,242,586 shares of Class A Common Stock at any time up through April
30, 2001 for no additional consideration. All such shares were reflected as
issued in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2000
because the Company believed it was probable that all predecessor owners would
exchange their interests for freely tradable Class A Common Stock of the
Company. However, at June 30, 2001, shareholders' equity has been reduced to
exclude the 447,892 expired, unexercised exchange rights. Upon issuance of the
shares relating to rights that were exercised, the tax effect of the book-tax
bases difference resulting from the exchange is reflected as an adjustment to
contributed capital in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Shareholders'
Equity.

 Treasury Stock

 In May 2001, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase
program authorizing the Company to purchase up to 30 million of its outstanding
Class A Common Stock over the ensuing 24 months. As of June 30, 2001, the
Company had repurchased 592,766 shares of Class A Common Stock for 6.8 million.
The Company accounts for repurchases of its Class A Common Stock using the cost
method with common stock in treasury classified in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets as a reduction of shareholders' equity.

 Comprehensive Income

 Comprehensive income was the same as net income for the years ended June
30, 2001, 2000 and 1999.

 Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

 SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" prohibits the pooling method of
accounting for business combinations and requires business combinations to be
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The requirements of this
statement should be applied to business combinations initiated after June 30,
2001. The Company believes the adoption of SFAS No. 141 will not have a material
impact on its results of operations or financial position.

 30
 33
 BOCA RESORTS, INC.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

 SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" addresses financial
accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and
supercedes APB Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets". SFAS No. 142 addresses how
intangible assets that are acquired individually, or with a group of assets,
should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition. It also
addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after
they have been initially recognized in the financial statements. Under SFAS No.
142, goodwill shall not be amortized. Goodwill shall be tested for impairment at
a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit. If the carrying amount of
reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an
impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The
provisions of this statement are required to be applied starting with fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2001. Early adoption is permitted for
entities with fiscal years beginning after March 15, 2001, provided that the
first interim financial statements have not previously been issued. This
statement is required to be applied at the beginning of an entity's fiscal year
and to be applied to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in its
financial statements at that date. Impairment losses for goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets that arise due to the initial application of
this statement (resulting from a transitional impairment test) are to be
reported as resulting from a change in accounting principle. The Company is
currently evaluating whether it will early adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 142
and will not be able to determine the ultimate impact of this statement on its
results of operations or financial position until such time as the Company
applies its provisions. Amortization of goodwill totaled 1.7 million for the
year ended June 30, 2001, however, this is not intended to be indicative of the
expected impact on the Company's future results of operations.

 SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" addresses
financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs. SFAS No. 143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company believes the adoption of SFAS
No. 143 will not have a material impact on its results of operations or
financial position and will adopt such standards on July 1, 2002, as required.

3. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION

 Interest and Income Taxes Paid

 Interest paid totaled 48.3 million, 53.1 million and 51.1 million during
the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Income taxes paid
totaled 9.9 million, 54,000 and 380,000 during the years ended June 30, 2001,
2000 and 1999 respectively. The income taxes paid during 2001 included certain
estimated quarterly tax payments for fiscal 2001 as well as actual income taxes
incurred for fiscal 2000. The income taxes paid for fiscal 1999 were nominal
because the Company had available net operating losses to offset taxable income
for that year. See Note 15.

 Non-Cash Investing and Financing Activities

 The Company sold the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa in December 2000. In
connection with such transaction, the buyer of the property assumed indebtedness
totaling 59.4 million. The Company issued shares of Class A Common Stock
totaling 50,000 (which were valued at 539,000) and 62,830 (which were valued at
 550,000) in connection with business acquisitions during the years ended June
30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

5. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND DIVESTITURE

 On July 25, 2001, the Company sold its entertainment and sports business.
The purchase price for the business, which incorporated certain working capital
adjustments, consisted of 83.5 million in cash, an 11.2 million secured
promissory note and the assumption by the purchasers of certain off-balance
sheet contingencies including a 10 million construction obligation secured by a
performance bond. The net proceeds from the sale of the business after payment
of disposal costs and income taxes is estimated to be between 67.0 million and
 69.0 million, and the gain on disposition, which will be recorded during the
three months ended September 30, 2001, is estimated to be between 23.0 million
and 25.0 million. Accordingly, the Company's entertainment and sports business
has been accounted for as discontinued operations and the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein have been restated to report
separately the net assets and operating results of this discontinued operation.
Operating losses totaling 2.9 million from the measurement date through June
30, 2001 have been deferred and will be recognized during the quarter ended
September 30, 2001 (the quarter in which the gain on sale is recognized). A
portion of the Company's interest expense has been allocated to discontinued
operations based upon its average borrowing cost and the average funds the
discontinued operations borrowed from the parent. Certain selling, general and
administrative expenses incurred by the Company have been allocated to
discontinued operations based upon the specific identification method. Summary
operating results of the discontinued operations for the year ended June 30 are
as follows (in 000's):

On December 22, 2000, the Company executed a definitive agreement and
closed on the sale of the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa for 335.0 million, plus
certain working capital adjustments. The Company received 283.0 million in
gross cash proceeds and the buyer of the property assumed 59.4 million in
indebtedness. The net proceeds from the asset sale amounted to 279.0 million
and was substantially used to repay indebtedness. The gain on the asset sale was
nominal. The Company is contingently liable for certain litigation relating to
the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa. While the results of such proceedings cannot
be predicted with certainty, management believes that losses, if any, resulting
from the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
A portion of the Company's interest expense has been allocated to the Arizona
Biltmore Resort & Spa based upon the debt balance attributable to it operations.
Certain selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by the Company
have been allocated based upon the specific identification method. The Company's
unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations assuming the disposition
of the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa occurred at the beginning of the period are

9. SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES PAYABLE

 On April 21, 1999, the Company issued 340.0 million aggregate principal
amount of 9.875 senior subordinated notes due April 15, 2009 (the "Notes") in a
private placement offering (the "Offering"). The Notes were subsequently
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Interest on the Notes is
payable semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The Notes are
redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, in cash, on or
after April 15, 2004, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
date of redemption. The optional redemption prices for the twelve month periods
beginning April 15 are: 2004 -- 104.9375 ; 2005 -- 103.2910 ; 2006 -- 101.6450 
and 2007 and thereafter -- 100.00 .

 During the year ended June 30, 2001 the Company repurchased 67.0 million
principal amount of Notes and recognized an extraordinary loss of 2.0 million
(or 1.2 million, net of a benefit for income taxes). The extraordinary loss
substantially represents the non-cash charge-off of a pro rata portion of the
debt issuance costs previously capitalized when the Notes were issued.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

 Prior to April 15, 2002, the Company may redeem up to 35 of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes with the proceeds of one or more public equity
offerings, at a redemption price equal to 109.875 of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption,
provided that at least 65 of the Notes remains outstanding after any such
redemption. The Notes are senior obligations of the Company and rank pari passu
in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the
Company and rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future
subordinated obligations of the Company. None of the assets of the Company
secure its obligations under the Notes, and the Notes are effectively
subordinated to secured indebtedness of the Company to any third party to the
extent of assets serving as security.

 The Notes are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of
the Company's existing and future domestic subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary
Guarantors"). The Note guarantees are senior obligations of the Subsidiary
Guarantors and rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future
senior indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantors and senior in right of payment
to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of such Subsidiary
Guarantors.

 The Notes contain certain covenants limiting the Company's ability to incur
additional indebtedness, pay dividends and make investments and other restricted
payments, enter into transactions with 5 stockholders or affiliates, create
liens, and sell assets. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at
June 30, 2001. Additionally, certain asset sales or specific kinds of change of
control may require the Company to offer to repurchase the Notes. In connection
with the Offering, the Company charged to operations debt issuance costs
relating to certain extinguished debt and recognized a 4.3 million
extraordinary loss (or 2.7 million, net of a benefit for income taxes) during
the year ended June 30, 1999.

10. PREMIER CLUB REFUNDABLE MEMBERSHIP FEES

 Fully paid initiation fees associated with Premier Club memberships at the
Boca Raton Resort and Club executed prior to December 31, 1997 are refundable
upon the death of a member or a member's spouse and upon the expiration of the
30-year membership term (subject to renewal at the member's option). The fee is
also refundable upon a member's resignation from the Premier Club, but only out
of the proceeds of subsequent new members to join the Premier Club following
refund of all previously resigned members' fees. If any member paying over time
suspends payment, amounts paid to date are forfeited and recognized as income.
Amounts forfeited to date have not been material. Premier Club refundable
membership fees of approximately 57.8 million and 60.4 million at June 30,
2001 and 2000, respectively, have been reflected as a non-current liability in
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Leases

 The Company leases the site of the Radisson Bahia Mar Resort and Yachting
Center from the City of Fort Lauderdale under an operating lease, which has a
term through August 31, 2062. Under the lease agreement, the Company is required
to pay annual rent equal to the greater of a percentage (4.0 through September
30, 2012 and 4.25 thereafter) of annual gross operating revenue, as defined, or
a 300,000 minimum annual rent (escalating after September 2037). Rent expense
under this lease totaled 891,000, 850,000 and 785,000 for the years ended
June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The lease agreement also requires

fixtures and equipment. All such restricted funds have been spent on their
required purpose through June 30, 2001.

 Future minimum lease obligations under various noncancellable operating
leases with initial terms in excess of one year at June 30, 2001 (including the

As of June 30, 2001, the Company has two letters of credit, which secure

 Litigation

 The Company is not involved in any material legal proceedings. However, the
Company may from time to time become a party to legal proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business, which are incidental to its business.

 Environmental Matters

 Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations,
an owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or
remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on such real property, as
well as for the costs of complying with environmental laws regulating on-going
operations. The Company may be potentially liable for any such costs in
connection with the ownership and operation of its properties. The Company has
obtained Phase I environmental site assessments for the real property on which
each of the resorts is located. In addition, Phase II environmental assessments
have been conducted at several properties. Phase I assessments are intended to
identify existing, potential and suspected environmental contamination and
regulatory compliance concerns, and generally include historical reviews of the
property, reviews of certain public records, preliminary visual investigations
of the site and surrounding properties and the preparation and issuance of
written reports. Phase II assessments involve the sampling of environmental
media, such as subsurface soil and groundwater, to confirm whether contamination
is present at areas of concern identified during the course of a Phase I
assessment.

 The Phase I and Phase II assessments have not revealed any environmental
liability or compliance concerns that the Company believes would have a material
adverse effect on its business, nor is the Company aware of any such material
liability or concern. Phase I and Phase II assessments cannot provide full and
complete knowledge of environmental conditions and compliance matters.
Therefore, there can be no assurances that: (1) material environmental
liabilities or compliance concerns do not exist; (2) an identified matter that
does not appear reasonably likely to be material will not result in
significantly greater expenditures than is currently anticipated; or (3) there
are no material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns of which the
Company is unaware.

13. LICENSE AND FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS

 Upon the acquisition of the Hyatt Regency Pier 66 Hotel and Marina, the
Company assumed the rights of the franchise agreement with Hyatt Franchise
Corporation. The franchise agreement expires in November 2014 with various early
termination provisions and liquidated damages for early termination. The
franchise agreement provides for payments of monthly royalty fees equal to 5.0 
of gross room revenue. The franchise agreement also provides for the payment of
certain Hyatt "allocable chain expenses" primarily relating to sales and
marketing. Aggregate Hyatt fees and expenses amounted to 1.6 million, 1.4
million and 1.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The franchise agreement also requires maintenance of a customary
reserve for replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment equal to 4.0 of
gross room revenue. All such restricted funds have been spent for their required
purpose through June 30, 2001.

 Upon the acquisition of Radisson Bahia Mar Resort and Yachting Center, the
Company assumed the rights of a ten-year license agreement with Radisson Hotels
International, Inc. ("Radisson"). The terms of the agreement allow the Company
to operate the resort using the Radisson system. Annual fees payable to Radisson
pursuant to the agreement equal 5.0 of gross room sales. Fees paid to Radisson
pursuant to the license agreement totaled 469,000, 469,000 and 436,000 for
the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

be realized. Management has considered these factors in reaching its conclusion
to release the valuation allowance during the year ended June 30, 2001.

The Company's revenue and income are seasonal in nature and are directly
affected by the strength and seasonality of the tourism and leisure industry.
Tourism is dependent upon weather and the traditional seasons for travel.
Because of this variability in demand, the Company's revenue fluctuates
quarter-to-quarter, and

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

revenue for the first quarter of each year can be expected to be lower than the
remaining quarters. Although historically the trend in quarterly revenue for the
second, third and fourth quarters of each year is generally higher than the
first quarter, there can be no assurance that this will occur in future periods.
Accordingly, quarterly or other interim results should not be considered
indicative of results to be expected for any quarter or for the full year.

 A DELAWARE CORPORATION

 ARTICLE I. MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

SECTION 1. ANNUAL MEETING.

 The annual meeting of the stockholders of this corporation shall be
held at the time and place designated by the Board of Directors. Business
transacted at the annual meeting shall include the election of directors of the
corporation.

SECTION 2. SPECIAL MEETINGS.

 Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes shall only
be called by the Board of Directors, and may not be called by any other person
or persons. Business transacted at any special meeting of the stockholders shall
be limited to the purposes stated in the corporation's notice of meeting.

SECTION 3. PLACE.

 Meeting of stockholders may be held within or without the State of
Delaware.

SECTION 4. NOTICE.

 Written notice stating the place, day and hour of the meeting and, in
the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is
called, shall be delivered not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the
meeting, either personally or by United States mail, by or at the direction of
the President, the Secretary, or the officer or persons calling the meeting to
each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail
addressed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the stock transfer
books of the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid.

SECTION 5. NOTICE OF ADJOURNED MEETINGS.

 When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, it shall not be
necessary to give any notice of the adjourned meeting if the time and place to
which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken, and at the adjourned meeting any business may be
transacted that might have been transacted on the original date of the meeting.
If, however, the adjournment is for more than 30 days or if after the
adjournment the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned
meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as provided in this
section to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting.

SECTION 6. FIXING RECORD DATE.

 In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled
to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting,
or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or
allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful
action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board of Directors, and which record date: (1) in the case of
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or
adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than
sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting; (2) in
the case of determination of stockholders entitled to express consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, shall not be more than ten (10)
days from the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board of Directors; and (3) in the case of any other action, shall not be
more than sixty (60) days prior to such other action. If no record date is
fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or
to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the
day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at
the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held; (2) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action
of the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be the first date on which a
signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is
delivered to the corporation in accordance with applicable law, or, if prior
action by the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking
such prior action; and (3) the record date for determining stockholders for any
other purpose shall be at the close of business

2
 6

on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating
thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the
adjourned meeting.

SECTION 7. LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE.

 The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before
every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to
vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of
each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for
any purpose germane to the meeting, as required by applicable law. Except as
otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who
are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of
stockholders or the books of the corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy
at any meeting of stockholders.

SECTION 8. STOCKHOLDER QUORUM AND VOTING.

 A majority in voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote
thereat, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a
meeting of stockholders. When a specified item of business is required to be
voted on by a class or series of stock, a majority in voting power of the
outstanding shares of such class or series shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of such item of business by that class or series.

 If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority in voting
power of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders unless otherwise provided by
law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws or the rules or regulations
of any stock exchange applicable to the corporation or pursuant to any
regulation applicable to the corporation. Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, at all meetings of stockholders for the election of
directors a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. After a
quorum has been established at a stockholders' meeting, the subsequent
withdrawal of stockholders, so as to reduce the number of stockholders entitled
to vote at the meeting below the number required for a quorum, shall not affect
the validity of any action taken at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.

3
 7

SECTION 9. VOTING OF SHARES.

 Each outstanding share shall be entitled to one vote on each matter
submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders, unless otherwise provided for
in the Certificate of Incorporation, or any amendments thereto, or any
certificate of designation filed on behalf of this corporation.

 Shares of stock of this corporation belonging to this corporation or to
another corporation, if the majority of the shares entitled to vote in the
election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly,
by this corporation, shall not be entitled to vote, and shall not be counted for
quorum purposes. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as limiting the
right of any corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own
stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

 Subject to the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation and any
certificate of designation of the corporation, on and after the date on which
written notice of redemption of redeemable shares has been mailed to the holders
thereof and a sum sufficient to redeem such shares has been deposited with a
bank or trust company with irrevocable instrument and authority to pay the
redemption price to the holders thereof upon surrender of certificates therefor,
such shares shall not be entitled to vote on any matter and shall not be deemed
to be outstanding shares.

SECTION 10. PROXIES.

 Every stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to
express consent without a meeting or a stockholder's duly authorized
attorney-in-fact may authorize another person or persons to act for him by
proxy. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven months from the
date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Every proxy shall be
revocable at the pleasure of the stockholder executing it, except as otherwise
provided by law. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, a proxy
shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as
long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an
irrevocable power.

4
 8

SECTION 11. VOTING TRUSTS.

 One stockholder or two or more stockholders of this corporation may
create a voting trust for the purpose of conferring upon a trustee or trustees
the right to vote or otherwise represent their shares, as provided by law. Where
a copy of a voting trust agreement has been deposited with the corporation's
registered agent as provided by law, such copy shall be open to the inspection
of any stockholder of the corporation or any beneficiary of the trust under the
agreement daily during business hours.

SECTION 12. STOCKHOLDERS' AGREEMENTS.

 Two or more stockholders of this corporation may enter an agreement
providing for the exercise of voting rights in the manner provided in the
agreement or relating to any phase of the affairs of the corporation as provided
by law. Nothing therein shall impair the right of this corporation to treat the
stockholders of record as entitled to vote the shares standing in their names.

SECTION 13. ACTION BY STOCKHOLDERS WITHOUT A MEETING.

 Any action required by law, these By-Laws, or the Certificate of
Incorporation to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, or
any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such
stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a
vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

 Prompt notice of the taking of corporate action without a meeting by
less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who
have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a
meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date
for such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient
number of holders to take the action were delivered to the corporation. SECTION

14. INSPECTORS OF ELECTION.

 The corporation may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any
meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be
employees of the corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof
and to make a written report thereof. The corporation may designate one or more
persons as alternate

5
 9

inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no
inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of
stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the
discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute
faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the
best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or
designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the
corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine
the shares of capital stock of the corporation represented at the meeting and
the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv)
determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any
challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their
determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation
represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots.
Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be
required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots
cast at any meeting of stockholders of the corporation, the inspectors may
consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a
candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such
election.

SECTION 15. CONDUCT OF MEETINGS.

 The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each
matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at
the meeting by the person presiding over the meeting. The Board of Directors may
adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of
stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent
with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the
chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to
prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in
the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the
meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of
Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without
limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of
business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the
meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or
participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the corporation, their
duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of
the meeting

6
 10

shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed
for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to
questions or comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined by
the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders
shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary
procedure.

SECTION 16. NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER BUSINESS AND NOMINATIONS.

 (a) ANNUAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS. (1) Nominations of persons for
election to the Board of Directors of the corporation and the proposal of
business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting
of stockholders only (i) pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting (or any
supplement thereto), (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or
(iii) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record of
the corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 16 is
delivered to the Secretary of the corporation, who is entitled to vote at the
meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section
16.

 (2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an
annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph (a)(1) of
this Section 16, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in
writing to the Secretary of the corporation and any such proposed business other
than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must
constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's
notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of
the corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day
nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day
prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than
thirty (30) days before or more than seventy (70) days after such anniversary
date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close
of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual
meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth
(90th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the
day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by
the corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or
postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time
period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such

7
 11

stockholder's notice shall set forth: (i) as to each person whom the stockholder
proposes to nominate for election as a director (A) all information relating to
such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for
election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each
case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (B) such person's
written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to
serving as a director if elected; (ii) as to any other business that the
stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the
business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or
business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and
in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the
corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting
such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such
stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is
made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial
owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (A) the name
and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and
of such beneficial owner, (B) the class and number of shares of capital stock of
the corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder
and such beneficial owner, (C) a representation that the stockholder is a holder
of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and

percentage of the corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or
adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (y) otherwise to solicit proxies
from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing
notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the
stockholder has notified the corporation of his or her intention to present a
proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor
thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal has
been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the corporation to

 (3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(2)
of this Section 16 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to
be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation at an annual meeting is
increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming the
nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred (100) days prior
to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's
notice required by this Section 16 shall also be considered timely, but only
with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be
delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation
not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day
on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation.

 (b) SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS. Only such business shall be
conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before
the meeting pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of
persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting
of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the
corporation's notice of meeting (1) by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors or (2) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that
directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the
corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for
in this Section 16 is delivered to the Secretary of the corporation, who is
entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the
notice procedures set forth in this Section 16. In the event the corporation
calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more
directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in
such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be)
for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation's notice of
meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(2) of this
Section 16 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive
offices of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one
hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than
the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such
special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public
announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the
nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no
event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a
special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the
giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.

 13

 (c) GENERAL. (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Section 16 shall be eligible to be elected at
an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to serve as
directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders
as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Section 16. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman
of the meeting shall have the power and duty (i) to determine whether a
nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or
proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this Section 16 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any,
on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a
group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in
support of such stockholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such
stockholder's representation as required by clause (a)(2)(iii)(d) of this
Section 16) and (ii) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or
proposed in compliance with this Section 16, to declare that such nomination
shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 16, if the stockholder
(or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual
or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present a nomination or
business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall
not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have
been received by the corporation.

 (2) For purposes of this Section 16, "public announcement" shall
include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly
filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to
Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 16, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set
forth in this Section 16. Nothing in this Section 16 shall be deemed to affect
any rights (i) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the
corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or
(ii) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock of the corporation to elect
directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation.

entitled to vote on an election of directors.

 A majority of the number of directors fixed pursuant to Section 5 of
Article II of these By-Laws shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business. The act of the majority of directors present at a meeting at which a
quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors.

SECTION 10. DIRECTOR CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

 No contract or transaction between this corporation and one or more of
its directors or officers or between this corporation and any other corporation,
partnership, association or other entity in which one or more of the directors
or officers are directors or officers or are financially interested, shall be
either void or voidable solely for this reason or solely because such director
or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of
Directors or committee which authorizes such contract or transaction or solely
because his or their votes are counted for such purpose, if:

 The material facts as to such relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed to or known by the Board of Directors or
committee, and the Board of Directors or committee authorizes the contract or
transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested
directors, even though less than a quorum; or

or matter expressly required by applicable law to be submitted to stockholders
for approval; or (ii) adopting, amending or repealing any By-Law of the

director by either personal delivery, telegram or telecopy at least two days

before the meeting.

 Notice of the meeting of the Board of Directors need not be given to
any director who signs a waiver of notice either before or after the meeting.

such meeting and waiver of any and all objections to the place of the meeting,
the time of the meeting, or the manner in which it has been called or convened,
except when a director states, at the beginning of the meeting, any objection to
the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or

otherwise.
