PART I.

 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

 THE PARTNERSHIP. Jones Cable Income Fund 1-A, Ltd. (the "Partnership")
is a Colorado limited partnership that was formed pursuant to the public
offering of limited partnership interests in the Jones Cable Income Fund 1
Limited Partnership Program (the "Program"), which was sponsored by Jones
Intercable, Inc. (the "General Partner"). Jones Cable Income Fund 1-B, Ltd. and
Jones Cable Income Fund 1-C, Ltd. are the other partnerships that were formed
pursuant to the Program. The Partnership was formed for the purpose of acquiring
and operating cable television systems.

 The Partnership owns the cable television systems serving the
communities of Milwaukie, Oregon (the "Milwaukie System") and Owatonna and
Glencoe, Minnesota (the "Owatonna/Glencoe System"). The Milwaukie System and the
Owatonna/Glencoe System may hereinafter collectively be referred to as the
"Systems."

 A primary objective of the Partnership is to provide quarterly cash
distributions from operating cash flow to its partners. During 1995, the
Partnership declared such distributions totaling 808,080, which equates to
 941 per 10,000 invested in the Partnership. The distributions, which were
principally from operating cash flow, were paid to limited partners during 
1995, except the fourth quarter distribution of 200,000, which was paid on 
February 15, 1996. Future distributions will be announced on a quarter-by-
quarter basis and no determination has been made regarding any specific level 
of future distributions. The payment of quarterly operating cash flow 
distributions may reduce the financial flexibility of the Partnership. See 
Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations.

 CABLE TELEVISION SERVICES. The Systems offer to subscribers various
types of programming, which include basic service, tier service, premium
service, pay-per-view programs and packages including several of these services
at combined rates.

 Basic cable television service usually consists of signals of all four
national television networks, various independent and educational television
stations (both VHF and UHF) and certain signals received from satellites. Basic
service also usually includes programs originated locally by the system, which
may consist of music, news, weather reports, stock market and financial
information and live or videotaped programs of a public service or entertainment
nature. FM radio signals are also frequently distributed to subscribers as part
of the basic service.

 The Systems offer tier services on an optional basis to its
subscribers. A tier generally includes most of the cable networks such as
Entertainment and Sports Programming Network (ESPN), Cable News Network (CNN),
Turner Network Television (TNT), Family Channel, Discovery and others, and the
cable television operators buy tier programming from these networks. The Systems
also offer a package that includes the basic service channels and the tier
services.

 The Systems also offer premium services to subscribers, which consist
of feature films, sporting events and other special features that are presented
without commercial interruption. The cable television operators buy premium
programming from suppliers such as HBO, Showtime, Cinemax or others at a cost
based on the number of subscribers the cable operator serves. Premium service
programming usually is significantly more expensive than the basic service or
tier service programming, and consequently cable operators price premium service
separately when sold to subscribers.

 The Systems also offer to subscribers pay-per-view programming.
Pay-per-view is a service that allows subscribers to receive single programs,
frequently consisting of motion pictures that have recently completed their
theatrical exhibitions and major sporting events, and to pay for such service on
a program-by-program basis.

REVENUES. Monthly service fees for basic, tier and premium services
constitute the major source of revenue for the Systems. At December 31, 1995,
the Systems' monthly basic service rates ranged from 8.73 to 9.99, monthly
basic and tier ("basic plus") service rates ranged from 17.61 to 22.20 and
monthly premium services ranged from 2.00 to 12.95 per premium service. In
addition, the Partnership earns revenues from the Systems' pay-per-view programs
and advertising fees. Related charges may include a nonrecurring installation
fee that ranges from 1.99 to 40.05; however, from time to time the Systems
have followed the common industry practice of reducing or waiving the
installation fee during promotional periods. Commercial subscribers such as
hotels, motels and hospitals are charged a nonrecurring connection fee that
usually covers the cost of installation. Except under the terms of certain
contracts with commercial subscribers and residential apartment and condominium
complexes, the subscribers are free to discontinue the service at any time
without penalty. For the year ended December 31, 1995, of the total fees
received by the Systems, basic service and tier service fees accounted for
approximately 70 of total revenues, premium service fees accounted for
approximately 13 of total revenues, pay-per-view fees were approximately 2 of
total revenues, advertising fees were approximately 4 of total revenues and the
remaining 11 of total revenues came principally from equipment rentals,
installation fees and program guide sales. The Partnership is dependent upon the
timely receipt of service fees to provide for maintenance and replacement of
plant and equipment, current operating expenses and other costs of the Systems.

 FRANCHISES. The Systems are constructed and operated under
non-exclusive, fixed-term franchises or other types of operating authorities
(referred to collectively herein as "franchises") granted by local governmental
authorities. These franchises typically contain many conditions, such as time
limitations on commencement and completion of construction, conditions of
service, including the number of channels, types of programming and the
provision of free service to schools and certain other public institutions, and
the maintenance of insurance and indemnity bonds. The provisions of local
franchises are subject to federal regulation.

 The Partnership holds 3 franchises for the Systems. These franchises
provide for the payment of fees to the issuing authorities and generally range
from 3 to 5 of the gross revenues of a cable television system. The 1984 Cable
Act prohibits franchising authorities from imposing annual franchise fees in
excess of 5 of gross revenues and also permits the cable television system
operator to seek renegotiation and modification of franchise requirements if
warranted by changed circumstances.

 The Partnership has never had a franchise revoked. The Partnership's
franchise expiration dates currently range from April 1997 to June 1998. The
General Partner recently has experienced lengthy negotiations with some
franchising authorities for the granting of franchise renewals. Some of the
issues involved in recent renewal negotiations include rate regulation, customer
service standards, cable plant upgrade or replacement and shorter terms of
franchise agreements.

 COMPETITION. Cable television systems currently experience competition
from several sources. A potential source of significant competition is Direct
Broadcast Satellite ("DBS") services that use video compression technology to
increase channel capacity and provide packages of movies, network and other
program services that are competitive with those of cable television systems.
Two companies offering DBS services began operations in 1994, and two other
companies offering DBS service recently began operations. In addition, a joint
venture has won the right to provide a DBS service through a FCC spectrum
auction. Not all subscribers terminate cable television service upon acquiring a
DBS system. The General Partner has observed that a number of DBS subscribers
also elect to subscribe to cable television service in order to obtain the
greatest variety of programming on multiple television sets, including local
video services programming not available through DBS service.

 Although neither the Partnership nor the General Partner has yet
encountered competition from a telephone company providing video services as a
cable operator or video dialtone operator, it is anticipated that the cable
television systems owned or managed by the General Partner will face such
competition in the near future. Legislation recently enacted into law will make
it possible for companies with considerable resources to enter the business. For
example, in February 1996, one of the regional Bell operating companies entered
into an

 3
 4

agreement to acquire the nation's third largest cable television company, which
has a significant number of cable systems in the Chicago area in close proximity
to the Systems. In addition, several telephone companies have begun seeking
cable television franchises from local governmental authorities as a consequence
of litigation that successfully challenged the constitutionality of the cable
television/telephone company cross-ownership rules. The General Partner cannot
predict at this time when and to what extent telephone companies will provide
cable television service within service areas in competition with cable
television systems owned or managed by the General Partner. 

 The General Partner is aware of the following imminent competition from
telephone companies: Ameritech, one of the seven regional Bell operating
companies, which provides telephone service in a multi-state region including
Illinois, has just obtained a franchise that will allow it to provide cable
television service in Naperville, Illinois, a community currently served by a
cable system owned by another one of the public limited partnerships managed by
the General Partner. Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Virginia and
Bell Atlantic Video Service Company, both subsidiaries of Bell Atlantic,
another of the regional Bell operating companies, have announced their
intention to build a cable television system in Alexandria, Virginia in
competition with a cable television system owned by the General Partner. Bell
Atlantic is preparing for the operation of a telecommunications and video
business in northern Virginia, including the Alexandria metropolitan area. The
FCC has granted GTE Virginia's application for authority to construct, operate,
own and maintain video dialtone facilities in northern Virginia, including in
the service area of a cable television system owned by the General Partner. To
date, GTE has not begun construction of a video distribution system. The entry
of telephone companies as direct competitors could adversely affect the
profitability and market value of the General Partner's owned and managed
systems.

 Additional competition is present from several sources, including the
following: Master Antenna Television and Satellite Master Antenna Television
systems that serve multi-unit dwellings such as condominiums, apartment
complexes, motels, hotels and private residential communities; private cable
television/telephonic companies that have secured exclusive contracts to provide
video and telephony services to multi-unit dwellings and similar complexes; and
multichannel, multipoint distribution service ("MMDS") systems, commonly called
wireless cable which generally focus on providing service to residents of rural
areas. In addition, the FCC has established a new wireless telecommunications
service known as Personal Communications Service ("PCS") that would provide
portable non-vehicular mobile communications services similar to that available
from cellular telephone companies, but at a lower cost. Several cable television
multiple system operators hold or have requested experimental licenses from the
FCC to test PCS technology.

 REGULATION AND LEGISLATION. The cable industry is regulated under the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act"), the Cable Television Consumer
Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (the "1992 Cable Act") and the Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984 (the "1984 Cable Act") and the regulations
implementing these statutes. The Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC")
has promulgated regulations covering such areas as the registration of cable
television systems and other communications businesses, carriage of television
broadcast programming, consumer education and lockbox enforcement, origination
cablecasting and sponsorship identification, children's programming, the
regulation of basic cable and cable programming service rates in areas where
cable television systems are not subject to effective competition, signal
leakage and frequency use, technical performance, maintenance of various
records, equal employment opportunity, and antenna structure notification,
marking and lighting. In addition, cable operators periodically are required to
file various informational reports with the FCC. The FCC has the authority to
enforce these regulations through the imposition of substantial fines, the
issuance of cease and desist orders and/or the imposition of administrative
sanctions, such as the revocation of FCC licenses needed to operate certain
transmission facilities often used in connection with cable operations. State or
local franchising authorities, as applicable, also have the right to enforce
various regulations, impose fines or sanctions, issue orders or seek revocation
subject to the limitations imposed upon such franchising authorities by federal,
state and local laws and regulations. Several states have assumed regulatory
jurisdiction of the cable television industry, and it is anticipated that other
states will do so in the future. To the extent the cable television industry
begins providing telephone service, additional state regulations will be applied
to the cable television industry. Cable television operations are subject to
local regulation insofar as systems operate under franchises granted by local
authorities.

The following is a summary of federal laws and regulations materially
affecting the cable television industry, and a description of state and local
laws with which the cable industry must comply.

 Telecommunications Act of 1996. The 1996 Act, which became law on
February 28, 1996, substantially revised the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended, including the 1984 Cable Act and the 1992 Cable Act, and has been
described as one of the most significant changes in communications regulation
since the original Communications Act of 1934. The 1996 Act is intended, in
part, to promote substantial competition in the telephone local exchange and in
the delivery of video and other services. As a result of the 1996 Act, local
telephone companies (also known as local exchange carriers or "LECs") and other
service providers are permitted to provide video programming, and cable
television operators are permitted entry into the telephone local exchange
market. The FCC is required to conduct rulemaking proceedings over the next
several months to implement various provisions of the 1996 Act.

 Among other provisions, the 1996 Act modified the 1992 Cable Act by
deregulating the cable programming service tier of large cable operators
effective March 31, 1999 and the cable programming service tier of small cable
operators (those that provide service to 50,000 or fewer subscribers) effective
immediately. The 1996 Act also revised the procedures for filing a cable
programming service tier rate complaint and adds a new effective competition
test.

 The most far-reaching changes in the communications business will
result from the telephony provisions of the 1996 Act. The statute expressly
preempts any legal barriers to competition in the local telephone business that
previously existed in state and local laws and regulations. Many of these
barriers had been lifted by state actions over the last few years, but the 1996
Act completes the task. The 1996 Act also establishes new requirements for
maintaining and enhancing universal telephone service and new obligations for
telecommunications providers to maintain privacy of customer information. The
1996 Act establishes uniform requirements and standards for entry, competitive
carrier interconnection and unbundling of LEC monopoly services.

 The 1996 Act repealed the cable television/telephone cross-ownership
ban adopted in the 1984 Cable Act. The federal cross-ownership ban was
particularly important to the cable industry because telephone companies already
own certain facilities such as poles, ducts and associated rights of way. While
this ban had been overturned by several courts, formal removal of the ban ended
the last legal constraints on telephone company plans to enter the cable market.
Under the 1996 Act, telephone companies in their capacity as common carriers now
may lease capacity to others to provide cable television service. Telephone
companies have the option of providing video service as cable operators or
through "open video systems" ("OVS"), a regulatory regime that may provide more
flexibility than traditional cable service. The 1996 Act exempts OVS operators
from many of the regulatory obligations that currently apply to cable operators,
such as rate regulation and franchise fees, although other requirements are
still applicable. OVS operators, although not subject to franchise fees as
defined by the 1992 Cable Act, are subject to fees charged by local franchising
authorities or other governmental entities in lieu of franchise fees. (Under
certain circumstances, cable operators also will be able to offer service
through open video systems.) In addition, the 1996 Act eliminated the
requirement that telephone companies file Section 214 applications (applications
to provide video dialtone services) with the FCC before providing video service.
This limits the opportunity of cable operators to mount challenges at the FCC
regarding telephone company entry into the video market. The 1996 Act also
contains restrictions on buying out incumbent cable operators in a telephone
company's service area, especially in suburban and urban markets.

 Other parts of the 1996 Act also will affect cable operators. Under the
1996 Act, the FCC is required to revise the current pole attachment rate
formula. This revision will result in an increase in the rates paid by entities,
including cable operators, that provide telecommunication services. The rates
will be phased in after a five-year period. (Cable operators that provide only
cable services will be unaffected.) Under the V-chip provisions of the 1996 Act,
cable operators and other video providers are required to pass along any program
rating information that programmers include in video signals. Cable operators
also are subject to new scrambling

 5
 6

requirements for sexually explicit programming, and cable operators that provide
Internet access or other online services are subject to the new indecency
limitations for computer services. In addition, cable operators that provide
Internet access or other online services are subject to the new indecency
limitations for computer services, although these provisions already have been
challenged in court, and the courts have preliminarily enjoined the 
enforcement of these content-based provisions.

 Under the 1996 Act, a franchising authority may not require a cable
operator to provide telecommunications services or facilities, other than an
institutional network, as a condition to a grant, renewal or transfer of a cable
franchise, and franchising authorities are preempted from regulating
telecommunications services provided by cable operators and from requiring cable
operators to obtain a franchise to provide such services. The 1996 Act also
repealed the 1992 Cable Act's anti-trafficking provision, which generally
required the holding of cable television systems for three years.

 It is premature to predict the specific effects of the 1996 Act on the
cable industry in general or the Partnership in particular. The FCC shortly will
be undertaking numerous rulemaking proceedings to interpret and implement the
1996 Act. It is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of those
proceedings or their effect on the Partnership.

 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. The
1992 Cable Act, which became effective on December 4, 1992, caused significant
changes to the regulatory environment in which the cable television industry
operates. The 1992 Cable Act generally mandated a greater degree of regulation
of the cable television industry. Under the 1992 Cable Act's definition of
effective competition, nearly all cable television systems in the United States,
including those owned and managed by the General Partner, became subject to rate
regulation of basic cable services. In addition, the 1992 Cable Act allowed the
FCC to regulate rates for non-basic service tiers other than premium services in
response to complaints filed by franchising authorities and/or cable
subscribers. In April 1993, the FCC adopted regulations governing rates for
basic and non-basic services. The FCC's rules became effective on September 1,
1993.

 In compliance with these rules, the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership reduced rates charged for certain regulated services in the
Partnership's cable systems effective September 1, 1993. These reductions
resulted in some decrease in Partnership revenues and operating income before
depreciation and amortization; however, the decrease was not as severe as
originally anticipated. The General Partner has undertaken actions to mitigate a
portion of these reductions primarily through (a) new service offerings in some
systems, (b) product re-marketing and re-packaging and (c) marketing efforts
directed at non-subscribers.

 On February 22, 1994, however, the FCC adopted several additional rate
orders including an order which revised its earlier-announced regulatory scheme
with respect to rates. The FCC's new regulations generally required rate
reductions, absent a successful cost-of-service showing, of 17 percent of
September 30, 1992 rates, adjusted for inflation, channel modifications,
equipment costs, and increases in programming costs. Further rate reductions for
cable systems whose rates are below the revised benchmark levels, as well as
reductions that would require operators to reduce rates below benchmark levels
in order to achieve a 17 percent rate reduction, were held in abeyance pending
completion of cable system cost studies. The FCC recently requested some of
these "low price" systems to complete cost study questionnaires. After review of
these questionnaires, the FCC could decide to permanently defer any further rate
reductions, or require the additional 7 percent rate roll back for some or all
of these systems. The FCC has also adopted its proposed upgrade methodology by
which operators would be permitted to recover the costs of upgrading their
plant.

 After analyzing the effects of the two methods of rate regulation, the
Partnership complied with the new benchmark regulations and further reduced
rates in its Systems.

 On November 10, 1994, the FCC also announced a revision to its
regulations governing the manner in which cable operators may charge subscribers
for new cable programming services. In addition to the present formula for
calculating the permissible rate for new services, the FCC instituted a
three-year flat fee mark-up plan for charges relating to new channels of cable
programming services. Commencing on January 1, 1995, cable

6
 7

system operators may charge for new channels of cable programming services added
after May 14, 1994 at a rate of up to 20 cents per channel, but may not make
adjustments to monthly rates totaling more than 1.20 plus an additional 30
cents for programming license fees per subscriber over the first two years of
the three-year period for these new services. Operators may charge an additional
20 cents in the third year only for channels added in that year plus the costs
for the programming. Operators electing to use the 20 cent per channel
adjustment may not also take a 7.5 percent mark-up on programming cost
increases, which is permitted under the FCC's current rate regulations. The FCC
has requested further comment as to whether cable operators should continue to
receive the 7.5 percent mark-up on increases in license fees on existing
programming services.

 The FCC also announced that it will permit operators to offer a "new
product tier" ("NPT"). Operators will be able to price the NPT as they elect so
long as, among other conditions, other channels that are subject to rate
regulation are priced in conformity with applicable regulations and operators do
not remove programming services from existing tiers and offer them on the NPT.

 In September 1995, the FCC authorized a new, alternative method of
implementing rate adjustments which will allow cable operators to increase rates
for programming annually on the basis of projected increases in external costs
(inflation, costs for programming, franchise-related obligations and changes in
the number of regulated channels) rather than on the basis of cost increases
incurred in the preceding calendar quarter. Operators that elect not to recover
all of their accrued external costs and inflation pass-throughs each year may
recover them (with interest) in subsequent years.

 In December 1995, the FCC adopted final cost-of-service rate
regulations requiring, among other things, cable operators to exclude 34 percent
of system acquisition costs related to intangible and tangible assets used to
provide regulated services. The FCC also reaffirmed the industry-wide 11.25
percent after tax rate of return on an operator's allowable rate base, but
initiated a further rulemaking in which it proposes to use an operator's actual
debt cost and capital structure to determine an operator's cost of capital or
rate of return. After a rate has been set pursuant to a cost-of-service showing,
rate increases for regulated services are indexed for inflation, and operators
are permitted to increase rates in response to increases in costs beyond their
control, such as taxes and increased programming costs.

 The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
recently upheld the FCC's rate regulations implemented pursuant to the 1992
Cable Act, but ruled that the FCC impermissibly failed to permit cable operators
to adjust rates for certain cost increases incurred during the period between
the date the 1992 Cable Act was passed through the initial date of rate
regulation. The FCC has not yet implemented the court's ruling.

 There have been several lawsuits filed by cable operators and
programmers in federal court challenging various aspects of the 1992 Cable Act
including its provisions relating to mandatory broadcast signal carriage,
retransmission consent, access to cable programming, rate regulations,
commercial leased channels and public access channels. On April 8, 1993, a
three-judge federal district court panel issued a decision upholding the
constitutionality of the mandatory signal carriage requirements of the 1992
Cable Act. That decision was appealed directly to the United States Supreme
Court. The United States Supreme Court vacated the lower court decision on June
27, 1994 and remanded the case to the district court for further development of
a factual record. On December 12, 1995, the three-judge federal district court
again upheld the must-carry rules' validity. This decision has been appealed to
the United States Supreme Court.

 In 1993, a federal district court upheld provisions of the 1992 Cable
Act concerning rate regulation, retransmission consent, restrictions on
vertically integrated cable television operators and programmers, mandatory
carriage of programming on commercial leased channels and public, educational
and governmental access channels and the exemption for municipalities from civil
damage liability arising out of local regulation of cable services. The 1992
Cable Act's provisions providing for multiple ownership limits for cable
operators and advance notice of free previews for certain programming services
have been found unconstitutional and these decisions have been appealed. The
FCC's regulations relating to the carriage of indecent programming, which

 7
 8

were recently upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia, have been appealed to the United States Supreme Court.

 Franchising. The responsibility for franchising or other authorization
of cable television systems is left to state and local authorities. There are,
however, several provisions in the 1984 Cable Act that govern the terms and
conditions under which cable television systems provide service. These include
uniform standards and policies that are applicable to cable television operators
seeking renewal of a cable television franchise. The procedures established
provide for a formal renewal process should the franchising authority and the
cable television operator decline to use an informal procedure. A franchising
authority unable to make a preliminary determination to renew a franchise is
required to hold a hearing in which the operator has the right to participate.
In the event a determination is made not to renew the franchise at the
conclusion of the hearing, the franchising authority must provide the operator
with a written decision stating the specific reasons for non-renewal. Generally,
the franchising authority can finally decide not to renew a franchise only if it
finds that the cable operator has not substantially complied with the material
terms of the present franchise, has not provided reasonable service in light of
the community's needs, does not have the financial, legal or technical ability
to provide the services being proposed for the future, or has not presented a
reasonable proposal for future service. A final decision of non-renewal by the
franchising authority is appealable in court.

 A provision of the 1996 Act preempts franchising authorities from
regulating telecommunications services provided by cable operators and from
requiring cable operators to obtain a franchise to provide such services. A
franchising authority may not require a cable operator to provide
telecommunications services or facilities, other than an institutional network,
as a condition to a grant, renewal or transfer of a cable franchise.

 GENERAL. The Partnership's business consists of providing cable
television services to a large number of customers, the loss of any one of which
would have no material effect on the Partnership's business. Each of the Systems
has had some subscribers who later terminated the service. Terminations occur
primarily because people move to another home or to another city. In other
cases, people terminate on a seasonal basis or because they no longer can afford
or are dissatisfied with the service. The amount of past due accounts in the
Systems is not significant. The General Partner's policy with regard to past due
accounts is basically one of disconnecting service before a past due account
becomes material.

 The Partnership does not depend to any material extent on the
availability of raw materials; it carries no significant amounts of inventory
and it has no material backlog of customer orders. The Partnership has no
employees because all properties are managed by employees of the General
Partner. The General Partner has engaged in research and development activities
relating to the provision of new services but the amount of the Partnership's
funds expended for such research and development has never been material.

 Compliance with federal, state and local provisions that have been
enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or
otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has had no material
effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the
Partnership.

 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

 The cable television systems owned by the Partnership are described
below:

SYSTEM ACQUISITION DATE
 ------ ----------------
 
 Owatonna/Glencoe System July 1986
 Milwaukie System July 1986

The following sets forth (i) the monthly basic plus service rates
charged to subscribers and (ii) the number of basic subscribers and pay units
for the Systems. The monthly basic service rates set forth herein

8
 9

represent, with respect to systems with multiple headends, the basic service
rate charged to the majority of the subscribers within the system. In cable
television systems, basic subscribers can subscribe to more than one pay TV
service. Thus, the total number of pay services subscribed to by basic
subscribers are called pay units. As of December 31, 1995, the Owatonna/Glencoe
System operated cable plant passing approximately 11,300 homes, representing an
approximate 70 penetration rate, and the Milwaukie System operated cable plant
passing approximately 9,600 homes, representing an approximate 55 penetration
rate. Figures for numbers of subscribers, miles of cable plant and homes passed
are compiled from the General Partner's records and may be subject to
adjustments.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
 Results of Operations

 JONES CABLE INCOME FUND 1-A, LTD.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1995 compared to 1994-

 Revenues of the Partnership increased 295,200, or approximately 7
percent, to 4,589,457 in 1995 from 4,294,257 in 1994. The increase in
revenues was primarily the result of increases in basic subscribers and
premium subscriptions. Since December 31, 1994, the Partnership's cable
systems added 401 basic subscribers, increasing to 13,323 basic subscribers at
December 31, 1995 from 12,922 basic subscribers at December 31, 1994. The
number of premium subscriptions totaled 7,807 at December 31, 1995 compared to
6,986 at December 31, 1994, an increase of 821, or approximately 11 percent.
Increases in advertising revenues accounted for approximately 10 percent of the
increase in revenues. No other individual factor significantly affected the
increase in revenues.

 Operating expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the
administration of the Partnership's cable television systems. The principal
cost components are salaries paid to system personnel, programming expenses,
professional fees, subscriber billing costs, rent for leased facilities, cable
system maintenance expenses and consumer marketing expenses.

 Operating expenses increased 218,339, or approximately 9 percent, to
 2,762,748 in 1995 from 2,544,409 in 1994. Operating expense represented 60
percent and 59 percent of the revenues in 1995 and 1994, respectively. The
increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increases in
advertising sales costs and increases in programming costs. No other
individual factor significantly affected the increase in operating expenses.

 Management fees and allocated overhead from the General Partner
increased 9,213, or approximately 2 percent, to 577,624 in 1995 from 568,411
in 1994 due to the increase in revenues, upon which such fees are based.

 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 94,479, or
approximately 11 percent, to 787,556 in 1995 from 882,035 in 1994. This
decrease was due to the maturation of the Partnership's intangible asset base.

 Operating income increased 162,127, or approximately 54 percent, to
 461,529 in 1995 from 299,402 in 1994. This increase was due to the increase
in revenues and the decreases in depreciation and amortization expense
exceeding the increases in operating expenses and management fees and allocated
overhead from the General Partner.

 The cable television industry generally measures the financial
performance of a cable television system in terms of cash flow or operating
income before depreciation and amortization. The value of a cable television
system is often determined using multiples of cash flow. This measure is not
intended to be a substitute or improvement upon the items disclosed on the
financial statements, rather it is included because it is an industry standard.
Operating income before depreciation and amortization increased 67,648, or
approximately 6 percent, to 1,249,085 in 1995 from 1,181,437 in 1994. This
increase was due to the increase in revenues exceeding the increases in
operating expenses and management fees and allocated overhead from the General
Partner.

 Interest expense increased 121,326, or approximately 57 percent, to
 335,359 in 1995 from 214,033 in 1994 due to higher outstanding balances on
interest bearing obligations.

 Net income increased 37,637, or approximately 40 percent, to 131,482
in 1995 from 93,845 in 1994 due to the factors discussed above.

1994 compared to 1993-

 Revenues of the Partnership increased 182,888, or approximately 4
percent, to 4,294,257 in 1994 from 4,111,369 in 1993. The increase in
revenues was primarily the result of increases in basic subscribers, equipment
sales and advertising revenues. Since December 31, 1993, the Partnership's
cable systems added 786 basic subscribers, increasing to 12,922 basic
subscribers at December 31, 1994 from 12,136 basic subscribers at December 31,
1993. The

11
 12
increase in revenues would have been greater but for the reduction in certain
rates charged due to basic rate regulations issued by the FCC in April 1993 and
February 1994 with which the Partnership complied effective September 1993 and
July 1994. No other individual factor significantly affected the increase in
revenues.

 Operating expenses increased 109,354, or approximately 4 percent, to
 2,544,409 in 1994 from 2,435,055 in 1993. Operating expense represented 59
percent of revenues in 1993 and 1994. Increased advertising sales costs
accounted for approximately 37 percent of the increase in expenses. Increased
programming costs due in part to the increase in the subscriber base, accounted
for approximately 14 percent of the increase in expenses. No other individual
factor significantly affected the increase in operating expenses.

 Management fees and allocated overhead from the General Partner
increased 58,168, or approximately 11 percent, to 568,411 in 1994 from
 510,243 in 1993 due primarily to the increase in revenues, upon which such
fees and allocations are based, and an increase in allocated expenses from the
General Partner in 1994.

 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 49,591, or
approximately 6 percent, to 882,035 in 1994 from 832,444 in 1993. This
increase was due to the purchase of property, plant and equipment in 1993 and
1994.

 Operating income decreased 34,225, or approximately 10 percent, to
 299,402 in 1994 from 333,627 in 1993. This decrease was due to the increases
in depreciation and amortization, operating expenses and management fees and
allocated overhead from the General Partner exceeding the increase in revenues.

 Operating income before depreciation and amortization increased
 15,366, or approximately 1 percent, to 1,181,437 in 1994 from 1,166,071 in
1993. This increase was due to the increase in revenues exceeding the
increases in operating expenses and management fees and allocated overhead from
the General Partner.

 Interest expense increased 76,336, or approximately 55 percent, to
 214,033 in 1994 from 137,697 in 1993 due to higher outstanding balances and
higher interest rates on interest bearing obligations.

 Net income decreased 63,532, or approximately 32 percent, to 132,056
in 1994 from 195,588 in 1993 due to the factors discussed above.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

 For the year ended December 31, 1995, the Partnership generated net
cash from operating activities totaling 439,466, which is available to fund
capital expenditures and non-operating costs. The Partnership expended
approximately 677,000 on capital improvements during 1995. Of these
expenditures, approximately 34 percent related to service drops to subscribers'
homes, approximately 16 percent was for the purchase of vehicles and
approximately 15 percent related to the purchase of converters. The remainder
of the expenditures related to various enhancements in each of the
Partnership's systems. Funding for these expenditures was provided primarily
by borrowings under the Partnership's credit facility. Anticipated capital
expenditures for 1996 total approximately 658,000. Of this total
approximately 41 percent is for construction of service drops to subscribers'
homes, approximately 14 percent is for the purchase of premium service
converters and approximately 10 percent is for headend equipment. The
remainder of the expenditures are for various enhancements in the Partnership's
cable television systems. Funding for these expenditures is expected to be
provided by borrowings under the Partnership's new revolving credit facility.

 On July 21, 1995, the Partnership entered into a new 6,500,000
revolving credit facility. The revolving credit period expires December 31,
1997, at which time the outstanding balance converts to a term loan with a
final maturity of December 31, 2003. The balance outstanding on the
Partnership's credit facility at December 31, 1995 was 4,500,000, leaving
 2,000,000 available to fund capital expenditures. Interest on outstanding
principal amounts on the new credit facility is computed at the Partnership's
option of the London Interbank Offered Rate plus 1-1/4 percent or the Prime
rate plus 1/4 percent.

 The General Partner believes that cash flow from operations and
available borrowings under the Partnership's new credit facility will be
sufficient to fund capital expenditures and other liquidity needs of the
Partnership in 1996.

 A primary objective of the Partnership is to provide quarterly cash
distributions from operating cash flow to the partners. During 1995, the
Partnership declared such distributions totaling 808,080, which equates to
 941 per 10,000

12
 13
invested in the Partnership. The distributions, which were principally from
operating cash flow, were paid to limited partners during 1995, except the
fourth quarter distribution of 200,000, which was paid on February 15, 1996.
The General Partner has agreed to defer its portion of cash distributions until
the Partnership is liquidated. Future distributions will be announced on a
quarter-by-quarter basis, and no determination has been made regarding any
specific level of future distributions. The payment of quarterly operating
cash flow distributions may reduce the financial flexibility of the
Partnership.

REGULATION AND LEGISLATION

 The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act"), which became law
on February 8, 1996, substantially revised the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended, including the 1984 Cable Act and the 1992 Cable Act, and has been
described as one of the most significant changes in communications regulation
since the original Communications Act of 1934. The 1996 Act is intended, in
part, to promote substantial competition in the telephone local exchange and in
the delivery of video and other services. As a result of the 1996 Act, local
telephone companies (also known as local exchange carriers or "LECs") and other
service providers are permitted to provide video programming, and cable
television operators are permitted entry into the telephone local exchange
market. The FCC is required to conduct rulemaking proceedings over the next
several months to implement various provisions of the 1996 Act.

 Among other provisions, the 1996 Act modified the 1992 Cable Act by
deregulating the cable programming service tier of large cable operators
including the Partnership effective March 31, 1999 and the cable programming
service tier of "small" cable operators in systems providing service to 50,000
or fewer subscribers effective immediately. The 1996 Act also revised the
procedures for filing cable programming service tier rate complaints and adds a
new effective competition test.

 It is premature to predict the specific effects of the 1996 Act on the
cable industry in general or the Partnership in particular. The FCC will be
undertaking numerous rulemaking proceedings to interpret and implement the 1996
Act. It is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of those
proceedings or their effect on the Partnership. See Item 1.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Partners of Jones Cable Income Fund 1-A, Ltd.:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of JONES CABLE INCOME FUND 1-A,
LTD. (a Colorado limited partnership) as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
related statements of operations, partners' capital (deficit) and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the General Partner's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Jones Cable Income Fund 1-A,
Ltd. as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

 JONES CABLE INCOME FUND 1-A, LTD.
 (A Limited Partnership)

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) ORGANIZATION AND PARTNERS' INTERESTS

 Formation and Business

 Jones Cable Income Fund 1-A, Ltd, (the "Partnership"), a Colorado
limited partnership, was formed on June 2, l986, under a public program
sponsored by Jones Intercable, Inc. ("Intercable"). The Partnership was formed
to acquire, develop and operate cable television systems. Intercable is the
"General Partner" and manager of the Partnership. The General Partner and its
subsidiaries also own and operate cable television systems. In addition, the
General Partner manages cable television systems for other limited partnerships
for which it is general partner and, also, for other affiliated entities. The
Partnership owns the cable television systems serving the communities of
Milwaukie, Oregon and Owatonna and Glencoe, Minnesota.

 Contributed Capital

 The capitalization of the Partnership is set forth in the accompanying
statements of partners' capital (deficit). No limited partner is obligated to
make any additional contribution to partnership capital.

 The General Partner purchased its interest in the Partnership by
contributing 1,000 to partnership capital.

 All profits and losses of the Partnership are allocated 99 percent to
the limited partners and 1 percent to the General Partner, except for income or
gain from the sale or disposition of cable television properties, which will be
allocated to the partners based upon the formula set forth in the Partnership
Agreement.

 Cable Television System Acquisitions

 The Partnership's acquisitions were accounted for as purchases with the
purchase price allocated as follows: first, to the fair value of net tangible
assets acquired; second, to the value of subscriber lists and franchise costs;
and third, to costs in excess of interests in net assets purchased. Brokerage
fees paid to an affiliate of the General Partner and additional acquisition
costs were allocated to intangible assets based upon the relative value of these
assets at acquisition. Other system acquisition costs were capitalized and
included in the cost of distribution systems.

(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 Accounting Records

 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the 
accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. The Partnership's tax returns are also prepared on the accrual
basis.

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the General Partner's management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

21
 22
 Property, Plant and Equipment

 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided using the
straight-line method over the following estimated service lives:

Cable distribution systems 5 - 15 years
 Equipment and tools 5 years
 Office furniture and equipment 5 - 15 years
 Buildings 10 - 20 years
 Vehicles 3 years

Replacements, renewals and improvements are capitalized and
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.

 Intangible Assets

 Costs assigned to franchises and cost in excess of interests in net
assets purchased are being amortized using the straight-line method over the
following remaining estimated useful lives:

Franchise costs 2 - 3 years
 Cost in excess of interests in net assets purchased 31 years

Revenue Recognition

 Subscriber prepayments are initially deferred and recognized as
revenue when earned.

(3) TRANSACTIONS WITH THE GENERAL PARTNER AND AFFILIATES

 Management Fees, Distribution Ratios and Reimbursements

 The General Partner manages the Partnership and receives a fee for its
services equal to 5 percent of the gross revenues of the Partnership, excluding
revenues from the sale of cable television systems or franchises. Management
fees charged during the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 were
 229,473, 214,713 and 205,568, respectively.

 Any partnership distributions made from cash flow (defined as cash
receipts derived from routine operations, less debt principal and interest
payments and cash expenses) are allocated 99 percent to the limited partners
and 1 percent to the General Partner. Distributions resulting from the sale or
refinancing of a system or upon dissolution of the Partnership will be made as
follows: first, to the limited partners in an amount which together with all
prior distributions, other than those made regularly from cash flow, will equal
their initial capital contribution; second, payment to the limited partners of
a liquidation preference equal to a 10 percent cumulative return on their
initial capital contribution, reduced by all prior distributions from cash
flow; and the balance, 75 percent to the limited partners and 25 percent to the
General Partner.

 The Partnership reimburses the General Partner for certain allocated
overhead and administrative expenses. These expenses represent salaries and
related benefits paid for corporate personnel, rent, data processing services
and other corporate facilities costs. Such personnel provide engineering,
marketing, administrative accounting, legal, and investor relations services to
the Partnership. Allocations of personnel costs are based primarily on actual
time spent by employees of the General Partner with respect to each partnership
managed. Remaining expenses are allocated based on the pro rata relationship
of the Partnership's revenues to the total revenues of all systems owned or
managed by the General partner and certain of its subsidiaries. Systems owned
by the General Partner and all other systems owned by partnerships for which
Intercable is the general partner are also allocated a proportionate share of
these expenses. The General Partner believes that the methodology used in
allocating overhead and administrative expenses is reasonable. Amounts
allocated to the Partnership by the General Partner for overhead and
administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993
were 348,151, 353,698 and 304,675, respectively.

 The Partnership was charged interest during 1995 at an average rate of
10.51 percent on the amounts due to the General Partner, which approximated the
General Partner's weighted average cost of borrowing. Interest charged to the
Partnership by the General Partner totaled 37,498, 11,769 and 5,838 during
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

22
 23
 Payments to/from Affiliates for Programming Services

 The Partnership receives programming from Product Information Network,
Superaudio, Mind Extension University and Jones Computer Network, all of which
are affiliates of the General Partner.

 Payments to Superaudio totaled 7,517, 7,598 and 7,488 in 1995, 1994
and 1993, respectively. Payments to Mind Extension University totaled 8,041,
 6,885 and 4,363 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Payments to Jones
Computer Network, which initiated service in 1994, totaled 6,517 and 1,611 in
1995 and 1994, respectively.

 The Partnership receives a commission from Product Information Network
based on a percentage of advertising revenues and number of subscribers.
Product Information Network, which initiated service in 1994, paid commissions
to the Partnership totaling 8,015 and 2,403 in 1995 and 1994, respectively.

(4) DISTRIBUTIONS FROM CASH FLOW

 One of the primary objectives of the Partnership is to provide
quarterly cash distributions to the partners. Such cash returns are generated
primarily from the net proceeds of payments by cable television subscribers for
the cable television services provided by the Partnership. For the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Partnership declared cash distributions
totaling 808,080, 989,900 and 1,040,402, respectively. The General Partner
has agreed to defer its portion of cash distributions until the Partnership is
liquidated. As of December 31, 1995, 74,229 had been deferred. All declared
limited partner distributions had been paid as of December 31, 1995, except for
 200,000 which was paid on February 15, 1996. Future distributions will be
announced on a quarter-by-quarter basis, and no determination has been made
regarding any specific level of future distributions.

(5) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

 Property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 1995 and 1994,
consisted of the following:

 ------------------------------

(6) DEBT

 Debt consists of the following:

December 31, 
 -------------------------------
 1995 1994 
 ---------- ----------
 
Lending institutions-
 Revolving credit agreement 4,500,000 3,500,000

 ---------- ----------

 4,606,827 3,584,706
 ========== ==========

23
 24
 On July 21, 1995, the Partnership entered into a new 6,500,000
revolving credit facility. The revolving credit period expires December 31,
1997, at which time the outstanding balance converts to a term loan with a
final maturity of December 31, 2003. The balance outstanding on the
Partnership's credit facility at December 31, 1995 was 4,500,000, leaving
 2,000,000 available to fund capital expenditures. Interest on outstanding
principal amounts on the renegotiated credit facility is computed at the
Partnership's option of the London Interbank Offered Rate plus 1-1/4 percent or
the Prime rate plus 1/4 percent. The effective interest rates on amounts
outstanding as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 were 7.24 percent and 7.29
percent, respectively.

 Installments due on debt principal for the five years ending December
31, 2000 and thereafter, respectively, are 32,048, 32,048, 482,048,
 573,183, 675,000 and 2,812,500. At December 31, 1995, substantially all of
the Partnership's assets secured the above indebtedness.

 At December 31, 1995, the carrying amount of the Partnership's
long-term debt did not differ significantly from the estimated fair value of
the financial instruments. The fair value of the Partnership's long-term debt
is estimated based on the discounted amount of future debt service payments
using rates of borrowing for a liability of similar risk.

(7) INCOME TAXES

 Income taxes have not been recorded in the accompanying financial
statements because they accrue directly to the partners. The federal and state
income tax returns of the Partnership are prepared and filed by the General
Partner.

 The Partnership tax returns, the qualification of the Partnership as
such for tax purposes, and the amount of distributable partnership income or
loss are subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities. If
such examinations result in changes with respect to the Partnership's
qualification as such, or in changes with respect to the Partnership's recorded
income or loss, the tax liability of the General and limited partners would
likely be changed accordingly.

 Taxable loss reported to the partners is different from that reported
in the statements of operations due to the difference in depreciation
recognized under generally accepted accounting principles and the expense
allowed for tax purposes under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System
(MACRS). There are no other significant differences between taxable loss and
the net loss reported in the statements of operations.

(8) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

 The Partnership rents office and other facilities under various
long-term lease arrangements. Rent paid under such lease agreements totaled
 30,791, 30,036 and 27,313, respectively, for the years ended December 31,
1995, 1994 and 1993. Minimum commitments under operating leases for each of
the five years in the period ending December 31, 2000, and thereafter are as
follows:

1996 26,790
 1997 26,790
 1998 20,092

Burney, John A. MacDonald and Daniel E. Somers are directors of the General
Partner. Reports by these persons with respect to the ownership of limited
partnership interests in the Partnership required by Section 16(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, were not filed within the required
time. None of these individuals own any limited partnership interests in the
Partnership.

 ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

 The Partnership has no employees; however, various personnel are
required to operate the Manitowoc System. Such personnel are employed by the
General Partner and, pursuant to the terms of the limited partnership agreement
of the Partnership, the cost of such employment is charged by the General
Partner to the Partnership as a direct reimbursement item. See Item 13.

 ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGERS

 No person or entity owns more than 5 percent of the limited partnership
interests of the Partnership.

 ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

 The General Partner and its affiliates engage in certain transactions
with the Partnership. The General Partner believes that the terms of such
transactions are generally as favorable as could be obtained by the Partnership
from unaffiliated parties. This determination has been made by the General
Partner in good faith, but none of the terms were or will be negotiated at
arm's-length and there can be no assurance that the terms of such transactions
have been or will be as favorable as those that could have been obtained by the
Partnership from unaffiliated parties.

 The General Partner charges a management fee, and the General Partner
is reimbursed for certain allocated overhead and administrative expenses. These
expenses represent the salaries and benefits paid to corporate personnel, rent,
data processing services and other corporate facilities costs. Such personnel
provide engineering, marketing, administrative, accounting, legal and investor
relations services to the Partnership. Allocations of personnel costs are based
primarily on actual time spent by employees of the General Partner with respect
to each partnership managed. Remaining expenses are allocated based on the pro
rata relationship of the Partnership's revenues to the total revenues of all
systems owned or managed by the General Partner and certain of its subsidiaries.
Systems owned by the General Partner and all other systems owned by partnerships
for which Jones Intercable, Inc. is the general partner, are also allocated a
proportionate share of these expenses.

 The General Partner also advances funds and charges interest on the
balance payable. The interest rate charged approximates the General Partner's
weighted average cost of borrowing.

 The Systems receives stereo audio programming from Superaudio, a joint
venture owned 50 by an affiliate of the General Partner and 50 by an
unaffiliated party, educational video programming from Mind Extension
University, Inc., an affiliate of the General Partner, and computer video
programming from Jones Computer Network, Ltd., an affiliate of the General
Partner, for fees based upon the number of subscribers receiving the
programming.

 Product Information Network ("PIN"), an affiliate of the General
Partner, provides advertising time for third parties on the Systems. In
consideration, the revenues generated from the third parties are shared
two-thirds and one-third between PIN and the Partnership. During the year ended
December 31, 1995, the Partnership received revenues from PIN of 8,015.
