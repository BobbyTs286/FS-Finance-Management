================================================================================

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

 Federal Screw Works (the "Registrant"), originally incorporated in
Michigan in 1919, is a domestic manufacturer of industrial component parts,
consisting of locknuts, bolts, piston pins, studs, bushings, shafts, perishable
tooling and other machined, cold formed, hardened and/or ground metal parts, all
of which constitute a single industry segment.

 The Registrant's products are manufactured at several plants and are
fabricated from metal rod and bar, which are generally available at competitive
prices from multiple sources. Production is in high-volume job lots to the
specification of original equipment manufacturers and sold to them for
incorporation into their assemblies. The majority of these sales are to
manufacturers of automobiles and trucks, with the balance being mainly to
manufacturers of nonautomotive durable goods.

 Approximately 91 of the Registrant's net sales in fiscal 2002 (85 and
89 in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000, respectively) were made either directly or
indirectly to automotive companies. The Registrant generally does not require
collateral from its customers.

 While the Registrant holds a number of patents, it believes that the
successful continuation of its business is not dependent on any single patent or
group of patents, trademarks, or licenses. (The Registrant retains the rights to
certain royalties related to an exclusive license agreement with semiconductor
manufacturer Silicon Systems incorporated (SSi), whereunder SSi will produce and
market certain phonetic speech synthesizer chips under the SSi product name. The
Registrant does not consider the royalty agreement to be material to its
business.)

 The OEM supplier industry is highly cyclical and, in large part,
dependent upon the overall strength of consumer demand for light trucks and
passenger cars. There can be no assurance that the automotive industry, for
which the Registrant supplies components, will not experience downturns in the
future. A decrease in overall consumer demand for motor vehicles, in general, or
specific segments, could have a material adverse effect on the Registrant's
financial condition and results of operations.

 There are no practices and conditions of the Registrant or known to the
Registrant relating to working capital items which are material to an
understanding of the Registrant's business in the industry in which it competes.

 The Registrant's Shareholders are aware of the Registrant's dependence
upon sales to the two largest U.S. automobile manufacturers, a condition that
has existed for at least fifty years. Although the Registrant has purchase
orders from such customers, such purchase orders generally provide for supplying
the customer's requirements for a particular model or model year rather than for
manufacturing a specific quantity of products. The loss of any one of such
customers or significant purchase orders could have a material adverse effect on
the Registrant. These customers are also able to exert considerable pressure on
component suppliers to reduce costs, improve quality and provide additional
design and engineering capabilities. There can be no assurance that the
additional costs of increased quality standards, price reductions or additional
capabilities required by such customers will not have a material adverse effect
on the financial condition or results of operations of the Registrant.

 Customers comprising 10 or greater of the Registrant's net sales are
summarized as follows:

2002 2001 2000
 ---- ---- ----

Ford Motor Company............................... 35 37 42 
 General Motors Corporation....................... 13 15 16 
 All Others....................................... 52 48 42 
 --- --- ---

 100 100 100 
 === === ===

2

Many of the Registrant's customers, and other suppliers to the
Registrant's customers, are unionized, and work stoppages, slow-downs or other
labor disputes experienced by, and the labor relations policies of, such
customers and suppliers, could have an adverse effect on the Registrant's
results of operations.

 As of August 31, 2002, the Registrant had an estimated backlog of firm
orders amounting to approximately 12,700,000, all of which are expected to be
filled within the 2003 fiscal year. The comparable backlog as of August 31, 2001
amounted to approximately 13,000,000.

 No material portion of the business of the Registrant is subject to
renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the
election of the Government.

 The manufacture and sale of the Registrant's products is an extremely
competitive business. Because industry statistics are not available, the
Registrant is unable to accurately determine the number of its competitors, nor
to state its competitive position in its principal market as a supplier of parts
to automotive customers. However, the Registrant believes that it is generally
considered a leading producer of its principal type of product in an estimated
 650 million annual market served by approximately thirty major domestic
suppliers, no one of which, or no small number of which, are dominant. The
Registrant is aware, however, that there are companies making similar products,
with greater sales and resources than the Registrant. The Registrant is aware
that in recent years the activity of foreign competitors manufacturing similar
products has increased. The quality of the product, the product's price and
service to customers are the principal methods of competition. There is no
assurance that the Registrant will be able to successfully compete in future
periods.

 Research and development activity expenses during each of the last
three fiscal years is not deemed material.

 The Registrant has experienced no material effects in complying with
government environmental regulations.

 The Registrant presently employs approximately 443 hourly-rated and
salaried personnel. The Registrant's hourly work forces at the Chelsea and
Romulus facilities are unionized. The Registrant's contracts with the unions in
Chelsea and Romulus expire in May of 2005 and January of 2003, respectively.

 Sales to customers outside the United States are not significant.

ITEM 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY.

 The Registrant's industrial component parts are manufactured in seven
plants located throughout Michigan.

 The Big Rapids Division in Big Rapids, Michigan, manufactures special
high-strength bolts and other cold formed products using boltmakers and headers
as primary equipment. Among the items manufactured to both inch and metric
specifications are hex head bolts, connecting rod bolts, studs and flange bolts.
The 200,000 square foot plant is situated on 25 acres of land, and contains heat
treat facilities for hardening in-process parts.

 The Romulus Division is housed in a 100,000 square foot plant on 13
acres of land in Romulus, Michigan. This division uses nutformers as primary
equipment to manufacture special prevailing torque locknuts. Products include
locknuts, connecting rod nuts, and other special nut products, in both metric
and inch sizes. The plant has its own furnace for heat treating in-process
parts.

 In February of 1999, the Registrant began operations in a new 35,000
square foot plant in Traverse City, Michigan. The Traverse City Division
manufacturers special assemblies for automotive customers.

 The parts produced at the above divisions are sold principally to the
automotive market. These parts are mass produced, and most are shipped directly
to car assembly plants.

3

The Novex Tool Division occupies a 19,000 square foot leased facility
in Brighton, Michigan. The lease expires in December, 2004. The Division
manufactures perishable tooling, primarily for the cold heading industry.
Approximately forty percent of its output is consumed by the Registrant's Big
Rapids, Romulus and Traverse City Divisions. Segment information for the Novex
Division is immaterial to the financial information for the Registrant as a
whole.

 The Chelsea Division is located in Chelsea, Michigan, in a plant having
approximately 86,000 square feet. Primary equipment consists of automatic screw
machines and rotary index machines capable of making products from 1/16 inch to
2-3/4 inches in diameter. The Chelsea Division fabricates a wide variety of
precision parts including piston pins, bushings, fittings, special fasteners,
valve components, sleeves, shafts, gear blanks and the like. These parts are
generally produced in large volume lots and delivered direct to manufacturers of
products such as compressors, automobiles, transmissions and small engines.

 In August, 1994, the Registrant leased a 16,000 square foot facility in
Romulus to conduct engineering and manufacturing development activities. This
facility, known as the Technical Center, gives the Registrant sufficient room to
try out new primary and secondary equipment, tooling, and parts feeding and
automation devices, as well as permitting the Registrant to rebuild recently
purchased used equipment.

 In June of 2001, the Registrant began operations in a new 43,000 square
foot plant in Boyne City, Michigan. This division provides special heat treating
to other divisions of the Registrant.

 The Registrant's corporate offices are located in St. Clair Shores,
Michigan, where the Registrant occupies 12,000 square feet of space under a ten
year lease expiring in 2009 (renewable for two additional periods of five years
each).

 Except as specifically noted to the contrary, the Registrant owns
outright all of the above described buildings, land, and production facilities.
The Registrant utilizes all of the floor space of these structures. Present
facilities are adequate to meet the needs of each division.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

 The Registrant has been designated by the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency (the "EPA") as a Potentially Responsible Party ("PRP") with
respect to a dump site referred to as the Cemetery Dump Site located in Oakland
County, Michigan. The PRPs engaged a single transporter who illegally disposed
of toxic and hazardous waste materials there in the late 1960s. While the
Registrant denies it has engaged in disposing of any materials at this site, the
Registrant together with other PRPs has actively participated in negotiations
directed toward settlement of the EPA's claims. The EPA has performed a site
clean-up but has not asserted claims against any of the identified PRPs which
suggests that the evidence of involvement by such parties is weak.

 Also, the Registrant received a notice letter from a representative of
the Barrels, Inc. site PRP Group located in Lansing, Michigan indicating that
"empty" drums from the Registrant were shipped to the site. The waste allegedly
shipped by the Registrant is 3520 gallons which is equal to approximately 0.02
percent of the total waste at the site. Since the total site costs for all
parties are not expected to exceed 10 million, the Registrant's share of the
costs are not expected to be material. No investigation has been undertaken to
the Registrant's knowledge which would identify any costs to be incurred by the
Registrant which might have a material effect on the Registrant's financial
statements.

At September 1, 2002, the approximate number of beneficial holders and
shareholders of record of the Registrant's common stock was 764, based upon the
securities position listings furnished to the Registrant.

 A cash dividend was declared in each of the four quarters during fiscal
2002. Four dividends were declared in fiscal 2001 with one declared in the first
quarter, two declared in the second quarter and one declared in the fourth
quarter. Total cash dividends in fiscal 2002 were 1.10 per share and in fiscal
2001 were 1.88 per share. The Registrant declared a 5 for 4 stock split on
December 8, 2000 payable on April 2, 2001 as a stock dividend. The amount of
cash dividends per share shown above have been retroactively adjusted to reflect
the stock split. The Registrant is in compliance with covenants of its revolving
credit and term loan agreement including any restrictions on the payment of cash
dividends.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 The following table sets forth the percent relationship of certain
items to net sales for the periods indicated:

For the Years Ended June 30,
 ----------------------------

 2002 2001 2000
 ---- ---- ----
 
 Net Sales 100 100 100 
 Gross Profit 11.2 11.9 15.2
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 6.3 5.6 5.5
 Interest .2 .1 .1

 Other income 2.2 .3 .4
 Earnings before federal income taxes 6.9 6.5 12.1
 Net earnings 4.7 4.4 8.0

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Federal Screw Works reported net sales of 95.5 million in fiscal 2002, which
represented a 9.8 decrease from fiscal 2001 sales of 105.9 million. Net sales
for fiscal 2001 decreased 13.1 from fiscal 2000 sales of 121.8 million. Sales
in both 2002 and 2001 benefited from new automotive parts programs. The number
of parts shipped decreased in 2002 and 2001 and increased in 2000.

Gross profits decreased 15.1 to 10.7 million in fiscal 2002, a 1.9 million
decrease from fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2001 gross profits decreased 31.9 to 12.6
million compared to the 18.5 million level realized in 2000. In the first six
months of fiscal 2002, the Registrant experienced severe production cuts from
our customers which, coupled with the demands for reduced prices, resulted in
marginally profitable operating results. In the second six month period of
fiscal 2002, an entirely new tone was reflected in incoming orders, which
increased slightly, but resulted in far more satisfactory operating results. By
the end of the fiscal year, inventories of car dealers and manufacturers had
been trimmed to acceptable levels. The new division at Boyne City, Michigan,
operated profitably in the second six months of the fiscal year. As a percentage
of total sales, the Registrant expects to gradually ship less to automobile
manufacturers and more to Tier One suppliers, reflecting the greater
manufacturing responsibilities assumed by Tier One suppliers.

Material, plating and packaging costs were again stable in 2002.

The Registrant is dependent upon sales to the two largest U.S. automobile
manufacturers, a condition that has existed for at least fifty years. The impact
of new parts programs were again a positive factor in fiscal 2002. Sales to
customers outside North America are increasing, but still are not material. Two
years ago the Registrant rejoined the Daimler Chrysler supply base after a four
year absence. The receipt of orders for the 2003, 2004 and 2005 model years
continues to be encouraging.

Refrigeration sales in fiscal 2002 were down slightly. As a percentage of
growth, refrigeration sales growth historically has been greater than automotive
sales growth.

The Registrant has not been able to increase its business with the transplant
suppliers in the current fiscal year.

7

Again, outsourcing programs were not a factor in fiscal 2002, which is
consistent with fiscal 2001 and 2000. Despite this, the Registrant believes that
these programs will be a source of significant new business in the future.
Fastener industry consolidations were limited in fiscal 2002.

As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses
increased to 6.3 in fiscal 2002, as a result of a reduction in net sales. In
fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 these expenses were 5.6 and 5.5 of net sales,
respectively. Interest expense increased in fiscal 2002 because of an increase
in average borrowings under the Registrant's Revolving Credit and Term Loan
Agreement. Net after-tax gains from the sale of stock acquired in the
demutualization of insurance companies amounted to 997,000 in the second
quarter and 501,000 in the third quarter of the current fiscal year.

The Registrant has been designated by the federal Environmental Protection
Agency ("EPA") as a Potentially Responsible Party ("PRP") with respect to a dump
site referred to as the Cemetery Dump Site located in Oakland County Michigan.
The PRPs engaged a single transporter who illegally disposed of toxic and
hazardous waste materials there in the late 1960s. While the Registrant denies
it has engaged in disposing of any materials at this site, the Registrant
together with other PRPs has actively participated in negotiations directed
toward settlement of the EPA's claims. The EPA has performed a site cleanup but
has not asserted claims against any of the identified PRPs which suggests that
the evidence of involvement by such parties is weak.

The Registrant received a notice letter from a representative of the Barrels,
Inc. site PRP Group located in Lansing, Michigan indicating that "empty" drums
from the Registrant were shipped to the site. The waste allegedly shipped by the
Registrant is 3520 gallons which is equal to approximately 0.02 percent of the
total waste at the site. Since the total site costs for all parties are not
expected to exceed 10 million, the Registrant's share of the costs are not
expected to be material. No investigation has been undertaken to the
Registrant's knowledge which would identify any costs to be incurred by the
Registrant which might have a material effect on the Registrant's financial
statements.

DIVIDENDS

Cash dividends declared in fiscal year 2002 were 1.10 per share, 0.78 less
than that declared in fiscal 2001 and 0.74 less than that declared in fiscal
2000. The Registrant declared a 5 for 4 stock split on December 8, 2000, payable
as a stock dividend April 2, 2001. The dividend per share amounts have been
adjusted to retroactively give effect to the stock split. The Board of
Directors, in August, 2002, declared a .10 per share quarterly dividend, and an
extra dividend of .70 per share.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flows from operating activities approximated 11.7 million in fiscal 2002.
This compares to 6.8 million in 2001 and 12.9 million in 2000. Capital
expenditures for fiscal 2002 were 7.5 million, primarily related to the
purchase of equipment and expansion of facilities in order to improve production
efficiencies and enable the Registrant to meet increased future demand for its
products. Capital expenditures in fiscal years 2001 and 2000 were 12.4 million
and 10.0 million, respectively. Expenditures for additional equipment during
fiscal 2003 are presently expected to approximate 6.8 million, of which 2.0
million had been committed as of June 30, 2002. These future capital
expenditures are expected to be financed from cash generated from operations and
additional borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit and Term Loan
Agreement.

Net cash used in financing activities was 4.1 million in fiscal 2002. This
compares to 4.1 million provided by financing activities in fiscal 2001 and
 6.3 million used in 2000. Fluctuations in these activities have been influenced
principally by borrowings and repayments under the Registrant's Revolving Credit
and Term Loan Agreement, payment of dividends and purchases of the Registrant's
common stock.

On October 19, 2001, the Registrant extended its Revolving Credit and Term Loan
Agreement by one year. The expiration date is October 31, 2004, and is renewable
annually for an additional year. Borrowings up to 25 million and capital
expenditures of 16 million annually are permitted. The Registrant has the
option to convert borrowings under the facility to a term note through October
31, 2006. Payments under the term note, if the conversion option were exercised,
would be made quarterly and could extend to October 31, 2006. Therefore,
borrowings under the

8

Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement, which were 6,340,000 at June 30,
2002, and 6,735,000 at June 30, 2001, are classified as long-term debt.

Working capital at June 30, 2002 amounted to 20,410,000 as compared to working
capital of 19,861,000 at June 30, 2001. The increase resulted primarily from an
increase in inventories and accounts receivable.

As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, effective July 1, 1993, the
Registrant adopted FASB Statement No. 106. As permitted by the Statement, the
Registrant is amortizing the present value of future health care and life
insurance benefits related to employees' past service 17,967,000 at July 1,
1993) over a period of 20 years. The implementation of this accounting
pronouncement has no impact on the Registrant's cash flows.

MARKET RISK

The Registrant's long-term debt is all at current interest rates and, therefore,
approximates current value but is subject to changes in interest rates.

IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

The Registrant passes increased costs on to customers, to the extent permitted
by competition, by increasing sales prices whenever possible. In fiscal 2002,
2001 and 2000 the Registrant was unable to pass on cost increases incurred due
to competitive pressures. Sales price increases in each of these years were
insignificant.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Application of
these accounting principles requires the Registrant's management to make
estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties. As a result,
actual results could differ from these estimates. In preparing these financial
statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts
and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving due regard to
materiality. The Registrant does not believe there is a great likelihood that
materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or
using different assumptions pertaining to the accounting policies described
below.

ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" and No. 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001. Under the new rules, goodwill and intangible assets
deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject
to annual impairment tests in accordance with the Statements. Other intangible
assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Registrant
adopted the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. As the Registrant does not have
any amounts for goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets on its balance
sheets, the adoption of No. 142 has no effect on the earnings or the financial
position of the Registrant.

INVESTMENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES

The Registrant accounts for certain of its investments under FASB 115 as
securities available-for-sale. Available for sale securities are carried at fair
value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in
value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are
included in investment income or loss. The cost of securities sold is based on
the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities
classified as available-for-sale are included in investment income. The fair
value of marketable securities is based on quoted market value.

The Registrant reviews its investments to determine if the value shows a decline
that has been deemed other-than-temporary. Since June 30, 2001, there has been a
broad decline in the public equity markets, including investments held by the
Registrant. As a result, for the year ended June 30, 2002, the Registrant
recorded a loss of 249,000 on

9

equity investments as a result of declines in the fair market value of certain
of its equity investments deemed to be other-than-temporary.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

The Registrant recognizes revenue from product sales upon transfer of title,
which is generally upon shipment. An estimate of reserves is recorded for
anticipated returns and credit memos which will be issued on sales recognized to
date. The SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101, "Revenue
Recognition", provides guidance on the application of accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States to selected revenue recognition issues.
The Registrant has concluded its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
and SAB No. 101.

ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

Accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for amounts that may
become uncollectible in the future. This estimated allowance is based primarily
on management's evaluation of the financial condition of the customer and
historical experience.

PRICE REDUCTIONS

As of June 30, 2002, all customer price reductions have been accounted for,
therefore no amounts have been accrued.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost, determined by the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, was used for certain raw material inventories;
 967,000 and 1,221,000 at June 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The remaining
inventories are costed using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. If
inventories valued on LIFO had been valued at current cost, amounts reported at
June 30 would have been increased by 497,000 and 636,000 in fiscal 2002 and
2001, respectively.

WORKERS' COMPENSATION RESERVE

The Registrant is self insured for workers' compensation claims. Losses are
accrued based on an estimate of the ultimate aggregate liability for claims
incurred, using certain assumptions based on the Registrant's experience under
this program. At June 30, 2002 and 2001, the Registrant accrued approximately
 1,097,000 and 1,335,000, respectively, included in Payroll and employee
benefits.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

The foregoing discussion and analysis contains a number of "forward looking
statements" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended, with respect to the expectation for
future periods which are subject to various uncertainties, including
competition, the loss of, or reduction in business with, the Registrant's
principal customers, work stoppages, strikes and slowdowns at the Registrant's
facilities and those of its customers; adverse changes in economic conditions
generally and those of the automotive industry, specifically.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

The Registrant's market risk is limited to interest rate risk on the Revolving
Credit and Term Loan Agreement and its lease-purchase obligation. At June 30,
2002, the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, debt and investments approximate fair value.
Accordingly, management believes this risk is not material.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FEDERAL SCREW WORKS

NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost,
determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, was used for certain raw
material inventories, 967,000 and 1,221,000 at June 30, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The remaining inventories are costed using the first-in, first-out
(FIFO) method. If inventories valued on LIFO had been valued at current cost,
amounts reported at June 30 would have been increased by 497,000 and 636,000
in 2002 and 2001, respectively.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost,
which includes the cost of interest which is capitalized during construction of
significant additions. Provisions for depreciation are based upon the estimated
useful lives of the respective assets and are computed by the straight-line
method for financial reporting purposes and by accelerated methods for income
tax purposes.

INVESTMENTS: The Registrant has invested approximately 2,850,000 and 2,400,000
as of June 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively, which has been designated for
payment of certain liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. These
amounts were recorded in miscellaneous assets within the balance sheets.
Approximately 1,161,000, 961,000, and 728,000 of the Registrant's investments
were held in equity securities, debt securities, and short-term investments,
respectively, as of June 30, 2002. Approximately 1,289,000, 728,000 and
 383,000 of the Registrant's investments were held in equity securities, debt
securities, and short-term investments, respectively, as of June 30, 2001. Debt
securities are scheduled to mature beginning in December 2005 and ending in
November 2012. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 115 ("FASB 115"), the Registrant has classified all investments as
"available-for-sale" because they are freely tradable. As of June 30, 2002, the
Registrant recorded a decrease in unrealized loss of 11,000, net of tax, from
its investments, which is reflected in the statements of shareholders' equity.

Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains
and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity net of
applicable income taxes. Realized gains and losses and declines in value deemed
to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in
other income. The cost basis for realized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities is determined on a specific identification basis.

Management continually evaluates whether changes in the value of such
investments should be considered other-than-temporary. Since June 30, 2001,
there has been a broad decline in the public equity markets, including
investments held by the Registrant. As a result, for the year ended June 30,
2002, the Registrant recorded a loss of 249,000 on equity investments as a
result of declines in the fair market value of certain of its equity investments
deemed to be other-than-temporary.

REVENUE RECOGNITION: The Registrant recognizes revenue when title to goods
transfer, generally when goods are shipped to the customer.

OTHER INCOME: Included in other income is 2,180,000 as a result of the sale of
stock acquired in connection with the demutualization of insurance companies.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: At June 30, 2002, the carrying amounts
reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
debt and investments approximate fair value.

NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: Net income per common share is based on weighted
average number of common shares outstanding of 1,263,507 in 2002; 1,299,137 in
2001 and 1,326,803 in 2000.

RECLASSIFICATION: Certain items in the prior year financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the presentation used in 2002.

16

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FEDERAL SCREW WORKS

USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results
could differ form those estimates.

NOTE 2 - DEBT

Long-term debt at June 30 consists of the following:

Less current maturities 0 0
 ---------- ----------
 6,340,000 6,735,000
 ========== ==========

The Registrant has a 25,000,000 revolving credit and term loan agreement with a
bank. The Registrant has the option to convert borrowings thereunder (classified
as long-term debt) to a term note through October 31, 2004, the expiration date
of the agreement. Payments under the term note, if the conversion option is
exercised, would be made quarterly commencing three months following conversion
until maturity of the term note on October 31, 2006. Interest (3.125 at June
30, 2002) on outstanding borrowings is determined based on the prime rate, or at
the Registrant's option, an alternative variable market rate. The Registrant
also pays a commitment fee of 3/8 on the unused portion of the revolving
credit.

The Registrant is in compliance with covenants of the revolving credit and term
loan agreement including the requirements to meet certain financial ratios.

Interest paid by the Registrant during fiscal 2002, fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000
aggregated 353,000, 372,000, and 69,000, respectively. Interest capitalized
into property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2002 and 2001 was 169,000 and
 359,000, respectively.

NOTE 3 - LEASES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

At June 30, 2002, the aggregate minimum rental commitments for various
noncancelable operating leases with initial terms of one year or more are as
follows:

NOTE 5 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Registrant sponsors three defined benefit pension plans covering
substantially all employees. Benefits under two of the plans are based on
negotiated rates times years of service. Under the remaining plan, benefits are
based on compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement and
years of service. It is the Registrant's policy to make contributions to these
plans sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements of the applicable laws and
regulations, plus such additional amounts, if any, as the Registrant's actuarial
consultants advise to be appropriate.

In accounting for pension plans, the Registrant used a discount rate of 7.25 in
2002 and 2001, a 5 rate of increase in compensation, and an 8 expected rate of
return on assets. Plan assets for these plans consist principally of fixed
income instruments, equity securities and participation in insurance company
contracts.

The weighted average discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at June 30, 2002 and 2001 was 7.25 .

For measurement purposes, a 7.0 annual rate of increase in the per capita cost
of covered health care benefits was assumed for fiscal 2002. The rate was
assumed to decrease gradually to 5.5 for 2005 and remain at that level
thereafter. Assumed health care cost trends have a significant effect on the
amounts reported for the health care plan. For example, increasing the assumed
health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would increase
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of June 30, 2002 and 2001
by 2,302,000 and 2,312,000, respectively, and the aggregate of the service and
interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the
year ended June 30, 2002 and 2001 by 256,000 and 271,000, respectively.

The Registrant sponsors a supplemental executive retirement plan which covers
certain executives of the Registrant. The net periodic pension expense for the
plan was 807,000 and 771,000 in fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively. The
actuarial present value of vested benefit obligations approximated 2,607,000 at
June 30, 2002 and 2,372,000 at

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FEDERAL SCREW WORKS

June 30, 2001, respectively. The Registrant has invested 2,329,000 as of June
30, 2002 to cover obligations of the plan.

The Registrant sponsors a retirement plan for directors who are not employees of
the Registrant. The net periodic pension expense for the plan was 41,000 in
fiscal 2002, 47,000 in fiscal 2001, and 79,000 in fiscal 2000. The actuarial
present value of vested benefit obligations approximated 932,000 at June 30,
2002 and 891,000 at June 30, 2001. The plan is currently not fully funded.

NOTE 6 - INDUSTRY INFORMATION

Approximately 91 of the Registrant's net sales in fiscal 2002 and 85 in fiscal
2001 were made either directly or indirectly to automotive companies.

Customers comprising 10 or greater of the Registrant's net sales are summarized
as follows:

NOTE 7 - LITIGATION

The Registrant is involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course
of business. Management, after taking into consideration legal counsel's
evaluation of such actions, is of the opinion that their outcome will not have a
significant effect on the Registrant's financial statements.

NOTE 8 -- FOREIGN SALES

terms provide for settlement in U.S. dollars.

Report of Independent Auditors

Board of Directors
Federal Screw Works

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Federal Screw Works as of
June 30, 2002 and 2001, and the related statements of operations, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
2002. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in Item
14(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Registrant's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Federal Screw Works at June 30,
2002 and 2001, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended June 30, 2002, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

Directors, no further notice of such regular meetings of the Board shall be
required.

 SECTION 10. Special Meetings of Board. A special meeting or special
meetings of the Board may be called at any time by the President or any two

setting forth the time, place and purpose of the

4
 
meeting, such notice to be dispatched (by air mail, by regular mail, telegram or
cable as circumstances warrant) at least five (5) days (exclusive of Saturday,
Sunday and holidays) in advance of such meeting. Action taken at any such
meeting shall not be invalidated for want of such notice if such notice shall be

taken without a meeting if, before or after the action, all members of the Board
or of the committee consent thereto in writing. The written consent shall be

Corporation at its registered office in Michigan. Every notice to Directors

the provisions of Section 10 above, to the sendee at his, her or its last
address as last filed in writing with the Secretary of the Corporation, or to
the sendee's place of residence or business if the sendee has not filed a
particular address with the Secretary; provided further that any such notice in
fact received by the sendee within such time as it would have been received if
sent to the sendee's last address as last filed with the Secretary or to the

5
 
sendee's place of residence or business if the sendee has not filed a particular
address with the Secretary, shall be deemed duly served.

 SECTION 13. Waiver of Notice. When, under the Michigan Business
Corporation Act as now existing or as may hereafter be amended, or under the
Articles of Incorporation of this Corporation, or under these By-Laws or by the
terms of an agreement or instrument, this Corporation or the Board or any
committee thereof may take action after notice to any person or after lapse of a
prescribed period of time, the action may be taken without notice and without
lapse of the period of time, if any time before or after the action is completed
the person entitled to notice or to participate in the action to be taken or, in
case of a shareholder, by his attorney-in-fact, submits a signed waiver of such
requirements.

 SECTION 14. Signing of Notices and Waivers thereof. Any notice or
waiver thereof provided for under the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws

 ARTICLE III

meeting constitute a quorum at the meeting. The shareholders present in person

vote of the shares present.

6

entitled to vote separately on an item of business, this section applies in
determining the presence of a quorum of such class or series for transaction of
the item of business.

 SECTION 2. Quorum and Vote of Board of Directors and Committees. A
majority of the members of the Board then in office, or of the members of a
committee thereof, constitutes a quorum for transaction of business. The vote of
the majority of members present at a meeting at which a quorum is present
constitutes the action of the Board or of the committee. Amendment of the
By-Laws by the Board requires the vote of not less than a majority of the
members of the Board then in office.

 ARTICLE IV

 VOTING, ELECTIONS AND PROXIES

SECTION 1. Vote of Shareholders.

 (1) Each outstanding share is entitled to one vote on each
matter submitted to a vote. A vote may be cast either orally or in writing.

 (2) When an action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders,
it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of shares
entitled to vote thereon, except as otherwise provided in the Articles of
Incorporation of the Company or in these By-Laws; and, without limitation of the
generality of the foregoing, except as provided in these By-Laws in Article IV,
Sections 9, 10, 11 and 12; and in Article V, Sections 1 and 1-A.

 SECTION 2. Record Date.

 (1) For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to
notice of and to vote at a meeting of shareholders or an adjournment thereof, or
for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to receive payment of a
dividend or allotment of a right, or for the purpose

7
 
of any other action, the Board may fix, in advance, a date as the record date
for any such determination of shareholders. The date shall not be more than 60
or less than 10 days before the date of the meeting, nor more than 60 days
before any other action.

 (2) If a record date is not fixed (a) the record date for
determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
shareholders shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on
which notice is given, or, if no notice is given, the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held, and (b) the record date for determining
shareholders for any purpose other than that specified in Subdivision (a) shall
be the close of business on the day on which the resolution of the Board
relating thereto is adopted.

 (3) When a determination of shareholders of record entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in
this Section, the determination applies to any adjournment of the meeting,
unless the Board fixes a new record date under this Section for the adjourned
meeting.

 SECTION 3. Proxies. No proxy shall be deemed operative unless and until
signed by the shareholder or his authorized agent or representative, in whose
name the certificate for the particular shares is registered, nor unless said
proxy is filed with the Secretary of the Corporation prior to or at the time of
the particular meeting of the shareholders.

 SECTION 4. Vote of Shareholder Corporation. Shares standing in the name
of another domestic or foreign corporation may be voted by an officer or agent,
or by proxy appointed by an officer or agent or by some other person, who by
action of its Board or pursuant to its By-Laws, shall be appointed to vote such
shares.

8
 
 SECTION 5. Vote by Pledgee. A shareholder whose shares are pledged is
entitled to vote the shares until they have been transferred into the name of
the pledgee, or a nominee of the pledgee.

 SECTION 6. Vote by Fiduciary. Shares held by a person in a
representative or fiduciary capacity may be voted by him without a transfer of
the shares into his name. Shares held jointly by fiduciaries, where the
instrument or order appointing the fiduciaries does not otherwise direct, shall
be voted as follows:

 (1) If only one fiduciary votes, his act binds all.

 (2) If more than one fiduciary votes, the shares shall be
voted as the majority of the fiduciaries determines.

 (3) If the fiduciaries are equally divided as to how the
shares shall be voted, a court having jurisdiction, in an action brought by any
of the fiduciaries or by any beneficiary, may appoint an additional person to
act with the fiduciaries in such matter, and the stock shall be voted by the
majority of such fiduciaries and such additional person.

 SECTION 7. Vote by Co-Owners. Shares held by two or more persons as
joint tenants or as tenants in common may be voted at a meeting of shareholders
by any of such persons, unless another joint tenant or tenant in common seeks to
vote any of such shares in person or by proxy. In the latter event, the written
agreement, if any, which governs the manner in which the shares shall be voted,
controls if presented at the meeting. If no such agreement is presented at the
meeting, the majority in interest of the joint tenants or tenants in common
present shall control the manner of voting. If there is no such majority, the
shares, for the purpose of voting, shall be divided among such joint tenants or
tenants in common in accordance with their interest in the shares.

9
 
 SECTION 8. Inspectors of Elections.

 (1) Inspectors of election at a shareholders' meeting need not
be appointed unless requested by a shareholder present in person or by proxy and
entitled to vote at the meeting. The Board, in advance of a shareholders'
meeting, may appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting or any
adjournment thereof. If inspectors are not so appointed, the person presiding at
a shareholders' meeting may, and on request of a shareholder entitled to vote
thereat shall, appoint one or more inspectors. In case a person appointed fails
to appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the Board in
advance of the meeting or at the meeting by the person presiding thereat.

 (2) The inspectors shall determine the number of shares
outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares represented at the meeting,
the existence of a quorum, the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive
votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine challenges and questions arising
in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate votes, ballots or
consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the
election or vote with fairness to all shareholders. On request of the person
presiding at the meeting or a shareholder entitled to vote thereat, the
inspectors shall make and execute a written report to the person presiding at
the meeting of any of the facts found by them and matters determined by them.
The report is prima facie evidence of the facts stated and of the vote as
certified by the inspectors.

 SECTION 9. Two-Thirds Vote of Shareholders Required on Mergers, Etc.
The affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the
outstanding shares of stock of this Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall
be required:

10

or consolidation of this Corporation with or into any corporation or other
business entity;

(b) to authorize any sale, lease, transfer, exchange,
mortgage, pledge or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
property and assets of this Corporation, except in transactions the purpose of
which is to finance this Corporation's present or future business operations,
and which financing transactions have been approved by a majority of the Board
of Directors of this Corporation;

 (c) to authorize the issuance, transfer or delivery by this
Corporation of any equity security of this Corporation in exchange or payment
for the securities or assets (including cash) of any other person, corporation
or other business entity, in a transaction for which the approval of
stockholders of the Corporation is required by law or by any agreement between
this Corporation and any other party, or by these Articles. "Equity security" as
used in this Article shall mean any capital stock, any security convertible into
capital stock, and any warrant, option, agreement or right to subscribe for or
purchase any capital stock; or

 (d) to adopt a plan of, or otherwise cause, a dissolution of
this Corporation.

 (e) The provisions of this Section shall not be applicable to
any transaction with any corporation of which a majority of the outstanding
shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote in elections of directors is
owned of record or beneficially by this Corporation and its subsidiaries, if
any, nor to mergers under Sections 704 and 711 of the Michigan Business
Corporation Act where this Corporation or a wholly owned subsidiary of this
Corporation is the surviving corporation.

 SECTION 10. Two-Thirds Vote of Shareholders Required for Removal of
Director for Cause. No director of this Corporation may be removed from office
without cause. At any

11
 
meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose, the affirmative vote of the
holders of two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of stock of this
Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to remove any director
from office for cause.

 SECTION 11. Two-Thirds Vote of Shareholders Required for Election of
Directors. Commencing with the 1975 annual stockholders meeting, and at all
stockholder elections of directors thereafter, directors shall be elected only
by vote of the holders of two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of each
class of stock entitled to vote to elect directors.

 SECTION 12. Two-Thirds Vote of Shareholders Required for Amendment of
Certain Provisions of the Articles of Incorporation. Notwithstanding the
provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and any provisions of the By-Laws of
this Corporation, no amendment to the Articles of Incorporation shall amend,
modify or repeal any or all of the provisions of Article IX, Article X, Article
XI, Article XII, or Article XIII, of the Articles of Incorporation unless so
adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds (2/3)
of the outstanding shares of stock of this Corporation entitled to vote in
elections of directors.

 ARTICLE V

 BOARD OF DIRECTORS

SECTION 1. Number and Term of Directors. The business, property and
affairs of this Corporation shall be managed by its Board of Directors, except
as otherwise provided by law, by the Articles of Incorporation or by these
By-Laws, including amendments thereto. No director need be a shareholder. Each
director shall hold office for the term for which he is elected and until his
successor is elected and qualified, or until his resignation or removal. A
director may resign by written notice to the Corporation. The resignation is
effective upon its receipt by the Corporation or a subsequent time as set forth
in the notice of resignation. In accordance with

12
 
Article X of the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Article V, Section 1-A
of the Company's By-Laws, the number of directors which shall constitute the
whole Board shall be seven and the number of directors which shall constitute
that class of directors whose term of office expires in 1978 shall be three. No
director of this Corporation may be removed from office without cause. At any
meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose, the affirmative vote of the
holders of two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of stock of this
Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall be required to remove any director
from office for cause.

SECTION 1-A. Division of Directors into Three Classes. The directors of
this Corporation shall be divided into three classes, each class to be as equal
in number as possible. The first class ("Class A") shall hold office for one
year until the annual meeting of stockholders in 1975, the second class ("Class
B") for two years until the annual meeting of stockholders in 1976, and the
third class ("Class C") for three years until the annual meeting of stockholders
in 1977. At each succeeding annual election after such classification, directors
shall be elected for a three-year term, to succeed the class of directors whose
term expires in that year. The number of directors which shall constitute the
whole Board shall be seven, but this number may be increased or decreased from
time to time by a majority vote of the directors then in office, but in no case
shall the number be less than three. During the intervals between annual
meetings of stockholders, any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors caused
by resignation, removal, death or other incapacity, and any newly created

may be filled by the Board for a term of office continuing only until the next
election of directors by the shareholders. If, because of death, resignation or
other cause, the Corporation has no directors in office, an officer, a

at a subsequent time specified in the notice of resignation. An officer may be
removed by the Board of Directors with or without cause. The removal of an
officer shall be without prejudice to his or her contract rights, if any. The

 INDEMNIFICATION OF
 OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS

SECTION 1. Actions Other Than Actions by or in the Right of the
Corporation. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or
is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the
fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted
in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation or its shareholders, and with respect to
any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his
conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding, by
judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or
its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did
not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or
not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or its shareholders, and,
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to
believe that his conduct was unlawful. The indemnification provided by this
Article XV and by all Sections of this Article shall extend to any Company
officer, director or employee who was, is or may become at the request of the
Company a trustee, administrator or fiduciary under any pension, retirement, or
other benefit plan established by the Company (or who was, is or may be deemed a
fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act

29
 
of 1974 or like legislation), or who was, is or may become a member or trustee
of the Federal Screw Works Foundation or of any other foundation or trust
established by the Company.

Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party to or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or
in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of
the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or
settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation or its shareholders and except that no indemnification shall be made
in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his
duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which
such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite
the adjudication of liability but in view of all circumstances of the case, such
person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which
such court shall deem proper.

 SECTION 3. Indemnification Against Expenses.

 (1) To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of
any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article
XV, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified
against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by
him in connection therewith.

30
 
 (2) Any indemnification under Sections 1 or 2 (unless ordered
by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific
case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer,
employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 1 and 2. Such determination
shall be made in either of the following ways:

 (a) By the Board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting
of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding.

 (b) If such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if
obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal
counsel in a written opinion.

 (c) By the shareholders.

 SECTION 4. Expense Advances. Expenses incurred in defending a civil or
criminal action, suit or proceeding described in Sections 1 or 2 shall be paid
by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding as authorized in the manner provided in Subsection (2) of Section 3
upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer,
employee or agent to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined
that he is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation.

 SECTION 5. Other Agreements, Duration. Nothing contained in this
Article shall affect any rights to indemnification to which persons other than
directors and officers may be entitled by contract or otherwise by law. The
indemnification provided by this Article continues as to a person who has ceased
to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of
the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.

person who is or was an officer or director of the Corporation to the fullest
extent permitted by

indemnification, the Act shall be interpreted and applied as follows: "other
enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; "fines" shall include any
excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and
"serving at the request of the corporation" shall include any service as a
director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties
on, or involves services by, the director, officer, employee, or agent with
respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a
person who acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to
be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit
plan shall be considered to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation or its shareholders" as referred to in the Act.

 SECTION 7. Insurance. The Corporation shall have power to purchase and
maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer,
