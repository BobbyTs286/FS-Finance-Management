 PART I
Item 1. BUSINESS

 Fidelity Leasing Income Fund VIII, L.P. (the "Fund"), a Delaware limited
partnership, was organized in 1990 and acquires computer equipment, including
printers, tape and disk storage devices, data communications equipment, com-
puter terminals, technical workstations, networking equipment, as well as other
electronic equipment that is leased to third parties on a short-term basis.
The Fund's principal objective is to generate leasing revenues for distri-
bution. The Fund manages the equipment, releasing or disposing of equipment
as it comes off lease in order to achieve its principal objective. The Fund
does not borrow funds to purchase equipment.

 The Fund generally acquires equipment subject to a lease. Purchases of
equipment for lease are typically made through equipment leasing brokers,
under a sale-leaseback arrangement directly from lessees owning equipment,
from the manufacturer either pursuant to a purchase agreement relating to
significant quantities of equipment or on an ad hoc basis to meet the needs
of a particular lessee.

 The equipment leasing industry is highly competitive. The Fund competes
with leasing companies, equipment manufacturers and distributors, and entities
similar to the Fund (including similar programs sponsored by the General
Partner), some of which have greater financial resources than the Fund.
Other leasing companies and equipment manufacturers and distributors may be in
a position to offer equipment to prospective lessees on financial terms which
are more favorable than those which the Fund can offer. They may also be in
a position to offer trade-in-privileges, maintenance contracts and other
services which the Fund may not be able to offer. Equipment manufacturers and
distributors may offer to sell equipment on terms and conditions (such as
liberal financing terms and exchange privileges) which will afford benefits to
the purchaser similar to those obtained through leases. As a result of the
advantages which certain of its competitors may have, the Fund may find it
necessary to lease its equipment on a less favorable basis than certain of
its competitors.

 A brief description of the types of equipment in which the Fund has
invested as of December 31, 2000, together with information concerning the
users of such equipment is contained in Item 2, following.

 The Fund does not have any employees. All persons who work on the Fund
are employees of the General Partner.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations

 Fidelity Leasing Income Fund VIII, L.P. had revenues of 678,950,
 1,051,009 and 2,790,169 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. Rental income from the leasing of equipment accounted
for 42 , 56 and 90 of total revenues in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
The decrease in total revenues in 2000 and 1999 was primarily attributable to
the decrease in rental income. Rental income decreased by approximately
 307,000 in 2000 because of equipment under operating leases that terminated
and either was renewed at lower rental rates or was sold during both 2000 and
1999. In 1999, rental income decreased by approximately 1,207,000 because of
equipment that terminated and was sold during both 1999 and 1998. Addition-
ally, the Fund collected the remaining rents owed on certain leases during the
last quarter of 1998. As a result, the Fund recognized 712,000 of rental
income during this period which also accounted for a portion of the decrease
in rental income in 1999. The fluctuation in earned income on direct financing
leases also contributed to the decrease in total revenues in 2000 but mitigated
the amount of the decrease in total revenues in 1999. The Fund invested in
 1,851,000, 1,858,000 and 3,312,000 of direct financing leases during the
years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, that accounted for
the increase in earned income recognized. However, in October 1999, one of the
direct financing leases was sold which caused the overall decrease in earned
income on direct financing leases in 2000. Furthermore, the decrease in net
gain on sale of equipment also contributed to the total decrease in income in
2000 and 1999. The Fund recognized a net gain on sale of equipment of 44,873,
 49,407 and 85,228 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.

 Expenses were 316,614, 686,370 and 2,696,271 for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Depreciation expense comprised
40 , 53 and 78 of total expenses during the years ended December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively. The decrease in total expenses in 2000 and 1999
was primarily related to the decrease in depreciation expense. In 2000, depre-
ciation expense decreased because of equipment that terminated and was sold.
The decrease in total expenses between 2000, 1999 and 1998 was also related to
the decrease in write-down of equipment to net realizable value. Based upon
the quarterly review of the recoverability of the undepreciated cost of rental
equipment, there was no write-down of equipment to net realizable value charged
to operations during the year ended December 31, 2000. For the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 1998, 80,267 and 246,318, respectively, was charged to
operations to write down equipment to its estimated net realizable value.
Currently, the Fund's practice is to review the recoverability of its undepre-
ciated costs of rental equipment quarterly. The Fund's policy, as part of this
review, is to analyze such factors as releasing of equipment, technological
developments and information provided in third party publications. In accor-
dance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, the Fund writes down its rental equipment to its estimated net
realizable value when the amounts are reasonably estimated and only recognizes
gains, if any, upon actual sale of its rental equipment. Any future losses are
dependent upon unanticipated technological developments affecting the types of
equipment in the portfolio in subsequent years. In addition, the decrease in
general and administrative expense to related party decreased in 2000 and 1999
because of a decrease in the amount of expenses charged by the General Partner

or its parent company for services and materials provided to the Fund during
these years. Furthermore, the decrease in management fee to related party
resulting from the decrease in rental income in 2000 and 1999 also contributed
to the overall decrease in expenses during both 2000 and 1999.

 The Fund's net income was 362,336, 364,639 and 93,898 for the years
ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The earnings per equiv-
alent limited partnership unit, after earnings allocated to the General
Partner, were 26.69, 27.55 and 6.87 based on a weighted average number of
equivalent limited partnership units outstanding of 13,438, 13,105 and 13,312
for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

 The Fund generated cash from operations of 442,771, 760,331 and
 2,358,458, for the purpose of determining cash available for distribution
during the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The
Fund distributed 240,000, 180,000 and 180,000 of those amounts during the
period April 1 through December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and
during the first quarter of 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Fund distributed 90,000,
 60,000 and 60,000 of those amounts, respectively. The Fund also paid 40,000
of cash distributions to partners during the first quarter of 1998 for the last
quarter of the previous year. For financial statement purposes, the Fund
records cash distributions to partners on a cash basis in the period in which
they are paid.

Analysis of Financial Condition

 The Fund began the process of dissolution during 1999. As provided in
the Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, the assets of the Fund shall be
liquidated as promptly as is consistent with obtaining their fair value.
During this time, the Fund will continue to look for opportunities to purchase
equipment under operating leases or invest in direct financing leases for lease
terms consistent with the plan of dissolution. The Fund purchased 231,262
of equipment subject to operating leases during the twelve months ended
December 31, 1998. The Fund also invested in 1,851,498, 1,857,519 and
 3,312,383 of direct financing leases during the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

 The cash position of the Fund is reviewed daily and cash is invested on
a short-term basis.

 The Fund's cash from operations is expected to continue to be adequate to
cover all operating expenses and contingencies during the next twelve month
period.

 (b) In 1990, the General Partner contributed 1,000 to the capital of

 Fund's outstanding securities. The General Partner owns a general part-
 nership interest which entitles it to receive 1 of cash distributions
 until the Limited Partners have received an amount equal to the purchase

 price of their units plus an 11 cumulative compounded priority return;
 thereafter 10 . The General Partner will also share in net income equal
 to the greater of its cash distributions or 1 of net income or to the
 extent there are losses, 1 of such losses.

 (c) There are no arrangements known to the Fund that would, at any
 subsequent date, result in a change in control of the Fund.

Item 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

 During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Fund was charged by the
General Partner 49,583 of management fees. The General Partner will
continue to receive 4 or 2 of rental payments on equipment under operating
leases and full pay-out leases, respectively, for administrative and manage-
ment services performed on behalf of the Fund. Full pay-out leases are
noncancellable leases for which rental payments during the initial term of
the lease are at least sufficient to recover the purchase price of the equip-
ment, including acquisition fees. All of the direct financing leases in
which the Fund has invested meet the criteria for a full pay-out lease and
pay a 2 management fee to the General Partner. This management fee is paid
monthly only if and when the Limited Partners have received distributions for
the period from the initial closing through the end of the most recent
calendar quarter equal to a return for such period at a rate of 11 per year
on the aggregate amount paid for their units.

 The General Partner may also receive up to 3 of the proceeds from the
sale of the Fund's equipment for services and activities to be performed in
connection with the disposition of equipment. The payment of this sales fee
is deferred until the Limited Partners have received cash distributions equal
to the purchase price of their units plus an 11 cumulative compounded
priority return. Based on current estimates, it is not expected that the Fund
will be required to pay this sales fee to the General Partner.

 The General Partner receives 1 of cash distributions until the Limited
Partners have received an amount equal to the purchase price of their units
plus an 11 cumulative compounded priority return. Thereafter, the General
Partner will receive 10 of cash distributions. During 2000, the General
Partner received cash distributions of 3,000.

 The Fund incurred 84,975 of reimbursable costs to the General Partner
and its parent company for services and materials provided in connection with
the administration of the Fund during 2000.

The Partners
Fidelity Leasing Income Fund VIII, L.P.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Fidelity Leasing
Income Fund VIII, L.P. as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related
statements of operations, partners' capital and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the finan-
cial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examin-
ing, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting princi-
ples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Fidelity Leasing
Income Fund VIII, L.P. as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

FIDELITY LEASING INCOME FUND VIII, L.P.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

 Fidelity Leasing Income Fund VIII, L.P. (the "Fund") was formed on
November 21, 1990. The General Partner of the Fund is F.L. Partnership
Management, Inc. ("FLPMI") which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Resource
Leasing, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Resource America, Inc. (Resource
America). The Fund is managed by the General Partner. The Fund's limited
partnership interests are not publicly traded. There is no market for the
Fund's limited partnership interests and it is unlikely that any will develop.
The Fund acquires computer equipment, including printers, tape and disk storage
devices, data communications equipment, computer terminals, technical work-
stations and networking equipment, as well as other electronic equipment. This
equipment is leased to third parties throughout the United States on a short-
term basis.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Concentration of Credit Risk

 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Fund to concentra-
tions of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments. The
Fund places its temporary investments in money market savings accounts.

 Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivables are
limited due to the dispersion of the Fund's lessees over different industries
and geographies.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

 The Fund reviews its assets to determine if it has any long-lived assets
that are carried on the books for an amount that may not be recoverable. If
it is determined that an asset's estimated future cash flows will not be suf-
ficient to recover its carrying amount, an impairment charge will be recorded.

Equipment Held for Sale or Lease

 Equipment held for sale or lease is carried at its estimated net realiz-
able value.

Use of Estimates

 In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Accounting for Leases

 The Fund's leasing operations consist of both operating and direct
financing leases. Under the operating method of accounting for leases, the

 F-7

FIDELITY LEASING INCOME FUND VIII, L.P.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

cost of the leased equipment is recorded as an asset and depreciated on a
straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, up to seven years.
Acquisition fees associated with lease placements are allocated to equipment
when purchased and depreciated as part of equipment cost. Rental income con-
sists primarily of monthly periodic rentals due under the terms of the leases.
Generally, during the remaining terms of existing operating leases, the Fund
will not recover all of the undepreciated cost and related expenses of its
rental equipment and is prepared to remarket the equipment in future years.
Upon sale or other disposition of assets, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss,
if any, is reflected in income.

 Under the direct financing method of accounting for leases, income (the
excess of the aggregate future rentals and estimated unguaranteed residuals
upon expiration of the lease over the related equipment cost) is recognized
over the life of the lease using the interest method.

Income Taxes

 Federal and State income tax regulations provide that taxes on the income
or benefits from losses of the Fund are reportable by the partners in their
individual income tax returns. Accordingly, no provision for such taxes has
been made in the accompanying financial statements.

Statements of Cash Flows

 For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Fund considers all
highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.

Net Income per Equivalent Limited Partnership Unit

 Net income per equivalent limited partnership unit is computed by
dividing net income allocated to limited partners by the weighted average
number of equivalent limited partnership units outstanding during the year.
The weighted average number of equivalent units outstanding during the year
is computed based on the weighted average monthly limited partners' capital
account balances, converted into equivalent units at 500 per unit.

Significant Fourth Quarter Adjustments

 Currently, the Fund's practice is to review the recoverability of its
undepreciated costs of rental equipment quarterly. The Fund's policy, as part
of this review, is to analyze such factors as releasing of equipment, tech-
nological developments and information provided in third party publications.
Based upon this review, there were no significant fourth quarter adjustments
for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999. However, the Fund recorded
an adjustment of approximately 73,000 or 5.48 per equivalent limited
partnership unit to write down its rental equipment in the fourth quarter
of 1998.

FIDELITY LEASING INCOME FUND VIII, L.P.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

3. ALLOCATION OF PARTNERSHIP INCOME, LOSS AND CASH DISTRIBUTIONS

 Cash distributions, if any, are made monthly as follows: 99 to the
Limited Partners and 1 to the General Partner, until the Limited Partners
have received an amount equal to the purchase price of their units, plus an
11 compounded priority return (an amount equal to 11 compounded annually on
the portion of the purchase price not previously distributed); thereafter,
90 to the Limited Partners and 10 to the General Partner.

 Net Losses are allocated 99 to the Limited Partners and 1 to the
General Partner. The General Partner is allocated Net Income equal to its
cash distributions, but not less than 1 of Net Income, with the balance
allocated to the Limited Partners.

 Net Income (Losses) allocated to the Limited Partners are allocated to
individual limited partners based on the ratio of the daily weighted average
partner's net capital account balance (after deducting related commission
expense) to the total daily weighted average of the Limited Partners' net
capital account balances.

4. EQUIPMENT LEASED

 Equipment on lease consists of equipment under operating leases. The
lessees have agreements with the manufacturer to provide maintenance for the
leased equipment. The Fund's operating leases are for initial lease terms of
11 to 36 months.

 In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, the Fund writes down its rental equipment to its estimated
net realizable value when the amounts are reasonably estimated and only recog-
nizes gains upon actual sale of its rental equipment. As a result, in 2000,
there was no write-down of equipment to net realizable value. In 1999 and
1998, approximately 80,000 and 246,000, respectively, was charged to write-
down of equipment to net realizable value. Any future losses are dependent
upon unanticipated technological developments affecting the equipment in
subsequent years.

 Unguaranteed residuals for direct financing leases represent the
estimated amounts recoverable at lease termination from lease extensions or
disposition of the equipment. The Fund reviews these residual values
quarterly. If the equipment's fair market value is below the estimated
residual value, an adjustment is made.

 2003 - 177,000
 ________ __________
 128,000 3,211,000
 ======== ==========

5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 The General Partner receives 4 or 2 of rental payments from equipment
under operating leases and full pay-out leases, respectively, for adminis-
trative and management services performed on behalf of the Fund. Full pay-out
leases are noncancellable leases for which the rental payments due during the
initial term of the lease are at least sufficient to recover the purchase price
of the equipment, including acquisition fees. This management fee is paid
monthly only if and when the Limited Partners have received distributions for
the period from the initial closing through the end of the most recent calendar
quarter equal to a return for such period at a rate of 11 per year on the
aggregate amount paid for their units.

 The General Partner may also receive up to 3 of the proceeds from the
sale of the Fund's equipment for services and activities to be performed in
connection with the disposition of equipment. The payment of this sales fee
is deferred until the Limited Partners have received cash distributions equal
to the purchase price of their units plus an 11 cumulative compounded
priority return. Based on current estimates, it is not expected that the
Fund will be required to pay this sales fee to the General Partner.

 Additionally, the General Partner and its parent company are reimbursed
by the Fund for certain costs of services and materials used by or for the
Fund except those items covered by the above-mentioned fees. Following is
