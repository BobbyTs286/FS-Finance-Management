Item 1. Business.

 (a) General Development of Business

 AFG Investment Trust A (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware business
trust in accordance with the Delaware Business Trust Act on February 26, 1992
for the purpose of acquiring and leasing to third parties a diversified
portfolio of capital equipment. Participants' capital initially consisted of
contributions of 1,000 from the Managing Trustee, AFG ASIT Corporation, 1,000
from the Special Beneficiary, Equis Financial Group Limited Partnership
(formerly known as American Finance Group), a Massachusetts limited partnership,
("EFG" or the "Advisor") and 100 from the Initial Beneficiary, AFG Assignor
Corporation, a wholly-owned affiliate of EFG. The Trust issued an aggregate of
549,218 Beneficiary Interests (hereinafter referred to as Class A Interests) at
a subscription price of 25.00 each 13,730,450 in total) to 645 investors on
May 29, 1992. On July 18, 1997, the Trust issued 826,072 Class B Interests at
 5.00 each 4,130,360 in total), of which (i) 822,863 interests are held by
Equis II Corporation, an affiliate of EFG, and (ii) 3,209 interests are held by
7 Class A investors. The Trust repurchased 65,402 Class A Interests on October
10, 1997 using proceeds from the issuance of Class B Interests. On April 28,
1998, the Trust repurchased 1,800 additional Class A Interests. Accordingly,
there are 482,016 Class A Interests currently outstanding.

 The Trust has one Managing Trustee, AFG ASIT Corporation, a Massachusetts
corporation, and one Special Beneficiary, EFG. The Managing Trustee is
responsible for the general management and business affairs of the Trust. EFG
acts as Advisor to the Trust and provides services in connection with the
acquisition and remarketing of the Trust's assets. AFG ASIT Corporation is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Equis II Corporation and an affiliate of EFG. Class A
Interests and Class B Interests basically have identical voting rights and,
therefore, Equis II Corporation has control over the Trust on all matters on
which the Beneficiaries may vote. The Managing Trustee and the Special
Beneficiary are not required to make any other capital contributions except as
may be required under the Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as
amended (the "Trust Agreement").

 (b) Financial Information About Industry Segments

 Historically, the Trust has been engaged in only one industry segment: the
business of acquiring capital equipment and leasing the equipment to
creditworthy lessees on a full-payout or operating lease basis. Full-payout
leases are those in which aggregate undiscounted, noncancellable rents equal or
exceed the Purchase Price of the leased equipment. Operating leases are those in
which the aggregate undiscounted, noncancellable rental payments are less than
the Purchase Price of the leased equipment. In connection with the Solicitation
Statement and consent of Beneficiaries (see Note 10 to the financial statements
included in Item 14, herein), the prior Trust Agreement was modified to permit
the Trust to invest in assets other than equipment. In the future, the Managing
Trustee anticipates that the Trust will make new investments that have the
potential to enhance the Trust's overall economic performance for the benefit of
all of the Beneficiaries. Industry segment data is not applicable.

 (c) Narrative Description of Business

 The Trust was organized to acquire a diversified portfolio of capital
equipment subject to various full-payout and operating leases and to lease the
equipment to third parties as income-producing investments. More specifically,
the Trust's primary investment objectives are to acquire and lease equipment
which will:

 1. Generate monthly cash distributions;

 2. Preserve and protect Trust capital; and

 3. Maximize residual value for ultimate sale

 The Trust has the additional objective of providing certain federal income
tax benefits.

3

The Closing Date of the offering of Class A Beneficiary Interests was May
29, 1992. Significant operations commenced coincident with the Trust's initial
purchase of equipment and associated lease commitments on May 29, 1992. The
acquisition of the equipment and its associated leases is described in detail in
Note 3 to the financial statements included in Item 14, herein. Pursuant to the
Trust Agreement, the Trust is scheduled to be dissolved by December 31, 2003.
The Trust is a Nominal Defendant in a Class Action Lawsuit, the resolution of
which remains pending. See Note 12 to the accompanying financial statements.

 The Trust has no employees; however, it entered into an Advisory Agreement
with EFG. EFG's role, among other things, is to (i) evaluate, select, negotiate,
and consummate the acquisition of equipment, (ii) manage the leasing,
re-leasing, financing, and refinancing of equipment, and (iii) arrange the
resale of equipment. The Advisor is compensated for such services as described
in the Trust Agreement, Item 13 herein, and in Note 5 to the financial
statements included in Item 14, herein.

 The Trust's investment in equipment is, and will continue to be, subject
to various risks, including physical deterioration, technological obsolescence
and defaults by lessees. A principal business risk of owning and leasing
equipment is the possibility that aggregate lease revenues and equipment sale
proceeds will be insufficient to provide an acceptable rate of return on
invested capital after payment of all debt service costs and operating expenses.
In addition, the leasing industry is very competitive. The Trust is subject to
considerable competition when equipment is re-leased or sold at the expiration
of primary lease terms. The Trust must compete with lease programs offered
directly by manufacturers and other equipment leasing companies, including
business trusts and limited partnerships organized and managed similarly to the
Trust and including other EFG-sponsored partnerships and trusts, which may seek
to re-lease or sell equipment within their own portfolios to the same customers
as the Trust. Many competitors have greater financial resources and more
experience than the Trust, the Managing Trustee and the Advisor. In addition,
default by a lessee under a lease agreement may cause equipment to be returned
to the Trust at a time when the Managing Trustee or the Advisor is unable to
arrange the sale or re-lease of such equipment. This could result in the loss of
a portion of potential lease revenues and weaken the Trust's ability to repay
related indebtedness.

 Revenue from major individual lessees which accounted for 10 or more of
lease revenue during the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 is
incorporated herein by reference to Note 2 to the financial statements in the
1998 Annual Report. Refer to Item 14(a)(3) for lease agreements filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

 The Trust Agreement originally provided for the reinvestment of Cash From
Sales or Refinancings in additional equipment until May 29, 1996, a period of
four years following Closing. In connection with the Solicitation Statement and
consent of Beneficiaries (see Note 10 to the financial statements included in
Item 14 herein), the Trust's reinvestment provisions were reinstated until
December 31, 2001 (see Note 5 to the financial statements included in Item 14
herein). In addition, the Trust is now permitted to invest in assets other than
equipment. Upon the expiration of each primary lease term, the Managing Trustee
will determine whether to sell or re-lease the Trust's equipment, depending on
the economic advantages of each alternative. Over time, the Trust will begin to
liquidate its portfolio of equipment.

 EFG is a Massachusetts limited partnership formerly known as American
Finance Group ("AFG"). AFG was established in 1988 as a Massachusetts general
partnership and succeeded American Finance Group, Inc., a Massachusetts
corporation organized in 1980. EFG and its subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Company") are engaged in various aspects of the equipment leasing business,
including EFG's role as Equipment Manager or Advisor to the Trust and several
other direct-participation equipment leasing programs sponsored or co-sponsored
by EFG (the "Other Investment Programs"). The Company arranges to broker or
originate equipment leases, acts as remarketing agent and asset manager, and
provides leasing support services, such as billing, collecting, and asset
tracking.

 The general partner of EFG, with a 1 controlling interest, is Equis
Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation owned and controlled entirely by Gary
D. Engle, its President, Chief Executive Officer and sole Director. Equis
Corporation also owns a controlling 1 general partner interest in EFG's 99 
limited partner, GDE Acquisition

4

Limited Partnership ("GDE LP"). Equis Corporation and GDE LP were established in
December 1994 by Mr. Engle for the sole purpose of acquiring the business of
AFG.

 In January 1996, the Company sold certain assets of AFG relating primarily
to the business of originating new leases, and the name "American Finance
Group," and its acronym, to a third party. AFG changed its name to Equis
Financial Group Limited Partnership after the sale was concluded. Pursuant to
terms of the sale agreements, EFG specifically reserved the rights to continue
using the name American Finance Group and its acronym in connection with the
Trust and the Other Investment Programs and to continue managing all assets
owned by the Trust and the Other Investment Programs.

Item 5. Market for the Trust's Securities and Related Security Holder Matters.

 (a) Market Information

 There is no public market for the resale of the Interests and it is not
anticipated that a public market for resale of the Interests will develop.

 (b) Approximate Number of Security Holders

 At December 31, 1998, there were 563 record holders (555 Class A Interests
and 8 Class B Interests) in the Trust.

 (c) Dividend History and Restrictions

 Pursuant to Article VIII of the Trust Agreement, the amount of cash
distributions to be declared and paid to the Beneficiaries is determined on a
monthly basis. Each monthly distribution may vary in amount and the Managing
Trustee may, in its sole discretion, restrict or suspend distributions if it
believes such action to be in the best interests of the Trust. Each distribution
is made 90.75 to the Class A and Class B Beneficiaries, 8.25 to the Special
Beneficiary, and 1 to the Managing Trustee. Currently, there are no
restrictions that materially limit the Trust's ability to make distributions or
that the Trust believes are likely to materially limit future distributions. The
Trust expects to continue to make distributions on a monthly basis.

 Distributable Cash From Operations and Distributable Cash From Sales or
Refinancings ("Distributions") must be distributed within 45 days after the
completion of each calendar month. Each Distribution is described in a statement
sent to the Beneficiaries.

 Distributions, prior to Class B Payout (defined below), are allocated to
the Class A and Class B Beneficiaries as follows: first, 100 to the Class A
Beneficiaries up to 0.41 per Class A Interest; second, 100 to the Class B
Beneficiaries up to 0.164 per Class B Interest, reduced by the Class B
Distribution Reduction Factor (defined later herein); third, 100 to the Class A
Beneficiaries up to an additional 0.215 per Class A Interest; and fourth, until
Class B Payout has been attained, 80 to the Class B Beneficiaries and 20 to
the Class A Beneficiaries. After Class B Payout, all further distributions will
be made to the Class A Beneficiaries and the Class B Beneficiaries in amounts so
that each Class A Beneficiary receives, with respect to each Class A Interest,
an amount equal to 400 , divided by the difference between 100 and the Class B
Distribution Reduction Factor, of the amount so distributed with respect to each
Class B Interest. The Class B Distribution Reduction Factor means the percentage
determined as a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate amount of any
cash distributions paid to the Class B Beneficiaries as a return of their
original capital contributions (on a per Class B Subordinated Interest basis),
discounted at 8 per annum (commencing August 1, 1997, the first day of the
month following the Class B Closing) and the denominator of which is 5.00.

 Distributions in 1998 and 1997 were as follows:

Distributions payable were 180,702 and 195,306 at December 31, 1998 and
1997, respectively.

 "Distributable Cash From Operations" means the net cash provided by the
Trust's normal operations after general expenses and current liabilities of the
Trust are paid, reduced by any reserves for working capital and contingent
liabilities to be funded from such cash, to the extent deemed reasonable by the
Managing Trustee, and increased by any portion of such reserves deemed by the
Managing Trustee not to be required for Trust operations and reduced by all
accrued and unpaid Equipment Management Fees and, after Payout, further reduced
by all accrued and unpaid Subordinated Remarketing Fees. Distributable Cash From
Operations does not include any Distributable Cash From Sales or Refinancings.

 "Distributable Cash From Sales or Refinancings" means Cash From Sales or
Refinancings as reduced by (i)(a) amounts reinvested in additional equipment in
accordance with Sections 4.2(b)(v) and 4.2(b)(vi) of the Trust Agreement, or (b)
the proceeds from the sale of an interest in a joint venture which are
reinvested in additional equipment, (ii) any accrued and unpaid Equipment
Management Fee and Acquisition Fees and Acquisition Expenses paid with respect
to additional equipment acquired through reinvestment of Cash From Sales or
Refinancings in accordance with Section 4.2(b)(v) of the Trust Agreement and
(iii) after Payout, any accrued and unpaid Subordinated Resale Fees.

 "Cash From Sales or Refinancings" means cash received by the Trust from
sale or refinancing transactions, as reduced by (i)(a) all debts and liabilities
of the Trust required to be paid as a result of sale or refinancing
transactions, whether or not then due and payable (including any liabilities on
an item of equipment sold which are not assumed by the buyer and any remarketing
fees required to be paid to persons not affiliated with the Managing Trustee,
but not including any Subordinated Resale Fees whether or not then due and
payable) and (b) general expenses and current liabilities of the Trust and (c)
any reserves for working capital and contingent liabilities funded from such
cash to the extent deemed reasonable by the Managing Trustee and (ii) increased
by any portion of such reserves deemed by the Managing Trustee not to be
required for Trust operations. In the event the Trust accepts a note in
connection with any sale or refinancing transaction, all payments subsequently
received in cash by the Trust with respect to such note shall be included in
Cash From Sales or Refinancings, regardless of the treatment of such payments by
the Trust for tax or accounting purposes. If the Trust receives purchase money
obligations in payment for equipment sold, which are secured by liens on such
equipment, the amount of such obligations shall not be included in Cash From
Sales or Refinancings until the obligations are fully satisfied.

 Class A Payout means the first time when the aggregate amount of all
distributions actually made to the Class A Beneficiaries equals 25 per Class A
Interest (minus all uninvested capital contributions returned to the Class A
Beneficiaries) plus a cumulative annual distribution of 10 compounded quarterly
and calculated beginning with the last day of the month of the Trust's initial
Class A Closing.

 Class B Payout means the first time when the aggregate amount of all
distributions actually made to the Class B Beneficiaries equals 5 per Class B
Interest plus a cumulative annual return of 8 per annum compounded quarterly
with respect to capital contributions returned to them as a Class B Capital
Distribution and 10 per annum, compounded quarterly, with respect to the
balance of their capital contributions and calculated beginning August 1, 1997,
the first day of the month following the Class B Closing.

 ------------ ------------ ------------

 Total 422,093 510,763 360,413
 ============ ============ ============

 EFG and its Affiliates were reimbursed for their out-of-pocket offering
costs incurred on behalf of the Trust in an amount equal to 1 of the gross
proceeds of the four trusts which sold Class B Interests, pursuant to the
Registration Statement on Form S-1. The amount of reimbursement made by the
Trust was prorated in proportion to the number of Beneficiary Interests sold in
the Trust.

 As provided under the terms of the Trust Agreement, EFG is compensated for
its services to the Trust. Such services include all aspects of acquisition,
management and sale of equipment. For acquisition services, EFG was compensated
by an amount equal to .28 of Asset Base Price paid by the Trust for each asset
acquired for

12

the Trust's initial asset portfolio. For acquisition services during the initial
reinvestment period, which expired on May 29, 1996, EFG was compensated by an
amount equal to 3 of Asset Base Price paid by the Trust. In connection with the
Solicitation Statement and consent of Beneficiaries (see Note 10 to the
financial statements included in Item 14, herein), the Trust's reinvestment
provisions were reinstated through December 31, 2001. In addition, the Trust is
now permitted to invest in assets other than equipment. Acquisition fees paid to
EFG in connection with such reinvestment assets are equal to 1 of Asset Base
Price paid by the Trust. For management services, EFG is compensated by an
amount equal to (i) 5 of gross operating lease rental revenue and 2 of gross
full payout lease rental revenue received by the Trust with respect assets
acquired on or prior to March 31, 1998. For management services earned in
connection with assets acquired on or after April 1, 1998, EFG is compensated by
an amount equal to 2 of gross lease rental revenue received by the Trust. Both
of these fees are subject to certain limitations defined in the Trust Agreement.
For non-equipment investments other than cash, the Managing Trustee receives an
annualized management fee of 1 . Compensation to EFG for services connected to
the remarketing of equipment is calculated as the lesser of (i) 3 of gross sale
proceeds or (ii) one-half of reasonable brokerage fees otherwise payable under
arm's length circumstances. Payment of the remarketing fee is subordinated to
Payout and is subject to certain limitations defined in the Trust Agreement.

 Administrative charges represent amounts owed to the EFG, pursuant to
Section 10.4(c) of the Trust Agreement, for persons employed by EFG who are
engaged in providing administrative services to the Trust. Reimbursable
operating expenses due to third parties represent costs paid by EFG on behalf of
the Trust which are reimbursed to EFG at actual cost.

 All equipment was purchased from EFG or directly from external vendors.
The Trust's Purchase Price is determined by the method described in Note 2 to
the Trust's financial statements included in Item 14, herein.

 All rents and proceeds from the sale of equipment are paid directly to
either EFG or to a lender. EFG temporarily deposits collected funds in a
separate interest-bearing escrow account prior to remittance to the Trust. At
December 31, 1998, the Trust was owed 70,959 by EFG for such funds and the
interest thereon. These funds were remitted to the Trust in January 1999.

 During 1997, the Trust and certain affiliated investment programs
sponsored by EFG exchanged their ownership interests in certain vessels for
aggregate consideration of 11,565,375. The Trust's share of such consideration
was 1,209,930, consisting of common stock in Semele valued at 314,541, a note
receivable from Semele of 462,353 and cash of 433,036. For further discussion,
see Note 4, "Investment Securities - Affiliate / Note Receivable - Affiliate to
the financial statements included in Item 14 herein and Item 10.

 On July 18, 1997, the Trust issued 826,072 Class B Interests at 5.00 per
interest, thereby generating 4,130,360 in aggregate Class B capital
contributions. Class A Beneficiaries purchased 3,209 Class B Interests,
generating 16,045 of such aggregate capital contributions, and the Special
Beneficiary, EFG, purchased 822,863 of such Class B Interests, generating
 4,114,315 of such aggregate capital contributions. The Trust incurred offering
costs in the amount of 41,304 and professional service costs of 54,186 in
connection with this offering.

 Subsequently, EFG transferred its Class B Interests to a special-purpose
company, Equis II Corporation, a Delaware corporation. EFG also transferred its
ownership of AFG ASIT Corporation, the Managing Trustee of the Trust, to Equis
II Corporation. As a result, Equis II Corporation has voting control of the
Trust through its ownership of the majority of the Trust's outstanding voting
interests, as well as its ownership of AFG ASIT Corporation. Equis II
Corporation is controlled by EFG's President and Chief Executive Officer, Gary
D. Engle. Accordingly, control of the Managing Trustee did not change as a
result of the foregoing transactions.

 Old North Capital Limited Partnership ("ONC"), a Massachusetts limited
partnership formed in 1995 and an affiliate of EFG, owns 1,702 Class A Interests
or less than 1 of the total outstanding Class A Interests of the Trust. The
general partner of ONC is controlled by Gary D. Engle. In addition, the limited
partnership interests of ONC are owned by Semele. Gary D. Engle is Chairman and
CEO of Semele.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 December 31, 1997 and the year ended December 31, 1997
 compared to the year ended December 31, 1996

 Certain statements in this annual report of AFG Investment Trust A (the
"Trust") that are not historical fact constitute "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and
are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. There are a number of
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those expressed in any forward-looking statements made herein. These factors
include, but are not limited to, the outcome of the Class Action Lawsuit
described in Note 12 to the accompanying financial statements, the collection
all rents due under the Trust's lease agreements and remarketing of the Trust's
equipment.

Year 2000 Issue

 The Year 2000 Issue generally refers to the capacity of computer
programming logic to correctly identify the calendar year. Many companies
utilize computer programs or hardware with date sensitive software or embedded
chips that could interpret dates ending in "00" as the year 1900 rather than the
year 2000. In certain cases, such errors could result in system failures or
miscalculations that disrupt the operations of the affected businesses. The
Trust uses information systems provided by Equis Financial Group Limited
Partnership (formerly American Finance Group) ("EFG") and has no information
systems of its own. EFG has adopted a plan to address the Year 2000 Issue that
consists of four phases: assessment, remediation, testing, and implementation
and has elected to utilize principally internal resources to perform all phases.
EFG completed substantially all of its Year 2000 project by December 31, 1998 at
an aggregate cost of less than 50,000 and at a di minimus cost to the Trust.
Remaining items are expected to be minor and be completed by March 31, 1999. All
costs incurred in connection with EFG's Year 2000 project have been expensed as
incurred.

 EFG's primary information software was coded by IBM at the point of
original design to use a four digit field to identify calendar year. All of the
Trust's lease billings, cash receipts and equipment remarketing processes are
performed using this proprietary software. In addition, EFG has gathered
information about the Year 2000 readiness of significant vendors and third party
servicers and continues to monitor developments in this area. All of EFG's
peripheral computer technologies, such as its network operating system and
third-party software applications, including payroll, depreciation processing,
and electronic banking, have been evaluated for potential programming changes
and have required only minor modifications to function properly with respect to
dates in the year 2000 and thereafter. EFG understands that each of its and the
Trust's significant vendors and third-party servicers are in the process, or
have completed the process, of making their systems Year 2000 compliant.
Substantially all parties queried have indicated that their systems would be
Year 2000 compliant by the end of 1998.

 Presently, EFG is not aware of any outside customer with a Year 2000 Issue
that would have a material effect on the Trust's results of operations,
liquidity, or financial position. The Trust's equipment leases were structured
as triple net leases, meaning that the lessees are responsible for, among other
things, (i) maintaining and servicing all equipment during the lease term, (ii)
ensuring that all equipment functions properly and is returned in good
condition, normal wear and tear excepted, and (iii) insuring the assets against
casualty and other events of loss. Non-compliance with lease terms on the part
of a lessee, including failure to address Year 2000 Issues could result in lost
revenues and impairment of residual values of the Trust's equipment assets under
a worst-case scenario.

 EFG believes that its Year 2000 compliance plan will be effective in
resolving all material Year 2000 risks in a timely manner and that the Year 2000
Issue will not pose significant operational problems with respect to its
computer systems or result in a system failure or disruption of its or the
Trust's business operations. However, EFG has no means of ensuring that all
customers, vendors and third-party servicers will conform ultimately to Year
2000 standards. The effect of this risk to the Trust is not determinable.

Overview

 As an equipment leasing trust, the Trust was organized to acquire a
diversified portfolio of capital equipment subject to lease agreements with
third parties. The Trust was designed to progress through three principal
phases: acquisitions, operations, and liquidation. During the operations phase,
a period of approximately six years, all equipment in the Trust's portfolio will
progress through various stages. Initially, all equipment will generate rental
revenues under primary term lease agreements. During the life of the Trust,
these agreements will expire on an intermittent basis and equipment held
pursuant to the related leases will be renewed, re-leased or sold, depending on
prevailing market conditions and the assessment of such conditions by EFG to
obtain the most advantageous economic benefit. Over time, a greater portion of
the Trust's original equipment portfolio will become available for remarketing
and cash generated from operations and from sales or refinancings will
fluctuate. Presently, the Trust is a Nominal Defendant in a Class Action
Lawsuit, the resolution of which remains pending. See Note 12 to the
accompanying financial statements. The Trust's operations commenced in 1992 and
pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Trust is scheduled to be dissolved by
December 31, 2003.

Results of Operations

 For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Trust recognized lease revenue
of 2,181,506 compared to 4,453,680 and 4,820,860 for the years ended December
31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The decrease in lease revenue from 1997 to 1998
resulted partially from the exchange of the Trust's interest in a vessel, as
described in Note 4 to the accompanying financial statements. During 1997, the
Trust recognized lease revenue of 565,318 related to this vessel. Other
reductions in lease revenue from 1997 to 1998 occurred from lease term
expirations and the sale of equipment. The decrease in lease revenue from 1996
to 1997 resulted principally from lease term expirations and the sale of
equipment. The level of lease revenue to be recognized by the Trust in the
future may be impacted by the amendment to the Trust Agreement described in Note
10 to the accompanying financial statements; however, the extent of such impact
cannot be determined at this time.

 The Trust's equipment portfolio includes certain assets in which the Trust
holds a proportionate ownership interest. In such cases, the remaining interests
are owned by EFG or an affiliated equipment leasing program sponsored by EFG.
Proportionate equipment ownership enables the Trust to further diversify its
equipment portfolio by participating in the ownership of selected assets,
thereby reducing the general levels of risk which could result from a
concentration in any single equipment type, industry or lessee. The Trust and
each affiliate individually report, in proportion to their respective ownership
interests, their respective shares of assets, liabilities, revenues, and
expenses associated with the equipment.

 Interest income for the year ended December 31, 1998 was 328,579 compared
to 207,539 and 85,627 for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. Interest income is typically generated from temporary investment
of rental receipts and equipment sales proceeds in short-term instruments.
Interest income in 1998 included 46,235 earned on the note receivable from
Semele Group, Inc. ("Semele"). See Note 4 to the accompanying financial
statements. Interest income in 1997 and 1998 also included interest earned on
proceeds from the issuance of Class B Interests (see below). The amount of
future interest income is expected to fluctuate in relation to prevailing
interest rates, the collection of lease revenue, and the proceeds from equipment
sales.

 During 1998, the Trust sold equipment having a net book value of 886,731
to existing lessees and third parties. These sales resulted in a net loss, for
financial statement purposes, of 256,890.

 During 1997, the Trust sold equipment having a net book value of 306,946
to existing lessees and third parties. These sales resulted in a net gain, for
financial statement purposes, of 181,585. During 1997, the Trust also exchanged
its interest in a vessel with an original cost and net book value of 2,399,580
and 1,185,726, respectively (See Note 4 to the accompanying financial
statements). In connection with this transaction, the Trust realized proceeds of
 777,326, which resulted in a net loss, for financial statement purposes, of
 408,400. As this vessel was disposed of prior to the expiration of the related
lease term, the Trust also received a prepayment of the remaining contracted
rent due under the vessel's lease agreement.

 In February 1996, the Trust concluded the sale of its interest in a Boeing
747-SP to the lessee, United Air Lines, Inc., ("United"). The Trust recognized a
net loss of 458,638 in connection with this transaction, of which 311,621 was
recognized as Write-Down of Equipment in 1995. The remainder of 147,017 was
recognized as a

4

loss on sale of equipment on the accompanying Statement of Operations for the
year ended December 31, 1996. In addition to lease rents, the Trust received net
sale proceeds of 1,392,779. A portion of such sale proceeds was reinvested in
other equipment in March 1996 through the acquisition of an 8.86 ownership
interest in an aircraft (the "Reno Aircraft") at an aggregate cost to the Trust
of 1,239,741. To acquire its interest in the Reno Aircraft, the Trust obtained
long-term financing of 997,888 from a third-party lender and utilized cash
proceeds of 241,853 from the sale of the United Aircraft. During the year ended
December 31, 1996, the Trust sold other equipment having a net book value of
 31,554, to existing lessees and third parties. These sales resulted in a net
loss, for financial statement purposes, of 6,406.

 The Trust received 71,850 in 1996 from a former lessee related to a
residual sharing agreement between the lessee and the Trust. In connection with
this agreement, the Trust was entitled to a portion of the sale proceeds
realized by the lessee upon its ultimate disposition of the vessel to a third
party. This amount is reflected as Other Income on the accompanying Statement of
Operations in 1996.

 It cannot be determined whether future sales of equipment will result in a
net gain or a net loss to the Trust, as such transactions will be dependent upon
the condition and type of equipment being sold and its marketability at the time
of sale. In addition, the amount of gain or loss reported for financial
statement purposes is partly a function of the amount of accumulated
depreciation associated with the equipment being sold.

 The ultimate realization of residual value for any type of equipment is
dependent upon many factors, including EFG's ability to sell and re-lease
equipment. Changing market conditions, industry trends, technological advances,
and many other events can converge to enhance or detract from asset values at
any given time. EFG attempts to monitor these changes in order to identify
opportunities which may be advantageous to the Trust and which will maximize
total cash returns for each asset.

 The total economic value realized upon final disposition of each asset is
comprised of all primary lease term revenue generated from that asset, together
with its residual value. The latter consists of cash proceeds realized upon the
asset's sale in addition to all other cash receipts obtained from renting the
asset on a re-lease, renewal or month-to-month basis. The Trust classifies such
residual rental payments as lease revenue. Consequently, the amount of gain or
loss reported in the financial statements is not necessarily indicative of the
total residual value the Trust achieved from leasing the equipment.

 Depreciation and amortization expense was 2,052,750, 3,354,030 and
 3,628,279 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
For financial reporting purposes, to the extent that an asset is held on primary
lease term, the Trust depreciates the difference between (i) the cost of the
asset and (ii) the estimated residual value of the asset on a straight-line
basis over such term. For purposes of this policy, estimated residual values
represent estimates of equipment values at the date of primary lease expiration.
To the extent that an asset is held beyond its primary lease term, the Trust
continues to depreciate the remaining net book value of the asset on a
straight-line basis over the asset's remaining economic life.

 Interest expense was 93,636 or 4.3 of lease revenue in 1998, 198,927
or 4.5 of lease revenue in 1997 and 396,793 or 8.2 of lease revenue in 1996.
Interest expense in future years is expected to decline in amount and as a
percentage of lease revenue as the principal balance of notes payable is reduced
through the application of rent receipts to outstanding indebtedness.

 Management fees were 4.5 , 4 and 3.9 of lease revenue during the years
ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Management fees are based
on 5 of gross lease revenue generated by operating leases and 2 of gross lease
revenue generated by full payout leases.

 Write-down of investment securities-affiliate was 186,105 for the year 
ended December 31, 1998. The Managing Trustee determined that the decline in 
market value of the Semele common stock was other-than-temporary at December 
31, 1998. As a result, the Trust wrote down the cost of the Semele common 
stock from 15 per share to 4.125 per share (the quoted price of Semele 
stock on NASDAQ at December 31, 1998).

 Operating expenses consist principally of administrative charges,
professional service costs, such as audit and legal fees, as well as printing,
distribution and remarketing expenses. Operating expenses were 323,842,
 291,300 and 137,739 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. During 1998, the Trust incurred or accrued approximately 88,000
for certain legal expenses related to the Class Action Lawsuit described in Note
12 to the financial statements. Additionally, operating expenses increased from
1997 to 1998 due to professional service costs incurred in connection with the
Solicitation Statement described in Note 10 to the financial statements. The
increase in operating expenses from 1996 to 1997 was due primarily to costs
incurred in

5

connection with the Solicitation and Registration Statements described in Note 8
to the accompanying financial statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources and Discussion of Cash Flows

 The Trust by its nature is a limited life entity. As an equipment leasing
program, the Trust's principal operating activities derive from asset rental
transactions. Accordingly, the Trust's principal source of cash from operations
is provided by the collection of periodic rents. These cash inflows are used to
satisfy debt service obligations associated with leveraged leases, and to pay
management fees and operating costs. Operating activities generated net cash
inflows of 2,558,932, 3,849,225 and 4,295,178 for the years ended December
31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Future renewal, re-lease and equipment
sale activities will cause a decline in the Trust's primary-term lease revenue
and corresponding sources of operating cash. Overall, expenses associated with
rental activities, such as management fees, and net cash flow from operating
activities will also decline as the Trust experiences a higher frequency of
remarketing events.

 The Trust's equipment is leased by a number of creditworthy,
investment-grade companies and, to date, the Trust has not experienced any
material collection problems and has not considered it necessary to provide an
allowance for doubtful accounts. Notwithstanding a positive collection history,
there is no assurance that all future contracted rents will be collected or that
the credit quality of the Trust's lessees will be maintained. Collection risk
could increase in the future, particularly as the Trust remarkets its equipment
and enters re-lease agreements with different lessees. The Managing Trustee will
continue to evaluate and monitor the Trust's experience in collecting accounts
receivable to determine whether a future allowance for doubtful accounts may
become appropriate.

 Cash expended for asset acquisitions and cash realized from asset disposal
transactions are reported under investing activities on the accompanying
Statement of Cash Flows. The Trust expended 15,246, and 1,441,796 to acquire
equipment during the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1996, respectively,
pursuant to the reinvestment provisions of the Trust Agreement (see Note 10).
Equipment acquired in 1996 was financed through a combination of leveraging and
sale proceeds available from the United Aircraft. There were no equipment
acquisitions during 1997. In 1998 and 1997, the Trust realized equipment sale
proceeds of 629,841 and 488,963, respectively. In 1996, the Trust received
sale proceeds of 1,417,927, including 1,392,779 of proceeds from the United
Aircraft. Future inflows of cash from asset disposals will vary in timing and
amount and will be influenced by many factors including, but not limited to, the
frequency and timing of lease expirations, the type of equipment being sold, its
condition and age, and future market conditions.

 As a result of the vessel exchange (see Results of Operations), the Trust
became the beneficial owner of 209,694 shares of Semele common stock (valued at
 314,541 1.50 per share) at the time of the exchange transaction). The Trust
also received a beneficial interest in the Semele Note of 462,353 in connection
with the exchange.

 In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 
115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, 
marketable equity securities classified as available-for-sale are required to 
be carried at fair value. On June 30, 1998, Semele effected a 1-for-300 
reverse stock split followed by a 30-for-1 forward stock split resulting in a 
reduction of the number of shares of Semele common stock owned by the Trust 
to 20,969 shares. During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Trust 
decreased the carrying value of its investment in Semele common stock to 
 4.125 per share (the quoted price of the Semele stock on NASDAQ at December 
31, 1998) resulting in an unrealized loss in 1998 of 70,773. This loss was 
reported as a component of comprehensive loss, included in participants' 
capital. At December 31, 1998, the Managing Trustee determined that the 
decline in market value of the Semele common stock was other-than-temporary. 
As a result, the Trust wrote down the cost of the Semele stock to 4.125 per 
share (the quoted price of the Semele stock on NASDAQ at December 31, 1998) 
for a total realized loss of 186,105 in 1998.

 The Trust obtained long-term financing in connection with certain
equipment leases. The origination of such indebtedness and the subsequent
repayments of principal are reported as components of financing activities. Cash
inflows of 997,888 in 1996 resulted from leveraging a portion of the Trust's
interest in the Reno Aircraft with a third-party lender (see above). Each note
payable is recourse only to the specific equipment financed and to the minimum
rental payments contracted to be received during the debt amortization period
(which period generally coincides with the lease rental term). As rental
payments are collected, a portion or all of the rental payment is

6

used to repay the associated indebtedness. In future years, the amount of cash
used to repay debt obligations will decline as the principal balance of notes
payable is reduced through the collection and application of rents.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust has a balloon payment obligation of
 282,421 at the expiration of the primary lease term related to its interest in
the Reno Aircraft.

 For financial reporting purposes, the Managing Trustee and the Special
Beneficiary each has accumulated a capital deficit at December 31, 1998. This is
the result of aggregate cash distributions to these Participants being in excess
of their aggregate capital contributions 1,000 each) and their respective
allocations of financial statement net income or loss. Ultimately, the existence
of a capital deficit for the Managing Trustee or the Special Beneficiary for
financial reporting purposes is not indicative of any further capital
obligations to the Trust by either the Managing Trustee or the Special
Beneficiary. However, for income tax purposes, the Trust Agreement requires that
income be allocated first to those Participants having negative tax capital
account balances so as to eliminate any such balances. In accordance with the
Trust Agreement, upon the dissolution of the Trust, the Managing Trustee will be
required to contribute to the Trust an amount equal to any negative balance
which may exist in the Managing Trustee's tax capital account. At December 31,
1998, the Managing Trustee had a positive tax capital account balance. No such
requirement exists with respect to the Special Beneficiary.

 At December 31, 1998, the Trust was due aggregate future minimum lease
payments of 1,484,028 from contractual lease agreements (see Note 2 to the
financial statements), a portion of which will be used to amortize the principal
balance of notes payable of 861,300 (see Note 6 to the financial statements).
Additional cash inflows will be realized from future remarketing activities,
such as lease renewals and equipment sales, the timing and extent of which
cannot be predicted with certainty. This is because the timing and extent of
equipment sales is often dependent upon the needs and interests of the existing
lessees. Some lessees may choose to renew their lease contracts, while others
may elect to return the equipment. In the latter instances, the equipment could
be re-leased to another lessee or sold to a third party. Accordingly, as the
Trust matures and a greater level of its equipment assets becomes available for
remarketing, the cash flows of the Trust will become less predictable. In
addition, the Trust will have cash needs to satisfy interest on indebtedness and
to pay management fees and operating expenses. Ultimately, the Trust is expected
to meet its future disbursement obligations and to distribute any excess of cash
inflows over cash outflows to the Participants in accordance with the Trust
Agreement. However, several factors, including month-to-month lease extensions,
lessee defaults, equipment casualty events, and early lease terminations could
alter the Trust's anticipated cash flows as described herein and in the
accompanying financial statements and result in fluctuations to the Trust's
periodic cash distribution payments.

 On July 18, 1997, the Trust issued 826,072 Class B Interests at 5.00 per
interest, thereby generating 4,130,360 in aggregate Class B capital
contributions. Class A Beneficiaries purchased 3,209 Class B Interests,
generating 16,045 of such aggregate capital contributions, and the Special
Beneficiary, EFG, purchased 822,863 Class B Interests, generating 4,114,315 of
such aggregate capital contributions. The Trust incurred offering costs in the
amount of 41,304 and professional service costs of 54,186 in connection with
this offering. Subsequently, EFG transferred its Class B Interests to a
special-purpose company, Equis II Corporation, a Delaware corporation. EFG also
transferred its ownership of AFG ASIT Corporation, the Managing Trustee of the
Trust, to Equis II Corporation. As a result, Equis II Corporation has voting
control of the Trust through its ownership of the majority of all of the Trust's
outstanding voting interests, as well as its ownership of AFG ASIT Corporation.
Equis II Corporation is controlled by EFG's President and Chief Executive
Officer, Gary D. Engle. Accordingly, control of the Managing Trustee did not
change as a result of the foregoing transactions (see also Note 8 to the
accompanying financial statements).

 As described in the Prospectus for the offering of the Class B Interests,
the Managing Trustee used a portion of the net cash proceeds realized from the
offering of the Class B Interests to pay a one-time special cash distribution to
the Class A Beneficiaries of the Trust. The Managing Trustee declared and paid
this special cash distribution of approximately 1.47 per Class A Interest,
aggregating 808,363, to Class A Beneficiaries on August 15, 1997.

 On August 7, 1997, the Trust commenced an offer to purchase up to 45 of
the outstanding Class A Beneficiary Interests of the Trust. On October 10, 1997,
the Trust used 620,011 of the net proceeds realized from issuance of the Class
B Interests to purchase 65,402 of the Class A Interests tendered as a result of
the offer. On July 6, 1998, the Trust used 1,263,443 of such proceeds to pay a
capital distribution to the Class B Beneficiaries. The remaining net proceeds
from the Class B offering of 1,343,053 will be used according to terms

7

negotiated in connection with settling the Class Action Lawsuit described in
Note 12 (see also Notes 9, 10 and 11 to the accompanying financial statements).
On April 28, 1998, the Trust purchased 1,800 additional Class A Interests at a
cost of 14,400.

 Cash distributions paid to the Participants consist of both a return of
and a return on capital. Cash distributions do not represent and are not
indicative of yield on investment. Actual yield on investment cannot be
determined with any certainty until conclusion of the Trust and will be
dependent upon the collection of all future contracted rents, the generation of
renewal and/or re-lease rents, and the residual value realized for each asset at
its disposal date. Future market conditions, technological changes, the ability
of EFG to manage and remarket the assets, and many other events and
circumstances, could enhance or detract from individual asset yields and the
collective performance of the Trust's equipment portfolio.

 It is the intention of the Managing Trustee to maintain a cash
distribution level that is consistent with the operating cash flows of the Trust
and to optimize the long-term value of the Trust. A distribution level that is
higher than the Trust's operating cash flows could compromise the Trust's
working capital position, as well as its ability to refurbish or upgrade
equipment in response to lessee requirements or other market circumstances.
Accordingly, in order to better align monthly cash distributions with the
Trust's operating cash flows, the Managing Trustee reduced the level of monthly
cash distributions from an annualized rate of 2.52 per Class A Interest (the
rate established and paid from the Trust's inception through September 1995) to
an annualized rate of 1.26 per Class A Interest commencing in October 1995. In
October 1996, the Managing Trustee increased the annualized distribution rate to
 1.64 per Class A Interest and has sustained this distribution rate throughout
1997 and 1998. For the Class B Beneficiaries, the Managing Trustee established
and paid, from the Trust, an annualized distribution of 0.66 per Class B
Interest commencing July 18, 1997. Future distributions with respect to Class B
Interests will be subordinate to certain distributions with respect to Class A
Interests.

 Cash distributions to the Managing Trustee, the Special Beneficiary and
the Beneficiaries are declared and generally paid within 45 days following the
end of each calendar month. The payment of such distributions is presented as a
component of financing activities. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the
Trust declared total cash distributions of 2,647,038. Of the total
distributions, the Beneficiaries were allocated 2,519,055 790,280 for Class A
Beneficiaries and 1,728,775 for Class B Beneficiaries); the Special Beneficiary
was allocated 114,147, and the Managing Trustee was allocated 13,836.

 The nature of the Trust's operations and principal cash flows gradually
will shift from rental receipts to equipment sale proceeds as the Trust matures
and change as a result of new investments not consisting of equipment
acquisitions. As this occurs, the Trust's cash flows resulting from equipment
investments may become more volatile in that certain of the Trust's equipment
leases will be renewed and certain of its assets will be sold. In some cases,
the Trust may be required to expend funds to refurbish or otherwise improve the
equipment being remarketed in order to make it more desirable to a potential
lessee or purchaser. The Trust's Advisor, EFG, and the Managing Trustee will
attempt to monitor and manage these events in order to maximize the residual
value of the Trust's equipment and will consider these factors, in addition to
new investment activities and the collection of contractual rents, the
retirement of scheduled indebtedness, and the Trust's future working capital
requirements, in establishing future cash distribution rates.

AFG Investment Trust A
 Notes to the Financial Statements

 December 31, 1998

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND TRUST MATTERS

 AFG Investment Trust A (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware business
trust in accordance with the Delaware Business Trust Act on February 26, 1992
for the purpose of acquiring and leasing to third parties a diversified
portfolio of capital equipment. Participants' capital initially consisted of
contributions of 1,000 from the Managing Trustee, AFG ASIT Corporation, 1,000
from the Special Beneficiary, Equis Financial Group Limited Partnership
(formerly known as American Finance Group), a Massachusetts limited partnership,
("EFG" or the "Advisor") and 100 from the Initial Beneficiary, AFG Assignor
Corporation, a wholly-owned affiliate of EFG. The Trust issued an aggregate of
549,218 Beneficiary Interests (hereinafter referred to as Class A Interests) at
a subscription price of 25.00 each 13,730,450 in total) to 645 investors on
May 29, 1992. On July 18, 1997, the Trust issued 826,072 Class B Interests at
 5.00 each 4,130,360 in total), of which (i) 822,863 interests are held by
Equis II Corporation, an affiliate of EFG, and (ii) 3,209 interests are held by
7 Class A investors. The Trust repurchased 65,402 Class A Interests on October
10, 1997 using proceeds from the issuance of Class B Interests. On April 28,
1998, the Trust repurchased 1,800 additional Class A Interests. Accordingly,
there are 482,016 Class A Interests currently outstanding.

 The Trust has one Managing Trustee, AFG ASIT Corporation, a Massachusetts
corporation, and one Special Beneficiary, EFG. The Managing Trustee is
responsible for the general management and business affairs of the Trust. EFG
acts as Advisor to the Trust and provides services in connection with the
acquisition and remarketing of the Trust's assets. AFG ASIT Corporation is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Equis II Corporation and an affiliate of EFG. Class A
Interests and Class B Interests basically have identical voting rights and,
therefore, Equis II Corporation has control over the Trust on all matters on
which the Beneficiaries may vote. The Managing Trustee and the Special
Beneficiary are not required to make any other capital contributions except as
may be required under the Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as
amended (the "Trust Agreement").

 Significant operations commenced May 29, 1992 when the Trust made its
initial equipment purchase. Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, each distribution
of Distributable Cash From Operations and Distributable Cash From Sales or
Refinancings of the Trust is made 90.75 to the Beneficiaries, 8.25 to the
Special Beneficiary and 1 to the Managing Trustee.

 Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement between the Trust and EFG,
management services are provided by EFG to the Trust at fees, which the Managing
Trustee believes to be competitive for similar services. (Also see Note 5.)

 EFG is a Massachusetts limited partnership formerly known as American
Finance Group ("AFG"). AFG was established in 1988 as a Massachusetts general
partnership and succeeded American Finance Group, Inc., a Massachusetts
corporation organized in 1980. EFG and its subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Company") are engaged in various aspects of the equipment leasing business,
including EFG's role as Equipment Manager or Advisor to the Trust and several
other direct-participation equipment leasing programs sponsored or co-sponsored
by EFG (the "Other Investment Programs"). The Company arranges to broker or
originate equipment leases, acts as remarketing agent and asset manager, and
provides leasing support services, such as billing, collecting, and asset
tracking.

 The general partner of EFG, with a 1 controlling interest, is Equis
Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation owned and controlled entirely by Gary
D. Engle, its President, Chief Executive Officer and sole Director. Equis
Corporation also owns a controlling 1 general partner interest in EFG's 99 
limited partner, GDE Acquisition Limited Partnership ("GDE LP"). Equis
Corporation and GDE LP were established in December 1994 by Mr. Engle for the
sole purpose of acquiring the business of AFG.

14

AFG Investment Trust A
 Notes to the Financial Statements

 (Continued)

 In January 1996, the Company sold certain assets of AFG relating primarily
to the business of originating new leases, and the name "American Finance
Group", and its acronym, to a third party. AFG changed its name to Equis
Financial Group Limited Partnership after the sale was concluded. Pursuant to
terms of the sale agreements, EFG specifically reserved the rights to continue
using the name American Finance Group and its acronym in connection with the
Trust and the Other Investment Programs and to continue managing all assets
owned by the Trust and the Other Investment Programs.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

 As of January 1, 1998, the Trust adopted Statement 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income. Statement 130 establishes new rules for the reporting and
the display of comprehensive income and its components; however, the adoption of
this statement had no impact on the Trust's net income or participants' capital.
Statement 130 requires unrealized gains or losses on the Trust's
available-for-sale securities, which prior to adoption were reported separately
in participants' capital, to be included in comprehensive income (loss). At
December 31, 1997, the cumulative amount of other comprehensive losses was
 115,332.

Statement of Cash Flows and Restricted Cash

 The Trust considers liquid investment instruments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. From time to time, the
Trust invests excess cash with large institutional banks in federal agency
discount notes and reverse repurchase agreements with overnight maturities.
Under the terms of the agreements, title to the underlying securities passes to
the Trust. The securities underlying the agreements are book entry securities.
At December 31, 1998, the Trust had 4,689,000 invested in federal agency
discount notes and reverse repurchase agreements secured by U.S. Treasury Bills
or interests in U.S. Government securities. Such cash includes 1,343,053 which
is classified as Restricted Cash and represents the net proceeds realized from
the offering of the Class B Interests less i the portion thereof used to pay
a special distribution to the Class A Beneficiaries and to redeem Class A
Interests (see Notes 8 and 9) and ii the portion used to pay a capital
distribution to the Class B Beneficiaries (see Note 11). The remainder is
expected to be used according to terms negotiated in conjunction with settling
the Class Action Lawsuit described in Note 12.

Revenue Recognition

 Rents are payable to the Trust monthly, quarterly or semi-annually and no
significant amounts are calculated on factors other than the passage of time.
The leases are accounted for as operating leases and are noncancellable. Rents
received prior to their due dates are deferred. In certain instances, the Trust
may enter primary-term, renewal or re-lease agreements which expire beyond the
Trust's anticipated dissolution date. This circumstance is not expected to
prevent the orderly wind-up of the Trust's business activities as the Managing
Trustee and the Advisor would seek to sell the then-remaining equipment assets
either to the lessee or to a third party, taking into consideration the amount
of future non-cancelable rental payments associated with the attendant lease
agreements. Future minimum rents of 1,484,028 are due as follows:

 For the year ending December 31, 1999 623,520
 2000 497,582
 2001 182,138
 2002 179,149

 Notes to the Financial Statements

 (Continued)

 Revenue from major individual lessees which accounted for 10 or more of
lease revenue during the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 is as
follows:

 1998 1997 1996

 Gerhard Jebsen Skipsrederi A/S) -- 565,318 530,881

Use of Estimates

 The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Equipment on Lease

 All equipment was acquired from EFG, one of its Affiliates or from
third-party sellers. Equipment Cost means the actual cost paid by the Trust to
acquire the equipment, including acquisition fees. Where equipment was acquired
from EFG or an Affiliate, Equipment Cost reflects the actual price paid for the
equipment by EFG or the Affiliate plus all actual costs incurred by EFG or the
Affiliate while carrying the equipment, including all liens and encumbrances,
less the amount of all primary term rents earned by EFG or the Affiliate prior
to selling the equipment. Where the seller of the equipment was a third party,
Equipment Cost reflects the seller's invoice price.

Depreciation and Amortization

 The Trust's depreciation policy is intended to allocate the cost of
equipment over the period during which it produces economic benefit. The
principal period of economic benefit is considered to correspond to each asset's
primary lease term, which term generally represents the period of greatest
revenue potential for each asset. Accordingly, to the extent that an asset is
held on primary lease term, the Trust depreciates the difference between (i) the
cost of the asset and (ii) the estimated residual value of the asset on a
straight-line basis over such term. For purposes of this policy, estimated
residual values represent estimates of equipment values at the date of primary
lease expiration. To the extent that an asset is held beyond its primary lease
term, the Trust continues to depreciate the remaining net book value of the
asset on a straight-line basis over the asset's remaining economic life.
Periodically, the Managing Trustee evaluates the net carrying value of equipment
to determine whether it exceeds estimated net realizable value. For purposes of
this comparison, "net carrying value" represents, at a given date, the net book
value (equipment cost less accumulated depreciation for financial reporting
purposes) of the Trust's equipment and "net realizable value" represents, at the
same date, the aggregate undiscounted cash flows resulting from future
contracted lease payments plus the estimated residual value of the Trust's
equipment. The Managing Trustee evaluates significant equipment assets, such as
aircraft and vessels, individually. All other assets are evaluated collectively
by equipment type unless the Managing Trustee learns of specific circumstances,
such as a lessee default, technological obsolescence, or other market
developments, which could affect the net realizable value of particular assets.
Adjustments to reduce the net carrying value of equipment are recorded in those
instances where estimated net realizable value is considered to be less than net
carrying value. To the extent that such adjustments were recorded, they are
reflected separately on the accompanying Statement of Operations as Write-Down
of Equipment.

16

AFG Investment Trust A
 Notes to the Financial Statements

 (Continued)

 The ultimate realization of residual value for any type of equipment is
dependent upon many factors, including EFG's ability to sell and re-lease
equipment. Changing market conditions, industry trends, technological advances,
and many other events can converge to enhance or detract from asset values at
any given time.

 Organization costs were amortized using the straight-line method over a
period of five years.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES -- AFFILIATE

 The Trust's investment in Semele Group, Inc. is considered to be 
available-for-sale and as such is carried at fair value with unrealized gains 
and losses reported as a separate component of Participant's Capital. 
Other-than-temporary declines in market value are recorded as write-down of 
investment in the Statement of Operations (see Note 4).

Accrued Liabilities - Affiliate

 Unpaid fees and operating expenses paid by EFG on behalf of the Trust and
accrued but unpaid administrative charges and management fees are reported as
Accrued Liabilities - Affiliate (see Note 5).

Allocation of Net Income or Loss

 Net income is allocated quarterly first, to eliminate any Participant's
negative capital account balance and second, 1 to the Managing Trustee, 8.25 
to the Special Beneficiary and 90.75 collectively to the Class A and Class B
Beneficiaries. The latter is allocated proportionately between the Class A and
Class B Beneficiaries based upon the ratio of cash distributions declared and
allocated to the Class A and Class B Beneficiaries during the period. Net losses
are allocated quarterly first, to eliminate any positive capital account balance
of the Managing Trustee, the Special Beneficiary and the Class B Beneficiaries;
second, to eliminate any positive capital account balances of the Class A
Beneficiaries; and third, any remainder to the Managing Trustee. Prior to
adoption of the current Trust Agreement on July 15, 1997 (see Note 8), the Trust
allocated net income or loss to the Participants for financial reporting
purposes according to their respective beneficial interests in the Trust (1 to
the Managing Trustee, 8.25 to the Special Beneficiary, and 90.75 to the Class
A Beneficiaries).

 The allocation of net income or loss pursuant to the Trust Agreement
differs from the foregoing and is based upon government rules and regulations
for federal income tax reporting purposes and assumes, for each income tax
reporting period, the liquidation of all of the Trust's assets and the
subsequent distribution of all available cash to the Participants. For income
tax purposes, the Trust adjusts its allocations of income and loss to the
Participants so as to cause their tax capital account balances at the end of the
reporting period to be equal to the amount that would be distributed to them at
such date in the event of a liquidation and dissolution of the Trust. This
methodology does not consider the costs attendant to liquidation or whether the
Trust intends to have future business operations. If the Trust made similar
assumptions and allocations for financial reporting purposes and the Trust was
liquidated at December 31, 1998 for an amount equal to its net carrying value
for financial reporting purposes, the capital accounts of the Managing Trustee,
Special Beneficiary, Class A Beneficiaries, and Class B Beneficiaries would have
reflected ending balances of 98,470, 803,688, 4,165,589, and 3,247,051,
respectively. See Note 7 for additional information concerning the allocation of
net income or loss for income tax reporting purposes.

Net Income and Cash Distributions Per Beneficiary Interest

 Net income and cash distributions per Class A Interest in 1998 are based
on 483,816 Class A Interests outstanding during the period January 1, 1998
through April 27, 1998 and 482,016 Class A Interests outstanding during the
period April 28, 1998 through December 31, 1998. Net income and cash
distributions per Class A Interest in 1997 are based on 549,218 Class A
Interests outstanding during the period January 1, 1997 through October 9, 1997
and 483,816 Class A Interests outstanding during the period October 10, 1997
through December 31, 1997. Net income and cash distributions per Beneficiary
Interest are based on 549,218 Class A Interests outstanding during the year
ended December 31, 1996. Net income and cash distributions per Class B Interest
are based on 826,072 Class B Interests outstanding during the year ended
December 31, 1998 and the period July 18, 1997 through December 31, 1997. For
each of the aforementioned periods, net income and cash distributions per
Beneficiary Interest are computed after allocation of the Managing Trustee's and
Special Beneficiary's shares of net income and cash distributions.

Provision for Income Taxes

 No provision or benefit from income taxes is included in the accompanying
financial statements. The Participants are responsible for reporting their
proportionate shares of the Trust's taxable income or loss and other tax
attributes on their tax returns.

NOTE 3 - EQUIPMENT

 The following is a summary of equipment owned by the Trust at December 31,
1998. Remaining Lease Term (Months), as used below, represents the number of
months remaining from December 31, 1998 under contracted lease terms and is
presented as a range when more than one lease agreement is contained in the
stated equipment category. A Remaining Lease Term equal to zero reflects
equipment either held for sale or re-lease or being leased on a month-to-month
basis. In the opinion of EFG, the acquisition cost of the equipment did not
exceed its fair market value.

In certain cases, the cost of the Trust's equipment represents a
proportionate ownership interest. The remaining interests are owned by EFG or an
affiliated equipment leasing program sponsored by EFG. The Trust and each
affiliate individually report, in proportion to their respective ownership
interests, their respective shares of assets, liabilities, revenues, and
expenses associated with the equipment. Proportionate equipment ownership
enables the Trust to further diversify its equipment portfolio by participating
in the ownership of selected assets, thereby reducing the general levels of risk
which could result from a concentration in any single equipment type, industry
or lessee. At December 31, 1998, the Trust's equipment portfolio included
equipment having a proportionate original cost of 5,301,429, representing
approximately 36 of total equipment cost.

18

AFG Investment Trust A
 Notes to the Financial Statements

 (Continued)

 Certain of the equipment and related lease payment streams were used to
secure term loans with third-party lenders. The preceding summary of equipment
includes leveraged equipment having an original cost of approximately 4,197,000
and a net book value of approximately 1,272,000 at December 31, 1998 (see Note
6).

 Generally, the costs associated with maintaining, insuring and operating
the Trust's equipment are incurred by the respective lessees pursuant to terms
specified in their individual lease agreements with the Trust.

 As equipment is sold to third parties, or otherwise disposed of, the Trust
will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the net book value
of the equipment at the time of sale or disposition and the proceeds realized
upon sale or disposition. The ultimate realization of estimated residual value
in the equipment will be dependent upon, among other things, EFG's ability to
maximize proceeds from selling or re-leasing the equipment upon the expiration
of the primary lease terms. At December 31, 1998, the cost and net book value of
equipment held for sale or re-lease was approximately 6,288,000 and 2,147,000,
respectively. This equipment includes the Trust's proportionate interest in a
McDonnell Douglas MD-82 aircraft formerly leased to Alaska Airlines, Inc. with a
cost and net book value of 1,153,983 and 706,535, respectively (See Note 13 -
Subsequent Event), and a SAAB SF340A aircraft formerly leased to Comair, Inc.
with a cost and net book value of 4,421,116 and 1,415,736, respectively. The
Managing Trustee is actively seeking the sale of the SAAB SF340A aircraft and
the sale or re-lease of all other equipment not on lease. In addition, the
summary above includes equipment being leased on a month-to-month basis.

NOTE 4 - INVESTMENT SECURITIES - AFFILIATE / NOTE RECEIVABLE - AFFILIATE

 On April 30, 1997, the vessel partnerships, in which the Trust and certain
affiliated investment programs are limited partners and through which the Trust
and the affiliated investment programs shared economic interests in three cargo
vessels (the "Vessels") leased by Gearbulk Shipowning Ltd (formerly Kristian
Gerhard Jebsen Skipsrederi A/S) (the "Lessee"), exchanged their ownership
interests in the Vessels for aggregate consideration of 11,565,375, consisting
of 1,987,000 newly issued shares (at 1.50 per share) of common stock in Semele
Group, Inc. (formerly Banyan Strategic Land Fund II) ("Semele"), a purchase
money note of 8,219,500 (the "Note") and cash of 365,375. Semele is a Delaware
corporation organized on April 14, 1987 and has its common stock listed on
NASDAQ (NASDAQ SmallCap Market effective January 5, 1999). At the date of the
exchange transaction, the common stock of Semele had a net book value of
approximately 1.50 per share and closing market value of 1.00 per share.
Semele has one principal real estate asset consisting of an undeveloped 274-acre
parcel of land near Malibu, California ("Rancho Malibu").

 The exchange was organized through an intermediary company (Equis Exchange
LLC, 99 owned by Semele and 1 owned by EFG), which was established for the
sole purpose of facilitating the exchange. There were no fees paid to EFG by
Equis Exchange LLC or Semele or by any other party that otherwise would not have
been paid to EFG had the Trust sold its beneficial interest in the Vessels
directly to the Lessee. The Lessee prepaid all of its remaining contracted
rental obligations and purchased the Vessels in two closings occurring on May 6,
1997 and May 12, 1997. The Note was repaid with 3,800,000 of cash and delivery
of a 4,419,500 note from Semele (the "Semele Note").

 As a result of the exchange transaction and its original 33 beneficial
ownership interest in Hato Arrow, one of the three Vessels, the Trust received
 433,036 in cash, became the beneficial owner of 209,694 shares of Semele common
stock (valued at 314,541 1.50 per share) at the time of the exchange
transaction) and received a beneficial interest in the Semele Note of 462,353.
At June 30, 1998, Semele performed both a reverse stock split and a forward
stock split resulting in a change of the Trust's beneficial ownership in its
stock to 20,969 shares. The Semele Note bears an annual interest rate of 10 and
will be amortized over three years with mandatory principal reductions, if and
to the extent that net proceeds are received by Semele from the sale or
refinancing of Rancho Malibu. The Trust recognized interest income of 46,235
related to the Semele Note during the year

ended December 31, 1998. The Trust's interest in the Hato Arrow had an original
cost and net book value of 2,399,580 and 1,185,726, respectively. The proceeds
realized by the Trust of 777,326 resulted in a net loss, for financial
statement purposes, of 408,400. In addition, as this vessel was disposed of
prior to the expiration of the related lease term, the Trust received a
prepayment of the remaining contracted rent due under the vessel's lease
agreement of 432,604.

 Pursuant to terms of the exchange, cash equal to the amount of the Semele
Note was placed in a segregated escrow account for the benefit of Semele pending
the outcome of certain shareholder proposals. Specifically, as part of the
exchange, Semele agreed to seek consent ("Consent") from its shareholders to:
(1) amend its certificate of incorporation and by-laws; (2) make additional
amendments to restrict the acquisition of its common stock in a way to protect
Semele's net operating loss carry-forwards, and (3) engage EFG to provide
administrative services to Semele, which services EFG will provide at cost. On
October 21, 1997, such Consent was obtained from Semele's shareholders. The
Consent also allowed for (i) the election of a new Board of Directors nominated
by EFG for terms of up to three years and an increase in the size of the Board
to as many as nine members, provided a majority of the Board shall consist of
members independent of Semele, EFG or any affiliate; and (ii) an amendment
extending Semele's life to perpetual and changing its name from Banyan Strategic
Land Fund II. Contemporaneously with the Consent being obtained, Semele declared
a 0.20 per share dividend to be paid on all shares, including those
beneficially owned by the Trust. A dividend of 41,939 was paid to the Trust on
November 17, 1997. This dividend represented a return of equity to the Trust,
which proportionately reduced the Trust's investment in Semele. Subsequent to
the exchange transaction, Gary D. Engle, President and Chief Executive Officer
of EFG, was elected to the Board of Directors and appointed Chief Executive
Officer of Semele and James A. Coyne, Executive Vice President of EFG was
appointed Semele's President and Chief Operating Officer, and elected to the
Board of Directors.

 In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 
115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, 
marketable equity securities classified as available-for-sale are required to 
be carried at fair value. On June 30, 1998, Semele effected a 1-for-300 
reverse stock split followed by a 30-for-1 forward stock split resulting in a 
reduction of the number of shares of Semele common stock owned by the Trust 
to 20,969 shares. During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Trust 
decreased the carrying value of its investment in Semele common stock to 
 4.125 per share (the quoted price of the Semele stock on NASDAQ at December 
31, 1998) resulting in an unrealized loss in 1998 of 70,773. This loss was 
reported as a component of comprehensive loss, included in participants' 
capital. The split-adjusted market price of Semele's stock was 7.50 per 
share at December 31, 1997. At December 31, 1998, the Managing Trustee 
determined that the decline in market value of the Semele common stock was 
other-than-temporary. As a result, the Trust wrote down the cost of the 
Semele stock to 4.125 per share (the quoted price of the Semele stock on 
NASDAQ at December 31, 1998) for a total realized loss of 186,105 in 1998.

 EFG and its Affiliates were reimbursed for their out-of-pocket offering
costs incurred on behalf of the Trust in an amount equal to 1 of the gross
proceeds of the four trusts which sold Class B Interests, pursuant to the
Registration Statement on Form S-1. The amount of reimbursement made by the
Trust was prorated in proportion to the number of Beneficiary Interests sold in
the Trust.

 As provided under the terms of the Trust Agreement, EFG is compensated for
its services to the Trust. Such services include all aspects of acquisition,
management and sale of equipment. For acquisition services, EFG was compensated
by an amount equal to .28 of Asset Base Price paid by the Trust for each asset
acquired for the Trust's initial asset portfolio. For acquisition services
during the initial reinvestment period, which expired on May 29, 1996, EFG was
compensated by an amount equal to 3 of Asset Base Price paid by the Trust. In
connection with the Solicitation Statement and consent of Beneficiaries (See
Note 10), the Trust's reinvestment provisions were reinstated through December
31, 2001. In addition, the Trust is now permitted to invest in assets other than
equipment. Acquisition fees paid to EFG in connection with such reinvestment
assets are equal to 1 of Asset Base Price paid by the Trust. For management
services, EFG is compensated by an amount equal to (i) 5 of gross operating
lease rental revenue and 2 of gross full payout lease rental revenue received
by the Trust with respect assets acquired on or prior to March 31, 1998. For
management services earned in connection with assets acquired on or after April
1, 1998, EFG is compensated by an amount equal to 2 of gross lease rental
revenue received by the Trust. Both of these fees are subject to certain
limitations defined in the Trust Agreement. For non-equipment investments other
than cash, the Managing Trustee receives an annualized management fee of 1 .
Compensation to EFG for services connected to the remarketing of equipment is
calculated as the lesser of (i) 3 of gross sale proceeds or (ii) one-half of
reasonable brokerage fees otherwise payable under arm's length circumstances.
Payment of the remarketing fee is subordinated to Payout and is subject to
certain limitations defined in the Trust Agreement.

 Administrative charges represent amounts owed to EFG, pursuant to Section
10.4(c) the Trust Agreement, for persons employed by EFG who are engaged in
providing administrative services to the Trust. Reimbursable operating expenses
due to third parties represent costs paid by EFG on behalf of the Trust which
are reimbursed to EFG at actual cost.

 All equipment was purchased from EFG, one of its Affiliates or from
third-party sellers. The Trust's Purchase Price is determined by the method
described in Note 2, Equipment on Lease.

 All rents and proceeds from the sale of equipment are paid directly to
either EFG or to a lender. EFG temporarily deposits collected funds in a
separate interest-bearing escrow account prior to remittance to the Trust. At
December 31, 1998, the Trust was owed 70,959 by EFG for such funds and the
interest thereon. These funds were remitted to the Trust in January 1999.

 Old North Capital Limited Partnership ("ONC"), a Massachusetts limited
partnership formed in 1995 and an affiliate of EFG, owns 1,702 Class A Interests
or less than 1 of the total outstanding Class A Interests of the Trust. The
general partner of ONC is controlled by Gary D. Engle. In addition, the limited
partnership interests of ONC are owned by Semele. Gary D. Engle is Chairman and
CEO of Semele.

 Refer to Note 8 regarding the purchase of Class B Interests by an
affiliate, Equis II Corporation and the change in ownership of the Managing
Trustee.

NOTE 6 - NOTES PAYABLE

 Notes payable at December 31, 1998 consisted of installment notes of
 861,300 payable to banks and institutional lenders. The notes bear interest
rates ranging between 5.7 and 8 , except for one note which

21

AFG Investment Trust A
 Notes to the Financial Statements

 (Continued)

bears a fluctuating interest rate based on LIBOR (5.54 at December 31, 1998)
plus a margin. All of the installment notes are non-recourse and are
collateralized by the equipment and assignment of the related lease payments.
Generally, the installment notes will be fully amortized by noncancellable
rents. However, the Trust has a balloon payment obligation of 282,421 at the
expiration of the primary lease term related to its interest in an aircraft
leased to Reno Air, Inc. The carrying amount of notes payable approximates fair
value at December 31, 1998.

 The annual maturities of the notes payable are as follows:

 For the year ended December 31, 1999 210,654
 2000 118,459
 2001 128,106

NOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES

 The Trust is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes.
Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been recorded in the accounts of
the Trust.

 For financial statement purposes, the Trust allocates net income quarterly
first, to eliminate any Participant's negative capital account balance and
second, 1 to the Managing Trustee, 8.25 to the Special Beneficiary and 90.75 
collectively to the Class A and Class B Beneficiaries. The latter is allocated
proportionately between the Class A and Class B Beneficiaries based upon the
ratio of cash distributions declared and allocated to the Class A and Class B
Beneficiaries during the period. Net losses are allocated quarterly first, to
eliminate any positive capital account balance of the Managing Trustee, the
Special Beneficiary and the Class B Beneficiaries; second, to eliminate any
positive capital account balances of the Class A Beneficiaries; and third, any
remainder to the Managing Trustee. This convention differs from the income or
loss allocation requirements for income tax and Dissolution Event purposes as
delineated in the Trust Agreement. For income tax purposes, the Trust allocates
net income or net loss in accordance with the provisions of such agreement.
Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, upon dissolution of the Trust, the Managing
Trustee will be required to contribute to the Trust an amount equal to any
negative balance which may exist in the Managing Trustee's tax capital account.
At December 31, 1998, the Managing Trustee had a positive tax capital account
balance.

NOTE 8 - ISSUANCE OF CLASS B INTERESTS

 On October 26, 1996, the Trust filed a Solicitation Statement with the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") which subsequently
was sent to the Beneficiaries pursuant to Regulation 14A of Section 14 of the
Securities Exchange Act. The Solicitation Statement sought the consent of the
Beneficiaries to a proposed amendment (the "Amendment") to the Amended and
Restated Declaration of Trust (the "Amended Trust Agreement") which would (i)
amend the provisions of the Amended Trust Agreement governing the redemption of
Beneficiary Interests to permit the Trust to offer to redeem outstanding
Beneficiary Interests at such times, in such amounts, in such manner and at such
prices as the Managing Trustee might determine from time to time, in accordance
with applicable law; and (ii) add a provision to the Amended Trust Agreement
that would permit the Trust to issue, at the discretion of the Managing Trustee
and without further consent or approval of the Beneficiaries, an additional
class of security with such designations, preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, powers and duties as the
Managing Trustee might affix. The funds obtained through the issuance of such a
security were intended to be used by the Trust to (a) expand redemption
opportunities for Beneficiaries without using Trust funds which might otherwise
be available for cash distributions; and (b) make a special one-time cash
distribution to the Class A Beneficiaries.

 Pursuant to the Amended Trust Agreement, the adoption of the Amendment
required the consent of the Beneficiaries holding more than 50 in the aggregate
of the Class A Interests held by all Class A Beneficiaries. A majority of Class
A Interests, representing 286,868 Interests or 52.2 of all Class A Interests,
voted in favor of the Amendment; 49,019 Interests or 8.9 of all Class A
Interests voted against the Amendment; and 16,104 Interests or 2.9 of all Class
A Interests abstained. Approximately 64 of all Class A Interests participated
in the vote. Accordingly, the Amendment was adopted.

23

AFG Investment Trust A
 Notes to the Financial Statements

 (Continued)

 On February 12, 1997, the Trust filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1
with the SEC, which became effective June 10, 1997. The Registration Statement
covered the issuance and sale of a new class of beneficiary interests in the
Trust (the "Class B Interests"). The characteristics of the Class B Interests,
associated risk factors and other matters of importance to the Beneficiaries and
purchasers of the Class B Interests were set forth in a Prospectus sent to the
Beneficiaries. On July 17, 1997, the offering closed and on July 18, 1997 the
Trust issued 826,072 Class B Interests at 5.00 per interest, thereby generating
 4,130,360 in aggregate Class B capital contributions. Class A Beneficiaries
purchased 3,209 Class B Interests, generating 16,045 of such aggregate capital
contributions, and the Special Beneficiary, EFG, purchased 822,863 Class B
Interests, generating 4,114,315 of such aggregate capital contributions. The
Trust incurred offering costs in the amount of 41,304 and professional service
costs of 54,186 in connection with this offering.

 Subsequently, EFG transferred its Class B Interests to a special-purpose
company, Equis II Corporation, a Delaware corporation. EFG also transferred its
ownership of AFG ASIT Corporation, the Managing Trustee of the Trust, to Equis
II Corporation. As a result, Equis II Corporation has voting control of the
Trust through its ownership of the majority of all of the Trust's outstanding
voting interests, as well as its ownership of AFG ASIT Corporation. Equis II
Corporation is controlled by EFG's President and Chief Executive Officer, Gary
D. Engle. Accordingly, control of the Managing Trustee did not change as a
result of the foregoing transactions.

 As described in the Prospectus for the offering of the Class B Interests,
the Managing Trustee used a portion of the net cash proceeds realized from the
offering of the Class B Interests to pay a one-time special cash distribution of
approximately 1.47 per Class A Interest to the Class A Beneficiaries of the
Trust. The Managing Trustee declared and paid this special cash distribution,
aggregating 808,363, to Class A Beneficiaries on August 15, 1997. See Note 9
regarding the redemption of Class A Interests.

NOTE 9 - REDEMPTION OF CLASS A INTERESTS

 On August 7, 1997, the Trust commenced an offer to purchase up to 45 of
the outstanding Class A Beneficiary Interests of the Trust by filing a Form
13E-4, Issuer Tender Offer Statement, with the SEC and distributing to the Class
A Beneficiaries information concerning the offer. On October 10, 1997, the Trust
used 620,011 of the net proceeds realized from the issuance of the Class B
Interests to purchase 65,402 of the Class A Interests tendered as a result of
the offer. On April 28, 1998, the Trust purchased 1,800 additional Class A
Interests at a cost of 14,400.

NOTE 10 - SOLICITATION STATEMENT

 On May 5, 1998, the Trust filed a definitive Solicitation Statement with
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the
solicitation by the Trust of the consent of the Beneficiaries to a proposed
amendment (the "Amendment") to the Second Amended and Restated Declaration of
Trust (the "Trust Agreement"). The Solicitation Statement and Consent of
Beneficiary were mailed to all of the Beneficiaries of the Trust on May 6, 1998.
The Beneficiaries were requested to use the Consent of Beneficiary to vote on
seven proposals and return their votes on or before June 5, 1998. Equis II
Corporation, which has voting control of the Trust, agreed to vote all of its
Class B Interests in the same manner in which the majority of the Class A
Interests were actually voted. Accordingly, the Amendment would be adopted or
rejected based upon the voting results of the majority of Class A Interests that
were actually voted (including 1,702 Class A Interests owned by affiliates of
EFG), regardless of how few Class A Interests were actually voted.

 The results of the voting reflected that a majority of Class A Interests
voted in favor of each of the proposals. Therefore, the Trust Agreement was
amended to (i) broaden the Trust's stated investment policies and objectives and
permit the Trust to invest in assets other than leased equipment; (ii) modify
the Trust's financing provisions to

24

AFG Investment Trust A
 Notes to the Financial Statements

 (Continued)

eliminate any cap on the amount of aggregate Trust indebtedness and permit the
Trust to use cross-collateralized and other recourse debt structures; (iii)
extend the Trust's reinvestment period, which originally expired on May 29,
1996, until December 31, 2001 and (iv) reduce acquisition fees paid to EFG in
connection with reinvestment assets acquired after the Amendment date from a
maximum of 3 to 1 and management fees earned in connection with such assets
from a maximum of 5 to 2 .

 In addition, subject to attaining a settlement in the Class Action Lawsuit
described in Note 12 herein, the Trust Agreement will be modified in the
following principal respects: (i) the Trust will pay a Special Cash Distribution
to the Class A Beneficiaries of record as of September 1, 1997, or to their
successors or assigns, totaling 413,247 (or approximately 0.75 per Class A
Beneficiary Interest) using a portion of the Class B capital contributions that
otherwise would be distributed as a Class B Capital Distribution to Equis II
Corporation, the parent company of the Managing Trustee and an affiliate of EFG;
(ii) Equis II Corporation will be required to reduce its prospective Class B
Capital Distributions by 929,806 and treat such amount as a long-term equity
investment in the Trust and (iii) certain voting restrictions will be placed
upon the Class B Interests owned by Equis II Corporation.

NOTE 11 - CLASS B CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION

 The Managing Trustee and certain of its affiliates were named as
defendants in the Class Action Lawsuit discussed in Note 12 herein. In
connection with this litigation and subject to a settlement being effected, the
Managing Trustee has agreed to adopt certain modifications to the Trust
Agreement as described in the Solicitation Statement referred to in Note 10
herein. One aspect of the proposed settlement would result in using of a portion
of Equis II Corporation's Class B Capital Contribution to the Trust to (i) pay a
second special cash distribution to Class A Beneficiaries totaling 413,247,
approximately .75 per Class A Beneficiary Interest, and (ii) invest 929,806 in
the Trust's long-term business activities. The remainder of the Class B Capital
Contributions (not otherwise used to repurchase Class A Interests or to pay for
offering and related costs associated with the Class B Interests or to pay the
first special cash distribution), 1,263,443 in total, was returned to Equis II
Corporation 1,253,318) and the other third-party Class B capital contributors 10,125) on July 6, 1998.

NOTE 12 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 On or about January 15, 1998, certain plaintiffs (the "Plaintiffs") filed
a class and derivative action, captioned Leonard Rosenblum, et al. v. Equis
Financial Group Limited Partnership, et al., in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Florida (the "Court") on behalf of a proposed class
of investors in 28 equipment leasing programs sponsored by EFG, including the
Trust (collectively, the "Nominal Defendants"), against EFG and a number of its
affiliates, including the Managing Trustee, as defendants (collectively, the
"Defendants"). Certain of the Plaintiffs, on or about June 24, 1997, had filed
an earlier derivative action, captioned Leonard Rosenblum, et al. v. Equis
Financial Group Limited Partnership, et al., in the Superior Court of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts on behalf of the Nominal Defendants against the
Defendants. Both actions are referred to herein collectively as the "Class
Action Lawsuit."

 The Plaintiffs have asserted, among other things, claims against the
Defendants on behalf of the Nominal Defendants for violations of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, common law fraud, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
duty, and violations of the partnership or trust agreements that govern each of
the Nominal Defendants. The Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, that
any of them have committed or threatened to commit any violations of law or
breached any fiduciary duties to the Plaintiffs or the Nominal Defendants.

 On July 16, 1998, counsel for the Defendants and the Plaintiffs executed a
Stipulation of Settlement setting forth terms pursuant to which a settlement of
the Class Action Lawsuit is intended to be achieved and which, among other
things, is expected to reduce the burdens and expenses attendant to continuing
litigation. The

25

AFG Investment Trust A
 Notes to the Financial Statements

 (Continued)

Stipulation of Settlement was based upon and superseded a Memorandum of
Understanding between the parties dated March 9, 1998 which outlined the terms
of a possible settlement. The Stipulation of Settlement was filed with the Court
on July 23, 1998 and was preliminarily approved by the Court on August 20, 1998
when the Court issued its "Order Preliminarily Approving Settlement,
Conditionally Certifying Settlement Class and Providing for Notice of, and
Hearing on, the Proposed Settlement" (the "August 20 Order"). Prior to issuing a
final order, the Court will hold a fairness hearing that will be open to all
interested parties and permit any party to object to the settlement. The
investors of the Trust and all other plaintiff class members in the Class Action
Lawsuit will receive a Notice of Settlement and other information pertinent to
the settlement of their claims in advance of the fairness hearing. Since first
executing the Stipulation of Settlement, the Court has scheduled two fairness
hearings, the first on December 11, 1998 and the second on March 19, 1999, each
of which was postponed because of delays in finalizing certain information
materials that are subject to regulatory review prior to being distributed to
investors, but none of which involved the Trust's settlement.

 On March 15, 1999, counsel for the Plaintiffs and the Defendants entered
into an amended stipulation of settlement (the "Amended Stipulation") which was
filed with the Court on March 15, 1999. The Amended Stipulation was
preliminarily approved by the Court by its "Modified Order Preliminarily
Approving Settlement, Conditionally Certifying Settlement Class and Providing
For Notice of, and Hearing On, the Proposed Settlement" dated March 22, 1999
(the "March 22 Order"). The Amended Stipulation, among other things, divides the
Class Action Lawsuit into two separate sub-classes that can be settled
individually. This revision is expected to expedite the settlement of the
Trust's claims by the middle of 1999. The second sub-class, which does not
include the Trust, is expected to remain pending for a longer period.

 Assuming the proposed settlement is effected according to present terms,
the Trust's share of legal fees and expenses related to the Class Action Lawsuit
is estimated to be approximately 88,000, all of which was accrued and expensed
by the Trust in 1998. There can be no assurance that settlement of either
sub-class of the Class Action Lawsuit will receive final Court approval and be
effected. However, the Managing Trustee and its affiliates, in consultation with
counsel, concur that there is a reasonable basis to believe that final
settlements of each sub-class will be achieved. In the absence of final
settlements approved by the Court, the Defendants intend to defend vigorously
against the claims asserted in the Class Action Lawsuit. Neither the Managing
Trustee nor its affiliates can predict with any degree of certainty the cost of
continuing litigation to the Trust or the ultimate outcome.

 In addition to the foregoing, the Trust is a party to other lawsuits that
have arisen out of the conduct of its business, principally involving disputes
or disagreements with lessees over lease terms and conditions. The following
action had not been finally adjudicated at December 31, 1998:

Action involving National Steel Corporation

 EFG, on behalf of the Trust and certain affiliated investment programs
(collectively, the "Plaintiffs"), filed an action in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts Superior Court, Department of the Trial Court in and for the
County of Suffolk on July 27, 1995, for damages and declaratory relief against a
lessee of the Trust, National Steel Corporation ("National Steel"). The
Complaint seeks reimbursement from National Steel of certain sales and/or use
taxes paid to the State of Illinois in connection with equipment leased by
National Steel from the Plaintiffs and other remedies provided under the Master
Lease Agreement ("MLA"). On August 30, 1995, National Steel filed a Notice of
Removal, which removed the case to United States District Court, District of
Massachusetts. On September 7, 1995, National Steel filed its Answer to the
Plaintiff's Complaint along with Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaims and
sought declaratory relief, alleging breach of contract, implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, and specific performance. The Plaintiffs filed an Answer
to National Steel's Counterclaims on September 29, 1995. The parties discussed
settlement with respect to this matter for some time; however, the negotiations
were unsuccessful. The Plaintiffs filed an Amended and Supplemental Complaint
alleging further default under the MLA and filed a motion for Summary Judgment
on all claims and Counterclaims. The Court held a hearing on the Plaintiff's
motion in December 1997 and later entered a decision dismissing certain of
National

 Notes to the Financial Statements

 (Continued)

Steel's Counterclaims, finding in favor of the Plaintiffs on certain issues and
in favor of National Steel on other issues. In March 1999, the Plaintiffs
obtained payment for certain of the disputed items and have resumed settlement
discussions to resolve remaining issues. The Managing Trustee does not believe
that the resolution of the remaining claims will have a material adverse effect
on the Trust's financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 13 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT

 In January 1999, the Trust sold its 6.74 interest in a McDonnell Douglas
MD-82 aircraft formerly leased to Alaska Airlines, Inc. The Trust received sale
proceeds of 786,406. At December 31, 1998, the net carrying value of this
aircraft to the Trust was 706,535.

 SCHEDULE OF EXCESS (DEFICIENCY) OF TOTAL CASH GENERATED TO COST
 OF EQUIPMENT DISPOSED

 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996

 The Trust classifies all rents from leasing equipment as lease revenue.
Upon expiration of the primary lease terms, equipment may be sold, rented on a
month-to-month basis or re-leased for a defined period under a new or extended
lease agreement. The proceeds generated from selling or re-leasing the
equipment, in addition to any month-to-month revenues, represent the total
residual value realized for each item of equipment. Therefore, the financial
statement gain or loss, which reflects the difference between the net book value
of the equipment at the time of sale or disposition and the proceeds realized
upon sale or disposition may not reflect the aggregate residual proceeds
realized by the Trust for such equipment.

 The following is a summary of cash excess associated with equipment
dispositions occurring in the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996.

1. LEASE TERM. PAYMENT DATES.

 This Rental Schedule, between Lessor and Lessee incorporates by reference
the terms and conditions of the Master Lease. Lessor hereby leases to Lessee and
Lessee hereby leases from Lessor those items of Equipment described on the
attached Schedule B, for the Lease Term and at the Basic Rent payable on the
Payment Dates hereinafter set forth on the attached Schedule A, on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Master Lease. The Lease Term is for the period from
and including the Acceptance Date of each item of Equipment set forth on the
attached Schedule B, to but not including the Primary Start Date, as hereinafter
defined ("Interim Term") and for a Primary Term commencing on the first day of
the calendar month following the last Acceptance Date for any item of Equipment
leased pursuant hereto ("Primary Start Date") and continuing to and including
the Lease Expiration Date set forth on the attached Schedule A. The Acceptance
Date for each item of Equipment shall be the date on which the item of Equipment
is accepted for lease by Lessee.

2. BASIC RENT.

 Interim Term Basic Rent is computed by multiplying the Total Equipment
Cost by the Per Diem Lease Rate set forth on the attached Schedule A and
multiplying the product by the number of days in the Interim Term. Primary Term
Basic Rent is computed by multiplying the Total Equipment Cost by the Periodic
Lease Rate set forth on the attached Schedule A.

3. LESSEE'S OPTIONS UPON LEASE EXPIRATION.

 Lessee has the option at the expiration of the Lease Term, exerciseable
with respect to all, but not less than all, items of Equipment leased pursuant
to Rental Schedules having the same Expiration Date, (i) to return the Equipment
to Lessor, (ii) to renew the Rental Schedule at fair rental value for a Renewal
Term the length of which shall be determined by agreement of Lessee and Lessor
or (iii) to purchase the equipment for cash at its then fair market value.

 a. Lessee agrees to provide Lessor written notice of its decision to
 return the Equipment, renew the Rental Schedule or purchase the
 Equipment not less than ninety (90) days prior to the Lease
 Expiration Date. If Lessee fails to give Lessor ninety (90) days
 written notice, the Lease Term may, at Lessor's option, be extended
 and continue until ninety (90) days from the date Lessor receives
 written notice of Lessee's decision to return the Equipment, renew
 the Rental Schedule or purchase the Equipment. Such (90) day
 extension shall be at the original rate set forth on Schedule A.

RENTAL SCHEDULE AND ACCEPTANCE CERTIFICATE NO. A-11
 PAGE TWO

 b. Fair market value and fair rental value shall mean an amount which
 would be obtained in an arm's-length transaction between an informed
 and willing buyer-user or lessee (other than a dealer) and an
 informed and willing seller or lessor under no compulsion to sell or
 lease provided, however, that in such determination: (i) the
 Equipment shall be assumed to be in the condition in which it is
 required to be maintained and returned under this Agreement and (ii)
 costs of removal from current location shall not be a deduction from
 such valuation. Fair market value, fair rental value and useful life
 will be determined by agreement of Lessor and Lessee, or if the
 parties cannot agree, by an independent equipment appraiser selected
 by Lessor and reasonably acceptable to Lessee. The cost of the
 appraisal will be shared equally by Lessor and Lessee.

 c. Each item of equipment must be maintained in a manner that is

1. LEASE TERM. PAYMENT DATES.

 This Rental Schedule, between Lessor and Lessee incorporates by reference
the terms and conditions of the Master Lease. Lessor hereby leases to Lessee and
Lessee hereby leases from Lessor those items of Equipment described on the
attached Schedule B, for the Lease Term and at the Basic Rent payable on the
Payment Dates hereinafter set forth on the attached Schedule A, on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Master Lease. The Lease Term is for the period from
and including the Acceptance Date of each item of Equipment set forth on the
attached Schedule B, to but not including the Primary Start Date, as hereinafter
defined ("Interim Term") and for a Primary Term commencing on the first day of
the calendar month following the last Acceptance Date for any item of Equipment
leased pursuant hereto ("Primary Start Date") and continuing to and including
the Lease Expiration Date set forth on the attached Schedule A. The Acceptance
Date for each item of Equipment shall be the date on which the item of Equipment
is accepted for lease by Lessee.

2. BASIC RENT.

 Interim Term Basic Rent is computed by multiplying the Total Equipment
Cost by the Per Diem Lease Rate set forth on the attached Schedule A and
multiplying the product by the number of days in the Interim Term. Primary Term
Basic Rent is computed by multiplying the Total Equipment Cost by the Periodic
Lease Rate set forth on the attached Schedule A.

3. LESSEE'S OPTIONS UPON LEASE EXPIRATION.

 Lessee has the option at the expiration of the Lease Term, exerciseable
with respect to all, but not less than all, items of Equipment leased pursuant
to Rental Schedules having the same Expiration Date, (i) to return the Equipment
to Lessor, (ii) to renew the Rental Schedule at fair rental value for a Renewal
Term the length of which shall be determined by agreement of Lessee and Lessor
or (iii) to purchase the equipment for cash at its then fair market value.

 a. Lessee agrees to provide Lessor written notice of its decision to
 return the Equipment, renew the Rental Schedule or purchase the
 Equipment not less than ninety (90) days prior to the Lease
 Expiration Date. If Lessee fails to give Lessor ninety (90) days
 written notice, the Lease Term may, at Lessor's option, be extended
 and continue until ninety (90) days from the date Lessor receives
 written notice of Lessee's decision to return the Equipment, renew
 the Rental Schedule or purchase the Equipment. Such (90) day
 extension shall be at the original rate set forth on Schedule A.

RENTAL SCHEDULE AND ACCEPTANCE CERTIFICATE NO. A-12
 PAGE TWO

 b. Fair market value and fair rental value shall mean an amount which
 would be obtained in an arm's-length transaction between an informed
 and willing buyer-user or lessee (other than a dealer) and an
 informed and willing seller or lessor under no compulsion to sell or
 lease provided, however, that in such determination: (i) the
 Equipment shall be assumed to be in the condition in which it is
 required to be maintained and returned under this Agreement and (ii)
 costs of removal from current location shall not be a deduction from
 such valuation. Fair market value, fair rental value and useful life
 will be determined by agreement of Lessor and Lessee, or if the
 parties cannot agree, by an independent equipment appraiser selected
 by Lessor and reasonably acceptable to Lessee. The cost of the
 appraisal will be shared equally by Lessor and Lessee.

 c. Each item of equipment must be maintained in a manner that is
 consistent with that which is recommended by the manufacturer. Upon
 any termination or expiration of this Rental Schedule, Lessee will
 promptly, at its own cost and expense provide Lessor with a
 Maintenance Acceptance Qualification (MAQ) letter which will be
 provided by a manufacturer's representative certifying that the
 Equipment is eligible for maintenance. Lessee will return to Lessor
 all operating manuals and cables required for the full functioning
 of the Equipment. Any cost associated with transferring the software
 license to a third party will be solely for the account of Lessee.

The Rental Schedule shall continue in full force and effect and Lessee shall
continue to pay Basic Rent through and including the date on which the Equipment
is returned by Lessee.

4. ACCEPTANCE CERTIFICATE
