 PART I
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY.
 
GENERAL
 
 Itel Corporation (the "Company" or "Itel"), which was incorporated in
Delaware in 1967, is engaged in (i) the distribution of wiring systems products
for voice, data and video networks and electrical power applications by Anixter
Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively "Anixter"), (ii) the development and
distribution of products used in the cable television industry by ANTEC
Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively "ANTEC"), and (iii) rail car
leasing by Itel Rail Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively "Rail") (see
discussion below of the 1992 rail car transaction for the limited nature of the
Company's continuing interest in this business). In 1993, ANTEC was changed from
a division of Anixter to a subsidiary of the Company and the Company's interest
in ANTEC was later reduced to 53 following a public offering of ANTEC common
stock. In 1993 and 1992, the Company sold substantially all of its other
transportation services assets, except for one short-line railroad which is
currently being held for sale. In 1991, the Company sold the distribution
services business previously conducted by Itel Distribution Systems, Inc. ("Itel
Distribution") and all the stock of Great Lakes International, Inc. which
together with its subsidiaries (collectively "Great Lakes") was engaged in heavy
marine construction, primarily dredging. At the end of 1990, the Company sold
substantially all of its intermodal container leasing assets. For information
about these sales see Item 7 -- Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources --
Asset Sales and Other Dispositions and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
 
 At December 31, 1993, the Company also had investments in securities of
other companies, including approximately 9 of the common stock of Santa Fe
Energy Resources, Inc. ("Energy") and approximately 9 of the common stock of
Catellus Development Corporation ("Real Estate"). In 1991, the Company sold its
15 investment in the common stock of Santa Fe Pacific Corporation ("Santa Fe")
and its 21 investment in the common stock of American President Companies, Ltd.
("APC"). The financing operations of Signal Capital Corporation and its
subsidiaries (collectively "Signal Capital") and certain remaining other
transportation services assets are being held for sale. See Note 3 of the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
 As of December 31, 1993, the Company had cumulative net operating loss
("NOL") carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes of approximately 345
million expiring primarily in 1995 through 2007, and investment tax credit
("ITC") carryforwards of approximately 16 million that expire between 1994 and
2001. Certain of these carryforwards have not been examined by the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") and, therefore, may be subject to adjustment. The
availability of tax benefits of NOL and ITC carryforwards to reduce the
Company's future Federal income tax liability is subject to various limitations
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. These carryforwards are not
applicable to ANTEC's results after September 1993. In addition, at December 31,
1993, various foreign subsidiaries of Itel had aggregate cumulative NOL
carryforwards for foreign income tax purposes of approximately 50 million which
are subject to various tax provisions of each respective country and expire
primarily between 1995 and 2003.
 
 At December 31, 1993, the Company and its subsidiaries employed
approximately 4,600 persons. For information on segment and geographic data see
Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
ANIXTER
 
 Anixter is a leading supplier of wiring systems, networking and
internetworking products for voice, data and video networks and electrical power
applications in the United States, Canada, Europe and parts of Asia. Anixter
stocks and sells a full line of these products from a network of 87 locations in
the United States, 21 in Canada, 20 in the United Kingdom, 23 in Continental
Europe, 2 in Mexico, 2 in Australia and single locations in Singapore, Hong Kong
and Ireland. Anixter sells approximately 80,000 products to over 60,000 active
customers and works with over 2,000 suppliers. Its customers include
international, national, regional and local companies that are end users of
these products and engage in manufacturing, communications, finance,
 
 3
 4
 
education, health care, transportation, utilities and government. Also, Anixter
sells products to resellers such as contractors, installers, system integrators,
value added resellers, architects, engineers and wholesale distributors. The
average order size is about 1,000.
 
 The products sold by Anixter fall into two broad categories. The first
category is communication (voice, data and video) products used to connect
personal computers, peripheral equipment, mainframe equipment and various
networks to each other. The products include an assortment of transmission media
(copper and fiber optic cable) and components, such as adapters, outlets, cable
assemblies, crossconnect systems, connectors, terminals, tools, test equipment
and power protection devices. Active data components for networking applications
include concentrators, intelligent hubs, multiplexers, transceivers, routers and
servers. Anixter sells products that are incorporated in local area networks
("LANs"), the internetworking of LANs to form wide area networks ("WANs") and
the increased use of fiber optic products in private networks, including factory
environments. It is expected that these markets will continue to grow at double
digit rates, with international growth somewhat outpacing U.S. growth. Anixter
has followed a strategy of regularly expanding its product lines and the
services that it provides to its customers. During 1993, Anixter began selling
and providing technological support for internetworking products, including
routers, as well as video-conferencing and network access products.
 
 The second major product category is electrical wiring systems products
used for the transmission of electrical energy and control/monitoring of
industrial processes. These products include power cables, high temperature or
other critical environment cables, armored and control cable, instrumentation
and thermalcouple cable, portable power cable, shielded electronic process
cables and accessory products. Anixter is not a significant distributor to the
residential or commercial construction industries.
 
 Prior to 1989, Anixter's operations were limited to the United States,
Canada, the United Kingdom and Belgium. In 1989, Anixter made a major commitment
to expand its operations into the international voice, data and video
communications markets. Since then, Anixter has opened businesses in France,
Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Australia, Mexico, Portugal,
Singapore, The Netherlands, Austria and Hong Kong. Anixter also has resident
salespersons in Greece and Malaysia along with technical representatives in the
Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. While several of these expansion businesses
achieved an operating profit in 1993 and 1992, the international expansion
program is still considered to be in the startup mode. Since 1988, Anixter has
experienced operating losses relating to the expansion program totalling
approximately 33 million.
 
 An important element of Anixter's business strategy is to develop and
maintain close relationships with its key suppliers, which include the world's
leading manufacturers of networking and electrical wiring systems products. Such
relationships stress joint product planning, inventory management, technical
support, advertising and marketing. In support of this strategy, Anixter does
not compete with its suppliers in product design or manufacturing activities.
 
 Anixter has developed a competitive advantage through its proprietary
computer system which connects all of its warehouses and sales offices
throughout the world. The system is designed for sales support, order entry,
inventory status, order tracking, credit review and material management. This
fully integrated system connects Anixter's 158 worldwide service centers through
more than 2,600 terminals. The computer system enables the sales staff to locate
products at any location and ship them within 24 hours. Anixter provides a high
level of customer service while maintaining a reasonable level of investment in
inventory and facilities.
 
 Anixter competes with distributors and manufacturers who sell products
directly or through existing distribution channels to end users or other
resellers. In addition, Anixter's future performance could be subject to
economic downturns and possibly rapid changes in applicable technologies. To
guard against inventory obsolescence, Anixter has negotiated various return and
price protection agreements with its key suppliers. Although Anixter's
relationships with its suppliers are good, the loss of a major supplier could
have a temporary adverse effect on Anixter's business but would not have a
lasting impact since such products are available from alternate sources.

ANTEC
 
 ANTEC is a leading developer and supplier of optical transmission,
construction, rebuild and maintenance equipment for the broadband communications
industry. The ANTEC business was originally formed as a division of Anixter in
1969 and, in 1993, ANTEC became a separate subsidiary of Itel.
 
 ANTEC's role in the development of new products is to identify new product
needs in the broadband communications industry and to work with strategic allies
that generally contribute extensive engineering and design services in
conjunction with ANTEC's engineers and then manufacture the product for sale by
ANTEC. These alliances allow ANTEC to develop innovative products while
minimizing its investment in engineering, facilities and equipment.
 
 ANTEC is one of the leading suppliers to the cable market for fiber optic
products. ANTEC also supplies cable system operators with almost all of the
products required in a cable television system, including headend, distribution,
drop and in-home subscriber products. ANTEC serves its customers through an
efficient delivery network consisting of 23 sales and stocking locations in
North America. ANTEC maintains complete inventories and is able to provide
overnight as well as staged delivery of product on an "as needed" basis.
 
 More than 95 of ANTEC's consolidated sales for the year ended December 31,
1993 came from sales to the cable industry. Demand for these products depends
primarily on capital spending by cable operators for constructing, rebuilding,
maintaining or upgrading their systems. The amount of capital spending and,
therefore, ANTEC's sales and profitability, are affected by a variety of
factors, including general economic conditions, access by cable operators to
financing, government regulation of cable operators, demand for cable services
and technological developments in the broadband communications industry.
Technological developments are occurring rapidly in the communications industry
and, while the effects of such developments are uncertain, they may have a
material adverse effect on the demand for ANTEC products and on the cable
industry as a whole. For example, technologies are being implemented that bypass
existing cable systems and permit the transmission of signals directly into
households.
 
 Cable operators are subject to extensive regulation. For example, pursuant
to the Cable Act of 1992, the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") has
adopted regulations that govern cable operators. The regulations generally
provide, among other things, for rate rollbacks for basic tier cable service,
further rate reductions under certain circumstances and limitations on future
rate increases. In addition, the Cable Act of 1992 provides that commercial
broadcasting stations may elect (i) to require cable operators to carry their
stations, or (ii) to bar cable operators from carrying their stations unless the
cable operator agrees to pay to the station a "re-transmission consent fee."
Also in 1992, the FCC issued its "video dialtone" ruling which, among other
things, allows local telephone companies to transmit all types of enhanced
services, including interactive voice, video and data delivery in competition
with cable operators. Additionally, in February 1994, the FCC announced that it
intends to impose another rate cut of 7 for basic services. These regulations,
among others, could limit capital expenditures by cable operators and, thus,
could limit or reduce ANTEC's profitability. Moreover, changes in current
regulation are possible and could have a similar effect.
 
 On August 24, 1993, a Federal district court judge in Alexandria, Virginia
declared unconstitutional, on First Amendment grounds, restrictions, as applied
to Bell Atlantic Corporation and six other regional phone companies, under the
1984 Cable Act that prevent local exchange telephone companies from providing
video programming to subscribers in their own telephone service area. It is
uncertain whether this ruling will be upheld on appeal, and it is unclear what
long-term effect, if any, this decision and related developments may have on the
cable industry in general or ANTEC's business prospects. Similar uncertainty is
created by proposed federal legislation to permit competition among cable
operators, telephone companies and other companies.
 
 Almost all of the products supplied by ANTEC are manufactured for it by
domestic and foreign manufacturers. Approximately 23 of ANTEC's aggregate
purchases in 1993 were of products manufactured by AT&T, and many ANTEC
customers have demonstrated loyalty to AT&T products. In addition, approximately
57 of ANTEC's purchases in 1993 were from its ten largest suppliers. The loss
of a significant manufacturing source, such as AT&T, could adversely affect
ANTEC's business, although management
 
 5
 6
 
believes that any such loss is unlikely to have a lasting impact on its
business, since such products are generally available from alternate sources.
 
 There can be no assurance that the technology applications under
development by ANTEC and its strategic partners will be successfully developed
or, if they are successfully developed, that they will be widely used by cable
operators or that ANTEC will otherwise be able to successfully exploit these
technology applications. Furthermore, ANTEC's competitors may develop similar or
alternative new technology applications which, if successful, could have a
material adverse effect on ANTEC. ANTEC relies on strategic alliances with
various manufacturers for the development and production of new technology
applications. These strategic alliances are based on business relationships and
generally are not subject of written agreements expressly providing for the
alliance to continue for a significant period of time. The loss of a strategic
partner could have a material adverse effect on the development of the new
products under development with that partner.
 
 The cable industry is highly concentrated with over 75 of U.S. domestic
subscribers being served by approximately twenty-five major multi-system
operators ("MSO's"). In 1993, approximately 58 of ANTEC's revenues were
obtained from sales to the twenty-five largest MSO's. A significant portion of
ANTEC's revenue is derived from sales to Tele-Communications, Inc. (together
with its affiliates, "TCI") aggregating 146.1 million, 86.7 million and 58.0
million for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991. In October, 1993,
TCI and Bell Atlantic Corporation jointly announced their agreement for the
acquisition of TCI and Bell Atlantic. In February, 1994, TCI and Bell Atlantic
jointly announced the termination of their acquisition agreement. A variety of
factors were identified, including the FCC rate cut, as the reasons for such
termination. In the termination announcement, TCI also indicated that it plans
to suspend its capital expenditure budget for 1994 by one-half pending
clarification of the FCC action. It is not known what effect, if any, the recent
FCC and TCI announcements will have on capital spending increases in general, or
on ANTEC's performance in particular. However, ANTEC believes that while capital
expenditures for some products by some operators may be adversely effected,
capital spending for infrastructure improvements and upgrades will continue and,
therefore, ANTEC does not anticipate a material adverse impact on its
performance as a result of these recent announcements.
 
 All aspects of ANTEC's business are highly competitive. ANTEC competes with
national, regional and local manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers,
including companies larger than ANTEC, such as General Instrument Corporation
and Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. Various manufacturers who are suppliers to ANTEC
sell directly as well as through distributors into the cable marketplace. In
addition, because of the convergence of the cable, telecommunications and
computer industries and rapid technological development, new competitors may
seek to enter the cable market. Many of ANTEC's competitors or potential
competitors are substantially larger and have greater resources than ANTEC. The
principal methods of competition are product differentiation, performance and
quality; price and terms; and service, technical and administrative support.
 
 The future success of ANTEC depends in part on its ability to attract and
retain key executive, marketing and sales personnel. Competition for qualified
personnel in the cable industry is intense, and the loss of certain key
personnel could have a material adverse effect on ANTEC. ANTEC has entered into
employment contracts with its executive officers. ANTEC also has a stock option
program designed to provide substantial incentives for its employees to remain
with ANTEC.
 
RAIL CAR LEASING
 
 In June 1992, Itel and Rail completed a transaction with General Electric
Capital Corporation and certain of its affiliates ("GECC") pursuant to which
Rail contributed substantially all of its owned rail cars, subject to
approximately 170 million of debt, to a trust (the "Trust") of which Rail is a
99 beneficiary and the Trust contributed these rail cars, subject to the debt,
along with other rail cars the Trust received as a contribution from its 1 
beneficiary, to a partnership (the "Partnership") of which the Trust is a 99 
partner. The Partnership assumed the Rail debt and leased all of these
contributed rail cars, along with other rail cars it received as a contribution
from its other partners, to a subsidiary of GECC (the "Lessee"). These leases
(the "Leases") expire in 2004, with fixed rentals of approximately 153 million
annually. The Leases include the grant to the Lessee of an assignable fixed
price purchase option at the end of the term of the leases for all, but
 
 6
 7
not less than all, of the rail cars for approximately 500 million. The Leases
are net leases under which the Lessee is responsible for maintenance and other
expenses of the rail cars and all obligations of the Lessee are unconditionally
guaranteed by GECC. Rail also assigned to GECC, for certain consideration,
substantially all of its contracts to lease rail cars from others.
 
 Prior to the rail car transaction, most of Rail's cars, other than boxcars,
were leased to major railroads and shippers under fixed-rate leases which were
typically one to five years in length. The majority of these leases required
Rail to maintain the cars and provide other administrative services. The
utilization of grain hoppers was affected by, among other things, export demand,
domestic trade policies and weather. Prior to the rail car transaction, most of
Rail's boxcars were leased to small railroads and used primarily for
transportation by the paper and forest product industries. A majority of these
leases were long-term "per diem" leases. Per diem leases did not require fixed
rental payments. Instead, the rental paid by the lessee was a percentage of the
use charges ("car hire") earned by the lessee railroad for the use of the leased
equipment on the tracks of other railroads.
 
STOCK INVESTMENTS
 
 At December 31, 1993, as the result of September 1988 acquisitions, other
purchases and Santa Fe's 1990 restructuring and related spin-offs of Energy and
Real Estate common stock, the Company owned 8,064,005 shares or approximately 9 
of Energy's common stock and 6,687,575 shares or approximately 9 of Real
Estate's common stock, both of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(the "NYSE"). Energy and Real Estate are subject to the informational filing
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, in accordance
therewith, are required to file reports and other information with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 In 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Company wrote down the value of its investments
in marketable equity securities by 25 million, 25 million and 50 million,
respectively.
 
ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
 
 The principal assets held for sale at December 31, 1993 are those of Signal
Capital. The Company acquired Signal Capital in connection with the purchase of
a major rail car fleet in 1988. The finance business of Signal Capital has been
classified as assets held for sale in the Company's consolidated financial
statements since its acquisition. The finance business is being liquidated and
no material amounts of new loans or investments are being made by Signal
Capital. Since the date of acquisition the portfolio has been reduced from 1.44
billion to 175 million at December 31, 1993, including reductions of 82
million, 82 million and 157 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. All
cash proceeds were used to reduce indebtedness.
 
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
 
 See Item 1--Business of the Company--Rail Car Leasing and the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The Company's rail cars have been leased to GECC under the
Leases. Most of Anixter and ANTEC's facilities are leased. Certain of the debt
agreements of the Company's subsidiaries are secured by their assets (see Note 9
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
 
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries became
involved as plaintiffs or defendants in various legal proceedings. The claims
and counterclaims in such litigation, including those for punitive damages,
individually in certain cases and in the aggregate, involve amounts which may be
material. However, it is the opinion of the Company's management, based upon the
advice of its counsel, that the ultimate disposition of pending litigation will
not be material.
 
ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
 
 During the fourth quarter of 1993, no matters were submitted to a vote of
the security holders.

- ---------------
Notes:
(a) Operating income in 1992 includes 21.8 million of non-recurring operating
 costs relating to severance and transition costs due to the rail car
 transaction (see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
 Statements).
(b) Non-recurring items include an 84.5 million pre-tax gain on ANTEC Offering
 in 1993 relating to the September 1993 initial public offering of shares of
 common stock of ANTEC (see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated
 Financial Statements).
(c) The non-recurring pre-tax loss of 20.5 million in 1993 principally relates
 to the write-down of miscellaneous investments and certain non-operating
 assets to net realizable value.
(d) In 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Company wrote down the value of its investments
 in marketable equity securities by 25.0 million, 25.0 million and 50.0
 million, respectively. The remaining 29.4 million pre-tax charge in 1991
 relates to the loss on sale of the Company's investment in Santa Fe. The
 31.7 million pre-tax charge in 1990 primarily relates to the recognized
 loss in market value on other marketable equity securities.
(e) Extraordinary items in 1993, 1992 and 1991 represent the gain/(loss) net of
 related income taxes on early extinguishment of senior and subordinated
 debt at Itel and its subsidiaries.
(f) Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding decreased
 substantially from 1989 to 1992 primarily as a result of Itel's large
 treasury stock purchases in 1992, 1991 and 1990. Consequently, the loss per
 share in 1992 and 1991 was adversely impacted. In 1993, weighted average
 common and common equivalent shares increased slightly due primarily to the
 conversion of Series C convertible preferred stock into approximately 3.8
 million shares of Common Stock in August 1993.
(g) Stockholders' equity reflects treasury stock purchases of .3 million,
 114.3 million, 147.4 million, 187.6 million and 6.5 million in 1993,
 1992, 1991, 1990 and 1989, respectively. No dividends on common stock were
 declared or paid during any of the periods shown.
(h) Stockholders' equity includes unrealized losses on marketable equity
 securities available-for-sale, net of deferred income tax benefit of 23.7
 million, 49.1 million, 47.8 million, 112.9 million and 24.9 million at
 December 31, 1993, 1992, 1991, 1990 and 1989, respectively.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
 OF OPERATIONS.
 
FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
Asset Sales and Other Dispositions
 
 Recapitalization Program: In 1990, the Company began a program of modifying
its capital structure by reducing certain senior and subordinated debt at Itel
and its subsidiaries and purchasing Common Stock. Over the last several years,
the Company also implemented a program of selling or otherwise monetizing
certain assets to fund the recapitalization program. Since the program began,
the Company has used proceeds to substantially reduce debt at the holding
company and subsidiary level and to repurchase approximately 450 million of
outstanding Common Stock. The financial liquidity and capital resources in 1993
and 1992 reflect the impact of Itel's recapitalization program.
 
 ANTEC Separation: In July 1993, ANTEC, formerly a business division of
Anixter, was established as a separate and independent corporation through
Anixter's contribution of assets and liabilities of its ANTEC business division
to ANTEC and Anixter's distribution of 100 of the outstanding common stock of
ANTEC to Itel. In September 1993, Itel and ANTEC completed a public offering
(the "Offering") of shares of common stock of ANTEC. Net proceeds from the
Offering were approximately 157 million of which Itel, after considering the
redemption by ANTEC of preferred shares owned by Itel, received approximately
 97 million. Proceeds were used to reduce indebtedness. As a result of the
Offering, Itel's ownership of ANTEC common stock was reduced to 53 .
 
 Liquidation of Signal Capital: Signal Capital has been classified as assets
held for sale since acquisition in connection with the purchase of a major rail
car fleet in 1988. The finance business is being liquidated and no material
amounts of new loans or investments are being made by Signal Capital. Since the
date of acquisition the portfolio has been reduced from 1.44 billion to 175
million at December 31, 1993, including reductions of 82 million, 82 million
and 157 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
 
 Rail Car Transaction: In June 1992, Itel and Rail completed a transaction
with GECC pursuant to which Rail contributed substantially all of its owned rail
cars, subject to approximately 170 million of debt, to a Trust of which Rail is
a 99 beneficiary and the Trust contributed these rail cars, subject to the
debt, along with other rail cars the Trust received as a contribution from its
1 beneficiary, to a partnership (the "Partnership") of which the Trust is a 99 
partner. The Partnership assumed the Rail debt and leased all of these
contributed rail cars, along with other rail cars it received as a contribution
from its other partners, to a subsidiary of GECC (the "Lessee"). The Leases
expire in 2004, with fixed rentals of approximately 153 million annually. The
Leases include the grant to the Lessee of an assignable fixed price purchase
option at the end of the term of the Leases for all, but not less than all, of
the rail cars for approximately 500 million. The Leases are net leases under
which the Lessee is responsible for maintenance and other expenses of the rail
cars and all obligations of the Lessee are unconditionally guaranteed by GECC.
Rail also assigned to GECC, for certain consideration, substantially all of its
contracts to lease rail cars from others.
 
 In June 1992, the Trust issued 998 million of 7 3/4 Notes (the "Trust
Notes") secured by the Trust's ownership interest in the Partnership. The net
proceeds were used to repay certain debt of Rail and Itel. The Trust Notes are
non-recourse to Itel.
 
 Other Dispositions: In 1993 and 1992, the Company sold substantially all
of its other transportation services assets, except for one short-line railroad
which is currently being held for sale. In 1991, the Company sold its
investments in American President Companies, Ltd. ("APC"), its third party
distribution business, Great Lakes International, Inc. ("Great Lakes") and Santa
Fe for aggregate cash proceeds in excess of 500 million. Proceeds from the
sales were used to reduce debt or to purchase Common Stock.
 
Cash Flow
 
 Consolidated net cash provided (used) by continuing operating activities
was 21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1993 compared to 5.5)
million in 1992. Cash provided (used) by continuing operating activities
increased due to higher operating income and lower interest costs caused by debt
reductions somewhat offset by higher investment in net working capital
attributable to Anixter and ANTEC sales volume
 
 11
 12
increases. Consolidated cash provided (used) by net investing activities was
 11.7 million in 1993 versus 18.7) million in 1992. Consolidated investing
activities in 1993 primarily reflect net receipts from Itel's investment in
Q-TEL (formerly Quadrum) of 23.7 million and proceeds from the sale of
miscellaneous marketable securities and other investments somewhat offset by two
ANTEC acquisitions aggregating 9.9 million and capital expenditures required at
Anixter and ANTEC. Consolidated cash used for net financing activities was 141.4) million for the year ended 1993 in comparison to 50.4) million for
the year ended 1992. The 1993 period includes approximately 156.6 million of
proceeds from the Offering and the paydown of a substantial amount of
subordinated debt. Consolidated net financing activities in 1992 reflect the
issuance of 998 million of Trust Notes and subsequent paydown of substantial
amounts of other debt. Cash from discontinued operations, net was 117.4 million
in 1993 versus 68.0 million in 1992. Discontinued operations in 1993 and 1992
include net proceeds from the sale of most of the Company's other transportation
services assets of 46 million and 8 million, respectively, and cash received
from the reduction of assets at Signal Capital of 82 million in both years.
 
 Consolidated net cash provided (used) by continuing operating activities
was 5.5) million for the year ended December 31, 1992 compared to 34.4
million in 1991. This decrease was due primarily to higher investment in net
working capital attributable to Anixter and ANTEC sales volume increases and
severance and transition payments due to the rail car transaction. Consolidated
cash provided (used) by net investing activities was 18.7) million in 1992
versus 209.4 million in 1991. Consolidated cash provided from net investing
activities in 1991 reflects significant proceeds from marketable securities
sales, primarily Santa Fe. Consolidated investing activities in 1992 reflect
significantly lower purchases of rail equipment due to the rail car transaction.
Consolidated cash used for net financing activities was 50.4) million for the
year ended 1992 in comparison to 442.0) million for the year ended 1991.
Consolidated net financing activities in 1992 reflect the issuance of 998
million of Trust Notes and subsequent paydown of substantial amounts of other
debt. Cash used for net financing activities in 1991 reflects the use of
proceeds from significant asset sales to repay debt. The consolidated cash used
for net financing activities in both years reflects large purchases of treasury
stock, principally from Henley. Cash from discontinued operations, net was 68.0
million in 1992 versus 170.7 million in 1991. Discontinued operations in 1992
includes net proceeds from the sale of certain of the Company's other
transportation services assets and cash received from the reduction of assets at
Signal Capital. Discontinued operations in 1991 include net proceeds from the
sales of the Company's investments in Great Lakes, APC and the third party
distribution business aggregating 183 million and cash received from the
reduction of assets at Signal Capital of 157 million.
 
 Based upon discussions with financial analysts and similar disclosures
provided by competitors of Itel's businesses, the Company considers operating
income before amortization of goodwill and operating income plus depreciation
and amortization of goodwill ("cash flow") to be meaningful and readily
comparable measures of Itel's relative performance. However, with the completion
of the rail car transaction in June 1992, the ongoing fixed cash flow of Rail
car leasing is available only to service interest and principal on the debt of
the Trust and the Partnership. Cash flow by the Company's major business
segments is presented in the following table. The decline in 1992 is due to the
rail car transaction.

Consolidated net interest expense was 151.1 million, 181.7 million and
 179.7 million for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively. The Company has entered into interest rate agreements which
effectively fix or cap, for a period of time, the interest rate on a portion of
its floating rate
 
 12
 13
 
obligations. As a result, the interest rate on substantially all debt
obligations at December 31, 1993 is fixed or capped.
 
Financings
 
 On December 13, 1993, the Company obtained a 250 million senior bank term
loan ("Term Loan") from a group of banks. The Term Loan is secured by the
Company's investments in the capital stock of Anixter, ANTEC and Signal Capital
and its common shares of Energy and Real Estate aggregating 730 million at net
book value at December 31, 1993. The Term Loan matures in 1996. The net proceeds
from the Term Loan were used exclusively to repay other debt of Itel.
 
 In August 1993, Itel's Series C convertible preferred stock was converted
into approximately 3.8 million shares of Common Stock.
 
 In July 1993, ANTEC executed an agreement with a group of banks for a new
 100 million revolving credit facility. The revolving line of credit, which
matures in 1997 and is extendible at the banks' option for one additional year,
was reduced to 50 million upon completion of the Offering. Part of the proceeds
from the new ANTEC revolving credit facility were used to repay a portion of a
secured revolving line of credit of Anixter. The ANTEC revolving credit facility
is non-recourse to Itel.
 
 In May 1993, the Anixter secured revolving line of credit was extended to
1996 and was increased to 300 million. The revolving line of credit may be
extended for two additional one-year periods at the option of the lenders. Upon
completion of the new ANTEC revolving credit facility in July, Anixter's secured
revolving line of credit was reduced to 210 million. In November, the Company
increased the revolving line of credit to 220 million.
 
 At December 31, 1993, 88.6 million was available under the bank revolving
lines of credit at Anixter, most of which was available to Itel for general
corporate purposes.
 
Debt Maturities and Repayments
 
 Current maturities of non-recourse debt of 67.8 million at December 31,
1993 represent senior debt related to the Rail car leasing business to be
serviced from Rail car leasing cash flow. In 1993 and 1992, Rail car leasing
retired at maturity approximately 62.2 million and 17.9 million of
non-recourse debt, respectively.
 
 In 1993, the Company retired or called for redemption approximately 558
million of the face value of subordinated debt at Itel (including 180 million
of 13 Senior Subordinated Notes ("13 Notes") called on December 17, 1993 for
January 18, 1994 redemption and 41 million of 13 Notes called on January 27,
1994 for February 28, 1994 redemption). In 1992 and 1991, respectively, the
Company retired 688 million and 79 million of the face value of senior and
subordinated debt at Itel and its subsidiaries.
 
NOL Carryforwards
 
 To the extent of certain taxable income realized by the Company, liquidity
is enhanced by potential tax benefits. As of December 31, 1993, the Company had
cumulative NOL carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes of approximately
 345 million expiring principally in 1995 through 2007, and ITC carryforwards of
approximately 16 million expiring in 1994 through 2001. Certain of these
carryforwards have not been examined by the IRS and, therefore, may be subject
to adjustment. The availability of tax benefits of NOL and ITC carryforwards to
reduce the Company's future Federal income tax liability is subject to various
limitations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
which may limit their use in the event of substantial ownership changes of
Itel's stock as defined in the Code. Such ownership changes may not be within
the control of the Company. In addition, at December 31, 1993, various foreign
subsidiaries of Itel had aggregate cumulative NOL carryforwards for foreign
income tax purposes of approximately 50 million which are subject to various
provisions of each respective country and expire between 1995 and 2003.
 
 13
 14
 
 The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS No. 109"). Among other things,
SFAS No. 109 requires recognition of deferred tax liability on the temporary
differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and
liabilities, measured at enacted tax rates, and the reduction of the liability
for deferred taxes for NOL and ITC carryforwards, to the extent that realization
of such carryforwards are more likely than not. Accordingly, the Company has
reduced its deferred tax liability for its Federal and state NOL and ITC
carryforwards in its consolidated financial statements. The Company's partial
recognition of Federal and state future tax benefits is due to the expected
utilization of those benefits based upon future receipt of substantial taxable
income, specifically resulting from (a) over 546 million of existing temporary
differences at December 31, 1993, primarily rail car depreciation, which will
reverse prior to 2005 and (b) projected consolidated taxable income including
the guaranteed minimum future rentals from the Leases of 153 million annually
through 2004 and the discontinuance of the substantial capital expenditure
program that gave rise to a significant portion of the NOL. Management
anticipates that increases in taxable income during the carryforward period will
arise primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above.
 
 The following table presents the Company's, exclusive of ANTEC, scheduled
reversal of existing temporary differences and the expiration dates and amounts
of the Company's, exclusive of ANTEC, domestic NOL and ITC carryforwards at
December 31, 1993.

At December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, consolidated valuation allowances for
its tax carryforwards are 55.4 million, 58.4 million and 62.1 million,
respectively, including valuation allowances on its foreign NOLs at December 31,
1993, 1992, 1991. The effect of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 enacted
in August 1993 was not significant to the Company's consolidated results of
operations.
 
Liquidity Considerations and Other
 
 Certain debt agreements entered into by Itel's subsidiaries contain various
restrictions including restrictions on payments to Itel. Such restrictions have
not had nor are expected to have an adverse impact on Itel's ability to meet its
cash obligations.
 
 At December 31, 1993, the market value of the Company's investment in
marketable equity securities was below cost by 36.5 million. In accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, the Company's investment in marketable
equity securities has been reflected at market value in the consolidated balance
sheet. The Company continuously evaluates the market value of its marketable
securities held for investment in relation to its historical cost to determine
whether a decline in market value is "other than temporary". When such decline
in market value is deemed to be other than temporary, the Company records such
decline as a charge against income. In 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Company wrote
down the value of its investments in marketable equity securities by 25.0
million, 25.0 million and 50.0 million, respectively.
 
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
 
 Consolidated capital expenditures were 13.4 million, 17.0 million and
 75.1 million for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Anixter capital
expenditures were 11.4 million, 6.3 million and 8.4 million for 1993, 1992
and 1991, respectively. ANTEC capital expenditures were 2.0 million, 1.7
million and 2.0 million for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Rail car leasing
capital expenditures were zero, 9.0 million and 64.7 million for 1993, 1992
and 1991, respectively. Due to the rail car transaction, future rail car leasing
capital
 
 14
 15
expenditures, if any, will be funded from the proceeds of any dispositions of
the rail cars involved in that transaction.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 As a result of the rail car transaction with GECC in June 1992, the
revenues and operating income of Rail car leasing, though essentially fixed, are
lower than such results prior to the rail car transaction. Further, the ongoing
fixed cash flow of Rail car leasing is available only to service interest and
principal on the Trust Notes and the debt of the Partnership.
 
 Earnings Per Share: Weighted average common and common equivalent shares
outstanding decreased substantially from 1989 to 1992 primarily as a result of
Itel's large treasury stock purchases in 1992, 1991 and 1990. Consequently, the
loss per share in 1992 and 1991 was adversely impacted. In 1993, weighted
average common and common equivalent shares increased slightly due primarily to
the conversion of Series C convertible preferred stock into approximately 3.8
million shares of Common Stock in August 1993.
 
 Quarter ended December 31, 1993: Loss from continuing operations for the
fourth quarter of 1993 was 17.5) million compared with 29.2) million in the
fourth quarter of 1992. The fourth quarter of 1993 and 1992 each include pre-tax
charges associated with the write-down of marketable equity securities of 25.0
million. Net loss was 22.6) million and 53.6) million in the fourth quarter
of 1993 and 1992, respectively. The Company retired or called for redemption
approximately 206.0 million and 65.3 million of its subordinated and senior
debt resulting in an extraordinary net loss of 5.1) million and 2.4) million
in the fourth quarters of 1993 and 1992, respectively. The loss from
discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 1992 includes a 16.1) million
net loss from the discontinuance of the other transportation services segment.
 
 Consolidated revenues during the period, which includes revenues of Rail
car leasing, increased 24 to 508.5 million, primarily reflecting increased
volume at Anixter and ANTEC. Anixter revenues increased 21 to 359.7 million
from 296.7 million reflecting increased volume in its U.S. wiring systems
business and significantly higher volume in its European operations. ANTEC
revenues increased 48 to 110.6 million in the fourth quarter of 1993 compared
to 74.7 million in 1992 due to the upswing in spending by cable system
operators and the acceptance of products developed by ANTEC.
 
 Consolidated operating income, including Rail car leasing, increased 27 to
 39.4 million from 31.1 million in the fourth quarter of 1992 and consolidated
operating income before amortization of goodwill increased 23 to 45.0 million
from 36.5 million in the fourth quarter of 1992. Anixter's operating income
before amortization of goodwill increased 78 to 16.4 million from 9.2 million
in the fourth quarter of 1992 due to stronger European and U.S. Distribution
earnings. The 1992 period also contained special charges related to a terminated
equity participation plan. ANTEC's operating income before amortization of
goodwill more than doubled to 7.1 million from 3.3 million in 1992 reflecting
significantly increased volume.
 
 Consolidated net interest expense and other for the fourth quarter declined
to 36.5 million from 48.8 million in 1992 due to the use of proceeds from the
continued monetization of Itel's non-core assets to significantly reduce
high-cost debt.
 
 Year ended December 31, 1993: Income (loss) from continuing operations was
 16.1 million in 1993 compared with 59.8) million in 1992. Results of
continuing operations in 1993 include an 84.5 million pre-tax gain on the
Offering and a 20.5) million non-recurring pre-tax loss principally relating
to the write-down of miscellaneous investments and certain non-operating assets
to net realizable value. Operating income in 1992 includes a 21.8 million
non-recurring operating charge related to the rail car transaction. Results of
continuing operations in both 1993 and 1992 include pre-tax charges associated
with the write-down of marketable equity securities of 25.0 million. Net loss
was 1.2) million and 104.3) million for the years ended December 31, 1993
and 1992, respectively. The loss from discontinued operations in 1992 includes a 16.1) million net loss on the discontinuance of the other transportation
services segment. The Company retired or called for redemption a significant
amount of its subordinated and senior debt resulting in an extraordinary net
loss of 16.0) million and 20.4) million in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

 Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 1993, which includes
Rail car leasing, increased 14 to approximately 1.9 billion from 1.7 billion
in 1992 primarily reflecting increased volume at Anixter and ANTEC. Anixter
revenues rose 14 to 1.3 billion resulting from the continued growth of the
U.S. wiring systems business and the continuing worldwide expansion. ANTEC
revenues increased 42 to 427.6 million in 1993 compared to 1992 due to the
upswing in spending by cable system operators and the acceptance of products
developed by ANTEC. More than 95 of ANTEC's consolidated sales for the year
ended December 31, 1993 came from sales to the cable industry. Demand for these
products depends primarily on capital spending by cable operators for
constructing, rebuilding, maintaining or upgrading their systems. In February
1994, the FCC announced its intention to impose a 7 rate reduction for basic
cable services and ANTEC's largest customers announced it may reduce its capital
expenditure budget for 1994. However, the Company believes that while capital
expenditures for some products by some operators may be adversely affected,
capital spending for infrastructure improvements and upgrades will continue and,
therefore, the Company does not anticipate a material adverse impact on its
performance as a result of these recent announcements. Rail car leasing revenue
in 1993 decreased to 153.0 million from 217.5 million due to the effect of the
rail car transaction in June 1992.
 
 Consolidated operating income, including Rail car leasing, was 157.9
million compared with 148.7 million (before the 21.8 million non-recurring
operating charge) in 1992. Consolidated operating income before amortization of
goodwill and the non-recurring operating charge increased to 179.4 million from
 166.3 million in 1992. Anixter operating income before amortization of goodwill
for 1993 increased 36 to 61.1 million due to improved margins and volume at
U.S. distribution offset slightly by increased spending in international
markets. Net start-up losses from recently established foreign operations were 4.4) million in 1993 compared to 2.5) million in 1992. The 1992 period also
contained special charges related to a terminated equity participation plan.
ANTEC's operating income before amortization of goodwill increased 70 to 25.2
million in 1993 from 14.8 million in 1992 reflecting significantly increased
volume. Rail car leasing operating income before amortization of goodwill
increased to 102.4 million from 93.5 million in 1992. Rail car leasing results
in 1992 include a 21.8 million non-recurring operating charge relating to the
rail car transaction.
 
 Consolidated net interest expense and other for 1993 declined to 151.1
million from 181.7 million in 1992 due to the use of proceeds from the 1992
rail car transaction and the continued monetization of Itel's non-core assets to
significantly reduce high-cost debt.
 
 Year ended December 31, 1992: Loss from continuing operations was 59.8)
million in 1992 compared with 57.7) million in 1991. Operating income in 1992
includes a 21.8 million non-recurring operating charge related to the rail car
transaction. Results of continuing operations in 1992 and 1991 include pre-tax
charges associated with the sale and write-down of marketable equity securities
of 25.0 million and 79.4 million, respectively. Net loss was 104.3) million
and 55.7) million for the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991,
respectively. The loss from discontinued operations in 1992 includes a 16.1)
million net loss on the disposition of certain other transportation services
assets. The loss from discontinued operations in 1991 includes a 14.6) million
net loss on the sale of APC and Great Lakes. The Company retired a significant
amount of its subordinated and senior debt resulting in an extraordinary net
gain (loss) of 20.4) million and 8.8 million in 1992 and 1991, respectively.
 
 Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 1992, which includes
revenues of Rail car leasing, increased 6 to approximately 1.7 billion from
 1.6 billion in 1991 primarily reflecting increased volume at Anixter and ANTEC.
Anixter revenues increased 13 to 1.2 billion reflecting strong U.S. data
markets and significantly higher European volume. ANTEC revenues increased 17 
to 301.0 million due to stronger fiber optics sales. Rail car leasing revenues
decreased to 217.5 million from 307.0 million primarily due to the effect of
the June 1992 rail car transaction.
 
 Consolidated operating income before the 21.8 million non-recurring
operating charge was 148.7 million compared with 165.3 million in 1991.
Consolidated operating income before the non-recurring operating charge and
amortization of goodwill decreased to 166.3 million from 177.8 million in
1991. Anixter operating income before amortization of goodwill for 1992
increased 7 to 44.8 million due to lower European losses and stronger U.K.
results partially offset by lower Canadian earnings. Net start-up losses from
 
 16
 17
recently established foreign operations decreased to 2.5) million in 1992 from 9.6) million in 1991. ANTEC's operating income before amortization of goodwill
increased 48 to 14.8 million in 1992 from 10.0 million in 1991 reflecting
significantly increased volume. Rail car leasing operating income before
amortization of goodwill decreased to 93.5 million in 1992 from 136.4 million
in 1991 reflecting the rail car transaction.
 
 Consolidated net interest expense and other for 1992 was 181.7 million
compared to 179.7 million in 1991. Results in 1992 reflect the effects of debt
reduction and lower interest costs following the 1991 sales of the Company's
investments in APC, Santa Fe and Great Lakes, and the 1992 rail car transaction
offset by the effect of the Company's treasury stock purchases and lower
investment income. Net interest expense includes the carrying costs on the
remaining marketable equity securities of approximately 25 million for the year
ended December 31, 1992.
 
 Year ended December 31, 1991: Loss from continuing operations was 57.7)
million compared with 32.4) million in 1990. Results in both years include
pre-tax charges associated with the sale and write-down of marketable equity
securities of 79.4 million and 31.7 million in 1991 and 1990, respectively.
Net income (loss) was 55.7) million and 128.7 million for the years ended
December 31, 1991 and 1990, respectively. The loss from discontinued operations
in 1991 includes a 14.6) million net loss on the sales of APC and Great Lakes.
Income from discontinued operations in 1990 primarily reflects a 154.9 million
net gain on the sale of the Company's container leasing assets. In 1991, the
Company retired approximately 78.9 million of the face value of its
subordinated debt resulting in an extraordinary net gain of 8.8 million.
 
 Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 1991 decreased
slightly to approximately 1.6 billion. Anixter revenues, which included the
start-up operations in Europe, increased 5 over 1990. ANTEC revenues declined
21 from 1990 due to significantly lower cable industry spending. Rail car
leasing revenue was 307.0 million, slightly lower than 1990 primarily due to
continued softness in the grain car leasing market.
 
 Consolidated operating income was 165.3 million compared with 168.2
million in 1990. Consolidated operating income before amortization of goodwill
was 177.8 million compared with 180.8 million in 1990. Anixter operating
income before amortization of goodwill for 1991 increased 14 to 42.0 million.
Net start-up losses from recently established foreign operations were 9.6)
million and 10.1) million in 1991 and 1990, respectively. ANTEC's operating
income before amortization of goodwill decreased to 10.0 million in 1991 from
 22.0 million in 1990 due to the poor cable television market. Rail car leasing
operating income before amortization of goodwill was 136.4 million, up slightly
from 1990 due to lower maintenance costs, partially offset by lower rental
revenues.
 
 Net interest expense and other for the year was 179.7 million compared to
 174.7 million in 1990 as the effect of the Company's treasury stock purchases
was partially offset by the effects of debt reduction following the 1991 sales
of the Company's investments in APC, Santa Fe and Great Lakes and excess
proceeds from the sale of the Company's container leasing assets at the end of
1990. Net interest expense includes the carrying costs on marketable equity
securities of approximately 60 million and 70 million for the years ended
December 31, 1991 and 1990, respectively.
 
 Impact of Inflation: Inflation has slowed in recent years and is currently
not an important determinant of Anixter and ANTEC's results of operations due,
in part, to rapid inventory turnover. Due to the rail car transaction, inflation
is currently not a determinant of the Company's rail car leasing business
results of operations.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Itel Corporation
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Itel
Corporation as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial
statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedules based on our audits.
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Itel
Corporation at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered
in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly
in all material respects the information set forth therein.
 
 Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The accompanying
supplemental balance sheets at December 31, 1993 (page 22) and supplemental
statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 (page
24) and supplemental statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31,
1993 (page 26) are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a
required part of the consolidated financial statements. Such information has
been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audits of the
consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all
material respects in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole.

 ITEL CORPORATION
 
 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
 Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Itel Corporation ("Itel") and its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively
"the Company") after elimination of intercompany transactions. Minority
interests of 98.2 million at December 31, 1993 primarily relate to the 47 
public ownership in ANTEC (see Note 4) and the 1 external ownership interests
in the Trust and Partnership, respectively (see Note 7).
 
 Reclassifications: The 1992 and 1991 consolidated financial statements and
related notes have been reclassified to reflect the 1993 presentation. The
Company adopted the Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" and No. 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" at December 31, 1993. The
effect on the consolidated financial statements was immaterial.
 
 Cash and equivalents and restricted cash: The Company considers all highly
liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and equivalents approximates fair value
because of the short maturity of those instruments. Restricted cash consists
primarily of cash to be used for interest and principal on the debt related to
Rail car leasing (see Note 9).
 
 Inventories: Inventories are valued principally at the lower of average,
approximating first-in, first-out, cost or market.
 
 Depreciation: The Company provides for depreciation of property principally
on the straight-line basis over various useful lives including the term of the
Leases (see Note 7) for rental equipment--rail cars, 25 to 40 years for
buildings and improvements, 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment and the
term of the lease for leasehold improvements.
 
 Goodwill: Goodwill relates to the excess of cost over net tangible assets
of businesses acquired. The Company at each balance sheet date evaluates, for
recognition of potential impairment, its recorded goodwill against the current
and undiscounted expected future operating income before goodwill amortization
expense of the entities to which goodwill relates. In the opinion of management,
goodwill at Anixter Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively "Anixter") and ANTEC
Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively "ANTEC") has not diminished in
value since their date of acquisition, and, having an indefinite life, is not
subject to amortization. However, in accordance with Opinion 17 of the
Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, goodwill is being amortized over a period of 40 years using the
straight-line method. The remaining goodwill relates to the purchase of Pullman
Leasing Company in 1988 and is being amortized over the term of the Leases (see
Note 7).
 
 Marketable equity securities available-for-sale: Marketable equity
securities available-for-sale are reflected in the balance sheet at the quoted
market price as of the balance sheet date. The difference between cost and
market is reflected in stockholders' equity net of deferred tax benefit.
Realized gains on dispositions of securities are determined using the average
cost method. Realized pre-tax gains, before related interest carrying costs,
were .3 million, zero and 5.5 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
Aggregate unrealized pre-tax loss on marketable equity securities
available-for-sale amounted to 36.6 million at December 31, 1993 (see Note 5).
 
 Investment in and advances to Q-TEL S.A. de C.V. of Mexico ("Q-TEL"):
Investment in and advances to Q-TEL, formerly Quadrum, include a 19 equity
interest in Q-TEL and at December 31, 1993 a 6.6 million loan.
 
 Interest rate agreements: The Company has entered into interest rate
agreements which effectively fix or cap, for a period of time, the interest rate
on a portion of its floating rate obligations. As a result, the interest rate on
substantially all debt obligations at December 31, 1993 is fixed or capped. The
net effects of such
 
 28
 29
 
 ITEL CORPORATION
 
 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
 
agreements are included in interest expense.
 
 Revenue recognition: Sales and related cost of sales are recognized
primarily upon shipment of products.
 
 Advertising and sales promotion: Advertising and sales promotion costs are
expensed as incurred.
 
 Income taxes: Provisions for income taxes include deferred taxes resulting
from temporary differences in determining income for financial and tax purposes
using the liability method. Such temporary differences result primarily from
differences in the carrying value of assets and liabilities.
 
 Income (loss) per common share: Income (loss) per share amounts are based
upon results from operations after deducting preferred dividends earned and the
amortization of preferred stock discounts. Weighted average common and common
equivalent shares were 30,132,000, 29,085,000 and 34,440,000 for 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively.
 
NOTE 2. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION
 
 Continuing operations of the Company paid interest, including interest
allocated to discontinued operations, of approximately 187.9 million, 232.5
million and 248.6 million for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively. Approximately 7.0 million, 1.5 million and 3.3 million was paid
principally for foreign and certain state income taxes for the years ended
December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
 
 In a non-cash transaction Itel's Series C convertible preferred stock
("Preferred Stock") was converted into approximately 3.8 million shares of
common stock in August 1993.
 
NOTE 3. DISCONTINUED AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
 
 The finance business of Signal Capital Corporation ("Signal Capital") has
been included as assets held for sale since acquisition in connection with the
purchase of a major railcar fleet in 1988. The finance business is being
liquidated and no material amounts of new loans or investments are being made by
Signal Capital. Since the date of acquisition the portfolio has been reduced
from 1.44 billion to 175 million at December 31, 1993, including reductions of
 82 million, 82 million and 157 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991 respectively.
Proceeds were used to repay indebtedness.
 
 In 1993 and 1992, the Company sold substantially all of its other
transportation services assets, except for one short-line railroad which is
currently being held for sale, for aggregate net cash proceeds of 54 million.
The Company recorded a 26 million pre-tax loss in 1992 in discontinued
operations to reflect the disposal of this segment.
 
 In 1991, the Company sold its investments in various other businesses for
aggregate cash proceeds in excess of 250 million. These 1991 sales resulted in
pre-tax losses totaling 65 million which was reflected in discontinued
operations.

 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
 
 The results of operations of the other transportation services segment,
other previously sold businesses and Signal Capital have been included in

corporate interest expense amounted to 19.0 million, 38.1 million and 53.6
million for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

NOTE 4. GAIN ON ANTEC OFFERING AND NON-RECURRING ITEMS
 
 The pre-tax gain on ANTEC Offering relates to the September 1993 initial
public offering of shares of common stock of ANTEC (the "Offering"). Itel
provided deferred taxes relating to the recognized pre-tax book gain. Itel and
ANTEC sold approximately 4.0 million and 5.4 million shares of ANTEC common
stock, respectively, at 18 per share. Net proceeds from the Offering were
approximately 157 million of which Itel, after considering the redemption by
ANTEC of preferred shares owned by Itel, received approximately 97 million. As
a result of the Offering, Itel's ownership of ANTEC common stock was reduced to
53 .
 
 The non-recurring pre-tax loss in 1993 principally relates to the
write-down of miscellaneous investments and certain non-operating assets to net
realizable value.

NOTE 5. MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE
 
 In 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Company wrote down the value of its investments
in marketable equity securities by 25.0 million, 25.0 million and 50.0
million, respectively. Also in 1991, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of
 29.4 million on the sale of its investment in Santa Fe Pacific Corporation
("Santa Fe"). The Company has reduced the pre-tax unrealized losses on
marketable equity securities available-for-sale included in stockholders' equity
by 12.9 million at December 31, 1993 to reflect a deferred tax benefit due to
the Company's current ability to either (a) carryback all December 31, 1993
unrealized capital losses to previously generated capital gains or (b) generate
capital gains by the future sale of capital assets to offset December 31, 1993
unrealized capital losses.
 
NOTE 6. EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS
 
 In 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Company retired or called for redemption senior
and subordinated debt resulting in a pre-tax extraordinary gain (loss) of 26.2) million, 32.9) million and 13.3 million, respectively.
 
NOTE 7. RAIL CAR TRANSACTION
 
 In 1992, a 98 owned affiliate of Itel leased all of the rail cars owned by
the Company to an affiliate of General Electric Capital Corporation ("GECC") for
twelve years with fixed annual rentals of approximately 153 million. The leases
(the "Leases") include an option for GECC to purchase all, but not less than
all, of the rail cars for approximately 500 million at the end of the term of
the Leases. GECC is responsible for the maintenance and other expenses of the
rail cars and has unconditionally guaranteed all obligations of its affiliate.
Operating income in 1992 includes 21.8 million of non-recurring operating
expense relating to severance and transition costs due to the rail car
transaction.

 ITEL CORPORATION
 
 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
 
 Term Loan: On December 13, 1993, the Company obtained a 250 million Term
Loan from a group of banks. The Term Loan is secured by the Company's
investments in the capital stock of Anixter, ANTEC and Signal Capital and its
common shares of Santa Fe Energy Resources, Inc. ("Energy") and Catellus
Development Corporation ("Real Estate") aggregating 730 million at net book
value at December 31, 1993. The Term Loan matures in 1996. Various interest rate
options are available. The interest rate at December 31, 1993 was 4 3/4 . The
net proceeds from the Term Loan were used exclusively to repay other debt of
Itel.
 
 Anixter--
 
 Bank revolving lines of credit: Anixter has various secured revolving bank
lines of credit worldwide which provide for up to 281 million of borrowings
contingent on the level of certain assets. At December 31, 1993, 184.7 million
was borrowed and 88.6 million was available under the bank revolving lines of
credit at Anixter, most of which was available for general corporate purposes.
These lines of credit reduce or mature at various dates from 1994 through 1996.
The 220.0 million domestic revolving line of credit, which matures in 1996, may
be extended for two additional one-year periods at the option of the lender.
Various interest rate options are available under these facilities and the
average interest rate at December 31, 1993 was 6.0 . Commitment fees of 1/2 are
payable on the unused portion of these revolving lines of credit. The 1993
commitment fees paid were insignificant.
 
 ANTEC--
 
 Bank revolving line of credit: ANTEC has a revolving line of credit which
provides for up to 50.0 million in borrowings. The line of credit is
non-recourse to Itel, matures in 1997 and is extendible at the banks' option for
one additional year. Various interest rate options are available. The interest
rate at December 31, 1993 was 4.5 . Commitment fees of 1/2 are payable on the
unused portion of the revolving line of credit. The 1993 commitment fees paid
were insignificant.
 
 Rail car leasing--
 
 In connection with the completion of the rail car transaction (see Note 7),
a trust (the "Trust") issued 998 million of 7 3/4 Notes (the "Trust Notes").
The Trust Notes are non-recourse to Itel, mature through 2004 and are secured by
the Trust's ownership interest in a partnership, which holds substantially all
of the rail cars formerly operated by Itel Rail Corporation and its subsidiaries
(collectively "Rail"). The net proceeds from the Trust Notes were used to repay
certain senior indebtedness of Rail and other debt of Itel. Equipment Trust
Certificates ("ETCs") and other secured indebtedness of the Partnership are
non-recourse to Itel, have interest rates ranging from 9.5 to 11.1 and mature
through 2003. The ETCs have annual sinking fund requirements. With the
completion of the rail car transaction in June 1992, the ongoing fixed cash flow
of the Company's Rail car leasing business is available only to service interest
and principal on the debt of the Rail car leasing business.
 
 Other--
 
 Certain debt agreements entered into by Itel's subsidiaries contain various
restrictions including restrictions on payments to Itel. These debt agreements
are secured by certain assets of the subsidiaries aggregating approximately 1.6
billion at December 31, 1993. Itel has guaranteed certain debt and other
obligations of Anixter. Restricted net assets of subsidiaries were approximately
 600 million at December 31, 1993.
 
 Certain of Itel's loan agreements or indentures require that Itel maintain
a minimum net worth and interest coverage, use the proceeds of certain asset
sales to repay debt, and limit Itel's ability to make capital investments, incur
debt, declare dividends or make distributions to holders of any shares of
capital stock, or

redeem or otherwise acquire such shares of the Company. Approximately 30
million is available for such distributions under the most restrictive of these
covenants.
 
 At December 31, 1993, the Company had four outstanding interest swap
agreements having a total notional principal amount of 193.0 million and an
average fixed rate of approximately 8.4 . The swap agreements expire in 1994.
The Company also had five future interest swap agreements having a total
notional principal amount of 150.0 million and an average fixed rate of 6.8 .
These swap agreements begin in the latter half of 1994 and expire in 1995 and
1996.
 
 Aggregate annual maturities of debt, after consideration of early 1994
retirements of the 13 Notes, are as follows:

NOTE 10. INCOME TAXES
 
 Itel and its U.S. subsidiaries (other than ANTEC for periods after
September 1993) file their Federal income tax return on a consolidated basis. As
of December 31, 1993, the Company had cumulative net operating loss ("NOL")
carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes of approximately 345 million
expiring principally in 1995 through 2007, and investment tax credit ("ITC")
carryforwards of approximately 16 million expiring in 1994 through 2001.
Certain of these carryforwards have not been examined by the Internal Revenue
Service and, therefore, may be subject to adjustment. The availability of NOL
and ITC carryforwards to reduce the Company's future Federal income tax
liability is subject to various limitations under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), which may limit their use in the event of
substantial ownership changes of Itel's stock as defined in the Code. Such
ownership changes may not be within the control of the Company. In addition, at
December 31, 1993, various foreign subsidiaries of Itel had aggregate cumulative
NOL carryforwards for foreign income tax purposes of approximately 50 million
which are subject to various provisions of each respective country and expire
primarily between 1995 and 2003.

 ITEL CORPORATION
 
 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
 
 In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company
has reduced its deferred tax liability to reflect its Federal and state NOL and
ITC carryforwards. The Company's partial recognition of Federal and state future
tax benefits is based on the expected utilization of those benefits based upon
future receipt of substantial taxable income, specifically resulting from (a)
over 546 million of existing temporary differences at December 31, 1993,
primarily rail car depreciation, which will reverse prior to 2005 and (b)
projected consolidated taxable income including the receipt of guaranteed
minimum future rentals from the Leases of 153 million annually through 2004 and
the discontinuance of the substantial capital expenditure programs that gave
rise to a significant portion of the NOL. Management anticipates that increases
in taxable income during the carryforward period will arise primarily as a
result of the factors mentioned above.
 
 Domestic income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes was
 58.6 million, 68.5) million and 79.9) million for the years ended December
31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Foreign loss from continuing operations
before income taxes was 12.8) million, 11.3) million and 13.9) million for
the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
 
 Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such
amounts as measured by tax laws. Deferred income taxes also result from
differences between the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations
accounted for as purchases and their tax bases.
 
 Significant components of the Company's deferred tax liabilities and assets
were as follows:

NOTE 11. CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION
 
 In the ordinary course of business, Itel and its subsidiaries become
involved as plaintiffs or defendants in various legal proceedings. The claims
and counterclaims in such litigation, including those for punitive damages,
individually in certain cases and in the aggregate, involve amounts which may be
material. However, it is the opinion of the Company's management, based upon the
advice of its counsel, that the ultimate disposition of pending litigation will
not be material.
 
NOTE 12. PENSION PLANS, POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND OTHER BENEFITS
 
 The Company's various pension plans are non-contributory and cover
substantially all full-time domestic employees. Retirement benefits are provided
based on compensation as defined in the plans. The Company's policy is to fund
these plans as required by ERISA and the Code.
 
 Assets of the Company's plans at fair value were 44.0 million and 40.1
million at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Projected benefit
obligations of the Company's plans were 57.2 million and 48.3 million at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligations of
the Company's plans were 44.5 million and 33.5 million at December 31, 1993
and 1992, respectively. The weighted-average assumed discount rate used to
measure the projected benefit obligation was 6.8 and 7.3 at December 31, 1993
and 1992, respectively. Pension expense, including the cost of 401(k) plans, for
1993, 1992 and 1991 was insignificant. The Company's liability for
post-retirement benefits other than pensions is insignificant.
 
NOTE 13. PREFERRED STOCK AND COMMON STOCK
 
 Itel has authorized 15 million shares of Preferred Stock, par value 1.00
per share. In August 1993, the Preferred Stock was converted into approximately
3.8 million shares of Common Stock. At December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991,
33,010,000, 28,080,000 and 32,140,000 shares of Common Stock, respectively, were
issued and outstanding. In connection with all Itel employee stock plans
described below, 2,998,485 shares were reserved for issuance at December 31,
1993.
 
 Stock options and stock grants--
 
 Itel has Employee Stock Incentive Plans ("ESIP") authorizing an aggregate
of 5.7 million stock options or restricted grants. In addition, Itel has a
Director Stock Option Plan ("DSOP") authorizing an aggregate of .2 million stock
options. Substantially all options and grants under these plans have been at
fair market value or higher. The exercise price of certain options increase at a
specified fixed rate. One-third of the options granted become exercisable each
year after the year of grant (except in the case of director options which vest
fully in six months) and the options expire seven to ten years after the date of
grant.
 
 37
 38
 
 ITEL CORPORATION
 
 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
 
 Additionally, Itel has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") covering
most employees, excluding ANTEC after September 1993. Participants can request
that up to 10 of their base compensation be applied toward the purchase of
Common Stock under Itel's ESPP. The exercise price is the lower of 85 of the
fair market value of the Common Stock at the date of grant or at the later
exercise date (currently one year).
 
 Under the ESIP, DSOP and ESPP, total options currently exercisable at
December 31, 1993 and 1992 were 763,336 and 1,374,030, respectively.
 
 The following table summarizes the 1993 activity under the ESIP, DSOP and
ESPP.

Total stock options exercised for the years ended December 31, 1992 and
1991 were 1,438,316 and 353,103, respectively. The purchase price per share for
all stock options exercised ranged from 4.44 to 21.88 in 1992 and 3.38 to
 16.50 in 1991.
 
 Stock option plans of subsidiaries--
 
 In 1993, Anixter adopted the Anixter Employee Stock Incentive Plan and
options to purchase approximately 2.1 million shares of Anixter common stock
were granted with an exercise price of 9.00 per share to key employees of
Anixter. Substantially, all options and grants under these plans have been at
fair market value. These options vest immediately to three years and terminate
one to seven years from the date of grant. At December 31, 1993, Itel owned all
of the 29.0 million shares of outstanding Anixter common stock.
 
 In 1993, ANTEC adopted the ANTEC Employee Stock Incentive Plan and options
to purchase approximately 1.5 million shares of ANTEC common stock were granted
with exercise prices of 10.00 to 18.00 per share to key employees of ANTEC.
All options and grants under these plans have been at fair market value or
higher. These options vest over four years beginning in January 1995 and

 Schedule V -- Property and equipment............................................... 53
 Schedule VI -- Accumulated depreciation............................................. 54

All other schedules are omitted because they are not required or are not

financial statements or notes thereto.

+ Copies of other instruments defining the rights of holders of long-term debt
 of Itel Corporation and its subsidiaries not filed pursuant to Item
 601(b)(4)(iii) of Regulation S-K and omitted copies of attachments to plans
 and material contracts will be furnished to the Securities and Exchange
 Commission upon request.
 
 For the purposes of complying with the amendments to the rules governing
Form S-8 (effective July 13, 1990) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
the Registrant hereby undertakes as follows, which undertaking shall be
incorporated by reference into the Registrant's Registration Statement on Form
S-8 Nos. 2-93173 (filed September 30, 1987), 33-13486 (filed April 15, 1987),
33-21656 (filed May 3, 1988) and 33-60676 (filed April 5, 1993):
 
 Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
 of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of
 the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provision, or otherwise, the
 Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and
 Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
 expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, and is, therefore, unenforceable.
 In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities
 (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a
 director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful
 defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director,
 officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
 registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the
 matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of
 appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is
 against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the
 final adjudication of such issue.

capacity as agent for the Lenders hereunder (in such capacity, the "Agent").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested and the Agent, The Bank of
New York as Issuing Bank (the "Original Issuing Bank") and the Lenders have

Agent have agreed to enter into this Agreement in order to (i) amend and
restate the Original Credit Agreement in its entirety, (ii) re-evidence the
Obligations which shall be repayable in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and (iii) set forth the terms and conditions under which the Lenders

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the terms and conditions
contained herein, and of any loans or extensions of credit heretofore, now or
hereafter made to or for the benefit of the Borrower by the Lenders, the
Issuing Banks and the Agent, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

-1-
 9
 ARTICLE I
 DEFINITIONS

1.01. Certain Defined Terms.

 The following terms used in this Agreement shall have the
following meanings (such meanings to be applicable, except to the extent
otherwise indicated in a definition of a particular term, both to the singular
and the plural forms of the terms defined):

 "Accommodation Obligation," as applied to any Person, shall mean
any contractual obligation, contingent or otherwise, of that Person with
respect to any Indebtedness or other obligation or liability of another,
including, without limitation, any such Indebtedness, obligation or liability
directly or indirectly guaranteed, supported by letter of credit, endorsed
(otherwise than for collection or deposit in the ordinary course of business),
co-made or discounted or sold with recourse by that Person, or in respect of
which that Person is otherwise directly or indirectly liable, including
Contractual Obligations (contingent or otherwise) arising through any agreement
to purchase, repurchase, or otherwise acquire such Indebtedness, obligation or
liability or any security therefor, or to provide funds for the payment or
discharge thereof (whether in the form of loans, advances, stock purchases,
capital contributions or otherwise), or to maintain solvency, assets, level of
income, or other financial condition, or to make payment other than for value
received. For purposes of interpreting any provision of this Agreement which
refers to the Dollar amount of Accommodation Obligations of any Person, such
provision shall be deemed to mean the maximum amount of such Accommodation
Obligations or, in the case of an Accommodation Obligation to maintain
solvency, assets, level of income or other financial condition, the amount of
Indebtedness to which such Accommodation Obligation relates, or if less, the
stated maximum, if any, in the documents evidencing such Accommodation
Obligation.

 "Affected Lender" shall have the meaning ascribed to that term
in Section 2.13.

 "Affiliate," as applied to any Person, shall mean any other
Person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with, that Person. For purposes of this definition, "control"
(including, with correlative meanings, the terms "controlling," "controlled by"
and "under common control with"), as applied to any Person, means the
possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to vote 20 or more of the
Securities having voting power for the election of directors of such Person or
otherwise to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of
that Person, whether through the ownership of voting Securities or by contract
or otherwise.

 "Agent" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the
preamble hereto and shall include any successor Agent appointed pursuant to
Section 11.07.

 "Agreement" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the
preamble hereto.

 "Agreement Accounting Principles" shall mean GAAP as of the date
of this Agreement together with any changes in GAAP after the date hereof which
are not "Material

-2-
 10
Accounting Changes" (as defined below). If any changes in GAAP are hereafter
required or permitted and are adopted by the Borrower with the agreement of its
independent certified public accountants and such changes result in a material
change in the method of calculation of any of the financial covenants,
restrictions or standards herein or in the related definitions or terms used
therein ("Material Accounting Changes"), the parties hereto agree to enter into
negotiations, in good faith, in order to amend such provisions in a credit
neutral manner so as to reflect equitably such changes with the desired result
that the criteria for evaluating the Borrower's financial condition shall be
the same after such changes as if such changes had not been made; provided,
however, that no Material Accounting Change shall be given effect in such
calculations until such provisions are amended, in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to the Requisite Lenders. In the event such amendment is entered
into, all references in this Agreement to Agreement Accounting Principles shall
mean GAAP as of the date of such amendment together with any changes in GAAP
after the date of such amendment which are not Material Accounting Changes.

 "Agreement Obligations" shall mean all Obligations other than
with respect to Eligible Hedging Contracts.

 "AHI" shall have the meaning ascribed to that term in the
definition of Foreign Subsidiaries below.

 "AII" shall have the meaning ascribed to that term in the
definition of Foreign Subsidiaries below.

 "Alternate Base Rate" shall mean, for any day, a fluctuating
interest rate per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1 as shall be in effect from time to time, which rate per annum shall at all
times be equal to the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day; (b)
the sum of one-half of one percent (0.50 and the Federal Funds Effective Rate
in effect on such day; and (c) the sum of one percent (1.0 and the
Three-Month Secondary CD Rate in effect on such day. For purposes hereof,
"Prime Rate" shall mean the rate of interest per annum publicly announced from
time to time by Chemical Bank as its prime rate in effect at its principal
office in New York City; each change in the Prime Rate shall be effective on
the date such change is publicly announced as being effective. "Three-Month
Secondary CD Rate" shall mean, for any day, the secondary market rate for
three-month certificates of deposit reported as being in effect on such day
(or, if such day shall not be a Business Day, the next preceding Business Day)
by the Federal Reserve Board through the public information telephone line of
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (which rate will, under the current
practices of the Federal Reserve Board, be published in Federal Reserve
Statistical Release H.15(519) during the week following such day), or, if such
rate shall not be so reported on such day or such next preceding Business Day,
the average of the secondary market quotations for three-month certificates of
deposit of major money center banks in New York City received at approximately
10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such day (or, if such day shall not be a
Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day) by Chemical Bank from three
New York City negotiable certificate of deposit dealers of recognized standing
selected by the Agent. "Federal Funds Effective Rate" shall mean, for any day,
a fluctuating interest rate per annum equal to the weighted average of the
rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal
Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers, as published

-3-
 11
on the next succeeding Business Day by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
or, if such rate is not so published for any day which is a Business Day, the
average of the quotations for such day on such transactions received by
Chemical Bank from three Federal funds brokers of recognized standing selected
by the Agent. If for any reason the Agent shall have determined (which
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that it is unable to
ascertain the Three-Month Secondary CD Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate
or both for any reason, including the inability or failure of the Agent to
obtain sufficient quotations in accordance with the terms hereof, the Alternate
Base Rate shall be determined without regard to clause (b) or (c), or both, of
the first sentence of this definition, as appropriate, until the circumstances
giving rise to such inability no longer exist. Any change in the Alternate
Base Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate, the Three-Month Secondary CD Rate
or the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall be effective on the effective date of
such change.

 "Anixter Venezuela" shall have the meaning ascribed to that term
in the definition of Foreign Subsidiaries below.

 "ANTEC Restructuring" shall have the meaning ascribed to that
term in Section 4.01(e).

 "Applicable Base Rate Margin" as at any date of determination,
shall be the rate per annum then applicable to Base Rate Loans determined in

Agent in Dollars and in immediately available funds, not later than 12:00 noon
(New York City time) on the Funding Date. After the Agent's receipt of the
proceeds of such Loans, the Agent shall (unless it has not received the Notice
of Borrowing in satisfaction of the requirements of Section 4.02(a) or has been
informed that any of the other conditions precedent have not been satisfied)
make the proceeds of such Loans available to Borrower on such Funding Date and
shall disburse such funds in Dollars and in immediately available funds to an
account of Borrower, designated in writing by Borrower in the Notice of
Borrowing.

 (c) Failure to Fund by Lender. Unless the Agent shall have
been notified by any Lender prior to any Funding Date in respect of any
Borrowing of Loans that such Lender does not intend to make available to the
Agent such Lender's Loan on such Funding Date, the Agent may assume that such
Lender has made such amount available to the Agent on such Funding Date and the
Agent in its sole discretion may, but shall not be obligated to, make available
to Borrower a corresponding amount on such Funding Date. If such corresponding
amount is not in fact made available to the Agent by such Lender on or prior to
12:00 noon (New York City time) on a Funding Date, such Lender agrees to pay
and Borrower agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
such amount is made available to Borrower until the date such amount is paid or
repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds
Effective Rate (as such term is defined in the definition of Alternate Base
Rate) for the first three (3) Business Days and thereafter at the Alternate
Base Rate, and (ii) in the case of Borrower, the interest rate which would be
applicable at the time to a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. If such Lender shall
pay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall
constitute such Lender's Loan, and if both such Lender and Borrower shall have
paid and repaid, respectively, such corresponding amount, the Agent shall
promptly pay over to Borrower such corresponding amount in same day funds, but
Borrower shall remain obligated for all interest thereon. Nothing in this
Section 2.02(c) shall be deemed to relieve any Lender of its obligation
hereunder to make its Loan on any Funding Date.

-25-
 33
 (d) Voluntary Reduction of Commitments. Borrower shall have
the right, at any time and from time to time, (i) to terminate the Commitments
in whole, without premium or penalty, if no Loans or Letters of Credit are then
outstanding, and no Loans or Letters of Credit have been requested but not yet
advanced or issued, as the case may be, or (ii) subject to the last sentence of
this Section 2.02(d), permanently to reduce in part, without premium or
penalty, the Commitments up to the amount by which the Commitments exceed the
sum of (A) the Loan Usage, (B) the aggregate principal amount of all Loans
requested hereunder but not yet advanced and (C) the aggregate face amount of
all Letters of Credit requested hereunder but not yet issued. Borrower shall
give not fewer than five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent
designating the date (which shall be a Business Day) of such termination or
reduction and the amount of any partial reduction. Promptly after receipt of a
notice of such termination or reduction, the Agent shall notify each Lender of
the proposed termination or reduction. Such termination or partial reduction
of the Commitments shall be effective on the date specified in the Borrower's
notice and shall reduce the Commitment of each Lender proportionately in
accordance with its Pro Rata Share. Any such partial reduction of the
Commitments shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of 5,000,000 and integral
multiples of 5,000,000 in excess of that amount. Any notice of reduction or
termination pursuant to this Section 2.02(d) shall be irrevocable.

 (e) Extension of Termination Date. This Agreement shall be
effective until the Initial Termination Date unless the Initial Termination
Date is extended pursuant hereto for successive periods ("Terms") of one year.
During the period which is not greater than ninety (90) but not less than sixty
(60) days prior to the first anniversary of the date hereof (and during like
periods each year thereafter), the Borrower may request in writing (an
"Extension Request") an extension of the initial Term for successive Terms of
one year; provided, such renewal Terms shall not be available for more than two
(2) years in the aggregate. The then applicable Termination Date shall be
extended for a one-year Term if, after receipt of such Extension Request, the
Lenders whose Pro Rata Shares, in the aggregate, are equal to or greater than
seventy-five percent (75 (the "Required Extension Lenders") approve such
Extension Request on or before the anniversary of the date hereof immediately
following such Extension Request; provided, however, that the failure of any
Lender to respond to an Extension Request shall be deemed to constitute such
Lender's denial of such Extension Request. If in any year an Extension Request
is not made or is made but not approved by the Required Extension Lenders, no
further Extension Requests may be made and the Revolving Credit Facility shall
expire on the Termination Date which was applicable thereto without regard to
such Extension Request. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
Lender which has denied its consent to an Extension Request ("Dissenting
Lender") shall be bound by the approval of the Extension Request granted by the
Required Extension Lenders, and the Commitment of each Dissenting Lender, and
each Dissenting Lender's participation in the Letters of Credit shall expire at
the end of the Term which was applicable thereto at the time of such Lender's
receipt of the Extension Request (the "Dissenting Lender's Term"). The
Borrower shall have the right, at any time, to replace a Dissenting Lender with
another financial institution reasonably acceptable to the Agent and the
Issuing Banks. In the event that a Dissenting Lender is not so replaced prior
to the expiration of the Dissenting Lender's Term, at the end of such Term, the
amount of the Commitments shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of the
expiring Commitments of Dissenting Lenders not so replaced, each remaining
Lender's Pro Rata Share shall be adjusted

-26-
 34
accordingly (including its pro rata participation in the Letters of Credit) and
the Borrower shall pay to the Dissenting Lender all amounts due and owing to
the Dissenting Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document, including,
without limitation, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans
owed to such Lender, together with accrued interest and fees thereon through
the date of repayment and amounts payable under Sections 2.09 and 2.10, all of
which amounts shall be immediately due and payable at such time. Upon the
replacement of a Dissenting Lender or payment of a Dissenting Lender's
Obligations at the end of such Dissenting Lender's Term in accordance with the
terms hereof, such Dissenting Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall
continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.10, 3.09,
12.03 and 12.04. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement on the
Termination Date, until all of the Obligations shall have been fully and
indefeasibly paid and satisfied, all financing arrangements among Borrower and
the Lenders shall have been terminated and all of the Letters of Credit shall
have expired, been cancelled or terminated, all of the rights and remedies
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall survive and the Agent
shall be entitled to retain its security interest in and to all existing and
future Collateral for the benefit of itself and the Holders of Secured
Obligations.

 (f) Notes. The Borrower shall execute and deliver to each
Lender (or to the Agent on behalf of each Lender) on or before the Effective
Date a substitute promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit 9 to
evidence the aggregate amount of that Lender's Loans and with other appropriate
insertions. The Note delivered to each Lender shall be dated the date hereof
and shall be stated to mature on the Termination Date. Each Lender is hereby
authorized to, and prior to any transfer of the Note issued to it each Lender
shall, endorse the date and amount of each Loan made by such Lender and each
payment or prepayment of principal of the Loans evidenced thereby on the
schedule annexed to and constituting a part of such Note, which endorsement
shall constitute prima facie evidence, absent manifest error, of the accuracy
of the information so endorsed, provided that failure by any such Lender to
make such endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower
hereunder or under such Note. In lieu of endorsing such schedule as
hereinabove provided, prior to any transfer of such Note, each Lender is hereby
authorized, at its option, to record such Loans and such payments or
prepayments in its books and records, such books and records constituting prima
facie evidence, absent manifest error, of the accuracy of the information
contained therein; provided, however, that if the Loan Account differs from the
information endorsed by a Lender on such Lender's Note, the Loan Account,
absent manifest error, shall govern.

 2.03. Interest on the Loans.

 (a) Rate of Interest. All Loans shall bear interest on the
unpaid principal amount thereof from the date made until paid in full at a
fluctuating rate determined from time to time by reference to the Alternate
Base Rate or the LIBO Rate. The applicable basis for determining the rate of
interest shall be selected by Borrower at the time a Notice of Borrowing is
given by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.02(a) or at the time a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation is delivered by Borrower pursuant to Section 2.03(c);
provided, however, that Borrower may not select the LIBO Rate as the applicable
basis for determining the rate of interest on a Loan (1) if at the time of such
selection a Potential Event of Default or Event of Default exists or (2) if
such a selection would be otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.
If on any day a Loan is outstanding with respect to which notice has not been
delivered to the Agent in

-27-
 35
accordance with the terms of this Agreement specifying the basis for
determining the rate of interest, then for each such day such Loan shall be a
Base Rate Loan. Loans shall bear interest, subject to Section 2.03(d), at the
following rates:

 (i) if a Base Rate Loan, then at a rate per annum equal to the
 sum of (A) the Applicable Base Rate Margin and (B) the Alternate Base
 Rate as in effect from time to time as interest accrues; and

 (ii) if a Eurodollar Rate Loan, then at a rate per annum equal
 to the sum of (A) the Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin and (B) the LIBO
 Rate determined for the applicable Interest Period.

 (b) Interest Payments. Subject to Section 2.03(d), (i)
interest accrued on each Base Rate Loan shall be payable in arrears (A) on the
last calendar day of each calendar quarter occurring after the Effective Date,
(B) upon the prepayment in full of the Loans and the termination of all
Commitments under this Agreement and (C) on the Termination Date, and (ii)
interest accrued on each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be payable in arrears (A)
on each Interest Payment Date applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (B) upon
the prepayment thereof and (C) on the Termination Date.

 (c) Conversion or Continuation. (i) Subject to the provisions
of Sections 2.07 and 2.08, Borrower shall have the option (A) to convert at any
time all or any part of outstanding Loans which comprise part of the same
Borrowing and which, in the aggregate, equal or exceed 1,000,000 from Base
Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans; or (B) to convert all or any part of
outstanding Loans which comprise part of the same Borrowing and which, in the
aggregate, equal or exceed 500,000 from Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate
Loans on the expiration date of any Interest Period applicable thereto; or (C)
upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to a Borrowing of
Eurodollar Rate Loans, to continue all or any portion of such Loans equal to or
in excess of 1,000,000 as Eurodollar Rate Loans of the same type, and the
succeeding Interest Period of such continued Loans shall commence on the
expiration date of the Interest Period applicable thereto; provided that no
outstanding Loan may be continued as, or be converted into, a Eurodollar Rate
Loan if any Potential Event of Default or Event of Default exists or if such a
continuation or conversion would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 (ii) In the event Borrower shall elect to convert or continue a
Loan under this Section 2.03(c), Borrower shall deliver a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation to the Agent no later than 12:00 noon (New York City
time) (A) at least one (1) Business Day in advance of the proposed conversion
date in the case of a conversion to a Base Rate Loan and (B) at least three (3)
Business Days in advance of the proposed conversion or continuation date in the
case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Loan. A
Notice of Conversion/ Continuation shall specify (1) the proposed conversion or
continuation date (which shall be a Business Day), (2) the amount of the Loan
to be converted or continued, (3) the nature of the proposed conversion or
continuation, and (4) in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a
Eurodollar Rate Loan, the requested Interest Period. In lieu of delivering the
above-described Notice of Conversion/Continuation, Borrower may give the Agent
telephonic notice of any proposed conversion or continuation by the time
required under this Section 2.03(c); provided

-28-
 36
that such notice shall be confirmed in writing by delivery to the Agent
promptly (but in no event later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the
proposed conversion or continuation date) of a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation. Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Conversion/
Continuation under this Section 2.03(c) (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof),
the Agent shall notify each Lender by telex, telecopy, telephone or other
similar form of transmission, of the proposed conversion or continuation.

 (iii) Any Notice of Conversion/Continuation for conversion to,
or continuation of, a Loan (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof) shall be
irrevocable and the Borrower shall be bound to convert or continue in
accordance therewith.

 (d) Default Interest. Notwithstanding the rates of interest
specified in Section 2.03(a) and the payment dates specified in Section
2.03(b), (i) from and after the occurrence of a payment default constituting an
Event of Default under Section 10.01(a), until the past-due amount is paid,
such amount not paid when due shall bear interest payable upon demand at a rate
per annum equal to the sum of (A) two and one-eighths percent (2.125 and (B)
the Alternate Base Rate in effect from time to time (the "Default Rate"), and
(ii) (x) from and after the occurrence of any Event of Default described in
Sections 10.01(f) or 10.01(g) with respect to the Borrower, any Domestic
Subsidiary or any one or more Supported Foreign Subsidiaries the aggregate
Credit Support of which equals or exceeds 25,000,000 and (y) from and after
the occurrence of any other Event of Default set forth in a notice from the
Agent or Requisite Lenders to the Borrower, and for so long thereafter as such
Event of Default is continuing, the principal balance of all Loans and other
Agreement Obligations then outstanding (including, without limitation, all
amounts due and payable pursuant to Section 10.02(a)) and, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, any interest payments on the Loans not paid when
due, shall bear interest payable upon demand at the Default Rate.

 (e) Determination of Applicable Margins and Applicable Fees;
Computation of Interest.

 (i) Definitions. As used in this Section 2.03(e) and in this
Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

 "Applicable Fees" and "Applicable Margins" shall mean the
 Applicable Commitment Fee and/or the Applicable Letter of Credit Fee,
 with respect to "Applicable Fees", and Applicable Base Rate Margin
 and/or Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin, with respect to "Applicable
 Margins", as the case may be. The Applicable Fees and Applicable
 Margins shall be determined, in accordance with the provisions of
 Section 2.03(e), by reference to the following:

-29-

 or equal to Not
 4.0 to 1.0 Applicable 0.375 1.125 1.125 0.125 

 Greater than
 4.0 to 1.0
 and less than
 or equal to Not
 5.0 to 1.0 Applicable 0.250 0.875 0.875 0.000 

 Greater than

 Greater than
 6.5 to 1.0 OR BBB 0.1875 0.625 0.625 0.000 

 Not Applicable BBB+ 0.1875 0.500 0.500 0.000 

"Borrower Interest Coverage Ratio" shall have the
meaning ascribed to such term in Section 9.01.

 "Senior Debt Ratings" shall mean the publicly announced
 ratings by Moody's, S&P or other nationally recognized rating services
 acceptable to the Agent on the Borrower's senior unsecured Indebtedness;
 provided, the Borrower shall have at least two such ratings and at least
 one of which shall be from S&P or Moody's.

 (ii) Determination of Applicable Margins and Applicable Fees.

 (A) The Applicable Margin in respect of any Loan and the
Applicable Fees payable under Section 2.04 shall be determined by reference to
the tables set forth in clause (i) above, as applicable, on the basis of the
Borrower Interest Coverage Ratio (calculated initially with respect to the
first two quarters after the Effective Date, then the first three quarters
after the Effective Date, and thereafter on a rolling four quarter basis)
determined by reference to the most recent financial statements delivered
pursuant to Section 6.01(b) or 6.01(c) or by reference to the Borrower's Senior
Debt Ratings, if any, from time to time, whichever reference results in the
lower Applicable Margin and Applicable Fees.

 (B) Upon receipt of the financial statements delivered pursuant
to Section 6.01(b) or Section 6.01(c), as applicable, the Applicable Margins
for all outstanding Loans and the

-30-
 38
Applicable Fees shall be adjusted, such adjustment being effective on the first
Business Day after receipt of such financial statements and the Compliance
Certificate to be delivered in connection therewith; provided, however, if the
Borrower shall not have timely delivered its financial statements in accordance
with Section 6.01(b) or Section 6.01(c), as applicable, beginning with the date
upon which such financial statements should have been delivered and continuing
until such financial statements are delivered, it shall be assumed for purposes
of determining the Applicable Margins and the Applicable Fees that the Borrower
Interest Coverage Ratio was less than 4.0 to 1.0. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if reference is made to the Senior Debt Ratings for determination of
the Applicable Margin or the Applicable Fees, the Applicable Margins for all
outstanding Loans and the Applicable Fees shall be adjusted automatically
without reference to the delivery of the Borrower's financial statements, such
adjustment being effective on the first Business Day after any change in
Borrower's Senior Debt Ratings.

(C) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from the
Closing Date through the date of receipt of the financial statements for the
period ended September 30, 1994 pursuant to Section 6.01(b) or 6.01(c), the
Applicable Margins and Applicable Fees shall be determined based upon an
assumption that the Borrower Interest Coverage Ratio is greater than 4.0 to 1.0
but less than or equal to 5.0 to 1.0.

(iii) Computation of Interest. Interest on all Agreement
Obligations (other than those on which the interest rate is determined by
reference to the Prime Rate) shall be computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed in the period during which interest accrues and a year
of 360 days. Interest on all Agreement Obligations with respect to which the
interest rate is determined by reference to the Prime Rate shall be computed on
the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which
interest accrues and a year of 365/366 days. In computing interest on any
Loan, the date of the making of the Loan or the first day of an Interest
Period, as the case may be, shall be included and the date of payment or the
expiration date of an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be excluded;
provided that if a Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one (1)
day's interest shall be paid on that Loan.

 (f) Changes; Legal Restrictions. In the event that after the
date hereof (i) the adoption of or any change in any law, treaty, rule,
regulation, guideline or determination of a Governmental Authority or any
change in the interpretation or application thereof by a Governmental
Authority, or (ii) compliance by any Lender with any request or directive
(whether or not having the force of law and whether or not the failure to
comply therewith would be unlawful) from any central bank or other Governmental
Authority or quasi-governmental authority exercising jurisdiction, power or
control over banks or financial institutions generally, does impose, modify, or
hold applicable, in the determination of a Lender, any reserve, special
deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance, capital allocation or similar
requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities (including
those pertaining to Letters of Credit) in or for the account of, advances or
loans by, Commitments made, or other credit extended by, or any other
acquisition of funds by, a Lender or any Applicable Lending Office of such
Lender (except with respect to Base Rate Loans, so long as the Base Rate in
effect at the time is determined under clause (a) in the definition of
"Alternate Base Rate"), and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase
the cost to such Lender of making, renewing or maintaining the Loans or its
Commitment or issuing or participating in any Letter of Credit or to reduce any
amount receivable hereunder or thereunder; then, in any such case, Borrower
shall

-31-
 39
upon written notice from and demand by that Lender pay to such Lender, within
fifteen (15) Business Days of the date specified in such notice and demand,
such amount or amounts (based upon a reasonable allocation thereof by such
Lender to the financing transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
affected by this Section 2.03(f)) as may be necessary to compensate that Lender
on an after-tax basis for any such additional cost incurred or reduced amount
received. Such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower a written statement of the
costs or reductions claimed and the basis therefor, and the allocation made by
such Lender of such costs and reductions, which statement shall, in the absence
of manifest error, be conclusive. If a Lender subsequently recovers from
another Person any amount previously paid by Borrower pursuant to this Section
2.03(f), such Lender shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such
refund and to the extent permitted by applicable law, pay to the Borrower,
without interest, the amount of any such recovery.

 2.04. Fees.

 (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for
the account of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares
except as set forth in Section 12.07(b)(vi), a fee (the "Commitment Fee"),
accruing at the rate of the then Applicable Commitment Fee on the average daily
amount by which the Commitments exceed Loan Usage for the period commencing on
the date hereof and ending on the Termination Date, such Commitment Fee being
payable quarterly, in arrears, on the last calendar day of each calendar
quarter occurring after the date hereof and on the Termination Date.

 (b) Letter of Credit Fees. Borrower shall pay to the Agent,
for the ratable account of the Lenders a fee for each Letter of Credit issued
on behalf of Borrower, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.08(a).

 (c) Payment of Fees; No Other Compensation. The fees described
in this Section 2.04 represent compensation for services rendered and to be
rendered separate and apart from the lending of money or the provision of
credit and do not constitute compensation for the use, detention or forbearance
of money, and the obligation of Borrower to pay each fee described herein shall
be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the obligation of Borrower to pay
interest, other fees and expenses otherwise described in this Agreement. Fees
and expenses shall be payable when due in immediately available funds. All
fees and expenses shall be nonrefundable when paid. All fees and expenses
specified or referred to in this Agreement or in the letter agreement dated
January 14, 1994 among Chemical, Chemical Securities, Inc. and the Borrower
(the "Fee Letter") due to the Agent, the Issuing Banks or any Lender,
including, without limitation, amounts referred to in this Section 2.04 and in
Section 12.03, shall constitute Obligations and shall be secured by all the
Collateral. All fees described in this Section 2.04 which are expressed as a
per annum charge shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed in a 365/366-day year. Except for upfront fees payable to the Lenders
on the Effective Date as agreed to by the Borrower and fronting fees of the
Issuing Banks with respect to Letters of Credit payable pursuant to Section
3.08(b), no Lender or Issuing Bank shall be entitled to receive any additional
compensation for its execution or performance under this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents.

-32-
 40
 2.05. Prepayments. Borrower shall not at any time cause or
permit Loan Usage to exceed the Commitments. If at any time Loan Usage exceeds
the Commitments, at such time, Borrower shall, without demand or notice,
promptly pay to the Agent such amount as may be necessary to eliminate such
excess, which prepayment shall be applied as set forth in Section 2.06(b). Any
payment required by this Section 2.05 shall be payable without penalty or
premium, except as may be required by Section 2.08(d) with respect to any
Eurodollar Rate Loan prepaid as a result thereof. After the Loans have been
paid in full, further prepayments made pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be
held as cash collateral for the Letter of Credit Obligations.

 2.06. Payments.

 (a) Manner and Time of Payment. Except as otherwise expressly
set forth herein, all payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and
Reimbursement Obligations and other Agreement Obligations (including without
limitation, fees and expenses) payable to the Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing
Banks (or any of them) shall be made without setoff, counterclaim, defense,
condition or reservation of right, in Dollars and in immediately available
funds, delivered to the Agent (or, in the case of Reimbursement Obligations, to
the applicable Issuing Bank) not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on
the date and at the place due, to such account of the Agent (or the applicable
Issuing Bank) as it may designate, for the account of the Agent, the Lenders or
the Issuing Banks, as the case may be; and funds received by the Agent after
that time and date shall be deemed to have been paid and received by the Agent
on the next succeeding Business Day. Payments actually received by the Agent
for the account of the Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, or any of them,
shall be paid to them promptly after receipt thereof by the Agent. All
payments of principal, interest, Reimbursement Obligations and fees, and all
reimbursements for expenses pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, may at the option of the Agent (but without any obligation to do so)
and upon reasonable notice to Borrower be paid from the proceeds of Loans made
to Borrower hereunder. Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
authorizes the Lenders to make Loans to it under the Revolving Credit Facility,
which Loans shall be Base Rate Loans, for the purpose of paying interest,
Reimbursement Obligations and fees due from it and for the purpose of
reimbursing the Agent, the Issuing Banks and each Lender for expenses due and
payable pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and agrees that
all such Loans so made shall be deemed to have been requested by it and at the
option of the Agent (but without any obligation to do so) may be charged to
Borrower's Loan Account.

 (b) Apportionment of Payments and Prepayments. (i) Subject to
the provisions of Section 12.07(b), all payments and prepayments of principal
and interest in respect of outstanding Loans, all payments in respect of
Reimbursement Obligations, all payments of fees and all other payments in
respect of any other Agreement Obligations, shall be allocated among such of
the Lenders and the Issuing Banks as are entitled thereto, in proportion to
their respective Pro Rata Shares or otherwise as provided herein. Subject to
the provisions of Section 2.06(b)(ii), all such payments and prepayments and
any other amounts received by the Agent from or for the benefit of the Borrower
shall be applied first, to pay principal of and interest on any portion of the
Loans which the Agent may have advanced on behalf of any Lender for which the
Agent has not then been reimbursed by such Lender or the Borrower, second, to
pay principal of and interest on any advance made under Section 12.20 for which
the

-33-
 41
Agent has not then been paid by the Borrower or reimbursed by the Lenders,
third, to pay all other Agreement Obligations then due and payable, and fourth,
as the Borrower so designates. Unless otherwise designated by the Borrower,
all principal payments and prepayments in respect of Loans shall be applied
first, to the Eurodollar Rate Loans maturing on the date of such payment,
second, to repay outstanding Base Rate Loans, and then to repay outstanding
Eurodollar Rate Loans with those Eurodollar Rate Loans which have earlier
expiring Interest Periods being repaid prior to those which have later expiring
Interest Periods.

 (ii) Subject to the provisions of Section 12.07(b), after the
occurrence of an Event of Default and while the same is continuing, the Agent
shall, unless otherwise specified at the direction of the Requisite Lenders
which direction shall be consistent with the last sentence of this clause (ii),
apply all payments and prepayments in respect of any Obligations and all
proceeds of Collateral in the following order:

 (A) first, to pay interest on and then principal of any portion
 of the Loans which the Agent may have advanced on behalf of any Lender
 for which the Agent has not then been reimbursed by such Lender or the
 Borrower;

 (B) second, to pay interest on and then principal of any
 advance made under Section 12.20 for which the Agent has not then been
 paid by the Borrower or reimbursed by the Lenders;

 (C) third, to pay Agreement Obligations in respect of any fees,
expense reimbursements or indemnities then due to the Agent;

 (D) fourth, to pay Agreement Obligations in respect of any
 fees, expenses, reimbursements or indemnities then due to the Lenders
 and the Issuing Banks;

 (E) fifth, to pay interest due in respect of Loans and Letter
of Credit Obligations;

 (F) sixth, to the ratable payment or prepayment of principal
 outstanding on Loans and Reimbursement Obligations in such order as the
 Agent may determine in its sole discretion;

 (G) seventh, to pay principal on contingent Letter of Credit
 Obligations by depositing such funds as cash collateral pursuant to
 Section 10.02(b);

 (H) eighth, to the ratable payment of all other Agreement
Obligations; and

 (I) ninth, to the ratable payment of all Obligations in respect
of Eligible Hedging Contracts.

The order of priority set forth in this Section 2.06(b)(ii) and the related
provisions of this Agreement are set forth solely to determine the rights and
priorities of the Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and other Holders of
Secured Obligations as among themselves. The order of priority set forth in
clauses (D) through (I) of this Section 2.06(b)(ii) may at any time and from
time to time be changed by the Requisite Lenders without necessity of notice to
or consent of or

-34-
 42
approval by the Borrower, or any other Person. The order of priority set forth
in clauses (A) through (C) of this Section 2.06(b)(ii) may be changed only with
the prior written consent of the Agent.

 (iii) Subject to Section 12.07(b), the Agent shall promptly
distribute to each Lender and the Issuing Banks at its primary address set
forth on the appropriate signature page hereof or the signature page to the
Assignment and Acceptance by which it became a Lender, or at such other address
as a Lender, an Issuing Bank or other Holder of Secured Obligations may request
in writing, such funds as such Person may be entitled to receive; provided that
the Agent shall under no circumstances be bound to inquire into or determine
the validity, scope or priority of any interest or entitlement of any Lender or
any other Holder of Secured Obligations and may suspend all payments or seek
appropriate relief (including, without limitation, instructions from the
Requisite Lenders or an action in the nature of interpleader) in the event of
any doubt or dispute as to any apportionment or distribution contemplated
hereby.

 (c) Payments on Non-Business Days. Whenever any payment to be
made by Borrower hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a
Business Day, payments shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day,
unless such Business Day occurs in the succeeding month in which case such
payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, and such
extension of time, if any, shall be included in the computation of the payment
of interest hereunder and of any of the fees specified in Section 2.04, as the
case may be.

 (d) Agent's or Issuing Banks' Accounting. The Agent shall
maintain such accounts, books and records (a "Loan Account") in which it shall
record (i) the names and addresses of the Lenders and the respective
Commitments of, and principal amount of Loans owing to, each Lender from time
to time; (ii) other appropriate debits and credits as provided in this
Agreement, including, without limitation, all interest and fees constituting
Obligations; and (iii) all payments of such Obligations made by Borrower or for
Borrower's account. Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practices an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of Borrower to
such Lender resulting from each Loan owing to such Lender from time to time,
including the amount of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender
from time to time hereunder. Each of the Issuing Banks shall maintain a
separate Loan Account in which it shall record appropriate debits and credits
related to its Letter of Credit Obligations. Entries in any Loan Account made
in accordance with the Agent's, any Lender's or any Issuing Bank's customary
accounting practices as in effect from time to time shall constitute prima
facie evidence of the matters reflected therein.

 2.07. Interest Periods. By giving notice as set forth in
Section 2.02(a) or 2.03(c) with respect to a Borrowing of, conversion into or
continuation of Loans consisting of Eurodollar Rate Loans, Borrower shall have
the option, subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.07 and Section
2.08, to specify an interest period (each an "Interest Period") to apply to the
Borrowing described in such notice, which Interest Period shall be either a one
(1), two (2), three (3) or six (6) month period. The determination of Interest
Periods shall be subject to the following provisions:

-35-
 43
 (a) In the case of immediately successive Interest Periods,
each successive Interest Period shall commence on the day on which the next
preceding Interest Period expires;

 (b) If any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day
which is not a Business Day, the Interest Period shall be extended to expire on
the next succeeding Business Day; provided that if any such Interest Period
would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day and no further
Business Day occurs in that calendar month, that Interest Period shall expire
on the immediately preceding Business Day;

 (c) Borrower may not select an Interest Period which terminates
later than the Termination Date;

 (d) Without the prior written consent of the Agent, there shall
be no more than five (5) Interest Periods under this Agreement in effect at any
one time.

 2.08. Special Provisions Governing Eurodollar Rate Loans.
Notwithstanding other provisions of this Agreement, the following provisions
shall govern with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans as to the matters covered:

 (a) Determination of Interest Rate. As soon as practicable
after 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the Interest Rate Determination Date,
the Agent shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be
presumptively correct) the interest rate which shall apply to the Eurodollar
Rate Loans for which an interest rate is then being determined for the
applicable Interest Period and shall promptly give notice thereof (in writing
or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrower and to each Lender.

 (b) Interest Rate Unascertainable, Inadequate or Unfair. With
respect to any Interest Period, if deposits in Dollars (in the applicable
amount) are not being offered to (i) Chemical Bank or (ii) the Requisite
Lenders in the London interbank Eurodollar market for such Interest Period, or
if adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable
interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition of LIBO Rate, then
the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to Borrower and each Lender,
whereupon until the Agent has determined that the circumstances giving rise to
such suspension no longer exist, (a) the right of Borrower to elect to have
Loans bear interest based upon the LIBO Rate shall be suspended, and (b) each
outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan on
the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor, notwithstanding any
prior election by the Borrower to the contrary.

 (c) Illegality. (i) In the event that on any date any Lender
shall have determined (which determination shall, in the absence of manifest
error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties) that the making or
continuation of any Eurodollar Rate Loan has become unlawful by compliance by
that Lender in good faith with any law, governmental rule, regulation or order
of any Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law and
whether or not failure to comply therewith would be unlawful), then, and in any
such event, such Lender shall promptly give notice (by teletransmission or by
telephone promptly confirmed in writing) to Borrower and the Agent of that
determination and the reasons therefor. The Agent shall promptly forward any
such notice it receives to the other Lenders.

-36-
 44
 (ii) Upon the giving of the notice referred to in Section
2.08(c)(i), (A) Borrower's right to request of the Lenders and the Lenders'
obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Loans with respect to the requested
Borrowing shall be immediately suspended, and the Lenders shall make Loans,
with respect to such requested Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans as Base Rate
Loans, and (B) if Eurodollar Rate Loans are then outstanding, Borrower shall
immediately (or, if permitted by applicable law, no later than the date
permitted thereby, upon at least one (1) Business Day's written notice to the
Agent and the Lenders) convert all such Loans of the same Borrowing into Base
Rate Loans.

 (iii) In the event that a Lender determines at any time
following its giving of a notice referred to in Section 2.08(c)(i) that such
Lender may lawfully make Eurodollar Rate Loans, such Lender shall promptly give
notice (by teletransmission or by telephone promptly confirmed in writing) to
Borrower and the Agent of that determination, whereupon Borrower's right to
request of the Lenders and the Lenders' obligation to make Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall be restored. The Agent shall promptly forward any such notice it
receives to the Lenders.

 (d) Compensation. In addition to such amounts as are required
to be paid by Borrower pursuant to Sections 2.03(a), 2.03(d), 2.03(f), 2.04 and
each other provision of this Agreement requiring payment by Borrower, Borrower
shall compensate each Lender, upon demand, for all losses (including lost
profits but excluding therefrom the Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin),
expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other
funds acquired by such Lender to fund or maintain such Lender's Eurodollar Rate
Loans to the Borrower) which such Lender may sustain (i) if for any reason a
Borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans does not
occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation or in a telephonic request for borrowing or conversion
or continuation or a successive Interest Period does not commence after notice
therefor is given pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii), (ii) if any prepayment of
any Eurodollar Rate Loan (including, without limitation, any prepayment
pursuant to Section 2.05 but excluding any prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate
Loan in connection with the replacement of any Lender under clause (i) or
clause (ii) of Section 2.13) occurs for any reason on a date which is not the
last day of the applicable Interest Period, (iii) as a consequence of any
required conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan as a result
of any of the events indicated in Section 2.08(c), (iv) as a consequence of an
acceleration of the Obligations pursuant to Section 10.02(a) and (v) as a
consequence of any other failure by Borrower to repay Eurodollar Rate Loans
when required by the terms of this Agreement. Such Lender shall deliver to
Borrower, as a condition of Borrower's obligation to compensate such Lender, a
written statement as to such losses, expenses and liabilities which statement,
in the absence of manifest error, shall be conclusive as to such amounts.

 (e) Booking of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Any Lender may make,
carry or transfer Eurodollar Rate Loans at, to, or for the account of, any of
its branch offices, agencies or the office of an Affiliate of that Lender;
provided that no such Lender shall be entitled to receive any greater amount
under Section 2.03(f) or Section 2.09 as a result of the transfer of any such
Loan than such Lender would be entitled to immediately prior thereto unless (i)
such transfer occurred at a time when circumstances giving rise to the claim
for such greater amount did not

-37-
 45
exist and were not reasonably foreseeable by such Lender, or (ii) such claim
would have arisen even if such transfer had not occurred.

 2.09. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by Borrower hereunder
shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.06, free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges, or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto including
those arising after the date hereof as a result of the adoption of or any
change in any law, treaty, rule, regulation, guideline or determination of a
Governmental Authority or any change in the interpretation or application
thereof by a Governmental Authority but excluding, in the case of each Lender,
each Issuing Bank and the Agent, such taxes (including income taxes, franchise
taxes and branch profit taxes) as are imposed on or measured by such Lender's,
Issuing Bank's or Agent's, as the case may be, income by the United States of
America or any Governmental Authority of the jurisdiction under the laws of
which such Lender, Issuing Bank or Agent, as the case may be, is organized,
maintains an Applicable Lending Office or is deemed to be engaged in trade or
business (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges,
withholdings, and liabilities which the Agent, an Issuing Bank or a Lender
determines to be applicable to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the
Commitments, the Loans or the Letters of Credit being hereinafter referred to
as "Taxes"). If Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or
in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under the other Loan Documents to
any Lender, Issuing Bank or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased
as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.09) such
Lender, Issuing Bank or Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to
the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) Borrower
shall make such deductions, and (iii) Borrower shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance
with applicable law. If a withholding tax of the United States of America or
any other Governmental Authority shall be or become applicable (y) after the
date of this Agreement, to such payments by Borrower made to the Applicable
Lending Office or any other office that a Lender may claim as its Applicable
Lending Office, or (z) after such Lender's selection and designation of any
other Applicable Lending Office, to such payments made to such other Applicable
Lending Office, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to make, fund and
maintain its Loans through another Applicable Lending Office of such Lender in
another jurisdiction so as to reduce such Borrower's liability hereunder, if
the making, funding or maintenance of such Loans through such other Applicable
Lending Office of such Lender does not, in the judgment of such Lender,
otherwise materially adversely affect such Loans, obligations under the
Commitments or such Lender.

 (b) In addition, Borrower agrees to pay any present or future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges, or
similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder, from the issuance
of Letters of Credit hereunder, or from the execution, delivery or registration
of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the
Commitments, the Loans or the Letters of Credit (hereinafter referred to as
"Other Taxes").

 (c) Borrower will indemnify each Lender, each Issuing Bank and
the Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without
limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any Governmental Authority on
amounts payable under this Section 2.09) paid by

-38-
 46
such Lender, Issuing Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability
(including penalties, interest, and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
asserted. This indemnification shall be made within thirty (30) days after the
date such Lender, Issuing Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written
demand therefor. A certificate as to any additional amount payable to any
Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Agent under this Section 2.09 submitted to such
Borrower and the Agent (if a Lender or Issuing Bank is so submitting) by such
Lender, Issuing Bank or the Agent shall show in reasonable detail the amount
payable and the calculations used to determine such amount and shall, absent
manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto. With
respect to such deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes and to
confirm that all such Taxes have been paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities, Borrower shall promptly (and in any event not later than thirty
(30) days after receipt) furnish to each Lender, Issuing Bank and the Agent
such certificates, receipts and other documents as may be required (in the
judgment of such Lender, Issuing Bank or the Agent) to establish any tax credit
to which such Lender, Issuing Bank or the Agent may be entitled.

 (d) Within thirty (30) days after the date of any payment of
Taxes or Other Taxes by Borrower, Borrower will furnish to the Agent, at its
address referred to in Section 12.10, the original or a certified copy of a
receipt evidencing payment thereof.

 (e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of Borrower contained in
this Section 2.09 shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest
hereunder, the termination of the Letters of Credit and the termination of this
Agreement.

 (f) Without limiting the obligations of Borrower under this
Section 2.09, each Lender that is not created or organized under the laws of
the United States of America or a political subdivision thereof shall deliver
to Borrower and the Agent on or before the initial Funding Date, or, if later,
the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender pursuant to Section 12.02
hereof, a true and accurate certificate executed in duplicate by a duly
authorized officer of such Lender, in a form satisfactory to Borrower and the
Agent, to the effect that such Lender is capable under the provisions of an
applicable tax treaty concluded by the United States of America (in which case
the certificate shall be accompanied by two executed copies of Form 1001 of the
IRS) or under Section 1442 of the IRC (in which case the certificate shall be
accompanied by two copies of Form 4224 of the IRS) of receiving payments of
interest hereunder without deduction or withholding of United States federal
income tax. Each such Lender further agrees to deliver to Borrower and the
Agent from time to time a true and accurate certificate executed in duplicate
by a duly authorized officer of such Lender substantially in a form
satisfactory to Borrower and the Agent, before or promptly upon the occurrence
of any event requiring a change in the most recent certificate previously
delivered by it to Borrower and the Agent pursuant to this Section 2.09(f).
Further, each Lender which delivers a certificate accompanied by Form 1001 of
the IRS covenants and agrees to deliver to Borrower and the Agent within
fifteen (15) days prior to January 1, 1995, and every third (3rd) anniversary
of such date thereafter, on which this Agreement is still in effect, another
such certificate and two accurate and complete original signed copies of Form
1001 (or any successor form or forms required under the IRC or the applicable
regulations promulgated thereunder), and each Lender that delivers a
certificate accompanied by Form 4224 of the IRS covenants and

-39-
 47
agrees to deliver to Borrower and the Agent within fifteen (15) days prior to
the beginning of each subsequent taxable year of such Lender during which this
Agreement is still in effect, another such certificate and two accurate and
complete original signed copies of IRS Form 4224 (or any successor form or
forms required under the IRC or the applicable regulations promulgated
thereunder). Each such certificate shall certify as to one of the following:

 (i) that such Lender is capable of receiving payments of
 interest hereunder without deduction or withholding of United States of
 America federal income tax;

 (ii) that such Lender is not capable of receiving payments of
 interest hereunder without deduction or withholding of United States of
 America federal income tax as specified therein but is capable of
 recovering the full amount of any such deduction or withholding from a
 source other than the Borrower and will not seek any such recovery from
 Borrower; or

 (iii) that, as a result of the adoption of or any change in any
 law, treaty, rule, regulation, guideline or determination of a
 Governmental Authority or any change in the interpretation or
 application thereof by a Governmental Authority after the date such
 Lender became a party hereto, such Lender is not capable of receiving
 payments of interest hereunder without deduction or withholding of
 United States of America federal income tax as specified therein and
 that it is not capable of recovering the full amount of the same from a
 source other than the Borrower.

 Each Lender shall promptly furnish to Borrower and the Agent
such additional documents as may be reasonably required by Borrower or the
Agent to establish any exemption from or reduction of any Taxes or Other Taxes
required to be deducted or withheld and which may be obtained without undue
expense to such Lender.

 2.10. Increased Capital. If any Lender determines that either
(A) the introduction of or any change in any law, order or regulation or in the
interpretation or administration of any law, order or regulation by any
Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof after the date hereof or (B) compliance with any guideline or request
issued or made after the date hereof from any central bank or other
Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or
any corporation controlling such Lender, as a consequence of or with reference
to such Lender's Commitment or its making or maintaining Loans or, in the case
of such Lender acting in its capacity as an Issuing Bank, such Issuing Bank's
issuance or maintenance of any Letter of Credit, or any Lender's participation
in any Letter of Credit, below the rate which such Lender or such other
corporation could have achieved but for such compliance (taking into account
the policies of such Lender or corporation with regard to capital), then
Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of
such demand to the Agent), pay to such Lender additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Lender on an after-tax basis for such reduction, upon receipt
by Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) of a certificate as to such amounts, by
such Lender, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for, and the
calculations used by such Lender in determining, any such amounts. Such
certificate, in the absence of manifest error shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify Borrower and the Agent
of any

-40-
 48
circumstances that would cause Borrower to pay additional amounts pursuant to
this Section 2.10, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect Borrower's obligation to pay such additional amounts hereunder.

 2.11. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Loans and Letters
of Credit may be used only in the ordinary course of business and for proper
corporate purposes. Letters of Credit may be used (a) to support financial or
performance obligations of the Borrower, (b) to provide Credit Support, subject
to the terms of Section 7.10, to Borrower's Subsidiaries and/or (c) with
respect to Commercial Letters of Credit, to facilitate international purchases.

 2.12. Authorized Officers of Borrower. Borrower shall notify
the Agent and the Issuing Banks in writing of the names of the Financial
Officers and the other officers and employees authorized to request Loans and
Letters of Credit and to request a conversion or continuation of any Loan and
shall provide the Agent with a specimen signature of each such Financial
Officer, officer or employee. The Agent and the Issuing Banks shall be
entitled to rely conclusively on such Financial Officer's, officer's or
employee's authority to request such Loan or Letter of Credit or such
conversion or continuation until the Agent and the Issuing Banks receive
written notice to the contrary. The Agent and the Issuing Banks shall have no
duty to verify the authenticity of the signature appearing on any written
Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation and, with respect to
an oral request for such a Loan or Letter of Credit or such conversion or
continuation, the Agent and the Issuing Banks shall have no duty to verify the
identity of any person representing himself as one of the Financial Officers,
officers or employees authorized to make such request on behalf of Borrower.
Neither the Agent, any Issuing Bank nor any Lender shall incur any liability to
Borrower in acting upon any telephonic notice referred to above which the Agent
believes to have been given by a duly authorized Financial Officer, officer or
other person authorized to borrow on behalf of Borrower.

 2.13. Replacement of Certain Lenders. In the event a Lender
("Affected Lender") shall have: (i) failed to fund its Pro Rata Share of any
Borrowing requested by the Borrower which such Lender is obligated to fund
under the terms of this Agreement and which such failure has not been cured,
(ii) failed to issue a Letter of Credit requested by the Borrower which such
Lender is obligated to issue as an Issuing Bank under the terms of this
Agreement, (iii) has requested compensation from the Borrower under Sections
2.03(f), 2.09 or 2.10 to recover additional costs incurred by such Lender which
are not being incurred generally by the other Lenders, or (iv) delivered a
notice pursuant to Section 2.08(c)(i) claiming that such Lender is unable to
extend Eurodollar Rate Loans to the Borrower for reasons not generally
applicable to the other Lenders, then, in any such case, the Borrower or the
Agent may make written demand on such Affected Lender (with a copy to the Agent
in the case of a demand by the Borrower and a copy to the Borrower in the case
of a demand by the Agent) for the Affected Lender to assign, and such Affected
Lender shall assign pursuant to one or more duly executed Assignment and
Acceptances five (5) Business Days after the date of such demand, to one or
more financial institutions which complies with the provisions of Section 12.02
(and, if selected by the Borrower is reasonably acceptable to the Agent) which
the Borrower or the Agent, as the case may be, shall have engaged for such
purpose ("Replacement Lender"), all of such Affected Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including,
without limitation, its Commitments, all Loans owing to it, all of its
participation interests in existing Letters of Credit, and its obligation to
participate in additional Letters of Credit

-41-
 49
hereunder) in accordance with Section 12.02. The Agent is hereby authorized to
execute one or more Assignment and Acceptances as attorney-in- fact for any
Affected Lender failing to execute and deliver the same within five (5)
Business Days after the date of such demand. Further, with respect to such
assignment:

 (a) in the event the Affected Lender is an Issuing Bank the
Borrower shall have, with respect to each outstanding Letter of Credit issued
by such Issuing Bank, provided the Affected Lender with cash collateral,
arranged for surrender of such Letters of Credit, arranged for a back-to-back
Letter of Credit or made such other arrangement in respect of such Letter of
Credit as shall be mutually acceptable to the Borrower and such Affected
Lender; and

 (b) the Affected Lender shall have concurrently received, in
cash, all amounts due and owing to the Affected Lender hereunder or under any
other Loan Document, including, without limitation, the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Loans owed to such Lender, together with accrued
interest thereon through the date of such assignment, amounts payable under
Sections 2.03(f), 2.09, 2.10, 2.14, 3.09, 12.03 and 12.04 and compensation
payable under Section 2.08(d) in the event of any replacement of any Affected
Lender under clause (iii) or clause (iv) of this Section 2.13; provided, upon
such Affected Lender's replacement, such Affected Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
2.03(f), 2.08, 2.09, 2.10, 2.14, 3.09, 12.03 and 12.04, as well as to any fees
accrued for its account hereunder and not yet paid.

Upon the replacement of any Affected Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13, (x)
each Letter of Credit issued by such Affected Lender shall cease to be a Letter
of Credit under this Agreement, shall cease to have any participation in,
entitlement to, or other right to share in the security interests and liens of
the Agent and the Holders of Secured Obligations in the Collateral and shall no
longer be subject to the participation provisions of Section 3.06, all of which
participations shall be deemed to have terminated and been repurchased by the
applicable Issuing Bank hereunder and (y) the provisions of Section 12.07(b)
shall continue to apply with respect to Borrowings which are then outstanding
with respect to which the Affected Lender failed to fund its Pro Rata Share and
which failure has not been cured.

 2.14. Incurrence of Costs. In the event any Lender shall be
subject to any cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or
maintaining such Lender's Commitment or its Loans or, in the case of an Issuing
Bank, the issuance or maintenance of any Letter of Credit, or any Lender's
participation in any Letter of Credit, which cost is due to either (i) the
compliance by such Lender or Issuing Bank with any law or regulation or other
requirements imposed upon it with respect to "Statutory Reserves" (as defined
below) or (ii) the application to such Lender of the annual assessment rate
that will be employed in determining amounts payable by such Lender to the FDIC
for insurance by the FDIC of time deposits made in Dollars at such Lender's
domestic office, then the Borrower shall, from time to time, on demand by such
Lender, pay to such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such
Lender on an after-tax basis for such costs. Any Lender wishing to require
payment of such additional costs shall notify the Borrower in writing (with a
copy to the Agent), which notification shall include a certificate as to such
costs, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for and the calculations
used by such Lender in determining any such amounts. The Borrower shall make
any such payment directly to the affected Lender. For purposes hereof, the
term "Statutory Reserves"

-42-
 50
shall mean the reserve percentages (including, without limitation, any basic,
marginal, special, emergency, supplemental or other reserves) expressed as a
decimal established by the Federal Reserve Board and any other banking
authority to which such Lender or Issuing Bank is subject (a) with respect to
the Three-Month Secondary CD Rate (as such term is used in the definition of
Alternate Base Rate), for new negotiable nonpersonal time deposits in Dollars,
and (b) with respect to the LIBO Rate, for Eurocurrency Liabilities (as defined
in Regulation D) (or in respect of any other category of liabilities which
includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Eurodollar Rate
Loans is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets
which includes loans by a non-United States office of any bank to United States
residents). Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be deemed to constitute Eurocurrency
Liabilities and to be subject to such reserve requirements without benefit of
or credit for proration, exemptions or offsets which may be available from to
time to time to any Lender under Regulation D. Statutory Reserves, assessments
and other costs shall be adjusted automatically on and as of the effective date
of any change in any reserve percentage, assessment rate or other imposed cost.

ARTICLE III
 LETTERS OF CREDIT

 3.01. Obligation to Issue. Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, from time to time during the period commencing on
the Effective Date and ending on the Business Day which is twenty (20) Business
Days prior to the Termination Date, Borrower may request any Issuing Bank, and
upon such request such Issuing Bank hereby agrees, to issue for the account of
Borrower, or for the account of any Subsidiary of Borrower if Borrower is named
as a co-applicant with respect to such Letter of Credit, one or more Letters of
Credit; provided, however, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue any
Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to the Letter of Credit requested,
such Issuing Bank's Letter of Credit Obligations would exceed the maximum
Letter of Credit Obligations indicated for such Issuing Bank on Schedule A
attached hereto.

 3.02. Types and Amounts. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 3.01, no Issuing Bank shall have any obligation to issue any Letter of
Credit at any time:

 (a) if the aggregate maximum amount then available for drawing
 under Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, after giving effect
 to the Letter of Credit requested hereunder, shall exceed any limit
 imposed by law or regulation upon such Issuing Bank;

 (b) if, after giving effect to such requested Letter of Credit,
 (i) Loan Usage exceeds the Commitments or (ii) the aggregate outstanding
 Letter of Credit Obligations would exceed 150,000,000; and any Letter
 of Credit issued by any Issuing Bank in excess of any such amounts shall
 not, to the extent of the excess, constitute a Letter of Credit
 hereunder; or

 (c) which has an expiration date which is (i) more than (1) one
 year after the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit (provided that
 a Standby Letter of Credit may provide for an annual renewal if such
 renewal is consented to by the

-43-
 51
 Issuing Bank and the conditions precedent to the issuance of such
 Standby Letter of Credit are met at the time of such renewal) or (ii)
 after three (3) Business Days immediately preceding the Termination Date
 or, if the Issuing Bank is a Dissenting Lender, such Dissenting Lender's
 Term, and any letter of credit issued by an Issuing Bank with an
 expiration date after three (3) Business Days immediately preceding the
 Termination Date or such Dissenting Lender's Term, as applicable, shall
 not constitute a Letter of Credit hereunder and the deemed purchase of
 participations pursuant to Section 3.06 shall not occur with respect to
 such letter of credit.

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary letters of
 credit issued under the Original Credit Agreement which constituted
 "Letters of Credit" under the Original Credit Agreement and which remain
 outstanding on the Effective Date, shall constitute Letters of Credit
 under this Agreement.

 3.03. Conditions. In addition to being subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent contained in Sections 4.01 and 4.02,
the obligation of any Issuing Bank to issue any Letter of Credit is subject to
the satisfaction in full of the following conditions:

 (a) Borrower shall have delivered to such Issuing Bank, at such
times and in such manner as such Issuing Bank may prescribe, a Letter of Credit
Application and a Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement and such other
documents and materials as may be required pursuant to the terms thereof and
the terms of the proposed Letter of Credit shall be reasonably satisfactory to
such Issuing Bank and shall be consistent with such Issuing Bank's ordinary
practice with respect to terms of its letters of credit; and

 (b) as of the date of issuance, no order, judgment or decree of
any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority shall purport by its terms to
enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit and no
law, rule or regulation applicable to such Issuing Bank and no request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law and whether or not the
failure to comply therewith would be unlawful) from any Governmental Authority
with jurisdiction over such Issuing Bank shall prohibit or request such Issuing
Bank to refrain from the issuance of letters of credit generally or the
issuance of that Letter of Credit.

 3.04. Issuance of Letters of Credit.

 (a) Borrower shall give the applicable Issuing Bank and each
Lender written notice (with a copy to the Agent) not later than 12:00 noon (New
York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately preceding the
requested issuance of a Letter of Credit under this Agreement, which notice as
provided to the Agent shall be accompanied by a Notice of Borrowing as required
pursuant to Section 4.02. Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify
(i) the stated amount of the Letter of Credit requested, (ii) the effective
date (which day shall be a Business Day) of issuance of such requested Letter
of Credit, (iii) whether such Letter of Credit is a Commercial Letter of Credit
or a Standby Letter of Credit, (iv) the date on which such requested Letter of
Credit is to expire, which date shall be a Business Day, (v) the Person for
whose benefit the requested Letter of Credit is to be issued, (vi) the amount
of Letter of Credit Obligations then outstanding, (vii) if such Letter of
Credit is also for the account of any

-44-
 52
Subsidiary of Borrower, the name of such Subsidiary, (viii) the Issuing Bank
being requested to issue such Letter of Credit and (ix) any other terms to be
included in such Letter of Credit. Prior to issuing any Letter of Credit, the
applicable Issuing Bank shall request and the Agent shall provide confirmation
that the request for such Letter of Credit complies with the provisions of
Section 3.02(b). If the Agent notifies the applicable Issuing Bank that it is
authorized to issue such Letter of Credit, and the conditions described in
Sections 3.02, 3.03, 4.01 (if issued on the Effective Date) and 4.02 otherwise
have been satisfied, then such Issuing Bank shall issue such Letter of Credit
as requested. The applicable Issuing Bank shall give the Agent and each Lender
prompt notice of the issuance of any such Letter of Credit by it.

 (b) No Letter of Credit may be amended, extended, modified or
supplemented unless Borrower shall have complied with the requirements of
Section 3.04(a) to the same extent as if such Letter of Credit, as so amended,
extended, renewed, modified or supplemented, were requested to be reissued
hereunder. No Issuing Bank may amend, extend, renew, modify or supplement any
Letter of Credit if the issuance of a new Letter of Credit having the same
terms as such Letter of Credit as so amended, extended, modified or
supplemented would be prohibited by Section 3.02. Each Issuing Bank shall
provide the Agent and each Lender with a copy of each amendment, extension,
renewal, modification or supplement to any Letter of Credit.

 3.05. Reimbursement Obligations; Duties of the Issuing Banks.

 (a) Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in any Letter of
Credit Reimbursement Agreement or Letter of Credit Application:

 (i) Borrower shall reimburse (or cause the Subsidiary which is
 a co-applicant with respect thereto to reimburse) the applicable Issuing
 Bank (by paying the Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank) for
 drawings under a Letter of Credit issued by it no later than the earlier
 of (a) the time specified in such Letter of Credit Reimbursement
 Agreement or Letter of Credit Application, and (b) one (1) Business Day
 after the payment by such Issuing Bank; and

 (ii) any Reimbursement Obligation with respect to any Letter of
 Credit shall bear interest from the date of the relevant drawing under
 the pertinent Letter of Credit at the interest rate then applicable to
 Base Rate Loans until the first (1st) Business Day after such date on
 which the applicable Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit
 gives notice of such drawing to Borrower and thereafter at the Default
 Rate.

 (b) No action taken or omitted to be taken by any Issuing Bank under or
in connection with any Letter of Credit shall put an Issuing Bank under any
resulting liability to any Lender (except for its gross negligence or willful
misconduct in connection therewith, as determined by the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction) or, subject to Sections 3.02 and 3.03, relieve
that Lender of its obligations hereunder to the Issuing Banks. In the event
this Agreement and any Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement or any Letter
of Credit Application are inconsistent, the terms of this Agreement shall
prevail. In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing
Bank shall have no obligation to the Lenders other

-45-
 53
than to confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter
of Credit appear to have been delivered and that they appear on their face to
comply with the requirements of such Letter of Credit.

 3.06. Participations.

 (a) Immediately upon issuance by any Issuing Bank of any Letter
of Credit for the account of Borrower in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Article III, each Lender irrevocably and unconditionally agrees
that it shall be deemed to have purchased and received from the applicable
Issuing Bank, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest in the amount
of such Lender's Pro Rata Share in such Letter of Credit (other than the fees
earned with respect to such Letter of Credit pursuant to 3.08(b)) and any
security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto; provided, however, that a
letter of credit issued by any Issuing Bank shall not be deemed to be a Letter
of Credit for purposes of this Section 3.06(a) if the Issuing Bank shall not
have received the confirmation from the Agent provided for in Section 3.04(a)
or shall have received written notice from the Agent or any Lender on or before
the Business Day immediately prior to the date of the Issuing Bank's issuance
of such letter of credit that one or more conditions of this Article III is not
satisfied and, in the event any Issuing Bank receives such a notice, it shall
have no further obligation to issue any Letter of Credit until such notice is
subsequently withdrawn or it receives notice from the Agent that such
conditions have been waived in writing by the Requisite Lenders or otherwise
have been satisfied.

 (b) If any Issuing Bank makes any payment under any Letter of
Credit and Borrower (or the Subsidiary which is a co-applicant with respect
thereto) does not repay such amount to such Issuing Bank pursuant to Section
3.05(a), 3.07 or 3.09, such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Agent of
such failure and the Agent shall, in turn, promptly notify each Lender of such
failure, and each Lender shall promptly and unconditionally pay to the Agent
for the account of such Issuing Bank the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share
of such payment, in Dollars and in immediately available funds, and the Agent
shall promptly pay such amount, and any other amounts received by the Agent for
such Issuing Bank's account pursuant to this Section 3.06(b), to such Issuing
Bank. If the Agent so notifies any such Lender prior to 12:00 noon (New York
City time) on any Business Day of such failure, such Lender shall make
available to the Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank its Pro
Rata Share of the amount of such payment on such Business Day in Dollars and in
immediately available funds, and otherwise on the next succeeding Business Day.
If and to the extent such Lender shall not have so made its Pro Rata Share of
the amount of such payment available to the Agent for the account of the
applicable Issuing Bank, such Lender agrees to pay to the Agent for the account
of the applicable Issuing Bank forthwith on demand such amount together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such payment was first due until
the date such amount is paid to the Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank,
at the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as such term is defined in the definition
of Alternate Base Rate) for three (3) Business Days and then at the Alternate
Base Rate. The failure of any Lender to make available to the Agent for the
account of the applicable Issuing Bank its Pro Rata Share of any such payment
shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make
available to the Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank its Pro
Rata Share of any payment on the date such payment is to be made.

-46-
 54
 (c) Whenever any Issuing Bank receives a payment on account of
a Reimbursement Obligation, including any interest thereon, as to which the
Agent has previously received payments from the Lenders for such account of the
Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 3.06, it shall promptly pay to the Agent
and the Agent shall promptly pay to each Lender which has funded its
participating interest therein, in Dollars, an amount equal to such Lender's
Pro Rata Share thereof. Each such payment shall be made by the applicable
Issuing Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, on the Business Day on which
such Person receives the funds paid to such Person pursuant to the preceding
sentence, if received prior to 12:00 noon (New York City time) on such Business
Day, and otherwise on the next succeeding Business Day together with interest
thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as such term is defined in the
definition of Alternate Base Rate) unless the applicable Issuing Bank certifies
that it received such amount later than it could be invested overnight.

 (d) Promptly upon the request of any Lender, any Issuing Bank
shall furnish to such Lender copies of any documentation with respect to the
Letters of Credit issued by it as may reasonably be requested by such Lender.

 (e) The obligations of a Lender to make payments to the Agent
for the account of the Issuing Banks with respect to a Letter of Credit issued
on behalf of the Borrower or the Borrower and one of its Subsidiaries shall be
irrevocable, shall not be subject to any qualification or exception whatsoever,
and shall be honored in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement under all circumstances (subject to Section 3.02), including, without
limitation, (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents; (ii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense
or other right which Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may have at any time
against a beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit or any transferee of any
Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting),
the Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Lender, or any other Person, whether in
connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions
contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying
transactions between Borrower and the beneficiary named in any Letter of
Credit); (iii) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under any
Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in
any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect
(in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection
therewith, as determined by the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction, on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank); (iv) the surrender
or impairment of any security for the performance or observance of any of the
terms of any of the Loan Documents; (v) any failure by the Agent or any Issuing
Bank to make any reports required pursuant to Section 3.10; or (vi) the
occurrence of any Event of Default or Potential Event of Default.

 3.07. Payment of Reimbursement Obligations.

 (a) Borrower agrees to pay (or cause its Subsidiary which is a
co-applicant with respect thereto to pay) to the Issuing Banks the amount of
all Reimbursement Obligations, interest and other amounts payable to the
Issuing Banks under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued on behalf
of Borrower immediately when due, irrespective of any and all events,
including, without limitation, (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents; (ii) the existence of any
claim, set-off, defense or other

-47-
 55
right which Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may have at any time against a
beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit or any transferee of any Letter of
Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Agent,
any Issuing Bank, any Lender, or any other Person, whether in connection with
this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or
any unrelated transactions (including any underlying transactions between
Borrower and the beneficiary named in any Letter of Credit); (iii) any draft,
certificate or any other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving
to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any
statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect (in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection therewith, as determined
by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, on the part of the
applicable Issuing Bank); (iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for
the performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Loan Documents;
(v) any failure by the Agent or any Issuing Bank to make any reports required
pursuant to Section 3.10; or (vi) the occurrence of any Event of Default or
Potential Event of Default.

 (b) In the event any payment by Borrower (or by any of its
Subsidiaries which is a co-applicant with respect thereto) received by any
Issuing Bank with respect to any Letter of Credit and distributed by the Agent
to the Lenders on account of their participations is thereafter set aside,
avoided or recovered from the applicable Issuing Bank in connection with any
receivership, liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, each Lender
which received such distribution shall, upon demand by such Issuing Bank,
contribute such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the amount set aside, avoided or
recovered together with interest at the rate required to be paid by such
Issuing Bank upon the amount required to be repaid by it.

 3.08. Compensation for Letters of Credit.

 (a) Lenders' Letter of Credit Fees. Borrower shall pay, with
respect to each Letter of Credit, a Letter of Credit fee equal to the
Applicable Letter of Credit Fee in effect from time to time (computed based
upon actual days elapsed in a 365/366-day year) of the maximum amount available
to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Such fee shall be paid to the Agent,
for the account of the Lenders in proportion to their respective Pro Rata
Shares, in arrears, on a calendar quarterly basis, on the last calendar day of
each March, June, September and December occurring after the Effective Date.
Each of the Issuing Banks shall provide the Borrower and the Agent on or before
the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December occurring
after the Effective Date a statement calculating the Letter of Credit fees
payable under this Section 3.08(a) for the quarter then ending with respect to
Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank.

 (b) Issuing Bank Fees. In addition to the fees under clause
(a) above, Borrower shall pay to each Issuing Bank, (i) with respect to each
Commercial Letter of Credit payable at such time as is agreed to between the
Borrower and the applicable Issuing Bank, the customary charges of the
applicable Issuing Bank with respect thereto for commercial letters of credit
of similar type and for similar credit risks, (ii) with respect to each Standby
Letter of Credit, such fronting fee as shall have been agreed to (both with
respect to amount and timing) between the applicable Issuing Bank and the
Borrower and (iii) with respect to all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing
Bank, on demand, such Issuing Bank's customary administration fees charged in
connection with its issuance, administration, transfer or amendment of or
drawing under any

-48-
 56
Letter of Credit. Such fees shall be paid directly to and shall be solely for
the account of the applicable Issuing Bank.

 3.09. Indemnification; Exoneration. (a) In addition to
amounts payable as elsewhere provided in this Article III, Borrower hereby
agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save harmless the Agent, the Issuing
Banks and each Lender from and against any and all Liabilities and Costs which
the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may incur or be subject to as a
consequence, direct or indirect, of (i) the issuance of any Letter of Credit
other than, in the case of any Issuing Bank, as a result of its gross
negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction or (ii) the failure of any Issuing Bank to
honor a drawing under such Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission,
whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto
Governmental Authority (all such acts or omissions herein called "Governmental
Acts").

 (b) As among Borrower, the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the
Agent, Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of
such Letter of Credit by, the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, subject to the provisions
of the Letter of Credit Applications and Letter of Credit Reimbursement
Agreements, the Issuing Banks, the Agent and the Lenders shall not be
responsible (in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct in
connection therewith, as determined by the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction): (i) for the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy,
genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in
connection with the application for and issuance of the Letters of Credit, even
if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient,
inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) for the validity or sufficiency of any
instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a
Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in
whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason;
(iii) for failure of the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit to comply duly with
conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) for
errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any
messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex, or other similar form of
teletransmission or otherwise; (v) for errors in interpretation of technical
terms; (vi) for any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any
document required in order to make a drawing under any Letter of Credit or of
the proceeds thereof; (vii) for the misapplication by the beneficiary of a
Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit;
and (viii) for any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the
Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders including, without limitation, any
Governmental Acts. None of the above shall affect, impair, or prevent the
vesting of any of the Issuing Banks' rights or powers under this Section 3.09.

 (c) In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the
specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted by any
Issuing Bank under or in connection with Letters of Credit issued on behalf of
the Borrower or the Borrower and one of its Subsidiaries or any related
certificates shall not, in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct, as determined by the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction, put such Issuing Bank, the Agent or any Lender under any
resulting liability to Borrower or relieve Borrower of any of its obligations
hereunder to any such Person.

-49-
 57
 (d) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of Borrower contained in
this Section 3.09 shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest
hereunder, the termination of the Letters of Credit and the termination of this
Agreement.

 3.10 Reporting By Issuing Banks. On or before the thirtieth
(30th) day following the end of each calendar month ending after the Effective
Date, each of the Issuing Banks shall provide the Agent and each Lender with a
written report describing, as of the end of such month, the then aggregate
outstanding face amount of each Letter of Credit issued by it, whether such
Letter of Credit is a Standby Letter of Credit or Commercial Letter of Credit,
the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, the name of any Subsidiary of
Borrower which is a co-applicant with respect to any such Letter of Credit and
any other additional information with respect thereto which the Agent or any
Lender reasonably requests. Together with each monthly report, each of the
Issuing Banks shall provide the Agent and each Lender with a copy of each
Letter of Credit issued by it during the immediately preceding month and each
Letter of Credit Application and/or Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement
executed in connection therewith.

 expressly speak only as of a different date) shall be true and complete
 in all respects on and as of such Funding Date or issuance date, as
 though made on and as of such date both before and after taking into
 account the requested Loans to be made and Letters of Credit to be
 issued;

 (ii) No Default. No Event of Default or Potential Event of
 Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result from the
 making of the requested Loan or the issuance of the requested Letter of
 Credit; and

 (iii) No Injunction. No law or regulation shall have been
 adopted, no order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority
 shall have been issued, and no litigation shall be pending or threatened
 (other than as a result of any condition described in Section 2.08(d),
 2.09 or 2.10), which in the reasonable judgment of the Requisite
 Lenders, would enjoin, prohibit or restrain any Lender from making the
 requested Loan or the applicable Issuing Bank from issuing the requested
 Letter of Credit or as a result of making any such Loan or issuing such
 Letter of Credit impose or result in the imposition of any material
 adverse condition upon any Lender or any Issuing Bank.

-52-

 (iv) No Material Adverse Change. No event shall have occurred
 after December 31, 1992 which, in the reasonable judgment of the
 Requisite Lenders, has had or could have a Material Adverse Effect, it
 being expressly understood and agreed that neither the ANTEC
 Restructuring nor the termination of the Anixter Cincinnati joint
 venture is a change which the Requisite Lenders have determined has had

 The request by Borrower for any Loan made, or to be made, or any
Letter of Credit issued, or to be issued, on any Funding Date shall constitute
a representation and warranty by Borrower as of such Funding Date that all the
conditions contained in this Section 4.02 have been satisfied or waived in
writing pursuant to Section 12.08.

ARTICLE V
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 5.01. Representations. To induce each Lender, each Issuing
Bank and the Agent to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans and to
issue or participate in the Letters of Credit, Borrower hereby represents and
warrants to each Lender, each Issuing Bank and the Agent that the following
statements are true and correct:

 (a) Organization; Corporate Powers. Borrower and each
Subsidiary of Borrower (i) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization,
(ii) is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real

except those jurisdictions where the failure to be in good standing or to so
qualify has not had or will not have a Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) has
all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and encumber its
property and assets and to conduct its business as presently conducted and as
proposed to be conducted in connection with and following the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

 (b) Authority. (i) Borrower and each Subsidiary of Borrower
party to any of the Transaction Documents, has the requisite corporate power
and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each of the
Transaction Documents executed by it, or to be executed by it.

 (ii) The execution, delivery and performance (or filing
or recording, as the case may be) of each of the Transaction Documents to which
it is party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Borrower
and each Subsidiary of Borrower party thereto and no other

-53-
 61
corporate proceedings on the part of any such Person are necessary to
consummate such transactions.

 (iii) Each of the Transaction Documents to which it is
a party has been duly executed and delivered (or filed or recorded, as the case
may be) by Borrower and each Subsidiary of Borrower party thereto and
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
equitable principles), is in full force and effect (unless terminated in
accordance with the terms thereof) and no term or condition thereof has been
amended, modified or waived from the terms and conditions contained therein
without the prior written consent of the Agent and the Requisite Lenders or,
where so required, all of the Lenders, and Borrower and each Subsidiary of
Borrower party thereto and, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, the other
parties thereto have performed and complied in all material respects with all
the material terms, provisions, agreements and conditions set forth therein and
required to be performed or complied with by such parties on or before the
effective date thereof, and no default by any such party exists thereunder.

property.

 (d) No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance of
each Transaction Document to which it is a party by Borrower and each
Subsidiary of Borrower party thereto and each of the transactions contemplated

such Person, any liability resulting from which would have or be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) conflict with or violate
such Person's certificate or articles of incorporation or by-laws or similar
charter and constituting documents, or (iii) except as set forth on Schedule

8.02(b)), or (v) require any approval of stockholders of any such Person,
unless such approval has been obtained.

 (e) Governmental Consents. The execution, delivery and
performance of each Transaction Document to which it is a party, by Borrower
and each Subsidiary of Borrower party thereto and the transactions contemplated
thereby do not and will not require any registration with, consent or approval
of, or notice to, or other action with or by, any Governmental Authority,
except filings, consents or notices which have been made, obtained or given.

-54-
 62
 (f) Governmental Regulation. Neither Borrower nor any of
Borrowers' Subsidiaries is subject to regulation under the Public Utility
Holdings Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, the Interstate Commerce
Act, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or any other statute or regulation of
any Governmental Authority such that its ability to incur indebtedness is
limited or its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or by
the other Transaction Documents is materially impaired.

 (g) Financial Position. (i) As of the Effective Date, all
quarterly and annual financial statements of Borrower or of Borrower and any of
its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures delivered to the Agent were prepared in
conformity with GAAP (except as otherwise noted therein) and fairly present the
financial position of Borrower or the consolidated financial position of
Borrower and such Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures, as the case may be, as at
the respective dates thereof and the results of operations and changes in cash
flows for each of the periods covered thereby, subject, in the case of any
unaudited interim financial statements, to changes resulting from audit and
normal year- end adjustments.

 (ii) All monthly, quarterly and annual financial
statements of Borrower or of Borrower and any of its Subsidiaries and Joint
Ventures delivered to the Agent after the Effective Date were prepared in
conformity with GAAP (except as otherwise noted therein) and fairly present the
financial position of Borrower or the consolidated financial position of
Borrower and such Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures, as the case may be, as at
the respective dates thereof and the results of operations and changes in cash
flows for each of the periods covered thereby, subject, in the case of any
unaudited interim financial statements, to changes resulting from audit and
normal year-end adjustments. Except as contemplated in the Transaction
Documents, none of Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any Joint Venture has
any material obligations, contingent liabilities or liabilities for taxes, long
term leases or material or unusual forward or long term commitments which are
not reflected in such financial statements and the notes thereto.

 (h) Pro Forma Financials and Projections. As of the date of
this Agreement, the pro forma financial statements of the Borrower, its
Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures dated February 8, 1994 set forth in that
certain Confidential Information Memorandum furnished by the Agent and Chemical
Securities, Inc. on behalf of the Borrower to the Lenders (the "Bank Book")
fairly present the financial condition of the Borrower, its Subsidiaries and
the Joint Ventures and the results of operations and changes in cash flows for
the periods covered thereby (subject to normal year-end adjustments). As of
the date of such pro forma financial statements, none of Borrower, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Joint Venture has any material obligations, contingent
liabilities or liabilities for taxes, long-term leases or material or unusual
forward or long-term commitments which are not reflected in such pro forma
financial statements or the notes thereto. As of the date of this Agreement
the projections concerning the Borrower, its Subsidiaries and the Joint
Ventures dated February 8, 1994 set forth in the Bank Book accurately represent
the good faith projections of Borrower of each such Person's projected
financial performance and are based upon reasonable assumptions.

 (i) Capitalization.

-55-
 63
 (i) As of the Effective Date, Schedule 5.01(i) sets forth the
number of shares and the relevant percentages of capital stock held by each
shareholder of the Borrower.

 (ii) There are outstanding no shares of any class of capital
stock (or any securities, instruments, warrants, option or purchase rights,
conversion or exchange rights, calls, commitments or claims of any character
convertible into or exercisable for capital stock) of:

 (A) Borrower other than capital stock described on Schedule
 5.01(i);

 (B) any Domestic Subsidiary other than the capital stock held
 directly or indirectly by Borrower all of which has been pledged to the
 Agent for the benefit of itself and the Holders of Secured Obligations
 pursuant to Pledge Agreements; and

 (C) any other Subsidiary of Borrower other than (i) the capital
 stock held by Borrower and/or Itel, provided that (x) capital stock
 representing at least 51 in the aggregate of each class of capital
 stock of such Subsidiary shall be owned by Borrower and (y) any such
 capital stock held by Itel shall have been obtained in exchange for cash
 proceeds or by debt conversion equal to the fair market value of such
 capital stock and (ii) capital stock representing not greater than 20 
 in the aggregate of any class of capital stock held by other Persons;
 provided however, if such other Subsidiary is a Supported Foreign
 Subsidiary and the Release Event shall not have occurred then the
 capital stock held directly or indirectly by Borrower shall be pledged
 to the Agent for the benefit of itself and the Holders of the Secured
 Obligations pursuant to a Foreign Subsidiary Pledge provided such pledge
 shall not be for capital stock representing not greater than 65 of the
 total combined voting power of all classes of such Foreign Subsidiary.

None of such capital stock is subject to any security, instrument, warrant,
option or purchase rights, agreement, conversion or exchange rights, call,
commitment or claim of any right, title or interest therein or thereto other
than pursuant to the Pledge Agreements and the Borrower Distribution Stock
Plan. The outstanding capital stock of Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries
is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

 (iii) The subordination provisions of the Subordination
Agreement are enforceable against the holders of the Permitted Subordinated
Indebtedness and the Obligations are within the definition of "Senior
Obligations" included in the Subordination Agreement.

 (j) Litigation; Adverse Effects. (i) Except as set forth in
Schedule 5.01(j), there is no action, suit, proceeding, investigation of any
Governmental Authority or arbitration, at law or in equity, or before or by any
Governmental Authority, pending, or, to the best knowledge of Borrower,
threatened against Borrower, any Subsidiary of Borrower or any Joint Venture or
any Property of any of them, which if adversely determined would be reasonably
expected to result in any Material Adverse Effect.

 (ii) Neither Borrower, any Subsidiary of Borrower nor
any Joint Venture is (A) in violation of any applicable law which violation has
or might reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (B)
subject to or in default with respect to any final judgment, writ, injunction,
decree, order, rule or regulation of any court or Governmental

-56-
 64
Authority which has or might have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set
forth in Schedule 5.01(j), there is no action, suit, proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Borrower, threatened against or
affecting Borrower, any Subsidiary of Borrower or any Joint Venture (i) which
challenges the validity or the enforceability of any of the Transaction
Documents or (ii) which will or would reasonably be expected to result in (a)
any liability individually in the amount of greater than 2,000,000 (net of
applicable third-party insurance coverage other than retro-premium insurance),
(b) any liability in the aggregate in the amount of greater than 2,000,000
(net of applicable third-party insurance coverage other than retro-premium
insurance) or (c) which involves a claim under the Racketeering Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act or any similar federal or state statute where such
Person is a defendant in a criminal indictment that provides for the forfeiture
of assets to any Governmental Authority as a potential criminal penalty.

 (k) No Material Adverse Change. With respect to Borrower or
Borrower and its Joint Ventures and Subsidiaries taken as a whole, there has
occurred no event since December 31, 1992 which has or could have a Material
Adverse Effect, it being expressly understood and agreed that neither the ANTEC
Restructuring nor the termination of the Anixter Cincinnati joint venture shall
be considered to be such an event.

 (l) Payment of Taxes. All tax returns and reports of each of
Borrower and Borrower's Subsidiaries required to be filed (including
extensions), have been timely filed, and all taxes, assessments, fees and other
charges of Governmental Authorities thereupon and upon their respective
properties, assets, income and franchises which are shown on such returns as
being due and payable, have been paid when due and payable, except (i) taxes
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and that are reserved
against in accordance with GAAP, (ii) taxes which are not yet delinquent, (iii)
taxes which are payable in installments so long as paid before any penalty
accrues with respect thereto and (iv) other taxes, assessments, fees and other
charges of Governmental Authorities which do not exceed 250,000 in the
aggregate. On the Effective Date, except as set forth in clause (iv) above or
on Schedule 5.01(l), and after the Effective Date, except as set forth in
clauses (i) through (iv) above or on Schedule 5.01(l), Borrower has no
knowledge of any proposed tax assessment against Borrower or any of Borrower's
Subsidiaries. All tax assessments referred to in Schedule 5.01(l) are being
contested in good faith by Borrower or such Subsidiary or a settlement with
respect to any such assessment is being negotiated in good faith by such Person
and appropriate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP.

 (m) Material Adverse Agreements. Neither Borrower, any of
Borrower's Subsidiaries nor any Joint Venture is a party to or subject to any
Contractual Obligation or other restriction contained in its charter or by-laws
which has or would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
after giving effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the
Transaction Documents or otherwise.

 (n) Performance. Neither Borrower, any of Borrower's
Subsidiaries nor any Joint Venture is in default in the performance, observance
or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in
any Contractual Obligation applicable to it under any agreement or instrument
the absence or termination of which Contractual Obligations could have a
Material Adverse Effect, and no condition exists which, with the giving of
notice or the lapse

-57-
 65
of time, or both, would constitute a default under such Contractual Obligation,
except where the consequences, direct or indirect, of such default or defaults,
if any, would not have or are not reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 (o) Securities Activities. Neither Borrower nor any of
Borrower's Subsidiaries is engaged in the business of extending credit for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock and none will use the
proceeds of any Loan to purchase or carry Margin Stock.

 (p) Disclosure. Subject to changes in facts or conditions
which are required or permitted under this Agreement, the representations and
warranties of Borrower and each Subsidiary of Borrower contained in the
Transaction Documents, and all certificates and other documents delivered to
the Agent in connection therewith, taken as a whole do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements contained herein or therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 (q) Requirements of Law. Borrower, each of its Subsidiaries
and each Joint Venture is in compliance with all Requirements of Law
(including, without limitation, the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange
Act, the applicable rules and regulations thereunder, and state securities
laws) applicable to it and its business, where the failure to so comply would
have or would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 (r) Patents, Trademarks, Permits, Etc. Borrower and each of
its Subsidiaries owns, is licensed or otherwise has the lawful right to use, or
has all permits and other approvals of Governmental Authorities, patents,
trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, technology, know-how and
processes used in or necessary for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted which are material to its financial condition, business, operations,
assets and prospects, individually or taken as a whole. The use of such
permits and other approvals of Governmental Authorities, patents, trademarks,
service marks, trade names, copyrights, technology, know-how and processes by
Borrower or any such Subsidiary does not infringe on the rights of any Person,
subject to such claims and infringements the existence of which do not have or
are not reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents will
not impair the ownership of or rights under (or the license or other right to
use, as the case may be) any permits and governmental approvals, patents,
trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, technology, know-how or
processes by Borrower or any such Subsidiary in any manner which has or might
have a Material Adverse Effect.

 (s) Environmental Matters. Except as disclosed in Schedule
5.01(s) and except to the extent that a failure of any of the following
representations to be true would not be reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect or subject the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to a
material liability to pay money, (i) each of the operations of Borrower, its
Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures comply in all respects with all applicable
environmental, health and safety Requirements of Law; (ii) each of Borrower,
its Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures has obtained all environmental, health
and safety Permits necessary for its operations, all such Permits are in good
standing and each of Borrower, its Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures is in
compliance with all terms and conditions of such Permits; (iii) (A) none of

-58-
 66
Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any Joint Venture, any of their present
Property or operations and (B) none of the Borrower's, its Subsidiaries or any
Joint Venture's previously owned Property or past operations is subject to any
order from or agreement with any Governmental Authority or private party or any
judicial or administrative proceeding or investigations respecting any
environmental, health or safety Requirements of Law or is the subject of any
investigation by any Governmental Authority evaluating the need for Remedial
Action to respond to a material Release or threatened Release of a Contaminant
into the environment, or is subject to any Remedial Action or other Liabilities
and Costs arising from the Release or threatened Release of a Contaminant into
the environment; (iv) none of the operations of Borrower, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Joint Venture is subject to any judicial or administrative
proceeding alleging a violation of any environmental, health or safety
Requirement of Law; (v) none of the present or past operations of Borrower, any
of its Subsidiaries or of any Joint Venture is the subject of any investigation
by any Governmental Authority evaluating whether any Remedial Action is needed
to respond to a Release or threatened Release of a Contaminant into the
environment; (vi) no past or present property of Borrower, any of its
Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures is now or has ever been a storage, treatment or
disposal facility for hazardous waste, as those terms are defined under 40 CFR
Part 261 or any state equivalent; (vii) neither Borrower, any of its
Subsidiaries nor any Joint Venture has filed any notice under any applicable
Requirement of Law reporting a Release of a Contaminant into the environment;
(viii) there is not now, nor has there ever been, on or in the Property of
Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any Joint Venture: (A) any underground
storage tanks or surface impoundments or (B) any polychlorinated biphenyls used
in hydraulic oils, electrical transformers or other equipment; (ix) neither
Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries nor any Joint Venture has received any notice
or claim to the effect that it is or might be liable to any Person as a result
of the Release or threatened Release of a Contaminant into the environment, or
as a result of exposure to asbestos or to any other hazardous substance, which
might result in liability in excess of workers compensation; (x) no
Environmental Lien has attached to any Property of Borrower, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Joint Venture; (xi) between March, 1991 and November, 1991,
Borrower inspected its Property, the Property of its Subsidiaries and the
Property of its Joint Ventures and all asbestos containing material, if any,
which was on or part of such Property (excluding any raw materials which are
used in the manufacture of products or products themselves) was in good repair
according to the then current standards and practices governing such material,
and its presence or condition does not violate any currently applicable or
proposed Requirement of Law; and (xii) to the best of the Borrower's knowledge,
none of the products which Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the
Joint Ventures manufactures, distributes or sells, or ever has manufactured,
distributed or sold, contains asbestos material.

 (t) Employee Benefit Matters.

 (i) ERISA. Neither Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains
or contributes to any Plan other than those listed on Schedule 5.01(t). Each
Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC as
currently in effect has been determined by the IRS to be so qualified, and each
trust related to any such Plan has been determined to be exempt from Federal
income tax under Section 501(a) of the IRC as currently in effect. Except as
disclosed in Schedule 5.01(t), neither Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate
maintains or contributes to any employee welfare benefit plan within the
meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA which provides benefits to employees after
termination of employment other than as required by

-59-
 67
Section 601 of ERISA. The Borrower and all of its ERISA Affiliates are in
compliance in all material respects with all of the responsibilities,
obligations or duties imposed on them by ERISA or regulations promulgated
thereunder with respect to all Plans. No Benefit Plan has incurred any
accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in Sections 302(a)(2) of ERISA and
412(a) of the IRC) whether or not waived. Neither Borrower nor any ERISA
Affiliate nor any fiduciary of any Plan which is not a Multiemployer Plan (i)
has engaged in a nonexempt prohibited transaction described in Section 406 of
ERISA or 4975 of the IRC or (ii) has taken or failed to take any action which
would constitute or result in a Termination Event that could subject either the
Borrower or an ERISA Affiliate to a material liability to pay money. Except as
disclosed on Schedule 5.01(t), neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has
any potential liability under Section 4063, 4064, 4069, 4204 or 4212(c) of
ERISA. Neither Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability to
the PBGC which remains outstanding other than the payment of premiums, and
there are no premium payments which have become due which are unpaid. Schedule
B to the most recent annual report filed with the IRS with respect to each
Benefit Plan and furnished to the Agent is complete and accurate. Since the
date of each such Schedule B, there has been no material adverse change in the
funding status or financial condition of the Benefit Plan relating to such
Schedule B. Neither Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has (i) failed to make a
required contribution or payment to a Multiemployer Plan or (ii) made a
complete or partial withdrawal under Section 4203 or 4205 of ERISA from a
Multiemployer Plan. Neither Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has failed to
make a required installment or any other required payment under Section 412 of
the IRC on or before the due date for such installment or other payment.
Neither Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate is required to provide security to a
Benefit Plan under Section 401(a)(29) of the IRC due to a Plan amendment that
results in an increase in current liability for the plan year. Neither the
Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has by reason of the transactions contemplated
hereby any obligation to make any payment to any employee pursuant to any Plan
or existing contract or arrangement.

 (ii) Foreign Employee Benefit Matters. Each Foreign Employee
Benefit Plan is in compliance in all material respects with all laws,
regulations and rules applicable thereto and the respective requirements of the
governing documents for such Foreign Employee Benefit Plan. The aggregate of
the liabilities to provide all of the accrued benefits under each Foreign
Pension Plan does not exceed the current fair market value of the assets held
in the trust or other funding vehicle for each such Foreign Pension Plan. With
respect to any Foreign Employee Benefit Plan maintained by Borrower, any of its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate which is not a Foreign Pension Plan,
reasonable reserves have been established in accordance with prudent business
practice or where required by ordinary accounting practices in the jurisdiction
in which such a plan is maintained. The aggregate unfunded liabilities with
respect to such Foreign Employee Benefit Plans, after giving effect to any
reserves for such liabilities, will not result in a material liability. There
are no actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits)
pending or threatened against the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any
ERISA Affiliate with respect to any Foreign Employee Benefit Plan.

 (u) Solvency. The Borrower, individually, and the Borrower,
its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures, considered as one enterprise, is Solvent
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents and the payment and accrual of all Transaction
Costs with respect to any of the foregoing.

-60-
 68
 (v) Assets and Properties. Each of Borrower and its
Subsidiaries has good title to all of the assets (tangible and intangible)
owned by it, except for imperfections of title (including Liens to the extent
permitted under Section 8.02(b)) which in the aggregate do not have a Material
Adverse Effect; and all such assets are free and clear of all Liens, except as
otherwise specifically permitted by the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents. Substantially all of the assets and properties
owned by, leased to or used by Borrower or any of its Domestic Subsidiaries are
in good repair, working order and condition, excepting ordinary wear and tear,
are free and clear of any known defects except such defects as do not
substantially interfere with the continued use thereof in the conduct of normal
operations.

 (w) Joint Venture; Partnership. Except as set forth in
Schedule 5.01(w), none of Borrower or any Subsidiary of Borrower is engaged in
any joint venture or partnership with any other Person.

 (x) Labor Matters. Except as listed on Schedule 5.01(x), there
are no collective bargaining agreements, other labor agreements or
Multiemployer Plans covering any of the employees of Borrower or any Subsidiary
of Borrower. No attempt to organize the employees of Borrower or any such
Subsidiary, and no labor disputes, strikes or walkouts affecting the operations
of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, is pending, or, to Borrower's
knowledge, threatened, planned or contemplated.

 (y) No Default. No Potential Event of Default or Event of
Default exists.

 (z) Restricted Junior Payments. On or after the Effective
Date, neither Borrower, any Subsidiary of Borrower nor any Joint Venture has

reasonable satisfaction of the Agent that such a secured-loan structure results
in material adverse tax consequences for the Borrower. To the extent that such
a secured loan would be prohibited by the pertinent Foreign Subsidiary's
contractual obligations, the Borrower shall use and shall cause such Foreign
Subsidiary to use its best efforts to obtain waivers of such restrictions or to
agree upon alternative structures reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.

 (c) Change of Subsidiary Status. In connection with the

Foreign Subsidiary, the Borrower may change the status of a

-71-
 79
Supported Foreign Subsidiary to a Foreign Subsidiary which is no longer
considered to be a Supported Foreign Subsidiary provided each of the following
conditions precedent is met in connection therewith:

 (i) the Agent shall have received documentation satisfactory to
 it evidencing the repayment of any loan and return of any Investment,
 other than with respect to Base Credit Support, cancellation or
 expiration of any letter of credit and/or release of any guaranty or
 other Accommodation Obligation, which comprised such Supported Foreign
 Subsidiary's Credit Support;

 (iii) all Letters of Credit with respect to which such Supported
 Foreign Subsidiary is a co-applicant shall have been cancelled or cash
 collateral shall have been provided therefor pursuant to the terms of
 Section 10.02(b);

 (iv) the Agent shall have received a compliance certificate from
 a Financial Officer of the Borrower certifying that no Event of Default
 or Potential Event of Default exists; and

 (v) the Lenders shall have received such other documents,
 instruments or agreements as are reasonably requested by the Agent or
 the Requisite Lenders.

Each Lender and each Issuing Bank consent to the release by the Agent of each
Foreign Subsidiary Guaranty and Foreign Subsidiary Pledge with respect to such
Foreign Subsidiary or its Foreign Holding Company (provided such Foreign
Holding Company does not also hold the capital stock of another Supported
Foreign Subsidiary) in connection with the change of such Foreign's
Subsidiary's status hereunder.

 7.11. Maintenance of Separate Corporate Existence. The
Borrower shall take all reasonable steps (including, without limitation, all
steps which the Agent or any Lender may from time to time reasonably request)
to maintain its identity as a separate legal entity and to make it apparent to
third parties that the Borrower is an entity with assets and liabilities
distinct from those of ANTEC CORPORATION. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Borrower shall:

 (i) to the extent any employee, consultant or agent of Borrower
 is also an employee, consultant or agent of ANTEC CORPORATION, allocate
 the compensation of such employee, consultant or agent between Borrower
 and ANTEC CORPORATION on the basis of actual use of the services so
 rendered to the extent practicable and, to the extent such allocation is
 not practical, on a basis reasonably related to actual use of such
 services;

 (ii) allocate all overhead expenses (including, without
 limitation, telephone and other utility charges) for items shared
 between Borrower and ANTEC CORPORATION on the basis of actual use to the
 extent practicable and, to the extent such allocation is not
 practicable, on a basis reasonably related to actual use; and

-72-
 80
 (iii) not maintain bank accounts or other depository accounts
 to which ANTEC CORPORATION is an account party, into which ANTEC
 CORPORATION makes deposits or from which ANTEC CORPORATION has the power
 to make withdrawals.

of which are hereby expressly waived by Borrower, and the obligation of each
Lender to make any Loan hereunder and of each Issuing Bank to issue any Letter

- 89 -
 97
 (b) Deposit for Letters of Credit. In addition, upon demand by
the Agent, the applicable Issuing Bank or the Requisite Lenders after the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Borrower shall
deposit with the Agent for the benefit of the applicable Issuing Bank with
respect to each Letter of Credit then outstanding which was issued by such
Issuing Bank, cash or Cash Equivalents in an amount equal to the greatest
amount for which such Letter of Credit may be drawn. Such deposit and cash
deposits shall be held by the Agent for the benefit of such Issuing Bank as
cash collateral and security for, and to provide for the payment of, the
Reimbursement Obligations, and may, and will at the request of the applicable
Issuing Bank, be applied by the Agent from time to time in payment of any of
the Reimbursement Obligations then due and payable. Borrower grants to the
Agent, for the benefit of itself and the Holders of Secured Obligations, a
security interest in and right of setoff against any such deposit or deposits.
Pending the application of such deposit to payment of the Reimbursement
Obligations, the Agent may invest such deposit in an open account or similar
immediately available savings deposit and all interest accrued thereon shall be
held with such deposit as additional security for the Reimbursement
Obligations. Such deposits shall be held by the Agent until the Reimbursement
Obligations have been paid in full and all Letters of Credit have expired or
been cancelled.

 (c) Rescission. If at any time after acceleration of the
maturity of the Loans, Borrower shall pay all arrears of interest and all
payments on account of principal of the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations
which shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on
principal and, to the extent permitted by law, on overdue interest, at the
rates specified in this Agreement) and all Events of Default and Potential
Events of Default (other than nonpayment of principal of and accrued interest
on the Loans due and payable solely by virtue of acceleration) shall be
remedied or waived pursuant to Section 12.08, then by written notice to
Borrower, the Requisite Lenders may elect, in the sole discretion of such
Requisite Lenders, to rescind and annul the acceleration and its consequences
and thereupon the Agent shall release any deposit made pursuant to Section
10.02(b); but such action shall not affect any subsequent Event of Default or
Potential Event of Default or impair any right or remedy consequent thereon.
The provisions of the preceding sentence are intended merely to bind the
Lenders to a decision which may be made at the election of the Requisite
Lenders; they are not intended to benefit Borrower and do not give Borrower the
right to require the Lenders to rescind or annul any acceleration hereunder,
even if the conditions set forth herein are met.

the Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers as are set
forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are incidental
thereto. The Agent agrees to act as such on the express conditions contained
in this Article XI.

- 90 -
 98

benefit of the Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, and Borrower shall
have no right to rely on or enforce any of the provisions hereof (other than as
expressly set forth in Section 11.07 or in Section 11.08). In performing its
functions and duties under this Agreement, the Agent shall act solely as agent
of the Issuing Banks and the Holders of Secured Obligations and does not assume
and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or relationship
of agency or trust with or for Borrower or any of its Affiliates.

 11.02. Nature of Duties. The Agent shall not have any duties
or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement or in
the other Loan Documents. The duties of the Agent shall be mechanical and
administrative in nature. The Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement
a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Holder of Secured Obligations or any
Issuing Bank. Nothing in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents,
expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be construed to impose upon the
Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents except as expressly set forth herein or therein. Each Holder of
Secured Obligations and each Issuing Bank shall make its own independent
investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Borrower and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the making and the continuance of the Loans
hereunder, the issuance of Letters of Credit and the entering into any Eligible
Hedging Contract and shall make its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of
Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and the Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any
Holder of Secured Obligations or Issuing Bank with any credit or other
information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the
Effective Date or at any time or times thereafter. Each Lender acknowledges
that neither the Agent nor counsel to the Agent nor any other Lender or
Original Lender is providing any assurances, or shall have any responsibility,
with respect to the ownership of the Property or the absence of any prior Liens
or defects of title, or the legality, sufficiency or effect of any mortgage,
certificate or notice, or any other document, or the validity, creation,
perfection or priority of any Lien, or as to any decision to request, take,
defer, omit or release any Collateral or to investigate or not to investigate
any of those matters, and each Lender agrees to look solely to its rights as
one of the Lenders with respect to any of the foregoing. If the Agent seeks
the consent or approval of the Requisite Lenders to the taking or refraining
from taking any action hereunder, the Agent shall send notice thereof to each
Lender. The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender at any time that the
Requisite Lenders or, where expressly required, all of the Lenders, have
instructed the Agent to act or refrain from acting pursuant hereto.

 11.03. Rights, Exculpation, Etc. Neither the Agent nor any of
its Affiliates nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys
or consultants shall be liable to any Holder of Secured Obligations or any
Issuing Bank for any action taken or omitted by it or such Person hereunder or
under any of the Loan Documents, or in connection herewith or therewith, except
that (i) the Agent shall be obligated on the terms set forth herein for
performance of its express obligations hereunder, and (ii) no Person shall be
relieved of any liability imposed by law for its gross negligence or willful
misconduct (as determined by the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction). The Agent shall not be liable for any apportionment or
distribution of payments made by it in good faith pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently
determined to have been made in error the sole recourse of any Holder of
Secured Obligations to whom payment was due, but not

- 91 -
 99
made, shall be to recover from other Holders of Secured Obligations any payment
in excess of the amount to which they are determined to have been entitled.
The Agent shall not be responsible to any Holder of Secured Obligations or any
Issuing Bank for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties herein
or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability,
collectibility, or sufficiency of this Agreement, any of the Collateral
Documents or any of the other Loan Documents, or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, or of any of the Transaction Documents or any
of the transactions contemplated thereby, or for the financial condition of
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. The Agent shall not be required to make
any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the
terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents
or the financial condition of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or the
existence or possible existence of any Potential Event of Default or Event of
Default. The Agent may at any time request instructions from the Lenders with
respect to any actions or approvals which by the terms of this Agreement or of
any of the other Loan Documents the Agent is permitted or required to take or
to grant, and if such instructions are promptly requested, the Agent shall be
absolutely entitled to refrain from taking any action or to withhold any
approval and shall not be under any liability whatsoever to any Person for
refraining from any action or withholding any approval under any of the Loan
Documents until it shall have received such instructions from the Requisite
Lenders or, where expressly required, all of the Lenders. Without limiting the
foregoing, no Holder of Secured Obligations or Issuing Bank shall have any
right of action whatsoever against the Agent as a result of the Agent acting or
refraining from acting under this Agreement, the Collateral Documents or any of
the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of the Requisite
Lenders or, where expressly required, all of the Lenders.

 11.04. Reliance. The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any
written notices, statements, certificates, orders or other documents or any
telephone message believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person, and with respect to all
matters pertaining to this Agreement, the Collateral Documents or any of the
other Loan Documents and its duties hereunder or thereunder, upon advice of
legal counsel (including counsel for Borrower), independent public accountants
and other experts selected by it in good faith.

 11.05. Indemnification. To the extent that the Agent is not
reimbursed and indemnified by Borrower or Borrower fails upon demand by the
Agent to perform its obligations to reimburse or indemnify the Agent, the
Lenders will reimburse and indemnify the Agent for and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which
may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Collateral Documents or any
of the other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under
this Agreement, the Collateral Documents or any of the other Loan Documents, in
proportion to each Lender's Pro Rata Share; provided that no Lender shall be
liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as
determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The
obligations of the Lenders under this Section 11.05 shall survive the payment
in full of the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations and the termination of this
Agreement.

 100
 11.06. The Agent Individually. With respect to its Pro Rata
Share hereunder and the Loans made by it, the Agent shall have and may exercise
the same rights and powers hereunder and is subject to the same obligations and
liabilities as and to the extent set forth herein for any other Lender. The
terms "Lenders" or "Requisite Lenders" or any similar terms shall, unless the
context clearly otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual
capacity as a Lender or one of the Requisite Lenders. The Agent may accept
deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of banking,
trust or other business with Borrower as if it were not acting as Agent
pursuant hereto.

 11.07. Successor Agent; Resignation of Agent. (a) The Agent
may resign from the performance of its functions and duties hereunder at any
time by giving at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Lenders
and Borrower. In the event that the Agent gives notice of its desire to resign
from the performance of its functions and duties as Agent, any such resignation
shall take effect only upon the acceptance by a successor Agent of appointment
pursuant to clauses (b) and (c) below or as otherwise provided below.

 (b) The Requisite Lenders shall appoint a successor Agent who
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Borrower provided no such approval of the
Borrower shall be required after the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default.

 (c) If a successor Agent shall not have been so appointed
within said thirty (30) day period, the retiring Agent, with the consent of
Borrower (which may not be withheld unreasonably), shall then appoint a
successor Agent who shall serve as Agent until such time, if any, as the
Requisite Lenders, with the consent of Borrower (which may not be withheld
unreasonably), appoint a successor Agent as provided above. No consent of the
Borrower shall be required after the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default.

 (d) Upon the appointment of a successor Agent, the term "Agent"
shall, for all purposes of this Agreement, thereafter include such successor,
except that the retiring Agent shall reserve all rights as to Obligations
accrued or due to it, in its capacity as such, at the time of such succession
and all rights (whenever arising) under Section 12.04.

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.07 to the
contrary, no Person shall serve as an Agent unless such Person is a Lender.

 11.08. Collateral Matters. (a) Each of the Lenders and each
of the Issuing Banks authorizes and directs the Agent to enter into the Loan
Documents relating to the Collateral for the benefit of itself and the Holders
of Secured Obligations. Each of the Lenders and each of the Issuing Banks
agrees that any action taken by the Agent or the Requisite Lenders (or, where
required by the express terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, a
greater proportion of the Lenders) in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, and the exercise by the Agent or the
Requisite Lenders (or, where so required, such greater proportion) of the
powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all of the
Lenders and Issuing Banks. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Agent shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to (i) act as
the disbursing and collecting agent for the Lenders and the Issuing Banks with
respect to all payments and collections arising in

- 93 -
 101
connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents relating to the
Loans or Collateral; (ii) execute and deliver each Loan Document relating to
the Collateral and accept delivery of each such agreement delivered by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) act as collateral agent for the
Lenders and Issuing Banks for purposes of the perfection of all security
interests and Liens created by such agreements and all other purposes stated
therein, provided, however, the Agent hereby appoints, authorizes and directs
the Lenders and the Issuing Banks to act as collateral sub-agent for the Agent,
the Lenders and the Issuing Banks for purposes of the perfection of all
security interests and Liens with respect to the Borrower's and its
Subsidiaries' respective deposit accounts maintained with, and cash and Cash
Equivalents held by, such Lender or such Issuing Bank; (iv) manage, supervise
and otherwise deal with the Collateral in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (v) take such action as is necessary or
desirable to maintain the perfection and priority of the security interests and
liens created or purported to be created by the Loan Documents; and (vi) except
as may be otherwise specifically restricted by the terms of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, exercise all remedies given to the Agent, the Lenders
or the Issuing Banks with respect to the Collateral under the Loan Documents
relating thereto, under applicable law or otherwise.

 (b) The Holders of Secured Obligations hereby irrevocably
authorize the Agent, at the option and in the discretion of the Agent, to
release any Lien granted to or held by the Agent upon any Collateral (a) upon
the occurrence of the Release Event or (b) (i) upon termination of the
Commitments and payment and satisfaction of all Loans, Reimbursement
Obligations, other Letter of Credit Obligations (whether or not due) and all
other Agreement Obligations which have matured and which the Agent has been
notified in writing are then due and payable; or (ii) constituting property
being sold or disposed of if Borrower certifies to the Agent that the sale or
disposition is made in compliance with Section 8.02 (and the Agent may rely
conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry); or (iii)
constituting property in which the Borrower owned no interest at the time the
Lien was granted or at any time thereafter; or (iv) if approved, or with
consent, authorized or ratified in writing by the Agent at the direction of the
Requisite Lenders (or, where so required, all of the Lenders). Upon request by
the Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Agent's
authority to release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this
Section 11.08(b).

 (c) Without in any manner limiting the Agent's authority to act
without any specific or further authorization or consent by the Requisite
Lenders (as set forth in Section 11.08(b)), each Lender agrees to confirm in
writing, upon request by Borrower, the authority to release Collateral
conferred upon the Agent under clauses (i) through (iv) of Section 11.08(b).
So long as no Event of Default is then continuing, upon receipt by the Agent of
the net cash proceeds of any sale and transfer of Collateral which is expressly
permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and upon at least five (5)
Business Days' prior written request by Borrower, the Agent shall (and is
hereby irrevocably authorized by the Holders of Secured Obligations to) execute
such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Liens granted
to the Agent for the benefit of the Holders of Secured Obligations herein or
pursuant hereto upon such Collateral; provided, that (i) the Agent shall not be
required to execute any such document on terms which, in the Agent's opinion,
would expose the Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any
consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty,
and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the
Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of Borrower in respect of) all
interests

- 94 -
 102
retained by Borrower, including, without limitation, the proceeds of any sale,
all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.

 (d) The benefit of the Collateral Documents and of the
provisions of this Agreement relating to the Collateral shall extend to and be
available in respect of any Obligations ("Related Obligations") which arise
under any Eligible Hedging Contracts or which are otherwise owed to Persons
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 12.04; provided that (i) the
Related Obligations shall be entitled to the benefit of the Collateral to the
extent and with the priority expressly set forth in this Agreement and the
Collateral Documents, and to such extent the Agent shall hold, and have the
right and power to act with respect to, the Collateral on behalf of and as
agent for the holders of the Related Obligations; but the Agent is otherwise
acting solely as agent for the Lenders and the Issuing Banks and shall have no
separate fiduciary duty, duty of loyalty, duty of care, duty of disclosure or
other obligation whatsoever to any holder of Related Obligations; and (ii) all
matters, acts and omissions relating in any manner to the Collateral, or the
omission, creation, perfection, priority, abandonment or release of any Lien,
shall be governed solely by the provisions of this Agreement and the Collateral
Documents, and no separate Lien, right, power or remedy shall arise or exist in
favor of any Holder of Secured Obligations under any separate instrument or
agreement or in respect of any Related Obligations; and (iii) each Holder of
Secured Obligations shall be bound by all actions taken or omitted, in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Collateral Documents,
by the Agent and the Requisite Lenders or, where expressly required, all of the
Lenders, each of whom shall be entitled to act at its sole discretion and
exclusively in its own interest given its own Commitments and its own interest
in the Loans, Reimbursement Obligations, Letter of Credit Obligations and its
other Agreement Obligations, without any duty or liability to any other Holder
of Secured Obligations or as to any Related Obligations and without regard to
whether any Related Obligations remain outstanding or are deprived of the
benefit of the Collateral or become unsecured or are otherwise affected or put
in jeopardy thereby; and (iv) no holder of Related Obligations and no other
Holder of Secured Obligations (except the Agent and the Lenders, to the extent
set forth in this Agreement) shall have any right to be notified of, or to
direct, require or be heard with respect to, any action taken or omitted in
respect of the Collateral or under this Agreement or the Collateral Documents;
and (v) no holder of any Related Obligations shall exercise any right of
setoff, banker's lien or similar right except as expressly provided in Section
12.06.

 11.09. Relations Among Lenders.

 (a) Except with respect to the exercise of set-off rights of
any Lender in accordance with Section 12.06, the proceeds of which are applied
in accordance with this Agreement, and except as set forth below, each Lender
agrees that it will not take any action, nor institute any actions or
proceedings, against Borrower or any other obligor hereunder or with respect to
any Collateral or Loan Document, without the prior written consent of the
Requisite Lenders or, as may be provided in this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, at the direction of the Agent.

 (b) The Lenders are not partners or co-venturers, and no Lender
shall be liable for the acts or omissions of, or (except as otherwise set forth
herein in case of the Agent) authorized to act for, any other Lender.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to Section 12.07(a)

- 95 -
 103
hereof, any Lender shall have the right to enforce on an unsecured basis the
payment of the principal of and interest on any Loan made by it after the date
such principal or interest has become due and payable pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

 (c) Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Original Lender or any
other Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and
such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any other Lender and based
on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

 11.10. Notices to Itel. At any time after the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Agent may, and shall at the
direction of the Requisite Lenders, notify Itel of the occurrence of such Event
of Default in connection with Itel's obligations under the Subordination
Agreement.

and its obligations to acquire such participations) in conformity with the
following provisions:

 (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a

 5,000,000 (provided that assignments between Lenders shall have no minimum
amount and assignments after the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default shall not require Borrower's consent regardless of the size of
such assignment);

- 96 -
 104

the rights and obligations of a Holder of Secured Obligations, as fully as if
such assignee had been named as a Lender in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement) and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned or negotiated by it
pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be
released from its obligations under this Agreement and, in the case of an
Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease

other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee
confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of
the financial statements most recently delivered pursuant to Article VI and
such other Loan Documents and other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, the Issuing Banks, such assigning Lender or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate
at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking
action under this Agreement; (v) such

- 97 -
 105
assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as an Agent on
its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof and thereof,
together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vi) such
assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the
obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed
by it as a Lender.

 (c) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to on
Schedule A a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted
by it and shall record in the Agent's Loan Account the names and addresses of
each Lender and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to,
such Lender from time to time. Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Loan Account as a Lender hereunder
for all purposes of this Agreement.

 (d) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed
by an assigning Lender and the assignee, the Agent shall, if such Assignment
and Acceptance has been properly completed and is in substantially the form of
Exhibit 1 and if the conditions for the assignment referred to in the
Assignment and Acceptance and set forth in Section 12.02(a) have been met, (i)
accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained

participating bank or entity had no transfer occurred, (v) Borrower, the Agent,
the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement and with regard to any and all payments to be
made under this Agreement, and (vi) the holder of any such participation shall
not be entitled to voting rights under this Agreement; provided, that the
participation agreement between a Lender and its participants may provide that
such Lender will obtain the approval of such participant prior to any amendment
or waiver of any provisions of this Agreement which would (A) extend the
scheduled maturities of the Loans, the Termination Date or the Reimbursement
Obligations or the time of payment of interest thereon or fees, (B) reduce the
interest rate or any fees hereunder, or the principal amount of the Loans or

 (f) Upon the acceptance by the Agent of any Assignment and
Acceptance, the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance may at any time
request that new Notes be issued to the Lender assignor and the Lender assignee
by (i) providing written notice of such request to the Agent and the Borrower
and (ii) delivering to the Borrower such assigning Lender's Notes for
cancellation and substitution. Promptly following receipt by the Borrower of
any such notice, and verification from the Agent that the applicable Assignment
and Acceptance shall have been accepted by the Agent, the Borrower forthwith
shall cause to be executed, and shall deliver to the Lender assignee, a new
Note to the order of the assignee and, if applicable, a replacement Note to the
order of the Lender assignor, and such Notes shall equal the aggregate
principal amount of such assigning Lender's Notes issued by the Borrower
immediately prior to the acceptance by the Agent of the applicable Assignment
and Acceptance. The Borrower shall immediately upon delivery of such new
Note(s), cancel the original Note delivered by the Lender assignor to the
Borrower.

 (g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each
Lender may assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement as
collateral security to the Federal Reserve Bank or any Governmental Authority
succeeding to its functions.

 12.03. Expenses.

 (a) Generally. Whether or not any Funding Date shall have

out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' and legal assistants' fees (including allocated costs of internal
counsel and costs of settlement) incurred by the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any
Lender prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default in commencing, defending

of internal counsel and costs of settlement) incurred by the Agent, any Issuing
Bank or any Lender after the occurrence of an Event of Default (i) in enforcing
any of the Obligations or in foreclosing against the Collateral or exercising

Default; (ii) in connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the credit
arrangements provided under this Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or in
any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding; (iii) in commencing, defending or
intervening in any litigation or in filing a petition, complaint, answer,
motion or other pleading in any legal proceeding relating to Borrower or any
Subsidiary of Borrower and related to or arising out of the transactions
contemplated hereby or by any of the Transaction Documents; (iv) in taking any
other action in or with respect to any suit or proceeding (whether in
bankruptcy or otherwise); (v) in protecting, preserving, collecting, leasing,
selling, taking possession of, or liquidating any of the Collateral; or (vi) in

costs and expenses under this Section 12.03(b) shall be apportioned among the
Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders in the order of priority set forth in
Section 2.06.

 12.04. Indemnification and Waiver. Borrower agrees: (a) to
defend, protect, indemnify, and hold harmless the Agent, each and all of the
Issuing Banks and each and all of the Lenders, each of their respective
Affiliates and each of the respective officers, directors, employees and agents
of each of the foregoing (collectively called the "Indemnitees") from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, the fees and
disbursements of counsel for such Indemnitees in connection with any
investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding, whether or not such
Indemnitees shall be designated a party thereto), imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against such Indemnitees (whether direct, indirect or consequential
and whether based on any federal or state laws or other statutory regulations,
including, without limitation, securities and commercial laws and regulations,
under common law or at equitable cause, or on contract or otherwise, including
any liabilities and costs under federal, state or local environmental, health
or safety laws, regulations, or common law principles, arising from or in
connection with the past, present or future operations of Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, or their respective predecessors in interest, or the past,
present or future environmental condition of the Property of Borrower or any
Subsidiary of Borrower, the presence of asbestos- containing materials at any
such Property, or the Release or threatened Release of any Contaminant into the
environment from any such Property) in any manner relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, the Collateral Documents or any of the other Transaction
Documents, the capitalization of Borrower, the Permitted Subordinated
Indebtedness, the Lenders' Commitments, the making of, issuance of, management
of and participation in the Loans or the Letters of Credit, or the use or
intended use of the Letters of Credit and the proceeds of the Loans hereunder
(collectively, the "Indemnified

- 100 -
 108
Matters"); provided, that Borrower shall have no obligation to an Indemnitee
hereunder with respect to (i) matters for which such Indemnitee has been
compensated pursuant to or for which an exemption is provided in Section
2.03(f) or 2.08(d) or any other provision of this Agreement and (ii)
Indemnified Matters caused by or resulting from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of that Indemnitee, as determined by a final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction; and (b) to assert no claim against the Agent, any of
the Lenders, any of the Issuing Banks or any other Indemnitee, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, all of
which claims, if any, are hereby waived. To the extent that the undertaking to
indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth in the preceding clause (a) may be
unenforceable because it is violative of any law or public policy, Borrower
shall contribute the maximum portion which it is permitted to pay and satisfy
under applicable law, to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified
Matters incurred by the Indemnitees. Without prejudice to the survival of any
other agreement of Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of
Borrower contained in this Section 12.04 shall survive the payment in full of
principal and interest hereunder, the termination of the Letters of Credit and
the termination of this Agreement.

 12.05. Limitation of Liability. No claim may be made by
Borrower, any Lender or other Person against the Agent, any Issuing Bank, or
any Lender or the Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents of any
of them for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages in respect
of any claim for breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising
out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection
therewith, and Borrower and each Lender hereby waives, releases and agrees not
to sue upon any claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether
or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.

 12.06. Setoff. In addition to any Liens granted to the Agent,
the Issuing Banks or Lenders and any rights now or hereafter granted under
applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such Lien or rights, upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender
and each Issuing Bank is hereby authorized by Borrower at any time or from time
to time, without notice to Borrower, or to any other Person (any such notice
being hereby expressly waived) to set off and to appropriate and to apply any
and all deposits (general or special, including, but not limited to,
indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured
but not including trust accounts) and any other Indebtedness at any time held
or owing by that Lender or that Issuing Bank to or for the credit or the
account of Borrower against and on account of the Obligations of Borrower to
that Lender or that Issuing Bank including, but not limited to, all Loans and
Reimbursement Obligations and all claims of any nature or description arising
out of or connected with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents,
irrespective of whether or not (i) that Lender or that Issuing Bank shall have
made any demand hereunder or (ii) the Agent shall have declared the principal
of and interest on the Loans and other amounts due hereunder to be due and
payable as permitted by Article X and although said obligations and
liabilities, or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured.

- 101 -
 109
 12.07. Ratable Sharing; Defaulting Lender.

 (a) Subject to Sections 2.06 and 12.07(b), the Lenders agree
among themselves that (i) with respect to all amounts received by them which
are applicable to the payment of the Agreement Obligations (excluding amounts
payable under this Agreement which are determined on a non-pro-rata basis,
including, without limitation, amounts payable under Sections 2.03(f), 2.04(c),
2.08(d), 2.09, 2.10, 2.13, 2.14, 3.09, 12.03 and 12.04), equitable adjustment
will be made so that, in effect, all such amounts will be shared among them
ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, whether received by voluntary
payment, by the exercise of the right of set-off or banker's lien, by
counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any or all of the
Agreement Obligations (excluding amounts payable under this Agreement which are
determined on a non-pro-rata basis, including, without limitation, amounts
payable under Sections 2.02(c), 2.03(f), 2.04(c), 2.08(d), 2.09, 2.10, 2.14,
3.09, 12.03 and 12.04) or the Collateral, (ii) if any of them shall by
voluntary payment or by the exercise of any right of counterclaim, setoff,
banker's lien or otherwise, receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate
amount of the Agreement Obligations held by it which is greater than its Pro
Rata Share of the payments on account of the Agreement Obligations (excluding
the fees described or referred to in Section 2.04), the one receiving such
excess payment shall purchase, without recourse or warranty, an undivided
interest and participation (which it shall be deemed to have been done
simultaneously upon the receipt of such payment) in such Agreement Obligations
owed to the others so that all such recoveries with respect to such Agreement
Obligations shall be applied ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares;
provided, that if all or part of such excess payment received by the purchasing
party is thereafter recovered from it, those purchases shall be rescinded and
the purchase prices paid for such participations shall be returned to that
party to the extent necessary to adjust for such recovery, but without interest
except to the extent the purchasing party is required to pay interest in
connection with such recovery. Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 12.07(a) may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including,
subject to Section 12.06, the right of setoff) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of Borrower
in the amount of such participation.

 (b) In the event that any Lender fails to fund its Pro Rata
Share of any Borrowing requested or deemed requested by the Borrower which such
Lender is obligated to fund under the terms of this Agreement (the funded
portion of such Borrowing being hereinafter referred to as a "Non Pro Rata
Loan"), until the earlier of such Lender's cure of such failure and the
termination of the Commitments, the proceeds of all amounts thereafter repaid
to the Agent by the Borrower and otherwise required to be applied to such
Lender's share of all other Obligations pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
shall be advanced to the Borrower by the Agent on behalf of such Lender to
cure, in full or in part, such failure by such Lender, but shall nevertheless
be deemed to have been paid to such Lender in satisfaction of such other
Obligations. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

 (i) the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.07(b) shall
 apply only with respect to the proceeds of payments of Obligations and
 shall not affect the conversion or continuation of Loans pursuant to
 Section 2.03(c);

- 102 -
 110
 (ii) any such Lender shall be deemed to have cured its failure
 to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Borrowing at such time as an amount
 equal to such Lender's original Pro Rata Share of the requested
 principal portion of such Borrowing is fully funded to the Borrower,
 whether made by such Lender itself or by operation of the terms of this
 Section 12.07(b), and whether or not the Non Pro Rata Loan with respect
 thereto has been repaid, converted or continued;

 (iii) amounts advanced to the Borrower to cure, in full or in
 part, any such Lender's failure to fund its Pro Rata Share of any
 Borrowing ("Cure Loans") shall bear interest at the rate applicable to
 Base Rate Loans under Section 2.03 in effect from time to time, and for
 all other purposes of this Agreement shall be treated as if they were
 Base Rate Loans;

 (iv) regardless of whether or not an Event of Default has
 occurred or is continuing, and notwithstanding the instructions of the
 Borrower as to its desired application, all repayments of principal
 which, in accordance with the terms of Section 2.06, would be applied to
 the outstanding Base Rate Loans shall be applied first, ratably to all
 Base Rate Loans constituting Non Pro Rata Loans, second, ratably to Base
 Rate Loans other than those constituting Non Pro Rata Loans or Cure
 Loans and, third, ratably to Base Rate Loans constituting Cure Loans;

 (v) for so long as and until the earlier of any such Lender's
 cure of the failure to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Borrowing and the
 termination of the Commitments, the term "Requisite Lenders" for
 purposes of this Agreement shall mean Lenders (excluding all Lenders
 whose failure to fund their respective Pro Rata Shares of such Borrowing
 have not been so cured) whose Pro Rata Shares represent more than
 fifty-one percent (51 of the aggregate Pro Rata Shares of such
 Lenders; and

 (vi) for so long as and until any such Lender's failure to fund
 its Pro Rata Share of any Borrowing is cured in accordance with Section
 12.07(b)(ii), (A) such Lender shall not be entitled to any Commitment
 Fees with respect to its Commitment and (B) the Commitment Fee shall
 accrue in favor of the Lenders which have funded their respective Pro
 Rata Shares of such requested Borrowing, shall be allocated among such
 performing Lenders ratably based upon their relative Commitments, and
 shall be calculated based upon the average amount by which the aggregate
 Commitments of such performing Lenders exceeds the sum of (I) the
 outstanding principal amount of the Loans owing to such performing
 Lenders, plus (II) the outstanding Reimbursement Obligations owing to
 such performing Lenders, plus (III) the aggregate participation
 interests of such performing Lenders arising pursuant to Section 3.06
 with respect to undrawn and outstanding Letters of Credit.

 12.08. Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or modification of
any provision of this Agreement shall be effective without the written
agreement of the Requisite Lenders and Borrower, and no termination or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement, or consent to any departure by Borrower
therefrom, shall in any event be effective without the written concurrence of
the Requisite Lenders, which the Requisite Lenders shall have the right to

- 103 -
 111
grant or withhold at their sole discretion; except that any amendment,
modification, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement which would (i)
extend the time of expiration or termination of any of the Commitments or the
scheduled maturities of the Loans or the Reimbursement Obligations or the time
of payment of interest thereon or fees (including, without limitation by any
amendment to or waiver of Section 10.02(a)), (ii) reduce the interest rate, the
amount of any fees, indemnities or reimbursements hereunder, or the principal
amount of the Loans or the Letter of Credit Obligations (including, without
limitation by any amendment to or waiver of Section 10.02(a)), (iii) except
pursuant to Section 2.02(e) increase the aggregate amount of the Commitments or
the Loans of the Lenders or increase the Lender's Pro Rata Share, (iv) release
all or substantially all of the Collateral except after the occurrence of the
Release Event, (v) amend the definitions of "Requisite Lenders," "Pro Rata
Share", the provisions of Section 2.01(b), the next to the last sentence of
Section 12.20 or the provisions contained in Section 12.07 or in this Section
12.08 or the parties whose consent is required for action hereunder or under
the other Loan Documents, shall be effective only if evidenced by a writing
signed by or on behalf of all Lenders. No amendment, modification,
termination, or waiver of any provision of Article XI or any other provision
referring to the Agent shall be effective without the written concurrence of
the Agent. No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision
of Article III shall be effective without the written consent of each of the
Issuing Banks. The Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, with the
concurrence of any Lender, execute amendments, modifications, waivers or
consents on behalf of such Lender. Any waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was
given. No notice to or demand on Borrower in any case shall entitle Borrower
to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
Any amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent effected in
accordance with this Section 12.08 shall be binding on each assignee,
transferee or recipient of a Lender's Commitment or Loans, each future
assignee, transferee, recipient of a Lender's Commitment or Loans, and, if
signed by Borrower, on Borrower.

 12.09. Independence of Covenants. All covenants hereunder
shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition
is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted
by an exception to, or be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant
shall not avoid the occurrence of an Event of Default or Potential Event of
Default if such action is taken or condition exists.

 12.10. Notices. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein,
any notice or other communication herein required or permitted to be given
shall be in writing and may be personally served, telecopied, telexed or sent
by courier service or United States mail and shall be deemed to have been given
when delivered in person or by courier service, upon receipt of a telecopy or
telex or four (4) Business Days after deposit in the United States mail
(registered or certified, with postage prepaid and properly addressed).
Notices to the Agent shall not be effective until received by the Agent. For
the purposes hereof, the addresses of the parties hereto (until notice of a
change thereof is delivered as provided in this Section 12.10) shall be as set
forth in Schedule A or on the applicable Assignment and Acceptance, or, as to
each party, at such other address as may be designated by such party in a
written notice to all of the other parties.

- 104 -
 112
 12.11. Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.
No failure or delay on the part of the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in
the exercise of any power, right or privilege under any of the Loan Documents
shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of
any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise
of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise
thereof or of any other right, power or privilege. All rights and remedies
existing under the Loan Documents are cumulative to and not exclusive of any
rights or remedies otherwise available.

 12.12. Termination. Upon the termination in whole of the
Commitments pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Borrower shall pay to the
Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks an amount equal to
any and all Agreement Obligations then outstanding.

 12.13. Marshalling; Recourse to Security; Payments Set Aside.
Neither any Lender nor the Agent shall be under any obligation to marshal any
assets in favor of Borrower or any other party or against or in payment of any
or all of the Obligations. Recourse to security shall not be required at any
time. To the extent that Borrower makes a payment or payments to the Agent or
the Lenders, or the Agent or the Lenders enforce their security interests or
exercise their rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds
of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be
repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law,
state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such
recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied,
and all Liens, right and remedies therefor, shall be revived and continued in
full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement
or setoff had not occurred.

 12.14. Severability. In case any provision in or obligation
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in
any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

 12.15. Headings. Article and Section headings in this
Agreement and in the Table of Contents hereto are included herein for
convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement
for any other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

 12.16. GOVERNING LAW. THE AGENT HEREBY ACCEPTS THIS AGREEMENT,
ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND THE LENDERS, AT NEW YORK, NEW YORK BY ACKNOWLEDGING AND
AGREEING TO IT THERE. ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN THE BORROWER AND THE AGENT, ANY

BETWEEN THEM IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL
BE RESOLVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

hereto and their respective successors and assigns and shall inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and the successors and permitted assigns of the
Lenders. The terms and provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of any assignee or transferee of the Loans and the Commitments of any Lender
(to the extent such assignment or transfer is effected in accordance with
Section 12.02), and in the event of such transfer or assignment, the rights and
privileges herein conferred upon Lenders shall automatically extend to and be
vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions
hereof. Borrower's rights or any interest therein hereunder, and Borrower's
duties and Obligations hereunder, may not be assigned without the written
consent of all of the Lenders. All of Borrower's obligations and duties under
this Agreement and under each of the other Loan Documents shall be binding upon
each of Borrower's successors and assigns, including, without limitation, any
receiver, trustee or debtor-in-possession of or for Borrower.

 12.19. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Inconsistencies. This
Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents, or supplements may be executed
in counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed
an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and
the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective against each of
Borrower, each Lender and the Agent on the date when all of such parties have
duly executed and delivered this Agreement to each other (delivery by Borrower
to the Lenders and by any Lender to the Borrower and any other Lender being
deemed to have been made by

- 107 -
 115
delivery to the Agent). This Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents
shall be construed to the extent reasonable to be consistent one with the
other, but to the extent that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are
actually inconsistent with the terms and conditions of any other Loan Document,
this Agreement shall govern.

 12.20. Performance of Obligations. Borrower agrees that the
Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, make any payment or perform any act
required of Borrower under any Loan Document or take any other action which the
Agent in its discretion deems necessary or desirable to protect or preserve the
Collateral, including, without limitation, any action to (i) pay or discharge
taxes, liens, security interests or other encumbrances levied or placed on or
threatened against any Collateral, (ii) effect any repairs or obtain any
insurance called for by the terms of any of the Loan Documents and to pay all
or any part of the premiums therefor and the costs thereof and (iii) pay any
rents payable by Borrower which are more than 30 days past due, or as to which
the landlord has given notice of termination, under any lease. The Agent shall
use its best efforts to give Borrower notice of any action taken under this
Section 12.20 prior to the taking of such action or promptly thereafter
provided the failure to give such notice shall not affect Borrower's
obligations in respect thereof. The Borrower agrees to pay the Agent, upon
demand, the principal amount of all funds advanced by the Agent under this
Section 12.20, together with interest thereon at the rate from time to time
applicable to Base Rate Loans from the date of such advance until the
outstanding principal balance thereof is paid in full. If the Borrower fails
to make payment in respect of any such advance under this Section 12.20 within
one (1) Business Day after the date the Borrower receives written demand
therefor from the Agent, the Agent shall promptly notify each Lender and each
Lender agrees that it shall thereupon make available to the Agent, in Dollars
in immediately available funds, the amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata
Share of such advance. If such funds are not made available to the Agent by
such Lender within one (1) Business Day after the Agent's demand therefor, the
Agent will be entitled to recover any such amount from such Lender together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate (as such term is defined in the
definition of Alternate Base Rate) for each day during the period commencing on
the date of such demand and ending on the date such amount is received. The
failure of any Lender to make available to the Agent its Pro Rata Share of any
such unreimbursed advance under this Section 12.20 shall neither relieve any
other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make available to the Agent such
other Lender's Pro Rata Share of such advance on the date such payment is to be
made nor increase the obligation of any other Lender to make such payment to
the Agent. All outstanding principal of, and interest on, advances made under
this Section 12.20 shall constitute Obligations secured by the Collateral until
paid in full by the Borrower.

 12.21. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. THIS WRITTEN CREDIT AGREEMENT
REPRESENTS THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES AS TO ITS SUBJECT MATTER AND
MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT
ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS
AMONG THE PARTIES.

 AGREEMENT

 AGREEMENT Exhibit 10.20(c)

 Rod F. Dammeyer ("Executive") and Itel Corporation ("Company") hereby
agree as follows:

 1. Company will employ Executive and Executive will be employed
by Company as an executive officer of Company and such of its subsidiaries as
the Company shall designate from time to time. Designation of a subsidiary of
the Company as an employer of Executive ("Designated Employer") shall not be
affected by whether that employer continues to be a subsidiary of the Company.

 2. The term of employment under this Agreement shall begin on
January 1, 1995 and shall end on the earlier of (a) the date specified in a
written notice by one party to the other, which date must be at least 2 years
after the date such notice is given, or (b) December 31, 2000."

 3. Minimum compensation of Executive shall be as follows:

 o Annual salary of 625,000.

 o Annual bonus opportunity of 50 to 112.5 of salary
 with a target of 75 of salary.

 Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in
 its good faith judgment shall determine from time to
 time to be appropriate.

 o Other benefits equal to those currently provided by
 the Company or its subsidiary, Anixter Inc., as those
 benefits may be modified from time to time.

 4. Offset against the compensation otherwise payable to Executive
by the Company shall be the compensation payable to the Executive by any
Designated Employer.

 5. Upon completion of his employment pursuant to this Agreement
and the concurrent or subsequent termination, by resignation or otherwise, of
his employment by the Company, but not otherwise not withstanding the
provisions of the Agreement between the parties, dated January 1, 1992, Mr.
Dammeyer (a) shall be fully vested in all options granted to him by the Company
prior to 1995, shall be protected by adjustment of exercise prices and number
of covered shares against dilution by any extraordinary cash dividends or other
actions as provided in the warrants previously granted directors of the
Company, and shall have until the earlier of the specific expiration date
stated in each option granted to him by

2

the Company prior to 1995 or the date two years after termination of his
employment to exercise that option; (b) shall receive a vested benefit in the
Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan as if a "change of control"
shall have occurred at such time; (c) shall receive the split dollar life
insurance policy on his life now owned by the Company if the policy has not
previously been delivered to him; and(d) shall be vested in any regular or
supplemental pension or savings plans in which he has participated.

 6. Performance of the obligations under this Agreement shall
discharge the Company and any Designated Employer from any other obligation
they may have to Executive in connection with any termination of his employment
by the Company and any Designated Employer.

 7. If necessary, to avoid the limitation of Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code on the deductibility by the Company of the Executive's
compensation, a sufficient amount of the Executive's bonus may be deferred,
with fair interest, to such time that the deduction for the Executive's
compensation is not so limited.
