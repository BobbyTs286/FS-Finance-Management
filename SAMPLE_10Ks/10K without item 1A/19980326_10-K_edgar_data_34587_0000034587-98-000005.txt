 PART I

ITEM 1. Business

The Company

 General. The Company's principal activities are the provision of
management services to the P&C Group and the ownership and operation of the
Insurance Subsidiaries. On April 15, 1997, OSL and IGL were sold to Great
Southern Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Americo Life, Inc.. As of
December 31, 1997, the Company had total assets of 12.1 billion, 
stockholder's equity of 6.8 billion and consolidated operating revenues for 
1997 of 2.0 billion. As of December 31, 1997, the Company's remaining life
insurance subsidiary, FNWL, had total assets of 5.4 billion, combined SAP
capital and surplus (including asset valuation reserve) of 0.8 billion,
combined SAP premium and deposits received for 1997 of 0.5 billion and
policies-in-force of 1.1 million. The financial results and assets and
liabilities of the P&C Group are not reflected in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company.

 In December 1988, BATUS Inc. ("BATUS"), a subsidiary of B.A.T Industries
p.l.c. ("B.A.T"), acquired 100 ownership of the Company through its wholly
owned subsidiary BATUS Financial Services. Immediately thereafter, BATUS
Financial Services was merged into Farmers Group, Inc.. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the acquired assets and
liabilities were recorded in the Company's consolidated balance sheets based
on their estimated fair values at December 31, 1988. In January 1990,
ownership of the Company was transferred to South Western Nominees Limited, a
subsidiary of B.A.T.

 B.A.T is one of the United Kingdom's leading business enterprises with
interests principally in tobacco and financial services. B.A.T operates in
more than 180 countries, employing more than 141,000 people. As of December
31, 1997, B.A.T reported total assets of 84.9 billion (based on an exchange
rate of 1.657 per British pound sterling as of December 31, 1997) and, for
the year then ended, reported total revenues and income before taxes of
 41.1 billion and 2.9 billion, respectively (based on an average exchange
rate of 1.639 per British pound sterling for the year ended December 31,
1997).

 On December 22, 1997, a definitive agreement was reached to merge B.A.T
Industries' Financial Services Businesses ("BAFS") with Zurich Insurance
Company ("Zurich"). Completion of the merger is subject to regulatory
consents, tax clearance and the approval of the shareholders of B.A.T and
Zurich, and is expected to be finalized in late 1998. Under the 

 5

agreement, the businesses of Zurich and BAFS, which include Farmers Group,
Inc., will be transferred to Zurich Financial Services, a new Swiss company
with headquarters in Zurich.

Financial Information About Industry Segments

 Financial information about industry segments can be found in Note Z 
contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Following are 
descriptions of the Company's industry segments.

 Provision of Management Services to the P&C Group. The insurers
constituting the P&C Group are owned by their policyholders. Accordingly, the
Company has no ownership interest in the P&C Group. The policyholders each
appoint the Company as the exclusive attorney-in-fact ("AIF") to provide
management services to the P&C Group. For such services, the Company earns
management fees based primarily on the gross premiums earned by the P&C Group.
Consequently, the Company is not directly affected by the underwriting
results of the P&C Group. This is in contrast to a typical property and
casualty insurance holding company which depends on dividends from owned and
operated subsidiaries which are subject to fluctuations in underwriting
results. The management fees comprise a major part of the Company's revenue
and, as a result, the Company's ongoing financial performance depends on the
volume of business written by, and the business efficiency and financial
strength of, the P&C Group.

 As manager and AIF of the P&C Group, the Company selects risks, prepares
and mails policy forms and invoices, collects premiums, manages the investment
portfolios and performs certain other administrative functions. The insurers
of the P&C Group are responsible for the claims functions, including the
settlement and payment of claims and claims adjustment expenses. They are also
responsible for the payment of commissions, benefits for agents and district
managers, and their respective premium and income taxes. 

 The Company is entitled to receive a management fee of up to 20 (25 in
the case of Fire Insurance Exchange) of the gross premiums earned by the P&C
Group. In order to enable the P&C Group to maintain appropriate capital and
surplus while offering competitive insurance rates, the Company has
historically charged a lower management fee than permitted. The Company has
been able to do this while maintaining appropriate profit margins through
enhanced operating efficiencies that encompass the use of economies of scale,
the use of technology and the standardization of procedures. The range of fees
has varied by line of business over time and from year to year. During the
past five years, aggregate management fees averaged between 12 and 13 of
gross premiums earned by the P&C Group. The P&C Group has reported a growing
volume of premiums which has generated a corresponding rise in management fee
income to the Company. Gross premiums earned by the P&C Group were 10.1
billion, 9.5 billion, and 9.0 billion for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively,
giving rise to management fee revenues to the Company of 1.24 billion, 1.17 
billion, and 1.11 billion, respectively, for the same years. 

 The P&C Group markets personal auto, homeowners and selected commercial
insurance products in 31 states. For the year ended December 31, 1997,
approximately 68.3 of net premiums earned was from auto insurance policies,
21.5 was from homeowner policies, and the remainder was from commercial
policies. As of December 31, 1997, the P&C Group had total assets of 12.6
billion, surplus as regards policyholders of 3.6 billion, gross premiums
earned of 10.1 billion and policies-in-force of 15.6 million.

6

 Life Insurance Subsidiaries. On April 15, 1997, upon receipt of regulatory
approval, the Company sold OSL and IGL to Great Southern Life Insurance
Company, a subsidiary of Americo Life, Inc.. As a result, FNWL, a Washington
insurance company, remains as the only life insurance subsidiary of FGI. FNWL
markets a broad line of individual life insurance products, including
universal life, term life and whole life insurance, and annuity products,
predominately flexible premium deferred annuities. As of December 31, 1997,
FNWL provided insurance to more than one million people and managed more than
 1.5 billion of annuity funds. FNWL's investment philosophy emphasizes
long-term fundamental value in the selection of the investment mix for its
portfolio. As of December 31, 1997, approximately 91.3 of FNWL's
portfolio was invested in fixed income securities and cash, 6.8 in other
fixed income instruments, and 1.9 in equity securities and owned real estate.
As of December 31, 1997, approximately 92.9 of FNWL's fixed income securities
were rated investment grade. FNWL's ratio of SAP capital and surplus
(including asset valuation reserve) to total assets as of December 31, 1997
was 20.6 , well over the industry average of approximately 11.9 as of
September 30, 1997, as published in the Statistical Bulletin issued by the
American Council of Life Insurance.

 In 1997, OSL and IGL contributed 5,502,000 to net income. The combined
net assets of these subsidiaries as of April 15, 1997 were 316,448,000. The
sale of these subsidiaries resulted in an estimated 19,019,000 gain and was
recorded on the "Gain on sale of subsidiaries" line of the income statement. 
In addition, taxes associated with the sale increased current year tax expense
by an estimated 26,826,000 and were reflected on the "Provision for income
taxes" line. Both of these amounts were reflected in the "Management services
to property and casualty insurance companies; and other" section of the
Company's consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 1997.

Other Businesses. The Prematic Service Corporation ("Prematic"), a 
subsidiary of the Company, was established in 1961 to enable individuals 
and businesses purchasing insurance from one or more members of the P&C 
Group and FNWL to combine all premiums due into a single monthly payment.
In practice, Prematic combines amounts due from a single insured associated
with auto, fire, commercial and life policies into a single amount, and
Prematic then bills the insured on a monthly basis for all policies-in-force. 
For its services, Prematic collects a service fee, but since Prematic does 
not finance the premium, there is no interest charged. Approximately 21.6 
of the P&C Group's policies-in-force and 6.1 of FNWL's policies-in-force are
currently billed by Prematic, and in 1997, Prematic generated approximately
 76 million in service charge income. Net income earned by this subsidiary was
approximately 24 million in 1997. The Company has certain other nonmaterial
subsidiaries, the results of which are included in the Company's consolidated
results.
 
Employees	 

 As of December 31, 1997, the Company had 7,559 employees. 

Business Environment

 Strategic Objectives. The Company's strategic objectives are to assist 
the P&C Group in growing the volume of profitably underwritten insurance and 
to increase life insurance and annuity sales to the P&C Group's existing 
policyholder base. The Company intends to achieve these objectives by (i) 
cross-selling insurance products and services to the P&C Group's nearly 
8.5 million existing households while focusing its efforts 
on the growth of FNWL, (ii) investing in technology to 
improve the efficiency and quality of service, (iii) maintaining its
long-standing tradition of providing

 7

high-quality customer service, (iv) capitalizing on the strong
brand name recognition of Farmers Insurance Group of Companies in its
31 state operating territory, (v) selectively expanding into new geographic
markets, and (vi) expanding the products and services offered to its
policyholders by taking advantage of horizontal marketing opportunities.

 Technology. The Company makes substantial use of information technology
in its business. Information technology is utilized for accounting and
billing, to provide management information services, to process policies, to
analyze and select risks, and to automate premium remittance processing.
An integrated network of computer workstations connects the Company's offices
and the P&C Group's offices, district managers and agents with the Company's
two data centers. 

 The Company is committed to an ongoing program of proprietary software
development which enhances the operating efficiency of FNWL and the management
services it provides to the members of the P&C Group. Examples of the
Company's commitment to using technology to improve operating efficiencies are
the Auto Policy Processing System ("APPS") and the Fire Policy Processing
System ("FPPS"), which were developed to allow agents on-line access to auto
and fire policy data. Additional projects under development are the Farmers
EasyPay (SM) billing system, which is being developed in order to update the
Prematic policy processing software system to allow for faster and more
flexible policyholder billing, and the Auto Mainfile Replacement ("AMR")
system, which is being developed to replace the existing automobile policy
mainfile and will allow for easier and faster information retrieval and
analysis.

 These software systems are designed to significantly reduce the time and
expense associated with processing and servicing a Personal Lines policy. In
addition, by allowing network access to more comprehensive policy and
policyholder information, these systems increase cross-selling opportunities
for the agent and provide better data to monitor and manage the quality of the
book of business. The above mentioned projects are expected to cost
approximately 299 million, of which an aggregate of 286 million has already
been capitalized as of December 31, 1997. 

 In 1995, the Company initiated the Year 2000 Project in order to prepare
for the information processing problems presented by the approach of the
new millennium. The project encompasses all major areas of the Company's
operations, including internal and vendor mainframe applications, mainframe
systems software, third party interfaces, non-mainframe system software,
forms, facilities, and equipment. As the Company and the P&C Group rely on
computer software logic to maintain accurate records, and as the business of
the P&C Group involves providing accurate and timely information and service
to its policyholders, the impact of the issues relating to the approach of the
new millennium are significant to the Company's ongoing performance. As such,
a phased plan has been developed for completing this project. As of December
31, 1997, the first two phases of the project (that is, the assessment and
strategic planning phases) have been completed. The project is currently in
its final phase (the conversion and implementation phase) which is expected to
be completed in mid-year 1999.

 The Company has communicated with all external entities with which it
interfaces and is testing all third party applications, interfaces and system
software for compliancy. Although the Company believes that all third party
interfaces will be compliant by the year 2000, there can be no guarantee that
the systems of other companies on which the Company's systems rely will
be timely converted or that a failure to convert by another company would not
have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

8

The costs associated with the Year 2000 Project are being expensed as
incurred. For the year ended December 31, 1997, such costs totaled 6.8
million, of which 1.5 million was allocated to the Exchanges. For the year
ended December 31, 1996, such costs totaled 0.8 million, of which 0.2
million was allocated to the Exchanges. Total costs for this project are
expected to be approximately 20.5 million, of which approximately 5.1
million is expected to be allocated to the Exchanges. The expenditures
associated with the Year 2000 Project are not expected to have a material
impact on the Company's results of operations, liquidity, or capital
resources. 

Marketing and Distribution. The P&C Group and FNWL operate under a common
trade name and logo - Farmers Insurance Group of Companies - and
distribute their respective insurance products in 29 states (primarily in
western and midwestern states) through a common network of 14,447 direct
writing agents and 497 district managers, each of whom is an independent
contractor. The size, efficiency and scope of this agency force have made it a
major factor in the Company's growth. Each agent is required to first submit
business to the insurers in Farmers Insurance Group of Companies within
the classes and lines of business written by such insurers. To the extent that
such insurers decline such business or do not underwrite it, the agents may
offer the business to other insurers. 

 The Farmers Insurance Group of Companies' agents direct their marketing
efforts toward family accounts and small businesses. They leverage these
relationships using an extensive portfolio of products to increase the number
of policies per household or account. The P&C Group's existing relationships
with nearly 8.5 million households provide a potential resource for future
growth in policies-in-force and life insurance sales. Management believes that
higher retention rates and profitability are achieved on business written with
households having multiple policies. 

 Farmers Insurance Group of Companies maintains its brand name
recognition throughout its operating territory through television, radio and
print advertising on both a national and local basis. The Farmers Agency
Information Management System provides the agency force with a marketing
advantage by delivering high-quality consumer focused service at the point of
sale. Furthermore, Farmers Insurance Group of Companies' formalized
policyholder recontact program, the "Farmers Friendly Review", builds customer
loyalty and provides a vehicle for enhanced policy retention and future
internal growth through the cross-selling of property and casualty and life
products. 

 In 1997, the P&C Group began offering preferred auto policies via direct
telemarketing operations in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State
of Maryland through Farmers Direct Insurance Company. The preferred
auto policies are offered through direct solicitation via direct mail,
television and other media. 
 
 Competition. Property and casualty insurance is a very competitive
industry with over 3,000 insurers. Many property and casualty insurers with a
small all-lines national market share have a significant market share within a
single state or a specialty market. The P&C Group competes through brand name
recognition of the Farmers Insurance Group of Companies, customer service,
product features, financial strength, price and the direct writing agency
force.

 There is substantial competition among insurance companies seeking
customers for the types of products sold by FNWL. Most of the 1,700 life
insurance companies in the United

9

States offer products similar to those offered by FNWL, and 
many use similar marketing techniques. Competitiveness in
the insurance business is affected by various factors including, but not
limited to, price, financial and claims-paying ratings, size and strength of
agency force, range of product lines, product quality, servicing ability and
general reputation. FNWL competes on the basis of customer service, product
features, financial strength and price. Many of FNWL's products contain
significant cash accumulation features; therefore, these products compete with
product offerings of banks, mutual funds and other financial institutions as
well.

Regulatory and Related Matters. The Insurance Subsidiaries and the P&C
Group are subject to extensive state regulatory oversight in the jurisdictions
in which they do business. The Company and the P&C Group are an 
insurance holding company system as defined by the insurance laws and
regulations of various jurisdictions. As such, certain transactions between an
insurance company and any other member company of the system, including
investments in subsidiaries and distributions by an insurance company to its
shareholders, are subject to regulation and oversight by the state of domicile
of the applicable insurance company. Insurers having insufficient statutory
capital and surplus are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action
depending on the level of capital inadequacy. As of December 31, 1997,
neither the P&C Group nor the Insurance Subsidiaries were subject to such
regulatory actions. Most of FNWL's and the P&C Group's business is subject to
regulation with respect to policy rates and related matters. In addition,
assessments are levied against FNWL and the P&C Group as a result of
participation in various types of mandatory state guaranty associations.
Existing federal laws and regulations affect the taxation of life insurance
products and insurance companies.

Investments

 During the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995, the Life
Insurance Subsidiaries had pretax net investment income and realized
investment gains of 306.4 million, 355.6 million, and 329.9 million,
respectively, and the Company other than the Life Insurance Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "FGI/Nonlife Account") had pretax net investment income
and realized investment gains of 217.6 million, 117.9 million, and 79.5
million, respectively. As of December 31, 1997, the book value of the FNWL
investment portfolio was approximately 3.9 billion and the book value of the
FGI/Nonlife Account investment portfolio was approximately 2.7 billion. Both
of these portfolios are managed by the Company's Investment Department in
accordance with investment policies approved by the Board of Directors of the
Company as well as the Investment Committee, which is comprised of 10 officers
of the Company appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company. 

 The Company's investment philosophy for both the FNWL portfolio and the
FGI/Nonlife Account portfolio emphasizes long-term fundamental value in the
selection of the investment mix. For FNWL, the assets backing the interest
sensitive portfolio are internally segregated along product lines in order to
closely match the funding assets with the underlying liabilities to
policyholders. The asset/liability matching system is the basis by which
credited interest rates are determined. Relatively short maturities are
maintained for the fixed income securities held in the FGI/Nonlife Account in
order to maintain capital preservation and to ensure liquidity. 

 The FNWL portfolio and the FGI/Nonlife Account portfolio are both
comprised of a broad range of assets, including corporate fixed income
securities, mortgage-backed securities, taxable and tax-exempt government
securities, preferred stock, common stock, owned real estate, commercial
mortgage loans and short-term instruments. The FNWL portfolio also includes
policy loans. Approximately 40.8 of the FGI/Nonlife Account portfolio
consists of notes issued by B.A.T 

10

Capital Corporation, a subsidiary of B.A.T, and surplus certificates issued
by the P&C Group. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" and
Notes D and S contained in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

 Approximately 92.9 of the fixed income securities in the FNWL portfolio
are rated investment grade and approximately 98.4 of the fixed income
securities in the FGI/Nonlife Account portfolio are rated investment grade.
Approximately 68.0 of the mortgage-backed securities in the FNWL portfolio
are guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA"),
Federal Housing Authority ("FHA"), Federal National Mortgage Association
("FNMA"), or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC"), and
approximately 32.0 are rated "AAA". Approximately 63.6 of the
mortgage-backed securities in the FGI/Nonlife Account portfolio are
guaranteed by GNMA, FHA, FNMA, or FHLMC, and approximately 36.4 are rated

Investment Accounting Policies. The Company follows the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities". This Statement addresses
the accounting and reporting for investments in equity securities that have
readily determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities.
As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company classified all investments in
equity and debt securities as available-for-sale under SFAS No. 115.
Correspondingly, these investments are reported on the balance sheet at
fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, excluded from
earnings and reported as a component of stockholder's equity. 

 11

 In compliance with a Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") staff
announcement, the Company has recorded certain entries to the Deferred Policy
Acquisition Costs ("DAC") and Value of Life Business Acquired line of the
consolidated balance sheet in connection with SFAS No. 115. The SEC requires
that companies record entries to those assets and liabilities that would have
been adjusted had the unrealized investment gains or losses from securities
classified as available-for-sale actually been realized, with corresponding
credits or charges reported directly to stockholder's equity.
	
 Bonds acquired prior to the December 31, 1988 acquisition of the Company
by B.A.T were marked-to-market at the time of the acquisition and the
resulting net writedown is being amortized over a period approximately equal
to the remaining time to maturity.

 Real estate investments are accounted for on a depreciated cost basis.
Real estate acquired in foreclosure and held for sale is carried at the lower
of fair value or depreciated cost less a valuation allowance. Short-term
instruments are carried at cost. Other investments, which consist primarily
of certificates in surplus of the Exchanges, policy loans and the B.A.T
Capital Corporation notes, are carried at the unpaid principal balances.

Fixed Income Securities. As of December 31, 1997, approximately 91.1 of
the FNWL portfolio and 23.1 of the FGI/Nonlife Account portfolio were
invested in fixed income securities. These investments include taxable and
tax-exempt government securities, domestic and foreign corporate bonds,
redeemable preferred stock and mortgage-backed securities. Approximately 92.9 
and 98.4 of the fixed income securities in the FNWL portfolio and FGI/Nonlife
Account portfolio, respectively, are rated investment grade. The following
table sets forth the market values of the various categories of fixed income
securities included within the portfolios as of December 31, 1997.

Credit Ratings. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners
("NAIC") maintains a valuation system that assigns quality ratings known as
"NAIC Designations" to publicly traded and privately placed fixed income
securities. The NAIC Designations range from 1 to 6, with categories 
1 (highest) and 2 considered investment grade and categories 3 through 6
(lowest) considered non-investment grade. As of December 31, 1997, FNWL held
 252.3 million in below investment grade bonds, representing 6.5 of total
invested assets, and the FGI/Nonlife Account portfolio held 7.8 million in
below investment grade bonds, representing 0.3 of total invested assets.

12

 Mortgage-backed Securities. Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") are the
largest component of FNWL's fixed income portfolio and represented
approximately 48.0 of its fixed income portfolio as of December 31, 1997.
The FGI/Nonlife Account's MBS represented approximately 11.0 of its fixed
income portfolio as of December 31, 1997. Approximately 68.0 of the MBS in
the FNWL portfolio are guaranteed by various government agencies and
government sponsored entities, including the GNMA, FHA, FNMA, or FHLMC, and
approximately 32.0 are rated "AAA". Approximately 63.6 of the MBS in the
FGI/Nonlife Account portfolio are guaranteed by GNMA, FHA, FNMA, or FHLMC, and
approximately 36.4 are rated "AAA". The primary risk in holding MBS is the
cash flow uncertainty that arises from changes to prepayment speeds as
interest rates fluctuate. To reduce the uncertainties surrounding the cash
flows of MBS, the FNWL portfolio held significant MBS investments in
collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs") including 702.5 million of
planned amortization classes ("PACs") and 52.2 million of targeted
amortization classes ("TACs"), and the FGI/Nonlife Account portfolio held
 30.8 million of PACs. These securities provide protection by passing a
substantial portion of the risk of prepayment uncertainty to other tranches. 

Equity Investments-Common Stock. In 1997, the Company restructured its
common stock portfolio to diversify and to limit its exposure in any one
market sector. As a result, the Company's common stock portfolio is
invested in the equities of many of the 3,000 largest United States Companies,
which represents approximately 98 of the investable United States equity
market.

 During 1997, FNWL participated in a class action lawsuit against
Structural Dynamics Research Corporation ("SDRC"). In settlement of this
lawsuit, the Company received both cash and common shares of SDRC. The cost
basis assigned to these common shares is zero, as any applicable costs of
purchasing the original shares was charged to previous years' earnings as a
result of the disposal of the securities. As of December 31, 1997, the fair
value of the SDRC common shares owned by FNWL was 120,000.

Commercial Mortgage Loans. As of December 31, 1997, the FNWL portfolio
included commercial mortgage loans with an aggregate book value of
approximately 89.9 million (net of loss provisions of 7.9 million), or 2.3 
of total invested assets, and the FGI/Nonlife Account portfolio included
commercial mortgage loans of 0.2 million.

 All commercial mortgage loans included in the FNWL portfolio are secured
by first mortgages. The majority of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio
consists of loans secured by office buildings, light industrial properties and
retail properties located primarily in unanchored shopping centers. Exposure
to potential losses from future commercial mortgage loan foreclosures and the
operation or sale of properties acquired through foreclosures is limited
because FNWL has not issued any commercial mortgage loans since 1989, and the
majority of the individual remaining commercial mortgage loan balances are
less than 1.0 million.

Owned Real Estate Investments. As of December 31, 1997, the FNWL
portfolio included owned real estate investments with a book value of 69.3
million (net of loss provisions of 4.3 million), or 1.8 of total invested
assets, and the FGI/Nonlife Account portfolio included owned real estate
investments with a book value of 63.5 million, or 2.4 of total
invested assets. The FNWL real estate holdings fall into two categories: real
property assets that were acquired directly as an equity investment and
foreclosed equity real estate properties. The FGI/Nonlife Account owned real
estate holdings were all acquired directly as equity investments.

13

 Problem Investments-Fixed Income Securities. As of December 31, 1997,
none of the fixed income securities held in the FNWL or the FGI/Nonlife
Account portfolios were classified as "problem" or "potential problem"
assets.

 Problem Investments-Mortgage Loan Investments. As of December 31, 1997, 
none of the mortgage loans held by the FNWL or the FGI/Nonlife Account were
classified as "troubled loans". 

ITEM 2. Properties

 The Company owns three buildings in Los Angeles, six regional offices, 
seven business support centers and 1 commercial claims center in which its
administrative operations are conducted. In addition, the Company owns a
building in Washington in which the operations of FNWL are conducted.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings

 The Company is a party to numerous lawsuits arising from its normal 
business activities. These actions are in various stages of discovery and 
development, and some seek punitive as well as compensatory damages. In the 
opinion of management, the Company has not engaged in any conduct which 
should warrant the award of any material punitive or compensatory damages. 
The Company intends to vigorously defend its position in each case, and 
management believes that, while it is not possible to predict the outcome 
of such matters with absolute certainty, ultimate disposition of these 
proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on the Company's 
consolidated results of operations or financial position. In addition, the 
Company is, from time to time, involved as a party in various governmental 
and administrative proceedings.

ITEM 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

 There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the 
year ended December 31, 1997.

ITEM 6. Selected Financial Data

 The following table sets forth summary consolidated income statement 
data, consolidated balance sheet data and other operating data for the 
periods indicated. The following consolidated income statement data of the 
Company for each of the years in the five-year period ended December 31, 
1997, and the consolidated balance sheet data of the Company as of December 
31, 1997 and each of the preceding four years ended December 31, have been 
derived from the Company's audited consolidated financial statements. The 
following data should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated 
Financial Statements and related notes, "Management's Discussion and Analysis 
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and other financial 
information appearing elsewhere herein. 

 Income statement data includes the effect of amortizing the purchase 
accounting entries related to the acquisition of the Company by B.A.T in 
December 1988. See Note A to the Company's Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Major items incorporated in the purchase price of the Company 
include goodwill and the value of the AIF contracts of the P&C Group. 
The amortization of these two items, which is being taken on a straight-line 
basis over forty years, reduced annual pretax income by approximately 102.8 
million in each of the years 1993 through 1997.

 Subsidiaries, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1994.
(2) Includes cash, short-term investments and notes receivable-affiliate.
(3) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges has been determined by dividing 
 the sum of net income before income taxes plus fixed charges by fixed 
 charges. Fixed charges consist of interest, capitalized interest, 
 dividends paid to QUIPS holders, amortization of QUIPS offering expenses 
 and that portion of rent expenses deemed to be interest.

ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
 Results of Operations

General

 The Company's principal activities are the management of property and
casualty insurance companies and the underwriting of life insurance and
annuity products. Revenues and expenses relating to both of these principal
business activities are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, which differs from SAP, which
FNWL is required to use for regulatory reporting purposes. 

 The Company underwrites life insurance and annuity products through FNWL.
Revenues attributable to traditional life insurance products, such as whole
life or term life contracts, are classified as premiums as they become due.
Future benefits are associated with such premiums (through increases in
liabilities for future policy benefits), and prior period capitalized costs
are amortized (through amortization of DAC) so that profits are generally
recognized over the same period as revenue income. Revenues attributable to
universal life products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance,
policy administration charges, surrender charges, and investment income on
assets allocated to support policyholder account balances on deposit. Revenues
for deferred annuity products consist of surrender charges and investment
income on assets allocated to support policyholder account balances. Expenses
on universal life and annuity policies include interest credited to
policyholders on policy balances as well as benefit claims incurred in excess
of policy account balances.

Year Ended December 31, 1997 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1996

 Management Services to Property and Casualty Insurance Companies; and Other

 Operating Revenues. Operating revenues increased from 1,245.4 million in
1996 to 1,324.9 million in 1997, an increase of 79.5 million, or 6.4 .
Operating revenues primarily consist of management fees paid to the Company as
a percentage of gross premiums earned by the P&C Group. Such premiums
increased from 9,458.2 million in 1996 to 10,070.1 million in 1997 due
primarily to higher average premium levels for the Auto and Fire lines of
business and an increase in the number of policies-in-force between years
reflecting stricter enforcement of the California mandatory auto insurance
law following enactment of California Assembly Bill 650 and the P&C Group's
re-entry into the California homeowners' market. Partially offsetting these
increases is the fact that, in recognition of expense savings realized as a
result of improved operating efficiencies, the Company waived an additional
0.43 from the Farmers Preferred Auto Management fee rate that was in effect
prior to November 1, 1996. This rate waiver resulted in a 22.3 million
reduction in management fees in 1997 from what such fees would have
been using the rates in effect during 1996. 

 Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses as a percentage of
operating revenues decreased from 56.0 in 1996 to 55.6 in 1997, a decrease
of 0.4 . Although total operating expenses increased by 5.7 , this increase
was less than the 6.4 increase in operating revenues. Specifically, the
Company continued to benefit from staffing efficiencies and improved
information technology systems and hence was able to control its labor costs,
reducing salaries and employee benefits from 27.1 of operating revenues in
1996 to 25.3 of operating revenues in 1997. 

17

Salaries and Employee Benefits. Salaries and employee benefits
 decreased from 337.2 million in 1996 to 335.8 million in 1997, a
 decrease of 1.4 million, or 0.4 , primarily due to a reduction in
 employee complement.

 Buildings and Equipment Expenses. Buildings and equipment expenses
 increased from 87.3 million in 1996 to 95.8 million in 1997, an
 increase of 8.5 million, or 9.7 . This increase was primarily due to
 higher amortization expense associated with information technology
 systems software.

 Amortization of AIF Contracts and Goodwill. The purchase 
 accounting entries related to the acquisition of the Company by 
 B.A.T in December 1988 include goodwill (capitalized at 2.4 
 billion) and the value of the AIF contracts of the P&C Group 
 (capitalized at 1.7 billion). The amortization of these two items,
 which is being taken on a straight-line basis over forty years, 
 reduced pretax income by approximately 102.8 million for both 1997 
 and 1996.

 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative
 expenses increased from 170.3 million in 1996 to 202.6 million in 1997,
 an increase of 32.3 million, or 19.0 . This increase was primarily due
 to higher expenses attributable to increased business levels and the
 re-entry of the P&C Group into the California homeowners' market. Also
 contributing to the increase in expense was a 4.6 million increase in
 costs associated with the modification of existing computer program logic 
 to accommodate years 2000 and beyond (Year 2000 Project).

 Net Investment Income. Net investment income increased from 112.8
million in 1996 to 144.2 million in 1997, an increase of 31.4 million, or
27.8 . This increase was primarily due to a larger invested asset base as a
result of the common stock received as part of a 374.9 million dividend from
FNWL to Farmers Group, Inc. in December 1996 and the reinvestment of cash
generated by the sale of OSL and IGL. 

 Net Realized Gains. Net realized gains increased from 5.1 million in
1996 to 73.4 million in 1997, an increase of 68.3 million, due primarily to
gains realized on equities formerly held by FNWL that were sold while
restructuring the portfolio. 

 Gain on Sale of Subsidiaries. The estimated gain on the April 15, 1997
sale of OSL and IGL amounted to 19.0 million in 1997.

 Dividends on Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trusts. Dividends expense
related to the 500.0 million of Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred
Securities ("QUIPS") issued in 1995 was 42.1 million in both 1996 and 1997.

 Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes increased from
 275.1 million in 1996 to 332.2 million in 1997, an increase of 57.1
million, or 20.8 . This increase was due to the increase in pretax 
income between years and an estimated 26.8 million of taxes associated with
the sale of OSL and IGL.

 Management Services Income. As a result of the foregoing, management 
services income increased from 348.5 million for the year ended December 31,
1996 to 450.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1997, an increase of 
 101.7 million, or 29.2 .

18

Life Insurance Subsidiaries

 On April 15, 1997, OSL and IGL were sold to Great Southern Life Insurance
Company, a subsidiary of Americo Life, Inc.. OSL and IGL contributed 5.5
million to net income in 1997, compared to 17.2 million in 1996 and 11.6
million in 1995. The following commentary addresses the results of the
Company's remaining life insurance subsidiary, FNWL.

 Total Revenues. Total revenues increased from 613.3 million in 1996 
to 638.6 million in 1997, an increase of 25.3 million, or 4.1 .

 Premiums. Premiums increased 15.0 million, or 11.0 , between years.
 This increase was due to growth in renewal and first year business. The
 increase in renewal premiums was attributable to a 12.2 growth in
 traditional life insurance in-force due in part to an increase in average
 policy size resulting from sales of the Premier Whole Life ("PWL")
 product. The higher first year premiums were due primarily to growth in
 sales of the PWL product.

 Policy Charges. Policy charges increased 12.5 million, or 6.6 ,
 over 1996, reflecting a 4.2 growth in universal life-type insurance in-
 force.

 Investment Income. Net investment income increased 17.9 million
 in 1997, or 6.9 , over 1996 due largely to higher bond interest income 
 resulting primarily from an increase in bond investments.

 Net Realized Gains. Net realized gains decreased by 20.1 million,
 from 30.2 million in 1996 to 10.1 million in 1997 due to the fact that
 FNWL's common stock portfolio was transferred to Farmers Group, Inc. as
 part of the 1996 dividend.

 Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses increased from
 399.9 million in 1996 to 427.0 million in 1997, an increase of 27.1
million, or 6.8 .

 Policyholders' Benefits. Policyholders' benefits expense increased
 from 260.3 million in 1996 to 274.5 million in 1997, an increase of
 14.2 million, or 5.5 . Policy benefits, which consist primarily of
 death and surrender benefits on life products, increased 1.5 million
 over 1996 due to an increase in death claims resulting from an increase
 in insurance-in-force. Increase in liability for future benefits
 expense increased from 11.4 million in 1996 to 15.7 million in 1997.
 This increase was primarily attributable to lower terminations on older
 whole life business carrying higher future benefit provisions and the
 effect of PWL sales in 1997 and 1996. Interest credited to
 policyholders, which represents the amount credited under universal
 life-type contracts and deferred annuities for policyholder funds on
 deposit, increased from 138.0 million in 1996 to 146.4 million in 1997,
 or 6.1 , reflecting a 4.2 growth in universal life-type insurance
 in-force and a 3.5 increase in annuity funds on deposit.

 Amortization of DAC and Value of Life Business Acquired. 
 Amortization expense increased from 60.4 million in 1996 to 73.7 
 million in 1997, or 22.0 . This increase reflects the continued 
 growth in the volume of universal life-type and traditional business 
 in-force.

 Commissions. Commissions decreased from 18.3 million in 1996 to
 17.3 million in 1997, or 5.5 . The decrease results from the
 commutation, by IGL in the third quarter of 1997, of the block of
 business ceded to FNWL under the Yearly Renewable Term reinsurance
 treaty.

 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative 
 expenses increased from 60.9 million in 1996 to 61.5 million in 1997,
 or 1.0 , due primarily to higher legal and

19

 consulting fees. Also contributing to the increase in expense was a
 0.1 million increase in costs associated with the Year 2000 Project. 

 Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes increased from
 71.1 million in 1996 to 73.8 million in 1997, an increase of 2.7 million,
due to a decrease in tax preference items, particularly tax exempt interest. 

 FNWL Income. As a result of the foregoing, FNWL income decreased from
 142.3 million in 1996 to 137.8 million in 1997, a decrease of 4.5 million,
or 3.2 .

 Consolidated Net Income

 Consolidated net income of the Company increased from 507.9 million in 
1996 to 593.5 million in 1997, an increase of 85.6 million, or 16.9 . 

Year Ended December 31, 1996 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1995

 Management Services to Property and Casualty Insurance Companies; and Other

 Operating Revenues. Operating revenues increased from 1,183.1 million in
1995 to 1,245.4 million in 1996, an increase of 62.3 million, or 5.3 . This
growth reflects higher gross premiums earned by the P&C Group, which increased
from 9,003.8 million in 1995 to 9,458.2 million in 1996 due primarily to
higher average premium levels across all major lines of business and an
increase in the number of policies-in-force between years. Partially
offsetting these increases is a 0.45 reduction in the Farmers Preferred Auto
Management fee rate, effective November 1, 1996. This resulted in a 4.1
million reduction in management fees in 1996 from what such fees would have
been using the 1995 rates. 

 Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses as a percentage of
operating revenues decreased from 58.9 in 1995 to 56.0 in 1996, a decrease
of 2.9 . Specifically, labor costs (salaries and employee benefits) decreased
from 29.5 of operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 1995 to 27.1 
of operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 1996. 
 
 Salaries and Employee Benefits. Salaries and employee benefits
 decreased from 348.8 million in 1995 to 337.2 million in 1996, a
 decrease of 11.6 million, or 3.3 , primarily due to a reduction in
 employee complement.

 Buildings and Equipment Expenses. Buildings and equipment expenses
 increased from 75.1 million in 1995 to 87.3 million in 1996, an
 increase of 12.2 million, or 16.2 . This increase was primarily due to
 the amortization of new information technology systems software, offset
 in part by a decrease in computer mainframe related expenses.

 Amortization of AIF Contracts and Goodwill. Amortization expense 
 was 102.8 million in both 1996 and 1995. These assets are being 
 amortized on a straight-line basis over forty years. 

 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative
 expenses decreased 0.2 million between years, from 170.5 million in
 1995 to 170.3 million in 1996.

20

 Net Investment Income. Net investment income increased from 78.0
million in 1995 to 112.8 million in 1996, an increase of 34.8 million,
or 44.6 . This increase was primarily due to higher yield rates and a larger
invested asset base in 1996.

 Net Realized Gains. Net realized gains increased from 1.5 million in
1995 to 5.1 million in 1996, an increase of 3.6 million, due mainly to gains
realized on sales of bonds and investment real estate. 
	
 Dividends on Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trusts. As a result
of the 500.0 million of QUIPS issued in September and October 1995, dividend
expense increased from 10.4 million in 1995 to 42.1 million in 1996. 

 Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes increased from
 224.3 million in 1995 to 275.2 million in 1996, an increase of 50.9
million, or 22.7 . This increase was due in part to 22.5 million of taxes
that resulted from the 374.9 million dividend paid to FGI by FNWL in
December 1996. The remaining increase was attributable to an increase in
pretax income between years. 

 Management Services Income. As a result of the foregoing, management
services income increased from 330.8 million for the year ended December 31,
1995 to 348.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1996, an increase of
 17.7 million, or 5.4 . 

Life Insurance Subsidiaries

 On April 15, 1997, OSL and IGL were sold to Great Southern Life Insurance
Company, a subsidiary of Americo Life, Inc.. OSL and IGL contributed 17.2
million to net income in 1996 and 11.6 million in 1995. The following
commentary addresses the results of the Company's remaining life insurance
subsidiary, FNWL.

 Total Revenues. Total revenues increased from 558.4 million in 1995 
to 613.3 million in 1996, an increase of 54.9 million, or 9.8 .

 Premiums. Premiums increased 12.2 million, or 9.8 , over 1995.
 This increase was due to growth in renewal and first year business.
 The increase in renewal premiums was attributable to an 11.9 growth in
 traditional life insurance in-force resulting from improved persistency
 and an increase in average policy size. The higher first year premiums
 were due primarily to growth in PWL and Mortgage Protection Plan
 products. 

 Policy charges. Policy charges increased 18.5 million, or 10.9 ,
 over 1995, reflecting an 8.5 growth in universal life-type
 insurance-in-force.

 Investment income. Net investment income increased 17.3 million in
 1996, or 7.2 , over 1995 due largely to higher bond interest income
 resulting from a higher invested asset base.

 Net realized gains. Net realized gains increased by 6.9 million in
 1996 due primarily to gains realized on common stock as a result of
 favorable market conditions.

 Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses increased from 
 369.9 million in 1995 to 399.9 million in 1996, an increase of 30.0 
million, or 8.1 . 

 Policyholders' Benefits. Policyholders' benefits expense increased
 from 241.4 million in 1995 to 260.3 million in 1996, an increase of
 18.9 million, or 7.8 . Policy benefits increased 4.9 million over 1995
 primarily due to an increase in death claims resulting from higher
 average

21

insurance-in-force. Increase in liability for future
benefits expense increased from 10.5 million in 1995 to 11.4 million in
1996, or 8.6 . This increase was primarily due to increases in PWL and other
traditional product premiums and to lower terminations in 1996. Interest
credited to policyholders increased from 124.9 million in 1995 to 138.0
million in 1996, or 10.5 , reflecting an 8.5 growth in universal life-type
insurance in-force and a 7.3 increase in annuity funds on deposit.

 Amortization of DAC and Value of Life Business Acquired.
 Amortization expense increased from 50.5 million in 1995 to 60.4
 million in 1996, or 19.6 , reflecting the continued growth in universal
 life-type business and lower traditional terminations in 1996.

 Commissions. Commissions increased from 17.7 million in 1995 to
 18.3 million in 1996, reflecting increased renewal premiums from
 traditional and universal life products.

 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative
 expenses increased from 60.3 million in 1995 to 60.9 million in 1996,
 or 1.0 , due to higher salaries and benefits expense.

 Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes increased
from 60.2 million in 1995 to 71.1 million in 1996, an increase of 10.9
million. This increase was attributable to the increase in pretax operating
income.

 FNWL Income. As a result of the foregoing, FNWL income increased from
 128.3 million in 1995 to 142.3 million in 1996, an increase of 14.0
million, or 10.9 .
 
 Consolidated Net Income 
 
 Consolidated net income of the Company increased from 470.7 million in
1995 to 507.9 million in 1996, an increase of 37.2 million, or 7.9 .

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 General. The principal uses of funds by the Company are (i) operating
expenses, (ii) dividends to the shareholders of the Company's QUIPS, (iii)
capital expenditures and (iv) dividends to its stockholder. In 1997,
dividends paid on the QUIPS totaled 42.1 million, capital expenditures
totaled 66.2 million and cash dividends paid to the stockholder totaled
 337.2 million.

 The principal sources of funds available to the Company are (i) the
management fees that it receives for managing the P&C Group, (ii) investment
income and (iii) dividends from its subsidiaries. Historically, funds
available from the first two of these sources have been sufficient to satisfy
the liquidity needs of the Company, and the Company anticipates that such
funds will continue to be adequate to satisfy such needs in the future. A
portion of the net income of FNWL is available for payment as a dividend to
the Company, subject to certain limitations imposed by the insurance laws of
the State of Washington and additional state taxation. As of December 31,
1997, an aggregate of 122.7 million was available for distribution as a
dividend without approval of the state insurance department (see Note G).
Additionally, as of December 31, 1997, the Company had available revolving
credit facilities enabling it to borrow up to 500.0 million in the event such
a need should arise (see Note T). 

 In order to maintain the policyholders' surplus of the Exchanges, the
Company has purchased approximately 850.0 million of surplus certificates of
the Exchanges 400.0 million of which were purchased in 1996, 250.0 million
of which were purchased in 1995 and 200.0

 22

million of which were purchased in 1986 and repaid in 1996, see Note D).
In addition, in 1991, the Company arranged for two subsidiaries of B.A.T
to purchase an aggregate of 400.0 million of surplus notes of two
subsidiaries of the Exchanges. The Company has, from time to time, made
other surplus contributions to the Exchanges totaling approximately 34.4
million, receiving certificates of contribution which bear interest at various
rates. The Company believes that these purchases of surplus certificates and
notes have helped to support the historical growth in premiums earned and the
related growth in management fees paid to the Company. 

 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased from 688.7 million
in 1996 to 655.4 million in 1997, a decrease in cash of 33.3 million, or
4.8 . This decrease in cash was principally due to a 34.9 million decrease
in Universal life type contracts as a result of a reduction in new life
business due to the sale of OSL and IGL. In addition, cash decreased 89.1
million due to an increase in non-current assets. The above decreases in cash
were partially offset by a 85.6 million increase in consolidated net income. 

 Net cash used in investing activities decreased from 532.1 million in
1996 to 351.9 million in 1997, an increase in cash of 180.2 million, or
33.9 , between years. This increase in cash was principally due to 336.7
million of proceeds received from the sale of OSL and IGL and a 200.0 million
net decrease in the purchase of surplus certificates of the Exchanges between
years 0 in 1997 versus a net 200.0 million purchase in 1996). Partially
offsetting this increase in cash was an increase in net purchases of
investments available-for-sale of 381.5 million. 

 Net cash used in financing activities decreased 570.3 million in 1996 to
 286.5 million in 1997, an increase in cash of 283.8 million, or 49.8 .
This increase in cash was primarily due to the repayment of 200.0 million of
8.25 Notes Payable in July 1996 and the fact that cash dividends paid to
B.A.T decreased 127.7 million, from 464.9 million in 1996 to 337.2 million
in 1997.

Life Insurance Subsidiary. The principal uses of funds by FNWL are (i)
policy benefits and claims, (ii) loans to policyholders, (iii) capital
expenditures, (iv) operating expenses, and (v) stockholder's dividends.
The principal sources of funds available to FNWL are premiums and amounts
earned from the investment of premiums and deposits. These sources of funds
have historically satisfied the liquidity needs of FNWL.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors of Farmers Group, Inc.

 We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Farmers Group, Inc. 
and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the 
related consolidated statements of income, stockholder's equity, and cash 
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997. 
Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the 
Index at Item 14. These financial statements and financial statement 
schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and 
financial statement schedules based on our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, 
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of 
December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of its operations and its 
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 
1997 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, 
in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in 
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, 
present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

 FARMERS GROUP, INC.
 AND SUBSIDIARIES
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A. Basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies

 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). All material
inter-company transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts applicable
to prior years have been reclassified to conform with the 1997 presentation.
The consolidated financial statements include Farmers Group, Inc. ("FGI") and
its subsidiaries (together, the "Company"). On April 15, 1997, FGI sold two
of its life insurance subsidiaries, The Ohio State Life Insurance Company
("OSL") and Investors Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("IGL"), to Great
Southern Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Americo Life, Inc.. As a
result, the 1997 balance sheet information includes FGI and its remaining life
insurance subsidiary, Farmers New World Life Insurance Company ("FNWL"),
whereas the 1996 information includes FGI as well as FNWL, OSL, and IGL (the
"Life Insurance Subsidiaries").
	 
 In December 1988, BATUS Inc. ("BATUS"), a subsidiary of B.A.T Industries
p.l.c. ("B.A.T"), acquired 100 ownership of the Company for 5,212,619,000 in
cash, including related expenses, through its wholly owned subsidiary BATUS
Financial Services. Immediately thereafter, BATUS Financial Services was
merged into Farmers Group, Inc.. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase and, accordingly, the acquired assets and liabilities were recorded
in the Company's consolidated balance sheets based on their estimated fair
values at December 31, 1988. In January 1990, ownership of the Company was
transferred to South Western Nominees Limited, a subsidiary of B.A.T. 

 On December 22, 1997, a definitive agreement was reached to merge B.A.T
Industries' Financial Services Businesses ("BAFS") with Zurich Insurance
Company ("Zurich"). Completion of the merger is subject to regulatory
consents, tax clearance and the approval of the shareholders of B.A.T and
Zurich, and is expected to be finalized in late 1998. Under the 
agreement, the businesses of Zurich and BAFS, which include Farmers Group,
Inc., will be transferred to Zurich Financial Services, a new Swiss company
with headquarters in Zurich.

 The Company is attorney-in-fact ("AIF") for three inter-insurance
exchanges: Farmers Insurance Exchange, Fire Insurance Exchange and Truck
Insurance Exchange (collectively the "Exchanges"), which operate in the
property and casualty insurance industry. As attorney-in-fact, FGI, or its
subsidiaries, as applicable, manages the affairs of the Exchanges, their
respective subsidiaries and Farmers Texas County Mutual Insurance Company
(collectively the "P&C Group") and receives compensation based on a percentage
of earned premiums. The management services generate a substantial portion of
the Company's revenue and profits, and as a result, the Company's ongoing
financial performance depends on the volume of business written by, and the
efficiency and financial strength of, the P&C Group. A portion of the
purchase price 1,709,043,000) associated with the acquisition was assigned
to these AIF contract relationships. The value so assigned is being amortized
on a straight-line basis over forty years. 

31

The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets
("Goodwill") of the Company at the date of acquisition 2,401,755,000) is
being amortized on a straight-line basis over forty years. The carrying amount
of the Goodwill is regularly reviewed for indications of impairment in value
which in the view of management are other than temporary, including unexpected
or adverse changes in the following: (1) the economic or competitive
environments in which the Company operates, (2) profitability analyses and
(3) cashflow analyses. As of December 31, 1997, the reported value and the
remaining life of Goodwill are considered appropriate. 

 Prior to April 15, 1997 the Company's life insurance operations were
conducted by its three wholly owned subsidiaries. A portion of the purchase
price 662,778,000) was assigned to the "Value of Life Business Acquired",
which represented an actuarial determination of the expected profits from the
business in force at the date of acquisition. The amount so assigned is
being amortized over its actuarially determined useful life with the
unamortized amount included in "Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of
Life Business Acquired" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

 On April 15, 1997, upon receipt of regulatory approval, the Company sold
OSL and IGL. The sale of these subsidiaries resulted in an estimated
 19,019,000 gain and was reported on the "Gain on sale of subsidiaries" line
of the income statement. In addition, taxes associated with the sale
increased current year tax expense by an estimated 26,826,000 and were
reflected on the "Provision for income taxes" line. Both of these amounts
were reflected in the "Management services to property and casualty insurance
companies; and other" section of the Company's consolidated income statement
for the year ended December 31, 1997. The decision to sell these subsidiaries
was part of the Company's strategic plan to focus its life insurance efforts
on the growth of FNWL, by far its largest insurance company, through increased
sales to the P&C Group's customer base. FNWL markets a broad line of
individual life insurance products, including universal life, term life and
whole life insurance, and annuity products, predominately flexible premium
deferred annuities. These products and services are sold directly by the
Exchanges' agents. 

 Properties are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives: 

 Buildings and improvements 10 to 35 years
 Furniture and equipment 5 to 10 years
 Data processing equipment and software 5 years

 Depreciation is calculated for financial statement purposes by the 
straight-line method. Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations; 
significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. 

 In 1997, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 125,
"Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities". This Statement establishes accounting and
reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and
extinguishments of liabilities based on a consistent application of a
financial-components approach that focuses on the issue of control. This
Statement was amended by SFAS No. 127, "The Deferral of the Effective Date of
Certain Provisions of FASB Statement No. 125", which delays for one year the
effective date of the provisions that apply to certain transactions. These
transactions include repurchase agreements, dollar-rolls, securities lending,
secured borrowings and collateral. The adoption of these Statements did not
have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

32

In February 1997, the FASB released SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share".
This Statement, effective for financial statements issued for periods ending
after December 15, 1997, establishes standards for computing and presenting
earnings per share and applies to entities with publicly held common stock or
potential common stock. The Company does not have any publicly held common
stock and, therefore, is not subject to the requirements of this Statement.

 In February 1997, the FASB released SFAS No. 129, "Disclosure of
Information about Capital Structure". This Statement, effective for financial
statements issued for periods ending after December 15, 1997, establishes
standards for disclosing information about an entity's capital structure.
This Statement eliminates the exemption of nonpublic entities from certain
disclosure requirements of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 15,
"Earnings Per Share", as provided by SFAS No. 21, "Suspension of the
Reporting of Earnings per Share and Segment Information by Nonpublic
Enterprises". The adoption of this Statement did not have a significant
impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

 In June 1997, the FASB released SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive
Income". This Statement, effective for fiscal periods beginning after
December 15, 1997, establishes standards for reporting and displaying
comprehensive income and its components. This Statement requires that all
items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as
components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement with
the same prominence as other financial statements. The Company does not
expect the adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements. 

 In June 1997, the FASB released SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information". This Statement, effective for
financial statements of public enterprises issued for periods beginning after
December 15, 1997, establishes standards for reporting information about
operating segments in annual financial statements and requires the reporting
of selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports
issued to shareholders. It also establishes standards for related disclosures
about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. This
Statement supersedes SFAS No. 14, "Financial Reporting for Segments of a
Business Enterprise" and amends SFAS No. 94, "Consolidation of All
Majority-Owned Subsidiaries". The Company does not expect the adoption of
this Statement to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial
statements.

 The preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

B. Life insurance accounting

 Traditional product premiums are recognized as revenues when they become
due, and future benefits and expenses are matched with such premiums so that
the majority of profits are recognized over the premium-paying period of the
policy. This matching of revenues and expenses is accomplished through the
provision for future policy benefits and the amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs ("DAC").

 Certain policy acquisition costs, principally first-year commissions and
other expenses for policy underwriting and issuance (which are primarily
related to and vary with the production of new

33

business), are deferred and amortized proportionately over the estimated
period during which the related premiums will be recognized as income, based
on the same assumptions that are used for computing the liabilities for
future policy benefits. Liabilities for future policy benefits are computed
principally by means of a net level premium method reflecting estimated future
investment yields, mortality, morbidity and withdrawals. Interest rate
assumptions range from 2.25 to 9.25 , depending on the year of policy issue.
Mortality is calculated principally on select and ultimate tables in common
usage in the industry, modified for the Life Insurance Subsidiaries'
experience, and withdrawals are estimated based primarily on the Life
Insurance Subsidiaries' experience.

 Revenues associated with universal life products consist of policy
charges for the cost of insurance, policy administration fees, surrender
charges and investment income on assets allocated to support policyholder
account balances. Revenues for deferred annuity products consist of surrender
charges and investment income on assets allocated to support policyholder
account balances. Expenses include interest credited to policyholder account
balances and benefit claims incurred in excess of policyholder account
balances. Liabilities for future policy benefits on universal life and
deferred annuity products are determined under the retrospective deposit
method. DAC is amortized in relation to the present value of expected gross
profit margins on the policies, after giving recognition to differences
between actual and expected gross profit margins to date. DAC and Value of
Life Business Acquired also includes amounts associated with the unrealized
gains and losses recorded as a component of stockholder's equity in accordance
with the application of SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities". Accordingly, DAC and Value of Life Business
Acquired is increased or decreased for the impact on estimated future gross
profits as if net unrealized gains or losses on securities had been realized
at the balance sheet date. Net unrealized gains or losses on securities
within stockholder's equity also reflects this impact. These entries
decreased the DAC and Value of Life Business Acquired asset by 43,447,000 and
 27,927,000 as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

cost as of December 31 follows:

 =========== ===========

D. Certificates in surplus of Exchanges

 The Company, as attorney-in-fact for the Exchanges, has made surplus 
contributions to the Exchanges from time to time. In return, the Company has
received the following certificates of contribution totaling 684,380,000 as
of December 31, 1997:

 A 100,000,000 certificate of contribution, issued on December 20, 1996,
 bearing interest at 8.95 annually.

 A 135,000,000 certificate of contribution, issued on September 30, 1996,
 bearing interest at 8.95 annually.

34

A 165,000,000 certificate of contribution, issued on June 27, 1996, 
 bearing interest at 8.95 annually.

 A 250,000,000 certificate of contribution, issued in 1995, bearing 
 interest at 8.95 annually.

 Miscellaneous other certificates of contribution totaling 34,380,000 
 which bear interest at various rates.

 Conditions governing repayment of these amounts are outlined in the
certificates. Generally, repayment may be made only when the surplus balance
of the appropriate Exchange reaches a certain specified level, and then only
after approval is granted by the Exchange Board of Governors and the
California Insurance Commissioner.

 On July 1, 1996, the Company received 200,000,000 from the Exchanges in
repayment of a surplus contribution made by the Company in 1986.

E. Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of
 Subsidiary Trusts Holding Solely Junior Subordinate Debentures

 In 1995, Farmers Group Capital and Farmers Group Capital II (the 
"Subsidiary Trusts"), consolidated wholly owned subsidiaries of Farmers 
Group, Inc., issued 410 million of 8.45 Cumulative Quarterly Income 
Preferred Securities ("QUIPS"), Series A and 90 million of 8.25 QUIPS, 
Series B, respectively. In connection with the Subsidiary Trusts' issuance 
of the QUIPS and the related purchase by Farmers Group, Inc. of all of the
Subsidiary Trusts' Common Securities ("Common Securities"), Farmers Group,
Inc. issued to Farmers Group Capital 422,680,399 principal amount of its
8.45 Junior Subordinated Debentures, Series A due on December 31, 2025,
(the "Junior Subordinated Debentures, Series A") and issued to Farmers Group
Capital II 92,783,505 principal amount of its 8.25 Junior Subordinated
Debentures, Series B due on December 31, 2025 (the "Junior Subordinated
Debentures, Series B" and, together with the Junior Subordinated Debentures,
Series A, the "Junior Subordinated Debentures"). The sole assets of Farmers
Group Capital are the Junior Subordinated Debentures, Series A. The sole
assets of Farmers Group Capital II are the Junior Subordinated Debentures,
Series B. In addition, these arrangements are governed by various agreements
between Farmers Group, Inc. and the Subsidiary Trusts (the Guarantee
Agreements, the Trust Agreements, the Expense Agreements, the Indentures and
the Junior Subordinated Debentures) which considered together constitute a
full and unconditional guarantee by Farmers Group, Inc. of the Subsidiary
Trusts' obligations under the Preferred Securities.

 Under certain circumstances, the Junior Subordinated Debentures may be
distributed to holders of the QUIPS and holders of the Common Securities in
liquidation of the Subsidiary Trusts. The QUIPS are subject to mandatory
redemption upon repayment of the Junior Subordinated Debentures at maturity, 
or upon their earlier redemption, at a redemption price of 25 per Preferred
Security, plus accrued and unpaid distributions thereon to the date fixed for
redemption. Farmers Group, Inc. will have the option at any time on or after
September 27, 2000 to redeem, in whole or part, the Junior Subordinated
Debentures.

 As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, a total of 20,000,000 shares of QUIPS
were outstanding.

35

F. Employees' profit sharing plans

 The Company has two profit sharing plans providing for cash payments to 
all eligible employees. The two plans, Cash Profit Sharing (consisting of 
Cash and Cash Plus) and Deferred Profit Sharing, provide for a maximum 
aggregate expense of 16.25 of the Company's consolidated annual pretax 
earnings, as adjusted. The Deferred Profit Sharing Plan, limited to 15 of 
the salary or wage paid or accrued to the eligible employee, provides for 
an annual payment by the Company to a trust for eventual payment to employees 
as provided in the Plan. The Cash Profit Sharing Plan provides for annual 
cash distributions limited to 5 (Cash) and 1.25 (Cash Plus) of the salary 
or wage paid or accrued to the eligible employee. 

 Expense under these plans was 52,235,000, 55,772,000, and 55,070,000
in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. 

G. Retained earnings

 Combined statutory capital and surplus of the Life Insurance Subsidiaries
was 894,738,000 as of December 31, 1996 and combined statutory net income was
 167,517,000 and 116,998,000 for the years ended December 31, 1996, and 1995,
respectively. Due to the sale of OSL and IGL on April 15, 1997, statutory
capital and surplus as of December 31, 1997 reflects only the results of the
Company's remaining life insurance subsidiary, FNWL. However, statutory
net income for the year ended December 31, 1997, reflects the results of FNWL
for the year and the results of OSL and IGL through the date of sale. As a
result, statutory capital and surplus of FNWL was 817,588,000, and statutory
net income of the Life Insurance Subsidiaries was 122,863,000 for the year. 
 
 In December 1996, upon approval of the Washington State Department of
Insurance, FNWL paid a 374,916,000 dividend to its parent company, Farmers
Group, Inc., which consisted primarily of common stock investments. As of
December 31, 1997, an aggregate of 122,667,000 was still available for
distribution without approval from the State Department of Insurance in
Washington, the state in which FNWL is domiciled.

H. Investments

 The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 115. This Statement
addresses the accounting and reporting for investments in equity securities
that have readily determinable fair values and for all investments in debt
securities. As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company classified all
investments in equity and debt securities as available-for-sale under SFAS
No. 115. Correspondingly, these investments are reported on the balance sheet
at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, excluded from
earnings and reported as a component of stockholder's equity. Real estate
investments are accounted for on a depreciated cost basis. Real estate
acquired in foreclosure and held for sale is carried at the lower of fair
value or depreciated cost less a valuation allowance. Short-term instruments
are carried at cost. Other investments, which consist primarily of
certificates in surplus of the Exchanges, policy loans and the B.A.T
Capital Corporation notes, are carried at the unpaid principal balances.

 In compliance with a Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") staff
announcement, the Company has recorded certain entries to the DAC and Value
of Life Business Acquired line of the consolidated balance sheet in connection
with SFAS No. 115. The SEC requires that companies record entries to those
assets and liabilities that would have been adjusted had the unrealized

I. Equity-indexed annuities

 During 1997, FNWL began selling an equity-indexed annuity product. At
the end of its seven year term, this product credits interest to the annuity
participant at a rate based on a specified portion of the change in the value
of the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index ("S&P 500 Index"),
subject to a guaranteed annual minimum return. In order to hedge the interest
liability generated on the annuities as the index rises, FNWL purchases call
options on the S&P 500 Index. FNWL considers such call options to be held as
a hedge. As of December 31, 1997, FNWL had call options with contract values
of 13,180,000 and carrying values of 3,299,000.

 Hedge accounting is used to account for the call options as FNWL believes
that the options reduce the risks associated with increases in the account
value of the annuities that result from increases in the S&P 500 Index. The
call options effectively hedge the annuity contracts since they are both
purchased and sold with identical parameters. Periodically, the value of the
assets (S&P 500 call options) are matched to the potential liability (annuity
contracts) to ensure the hedge has remained effective. The annuities were
written based on a seven year investment term, absent early termination by
participants. Therefore, the anticipated hedged transaction (i.e., payment of
interest to the policyholder at the end of the investment term and maturity of
the call option) for each annuity is generally expected to occur in seven 
years or less. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the amount of unrealized
hedging losses deferred was 151,000.

 The call options are included in other invested assets and are carried at
estimated fair value. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes
in the estimated fair value of the call options are recorded as an adjustment
to the interest liability credited to policyholders. In addition, realized
gains and losses from maturity or termination of the call options are offset
against the interest credited to policyholders during the period incurred.
Premiums paid on indexed call options are amortized to net investment income
over the term of the contracts. There were no early terminations by annuity
participants, or maturities or sales of the S&P 500 call options during 1997.

 The cash requirement of the call options consists of the initial premium
paid to purchase the index options. Should a liability exist to the annuity
participant at maturity of the annuity policy, the termination or maturity of
the option contracts will generate positive cash flow to FNWL. The
appropriate amount of cash will then be remitted to the annuity participant
based on the respective 

43

participation rate. The index options are generally expected to be held for
a seven year term, but can be terminated at any time.

 There are certain risks associated with the index call options, primarily
with respect to significant movements in the United States stock market and
counterparty nonperformance. The Company believes that the counterparties to
its call option agreements are financially responsible and that the
counterparty risk associated with these transactions is minimal.

J. Fair value of financial instruments

 The estimated fair values of financial instruments disclosed have been 
determined using available market information and appropriate valuation 
methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market 
data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates 
presented may not be indicative of the amounts the Company could realize 
in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or 
estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated 
fair value amounts.

 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
value of financial instruments as of December 31, 1997 and 1996: 

 Cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities The
carrying amounts of these items are a reasonable estimate of their fair
values. 

 Fixed maturities, non-redeemable preferred stocks and common stocks The
estimated fair values of bonds, redeemable and non-redeemable preferred stocks
and common stocks are based upon quoted market prices, dealer quotes, and
prices obtained from independent pricing services. 

 Mortgage loans The estimated fair value of the mortgage loans portfolio
is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows, using a year-end
market rate which is applicable to the yield, credit quality and average
maturity of the composite portfolio. 
	
 Certificates in surplus of Exchanges The carrying amounts of these
certificates are a reasonable estimate of their fair values.

 Notes receivable-affiliate The fair values are estimated by discounting
the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be
made by the Company to borrowers for the same remaining maturities. 

 Joint ventures, at equity The estimated fair values are based upon
quoted market prices, current appraisals, and independent pricing services. 

 Other assets Other assets consist primarily of advances to agents, the
fair value of which is determined by discounting the estimated future cash
flows using credit quality, the average maturity of related advances, and the
current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers by the
Company. 

 Policy loans The estimated fair values of policy loans are determined by
discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar
loans would be made. 

 Other Investments Other investments consist of S&P 500 index call
options purchased as hedges against the interest liabilities generated on the
equity-indexed annuity products. These call options are carried at an
estimated fair value based on stock price, strike price, time to expiration,
interest rates, dividends and volatility per the methodology of the
Black-Scholes Option Pricing Formula. 

 Assets held in separate account and liabilities related to separate
account The carrying values are a reasonable estimate of their fair values
since assets and liabilities of separate accounts are carried at market value. 
	
 Real estate mortgages payable The estimated fair values are determined
by discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate which approximates
the Company's incremental borrowing rate. 

 Company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of
subsidiary trusts holding solely junior subordinated debentures The estimated
fair values are based on quoted market prices.

46

Future policy benefits-deferred annuities The estimated fair values of
flexible premium and single premium deferred annuities are based on their cash
surrender values. 
 
K. Value of Life Business Acquired

 The changes in the Value of Life Business Acquired were as follows: 

1997 1996 1995
 ---------- ---------- ----------

 Sale of OSL and IGL (58,545) 0 0
 ---------- ---------- ----------
 Balance, end of year 359,146 443,318 473,398
 ========== ========== ==========

Based on current conditions and assumptions as to future events, FNWL
expects to amortize the December 31, 1997 balance as follows: approximately
3.2 in 1998 and 1999, 3.4 in 2000, 3.6 in 2001, and 3.9 in 2002. The
discount rate used to determine the amortization rate of the Value of Life
Business Acquired ranged from 12.5 to 7.5 . 

L. Mortgage loans

 The Company follows the principles of SFAS No. 118 (amending SFAS No.
114), "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan". This Statement
requires that an impaired loan be measured based on the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate
or, as a practical expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the
fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent.

 The total recorded investment in impaired mortgage loans and the amount
of recorded investment for which an allowance for credit losses exists as of
December 31 follows: 

1997 1996

M. Security lending arrangement

 The Company has a security lending agreement with a financial
institution. The agreement in effect as of December 31, 1997 authorizes the
institution to lend securities held in the Company's portfolio to a list of
authorized borrowers. Concurrent with delivery of the securities, the
borrower provides the Company with cash collateral equal to at least 102 of
the market value of domestic securities and 105 of the market value of other
securities subject to the "loan."

 The securities are marked-to-market on a daily basis and the collateral
is adjusted on the next business day. The collateral is invested in highly
liquid, fixed income assets with a duration of less than one year. Income
earned from the security lending arrangement was allocated 60 to the Company
and 40 to the lending agent. Income earned by the Company was approximately
 856,000 in 1997. As of December 31, 1997, the collateral under the agreement
was 594,488,000. 

 In 1996 and 1995, the Life Insurance Subsidiaries had a security lending
agreement with a financial institution which had the same terms as the
agreement in effect as of December 31, 1997. Income earned by the Life
Insurance Subsidiaries was 422,000 and 233,000 in 1996 and 1995,
respectively. The collateral under these agreements as of December 31, 1996
was 221,216,000.

N. Employees' retirement plans

 The Company has two noncontributory defined benefit pension plans (the 
Regular Plan and the Restoration Plan). The Regular Plan covers substantially 
all employees of the Company and the Exchanges who have reached age 21 and 
have rendered one year of service. Benefits are based on years of service and 
the employee's compensation during the last five years of employment. The 
Restoration Plan provides supplemental retirement benefits for certain key 
employees of the Company. 

 The Company's policy is to fund the amount determined under the aggregate
cost method, provided it does not exceed funding limitations. There has been
no change in funding policy from prior years. 

 Assets of the Regular Plan are held by an independent trustee. Assets
held are primarily in fixed maturity and equity investments. The principal
liability is for annuity benefit payments of current and future retirees.
Assets of the Restoration Plan are considered corporate assets and are held
in a grantor trust. In 1996, assets and liabilities of the Regular Plan were
recorded by FNWL in Separate Accounts and were not commingled with the general
assets and liabilities of that company (see Note V). 

 Information regarding the Regular Plan's funded status is not developed
separately for the Company and the Exchanges. Information regarding the
Restoration Plan pertains only to the

48

Company. The funded status of the Plans for the Company and the Exchanges as
of December 1, 1997 and 1996 (the latest date for which information is
available) was as follows:

1997 1996
 ---------- ---------- 
 (Amounts in thousands)
 
 Actuarial present value of benefit obligations:
 Vested benefit obligation (562,686) (520,715)
 Accumulated benefit obligation (588,020) (545,459)
 Projected benefit obligation (747,069) (695,346)
 Assets at fair market value 817,552 744,340
 Plan assets in excess of projected benefit obligation 70,483 48,994
 Unrecognized net transition (asset) (30,862) (35,538)
 Unrecognized prior service cost 34,555 30,132
 Unrecognized net (gain)/loss (136,691) (98,544)
 Additional liability (3,685) 0
 Accrued pension cost (66,200) (54,956)

Upon purchase of the Company in 1988, the Company allocated part of the
purchase price to its portion of the Regular Plan assets in excess of the
projected benefit obligation at the date of acquisition. The asset is being
amortized for the difference between the Company's net pension cost and
amounts contributed to the Plan. The unamortized balance as of December 31,
1997 and 1996 was 24,304,000 and 29,252,000, respectively. 

 Components of net periodic pension expense for the Company follow:

 ---------- ---------- ----------
 Net periodic pension expense 9,763 9,012 6,285
 ========== ========== ==========

The Company uses the projected unit credit cost actuarial method for
attribution of expense for financial reporting purposes. The interest cost and
the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were computed using an
interest rate of 7.25 in 1997, 1996 and 1995, while the expected return on
plan assets was computed using an interest rate of 9.00 in 1997 and 1996 and
9.25 in 1995. The rate of increase in future compensation levels used in
determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation
was 5.00 in 1997 and 1996 and 4.50 in 1995.
 
 The Company's postretirement benefits plan is a contributory defined
benefit plan for employees who were retired or who were eligible for early
retirement as of January 1, 1995, and is a contributory defined dollar plan
for all other employees retiring after January 1, 1995. Health benefits are
provided for all employees who participated in the Company's and the
Exchanges' group medical benefits plan for 15 years prior to retirement at
age 55 or later. A life insurance benefit of 5,000 is provided at no cost
to retirees who maintained group insurance coverage for 15 years prior to
retirement at age 55 or later. 

 There are no assets separated and allocated to this plan.

49

The funded status of the entire plan, which includes the Company and the
Exchanges, as of December 1, 1997 and 1996 (the latest date for which
information is available) was as follows: 

1997 1996
 ---------- ----------
 (Amounts in thousands)
 
 Actuarial present value of benefit obligations:
 Vested benefit obligation 0 0
 Accumulated benefit obligation:
 Retirees 43,216 44,051

 Unrecognized net transition obligation (19,665) (20,976)
 ---------- ----------
 Accrued postretirement benefit cost 67,069 61,962
 ========== ==========

The Company's share of the accrued postretirement benefit cost was
approximately 49,404,000 in 1997 and 47,948,000 in 1996. The unrecognized
net transition obligation of 19,665,000 in 1997 and 20,976,000 in 1996
represents the remaining transition obligation of the Exchanges. 

 Components of postretirement benefits expense for the Company follow:

The interest rate used in the above benefit computations was 7.25 in
1997, 1996 and 1995. Beginning in 1995, the initial medical inflation rate
was 8.00 , to be graded over a 4-year period to 6.00 and level thereafter,
and contribution levels from retirees were the same as applicable medical cost
increases where defined benefits exist. The rate of increase in future
compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present value of the
accumulated benefit obligation was 5.00 in 1997 and 1996 and 4.50 in 1995.
A 1.00 increase in the medical inflation rate assumption would have resulted
in an approximate increase of 1,179,000 in 1997 and 1,231,000 in 1996 in the
accumulated benefit obligation for the Company.

O. Commitments and contingencies

 Rental expense incurred by the Company was 20,322,000, 20,121,000,
and 21,944,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. 

50

The Company has long-term operating lease commitments on equipment and
buildings, with options to renew at the end of the lease periods. As of
December 31, 1997, the remaining commitments payable over the next five years
under these leases are:

The Company is a party to numerous lawsuits arising from its normal
business activities. These actions are in various stages of discovery and
development, and some seek punitive as well as compensatory damages. In the
opinion of management, the Company has not engaged in any conduct which should
warrant the award of any material punitive or compensatory damages. The
Company intends to vigorously defend its position in each case, and management
believes that, while it is not possible to predict the outcome of such
matters with absolute certainty, ultimate disposition of these proceedings
should not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated
results of operations or financial position. 

 The Company has entered into employment agreements with certain
executives of the Company. Each agreement obligates the Company to
compensate the executive should the executive's employment be terminated due
to a qualifying event, as defined within the agreement. In the opinion of 
management, any payments made as a result of these agreements would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations
or financial position.

P. Income taxes

 The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes". Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recorded
to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and the corresponding bases used for financial
statements. On April 15, 1997, OSL and IGL were sold pursuant to Internal
Revenue Code Section 338(h)(10). Federal and state taxes incurred as a result
of this transaction amounted to an estimated 26,826,000.

Cash payments for interest were 3,725,000, 18,674,000, and 18,995,000
in 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively, while cash payments for dividends to
the holders of the Company's QUIPS were 42,070,000 in 1997 and 1996 and
 10,414,000 in 1995. Cash payments for income taxes were 430,588,000,
 379,455,000, and 315,603,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. 

54

In 1997, net cash proceeds from the sale of OSL and IGL amounted to an
estimated 336,714,000 and were in consideration primarily for the following:

 Investments 823,666,000
 Deferred policy acquisition costs and Value of Life 
 Business Acquired 181,196,000
 Life insurance policy liabilities (690,426,000)

 Also in 1997, the change in the Separate Accounts assets and liabilities
netted to 0 and was reflected in the Statements of Cash Flows (see Note V). 

 In July 1996, the Company used 200,000,000 of proceeds it received
from the Exchanges in connection with the repayment of the 1986 surplus
contribution (see Note D) to extinguish the 200,000,000 of 8.25 Notes
Payable the Company issued in July 1986.

 As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 115, the Life Insurance
Subsidiaries have decreased the DAC asset and increased the Value of Life
Business Acquired asset to account for the impact on estimated future gross
profits of the net unrealized gains or losses on securities. 

R. Management fees

 As attorney-in-fact, the Company, or its subsidiaries, as applicable,
manages the affairs of the P&C Group and receives management fees for the
services rendered to the Exchanges. As a result, the Company received
management fees from the Exchanges of 1,241,153,000, 1,167,704,000 and
 1,109,425,000 in 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.

S. Related parties

 Certain directors of the Company are partners in legal firms that
received fees for legal services from the Company and the Exchanges. These
fees totaled 5,208,000, 1,853,000 and 2,231,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. 

 As of December 31, 1997, the Company had 407,000,000 in notes receivable
related to loans made to B.A.T Capital Corporation, a subsidiary of B.A.T.
These notes are fixed rate medium term notes with maturity dates as follows:
 137,000,000 in October 1998, 135,000,000 in October 1999 and 135,000,000 in
October 2000. Interest on these notes is paid semi-annually at coupon rates
of 5.35 , 6.68 and 6.33 , respectively. On October 7, 1997, a four year
 135,000,000 note with an interest rate of 5.10 matured and the 135,000,000
note maturing in October 2000 was subsequently issued at an interest rate
of 6.33 . Income earned on the notes outstanding during 1997, 1996 and 1995
was 23,620,000, 21,245,000, and 20,697,000, respectively.

 On October 7, 1996, a three year 135,000,000 note with an interest rate
of 4.76 matured and the 135,000,000 note, maturing in October 1999, was
subsequently issued at an interest rate of 6.68 .

T. Revolving credit agreement

 As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company had a revolving credit
agreement with certain financial institutions and had an aggregate borrowing
facility of 500,000,000. The

 55

proceeds of the facility were available to the Company for general corporate
purposes, including loans to the Exchanges. As of December 31, 1997 and 1996,
facility fees were payable on the aggregate borrowing facility in the amount
of 7 and 9 basis points per annum, respectively, and were reimbursable to the
Company by the Exchanges. In the case of a draw on the facility, the Company
has the option to borrow at annual rates equal to the prime rate, the banks'
certificate of deposit rate plus 1 , the federal funds effective rate plus
1/2 of 1 or the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus certain
percentages. As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company did not have any
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement. Facility fees
were 399,000, 592,000 and 526,000 for the years ended December 31, 1997,
1996 and 1995, respectively, and were reimbursed by the Exchanges. The
revolving credit agreement in effect as of December 31, 1997 expires on July
1, 2002.

U. Real estate mortgages payable

 As of December 31, 1997, the Company, excluding FNWL, was liable for two
mortgages, one with an interest rate of 6.98 maturing in June 1998 and one
with an interest rate of 7.24 maturing in June 2004. The amount of principal
due within one year is approximately 67,000. As of December 31, 1997, there
were no real estate mortgage notes payable by FNWL. 

V. Separate Accounts

 The assets and liabilities held in Separate Accounts as of December 31,
1996 related to the pension plan for the employees of the Company and the
Exchanges. The assets were held primarily in fixed maturity and equity
investments, while the principal liability was for annuity benefit payments
under the pension plan. A review of the trust agreement with Chase Manhattan
Bank, the trustee for the pension plan, led to the conclusion that Separate
Account treatment was no longer required. Therefore, FNWL excluded the
pension plan assets and liabilities from Separate Accounts as of November
30, 1997.

W. Participating policies

 Participating business, primarily group insurance, comprised
approximately 8.8 of FNWL's total insurance-in-force as of December 31, 1997
and 7.5 of the Life Insurance Subsidiaries' total insurance-in-force as of
December 31, 1996. In addition, participating business represented 2.2 of
FNWL's premium income for the year ended December 31, 1997, and 2.2 of the
Life Insurance Subsidiaries' premium income for the years ended December 31,
1996 and 1995.
	
X. Life reinsurance	

 In 1996 and 1995, the Life Insurance Subsidiaries had reciprocal
reinsurance treaties in place among themselves so that the maximum exposure
to the Life Insurance Subsidiaries, in the aggregate, for any one life was the
sum of their individual retention levels, or 1,400,000. Due to the sale of
OSL and IGL on April 15, 1997, the reciprocal reinsurance treaties which
existed with FNWL ceased. 

 Premiums ceded to non-affiliates totaled 3,868,000 and 3,577,000 for
the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Reinsurance
receivables, which totaled 10,621,000 as of December 31, 1996, were included
in Other Assets of Life Insurance Subsidiaries. 

 56

 In the fourth quarter of 1997, FNWL revised the retention limit for
automatic reinsurance ceded. The primary change was to set the maximum
retention on new issues at 2,000,000 per life for the Farmers Flexible
Universal Life policy, 1,500,000 per life for all Traditional policies except
Farmers Yearly Renewable Term, and 800,000 per life for Farmers Yearly
Renewable Term. The excess is reinsured with a third party reinsurer.
Premiums ceded under these agreements totaled 4,236,000 in 1997.
Reinsurance receivables, which totaled 8,627,000 as of December 31, 1997
were included in Other Assets of Life Insurance Subsidiaries.

Z. Operations in different industries

 The Company operates primarily in two industries - management of property
and casualty insurance companies (principally reciprocal insurance exchanges)
and the life insurance industry. Total revenue by industry includes both
revenues as reported in the Company's consolidated income statement, and
intersegment revenues which are eliminated in consolidation.

 Operating profit is comprised of total revenues less operating expenses.
Accordingly, investment income and realized gains on securities and real
estate investment income earned as a result of the management services to the
P&C Group have not been added, and general corporate expenses and income taxes
have not been deducted. The Management Services to the P&C Group segment
incurred depreciation expense of 51,579,000, 40,096,000, and 28,023,000 in
1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively, while depreciation for the Life Insurance
Subsidiaries was 2,838,000 in 1997, 3,108,000 in 1996 and 3,699,000
in 1995. Capital expenditures for the Management Services to the P&C Group
totaled 41,732,000, 51,605,000 and 55,811,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively, while capital expenditures for the Life Insurance Subsidiaries
were 1,696,000 in 1997, 132,000 in 1996 and 301,000 in 1995. The Other
industry category includes certain subsidiary companies engaged in real estate
investment and leasing activities. These companies incurred depreciation
expenses of 18,634,000, 20,202,000 and 17,270,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. Capital expenditures within the Other industry category were
 22,802,000 in 1997, 24,074,000 in 1996 and 17,493,000 in 1995.

 Identifiable assets by industry are those assets used in the Company's
operations within each industry. Corporate assets are principally marketable
securities owned by the Company and its non-life subsidiaries and amounts
invested by the Company in joint ventures.

(1) Bonus amounts reported in the year in which service related to such bonus
 is rendered. Payment does not occur until the year subsequent to the year
 of service. 

(2) In 1997, Messrs. Feinstein, Katz, MacKinnon, Secord and Ms. Schofield
 received awards of 17,982, 8,200, 8,000, 6,000 and 8,200 Premier Award
 Units ("PAUs"), respectively, under FGI's Premier Award Units Plan. In
 1995, Messrs. Feinstein, Katz, MacKinnon and Ms. Schofield received
 awards of 7,495, 7,710, 5,805 and 4,995 PAUs. Mr. Secord received an
 interim award of 5,620 PAUs in 1996. The value of the PAUs is linked to
 performance goals set by the Compensation Committee based on the
 financial and operating results of the Company and the P&C Group and the
 price of B.A.T ADRs over a four-year period. The value of the PAUs will
 be paid to eligible employees in cash or in B.A.T ADRs if such ADRs are
 eligible for unrestricted issue pursuant to applicable law. The receipt
 of such amounts may be deferred at the election of participants, subject
 to the approval of the Compensation Committee. In the event of certain
 changes in the capital structure of FGI or other events relating to
 control of FGI, the Compensation Committee has the discretion to pay out
 the value of outstanding PAUs immediately or make other appropriate
 adjustments to the PAUs. 
 
(3) Represents estimated amounts to be contributed by FGI under the
 Employees' Profit Sharing Savings Plan Trust (the "Deferred Plan") and
 reported in the year of service as earned. To the extent that a
 participant's annual benefits under the Deferred Plan exceed certain
 limits imposed by law, such amounts will be paid under FGI's nonqualified
 Employee Benefits Restoration Plan (the "Benefits Restoration Plan"),
 which is funded through a grantor trust. 

63

Employees' Pension Plan

 In addition to the compensation set forth above, the Named Executive
Officers participate with all eligible employees of the Company in the
Company's tax-qualified Employees' Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan"). The
Named Executive Officers also participate in the Benefits Restoration Plan,
funded through a grantor trust, which provides supplemental benefits to the
extent amounts otherwise payable under the Pension Plan and the Deferred Plan
are limited under applicable laws. (Together, the Pension Plan and the
Benefits Restoration Plan are referred to as the "Retirement Plans"). 

 Effective May 7, 1997, the Employee Benefits Restoration Plan was amended
to include awards made under the Executive Incentive Plan as compensation in
calculating pension benefits, starting with the 1996 awards paid in 1997. The
entire benefit derived from inclusion of the Executive Incentive Plan award(s)
will be paid from the Employee Benefits Restoration Plan. This amendment
impacts certain key officers and includes the Named Executive Officers. 

 The Pension Plan bases retirement benefits upon the employee's final
five-year average annual base salary and the total years of credited service,
subject to a maximum of 35 years of credited service. Employees who are at
least 21 years of age and who have completed one year of service participate
in the Pension Plan retroactive to the first day of the month following their
hire date. Eligible participants become vested and earn a nonforfeitable right
to Pension Plan benefits after completing five years of service or upon
reaching the first day of the month in which they become age 65. In addition,
the Pension Plan provides that if, following a Change in Control of the
Company (as defined in the Pension Plan), the Pension Plan is terminated or
the employment of a participant in the Pension Plan is terminated, and if at
the time of such termination there are surplus assets in the Pension Plan,
such surplus assets shall be used to increase the benefits payable to each
affected plan participant. The Retirement Plans both provide for the full
vesting of accrued benefits in the event of a Change in Control. 

 Normal retirement benefits begin at age 62 with 30 years of service and
at age 65 with less than 30 years of service, but participants may retire as
early as age 55 at actuarially reduced rates, provided that they have at least
15 years of service. Participants who become totally and permanently disabled
may qualify for disability retirement benefits if they have 10 or more years
of service and are between the ages of 35 and 65. 

 For purposes of illustration, the following table provides examples of the
annual pension benefits payable at age 65 pursuant to the defined benefit

At the end of 1997, Messrs. Feinstein, Katz, MacKinnon, Secord and Ms.
Schofield were credited under the Pension Plans with 24.0, 13.4, 35.0, 2.0 and
2.6 years of service, respectively. The average annual salary for the
five-year period ended December 31, 1997 for Messrs. Feinstein, Katz,
MacKinnon, Secord and Ms. Schofield was 402,260, 350,880, 284,210, 311,580
and 289,420, respectively. These figures include the 1996 Executive
Incentive Plan Awards paid in 1997.

Employment Agreements and Change-in-Control Arrangements

 The Company has entered into employment agreements with each of Messrs.
Feinstein, Katz, MacKinnon, Secord and Ms. Schofield. Each of the agreements
provide that if the executive's employment is terminated following a
"Change-in-Control" (as defined in the agreement), the executive will receive
a severance payment equal to two (2) times the executive's "Cash
Compensation" (as defined in the agreement, but generally including certain
base salary, bonus and profit sharing plan allocation amounts). In addition
to the Cash Compensation amount payable, the executive is also entitled to (i)
continued coverage under applicable group welfare benefit plans of the Company
(for example, the Company's life, disability and health insurance plans); (ii)
a benefit under the Company's long-term incentive plan (determined as if the
executive terminated employment due to retirement, and as if any remaining
performance criteria had been waived), and (iii) a lump sum payment of certain
enhanced benefit amounts under the Company's pension plans (including the
supplemental pension plan). In the cases of Messrs. Feinstein and Katz, the
agreements provide for a tax gross-up payment equal to the amount of any
excise tax payable under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended. In the case of the other executives, amounts payable under the
agreements will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid the application of
such excise tax.

 The payments under the agreement will be made if the executive is
employed at the time of the Change-in-Control and his or her termination is
(i) by the Company other than for "Cause" (as defined in the agreement); (ii)
by the executive for "Good Reason" (as defined in the agreement) or
(iii) other than due to the executive's death, disability or retirement. 

 The agreements are effective until December 31, 1999. In the event of a
"Potential Change-in-Control" (as defined in the agreement), however, the term
of the agreements will be extended for a period of two (2) years following
the Potential-Change-in-Control (unless the 

 65

Potential-Change-in-Control is abandoned prior to a Change-in-Control).
In the event of a Change-in-Control, the agreements will be extended for a
period of two (2) years following the date of the Change-in-Control. In
all cases, however, the agreements will expire upon the death, retirement or
disability termination of the executive.

Compensation of Directors

 Directors who are not employees of FGI or B.A.T receive an annual
retainer of 21,000, together with 1,000 plus expenses for each FGI Board of
Directors (the "Board") meeting attended in 1997. Additionally, committee
members of the Board receive 950 plus expenses for each committee meeting
attended and Committee Chairs receive 1,100 plus expenses for each committee
meeting attended. Directors who are employees of FGI or of B.A.T do not
receive the retainer fees, Board meeting fees or committee fees referred to
above. Total payments, excluding reimbursement of expenses, to Messrs.
Heafey, Neff, Parnell, Pings, Sauter, Yeutter and Ms. Wilson amounted to
 29,400, 28,800, 32,600, 33,200, 28,800, 26,800 and 27,850, respectively,
in 1997 for services rendered in that year. 

 FGI has established an Outside Directors' Retirement Benefit Program. Any
director who is not an employee of FGI or of B.A.T who has attained age 70 at
the time such director retires from service as a member of the Board and has
either accrued 10 or more calendar years of service as a Board member or who
was a Board member as of August 7, 1987, the inception date of this Program, is
entitled to an annual benefit commencing in May of the calendar year following
the director's retirement from the Board. Such annual benefit is equal to 100 
of the annual retainer fee in effect during the last year the director served
on the Board. Benefit payments are made for five or more years, depending on
the director's length of service on the Board. Based on their tenure as Board
members, Mr. Heafey has accrued benefits of seven annual payments, and Messrs.
Neff, Parnell, Pings, Sauter, Yeutter and Ms. Wilson have accrued no benefits
under this Program. Benefits for this Program were funded through a grantor
trust through 1995. Effective January 1, 1996, retirement payments to
directors retiring after January 1, 1996 will be paid directly by FGI.
Payments under this Program to former Board members amounted to 51,000 in
1997.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

 During 1997, FGI's Compensation Committee (the "Committee") consisted of
Mr. Heafey, who is Chairman, and Messrs. Allvey, Parnell, Pings, Sauter and
Yeutter. None of these individuals is now or has ever been an officer or
employee of the Company.

 The Committee receives compensation recommendations from the Chief
Executive Officer and amends or revises them as appropriate. The Committee
then submits a recommendation regarding executive compensation to the Board.
Compensation levels for Mr. Feinstein are approved by the Board of B.A.T
following recommendations of that Board's Compensation Committee, whose
composition consists of no members who are employees or executive officers
of FGI. The compensation levels of certain senior officers are also reviewed
by the Chief Executive's Committee of B.A.T. 

 The law firm of Crosby, Heafey, Roach and May received fees of 5,177,000
for legal services rendered to the Company or the Exchanges in 1997. Mr.
Heafey is a partner in such firm and has been a director of FGI since 1978.
In addition, the law firm of Hogan and Hartson, LLP, received fees of 31,000
for legal services rendered to the Company or the Exchanges in 1997. Mr.
Yeutter is a partner in such firm and has been a director of FGI since 1994.

 as described in the previous sentence, or deferred, as described
 in Section 6(a) hereof) shall thereupon be forfeited by the
 Grantee; provided, however, that in the case of special
 circumstances the Committee may waive, in whole or in part,
 any or all of the remaining Performance Criteria or any time
 period of service requirement.

 G. The first paragraph of Section 6(a) shall be amended in its
 entirety to read as follows:

 "Any individual eligible to participate in the Premier Award
 Unit Plan may request that the payment of all or a portion of any
 payout from any installment of Premier Award Units be deferred for
 annual periods up to five years from the date such amount would
 otherwise be paid under Section 5(e) hereof, or until the
 occurrence of retirement, death or permanent disability, if
 earlier. Individuals who are "highly compensated" (as defined
 below) as of the date of any election to defer may request that
 the payment of all or a portion of any payout from any installment
 of Premier Award Units be deferred until the occurrence of
 retirement, death or permanent disability. Any requests for
 deferral must be made to the Committee, in writing, on or before
 March 31 of the last year of the applicable Performance Period
 (e.g., a request must be made on or before March 31, 2000,
 relating to any Premier Award Units granted in 1998, whose value,
 if any, might be determined in 2000, and payable in 2001,
 assuming that the applicable Performance Period is three years
 starting in 1998). Such requests shall specify that either
 25 , 50 , 75 , or 100 of the payout which might be made is to
 be deferred. A Participant who is "highly compensated" may elect
 at the time of initially requesting deferral to

 2

 commence payment of benefits within ninety (90) days of
 retirement, death or the date it is established to the
 satisfaction of the Compensation Committee that the Participant
 has a permanent disability, either in a single payment or in five
 (5) or ten (10) equal annual payments to which will be added an
 interest equivalent from the first payment date computed as
 provided above. Any participant who is not "highly compensated"
 as of the date of his or her election and who elects in accordance
 with this paragraph to defer payout for a term not to exceed five
 (5) years, shall at the end of such term or as soon as thereafter
 as practicable, receive his or her deferred amount plus earnings
 thereon in one lump sum. For purposes of this Section 6, the
 Committee shall, in its discretion, determine which Grantees are
 "highly compensated" consistent with the intent that such
 individuals be part of a select group of management or highly
 compensated employees within the meaning of Section 201(2) of the
 Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended."

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this instrument of Amendment is executed this 10 day of
November, 1997.

 Exhibit 10.5

 FARMERS GROUP, INC.
 EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE PROGRAM
 AS AMENDED MAY 7, 1997 AND AUGUST 13, 1997

1. Purpose

 The Farmers Group, Inc. Executive Incentive Program (the "Program") is
designed to award and compensate key executives who contribute substantially
to the financial success of Farmers Group, Inc., its subsidiaries and its
affiliates (the "Corporation"), and to focus the efforts of such key
executives on the continued success of the Corporation.

2. Administration

 (a)	The Program shall be administered by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation (the "Board") and by the Compensation Committee of the Board
(the "Compensation Committee"), as hereinbelow described. The Board shall
have discretion to select key executives who are to be eligible to receive
awards under the Program with respect to each fiscal year, and to determine
the amount of such awards, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in the Program and such other terms and conditions as are not inconsistent
with the purposes and provisions of the Program.

 (b) The Board may establish such rules and regulations as deemed
appropriate for proper administration of the Program and may modify or revoke
such rules and regulations from time to time. In addition, the Board may
make such determinations and take such action in connection with the Program
as are necessary.

 (c) All determinations and interpretations of the Board shall be final
and binding, except that all awards are subject to final approval by B.A.T.

3. Eligibility and Participation

 Eligibility and participation in the Program are restricted to the Chief
Executive Officer of the Corporation and such Home Office Officers and Field
Executives of the Corporation whom the Board, in its discretion, selects to
receive awards under the Program.

4. Determination and Allocation of Awards

 (a) Awards under the Program shall be made from a pool (the "Pool"),
which Pool for a given year shall consist of twenty percent (20 of Growth
in Earnings (as hereinbelow defined) for that year, less a factor for a
decrease in Exchange Surplus as also defined below.

 (b) Growth in Earnings for a particular year shall mean the increase in
the USPGAAP Net Income of the Corporation over the USPGAAP Net Income of the
Corporation for the immediately preceding year. For purposes of determining
the amount of the Pool, USPGAAP Net Income shall be adjusted as follows:

 (1) Awards paid or accrued under this Program shall be excluded;

 (2) Capital gains or losses attributable to sales of real estate or
 equipment used solely in the Corporation's insurance business
 shall be excluded to the extent that they individually or
 collectively exceed two percent (2 of USPGAAP Net Income in
 any one calendar quarter;

 (3) In the event that the statutory rates used in determining Federal
 Income Tax and/or California Franchise Tax are increased or
 decreased in a particular year from the rates applicable during
 the immediately preceding year, or if the method of determining
 and reporting said taxes changes due to a change in accounting
 method required by a recognized rule-making body, said taxes
 applicable to the

 2

 preceding year shall be recalculated on an equivalent basis in
 determining USPGAAP Net Income for such preceding year;

 (4) Capital gains or losses arising from the sale or other
 disposition of any joint venture investment of F.I.G. Holding
 Company entered into before January 1, 1974 shall be excluded;

 (5) Any expense or income attributable to merger or acquisition
 activities shall be excluded; and 

 (6) Other extraordinary items as approved by the Compensation
 Committee.

 (c) Growth in Earnings for each year shall be determined by the Chief
Financial Officer for the Corporation and verified by the independent
certified public accountants of the Corporation. The Pool shall be an
accrued liability in the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation
and the amount accrued in the Pool shall not be placed in a separate account
or in trust or otherwise be segregated from the general funds of the
Corporation.

 (d) A three-year weighted average Surplus Ratio shall be calculated and
compared to the Target Surplus Ratio of 33 1/3 (premium written to surplus of
3 to 1). If the three-year weighted average Surplus Ratio is at or greater
than 33 1/3 , no reduction in the Bonus Pool will be made. If the three-year
weighted average Surplus Ratio is less than 33 1/3 , the Bonus Pool will be
reduced in the following manner. A Maximum Reduction of 20 of the Bonus Pool
will be made when the Exchange Surplus Ratio is 28.57 (premium written to
surplus of 3.5 to 1) or lower. The Maximum Reduction will be reduced
proportionately based on where the three-year weighted average Surplus Ratio
falls between 33 1/3 and 28.57 . 

 (e) The Award to the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation under the
Program for each year shall not exceed seventy-five percent (75 of the base
salary paid to the Chief Executive Officer during the year to which the award
relates, except as outlined in section 4(h) below. The Award amount for the
Chief Executive officer shall be determined by the B.A.T Industries Group
Compensation Committee.

 (f) The Chief Executive Officer shall evaluate the performance and
contribution to the successful operation of the Corporation of each Officer
and Field Executive of the Corporation and shall recommend to the Compensation
Committee each year, prior to the February meeting of the Board, the
percentage of the Pool for the preceding year which he believes should be
awarded to each such individual. Such recommendations shall be in an amount
not to exceed one hundred percent (100 of the Pool, except as outlined in
section 4(h) below, less the percentage of the Pool awarded to the Chief
Executive Officer. Awards for Level I executives shall not exceed 75 of
salary, awards to Level II executives shall not exceed 60 of salary,
awards for Level III executives shall not exceed 40 of salary, except as
outlined in section 4(h) below. Membership in each level shall be determined
by the Chief Executive Officer at the outset of the performance year.
Generally, Level I executives are direct reports to the CEO, Level II
executives are Home Office and Level III executives are Field Executives, or
more junior executives.

 (g) Each year, prior to the February meeting of the Board, the
Compensation Committee shall receive the recommendations of the Chief
Executive Officer and shall confer with him concerning such recommendations.
Such recommendations will be based on estimated prior year end and financial
results. The Compensation Committee shall then recommend to the Board at the
February meeting of the Board the individuals to receive awards under the
Program and the percentage of the Pool which should be awarded to each such
individual. The Board shall, in its absolute discretion, select the
individuals to whom awards shall be made under the Program and determine the
percentage of the Pool which shall be awarded to such individuals. No award
made under the Program shall exceed the maximum award applicable to the level
of the incumbent either 75 , 60 , or 40 of the base salary paid to an
individual during the year to which the award relates, except as outlined in
section 4(h) below. Final confirmation by the Board based on actual prior
year end results will occur at the May meeting of the Board.

 (h) Payment of EIP awards is contingent upon performance of the
Corporation as it relates to the performance of a peer group of companies.
Depending upon which quartile performance falls, individual awards
may be increased/decreased based on individual performance as shown below:

3

Peer Group Standing Award Adjustment
 ------------------- ----------------
 Fourth Quartile +33 1/3 
 Third Quartile No Adjustment
 Second Quartile -33 1/3 
 First Quartile -66 2/3 

Should the Award Pool be insufficient to fund the approved awards in the fourth
quartile, additional funds will be added and expensed. In no event will the
amount of the additional funds be greater than one-third of the original Pool
for the year. A comparative analysis is to be provided to the Compensation
Committee each year to substantiate the current year's awards. 

 (i) Payments of awards under the Program shall be within the absolute
discretion of the Board subject to the final approval of B.A.T. The Board
shall be under no obligation to award all of the Pool or any portion thereof.

 (j) The Pool shall not accumulate from year to year, and any amount in
the Pool not distributed pursuant to the Program shall revert to net income of
this Corporation.

 (k) Payment of awards under the Program shall be made no later than
April 15 after the close of the calendar year to which the award relates.

 (l) The Corporation shall have the right to deduct any sums required to
be withheld by federal, state or other applicable laws from payments of awards
under the Program.

5. Rights of Participants and Beneficiaries

 (a) No individual shall have any vested or protectable interest in,
legal right to, or shall otherwise be entitled to, any amount under the
Program until such time as the Board by resolution approves an award to such
individual. Nothing in the Program shall be deemed to give any individual, or
his or her legal representative or assigns, or any other person or entity
claiming under or through him, any contract or right to participate in the
benefits of the Program.

 (b) The Corporation shall pay all amounts payable hereunder only to
the individual or beneficiaries entitled thereto pursuant to this Program. The
Corporation shall not be liable for the debts, contracts, or engagements of
any individual or his or her beneficiaries, and rights to payments under this
Program may not be taken in execution by attachment or garnishment, or by any
other legal or equitable proceeding while in the hands of the Corporation; nor
shall any individual or his or her beneficiaries have any right to assign,
pledge, or hypothecate any benefits or payments hereunder.

 (c) Participation in the Program shall not be construed as
constituting a commitment, guarantee, agreement or understanding of any
kind that the Corporation shall continue to employ any individual.

 (d) Any individual eligible to participate in the Program may
designate a beneficiary to receive payments of awards under the Program in the
case of such individual's death.

 (e) Commencing with awards to be made for services rendered, on or
after January 1, 1984 and for which awards are to be paid after January 1,
1985, any individual eligible to participate in the Program may request that
payment of all or a portion of any award be deferred until the occurrence of
retirement, death or permanent disability. Such request must be made to the
Compensation Committee in writing on or before December 31 of the performance 
year which is the year prior to the date the awards are determined and paid
(i.e., a request must be made on or before December 31, 1988, relating to any
award under the Program which might be determined and paid in 1989). Such
request shall specify that either 25 , 50 , 75 or 100 of awards which might
be made are to be deferred and shall specify whether such request relates only
to awards relating to services to be performed during the next calendar

 4

year or to all awards which might be made under the Program in the second
succeeding and all future years. Once such a request for deferral is made,
it may not be withdrawn by the participant except with respect to any awards
for service to be performed in calendar years following the year in which the
date such request for withdrawal is made. Any such request for withdrawal
must be made in writing to the Compensation Committee. If the Board selects
the individual for an award and in its sole discretion consents to the request
for deferred payment, to any amount so deferred there will be interest added
to the deferred amount for each year or partial year the payment of the award
is deferred. The participant in this Deferred Payment Plan may elect at the
time of initially requesting deferral to commence payment of benefits within
thirty (30) days of retirement, death or the date it is established to the
satisfaction of the Compensation Committee that the participant has a
permanent disability, either in a single payment or in five (5) or ten (10)
equal annual payments to which will be added an interest equivalent from the
first payment date computed as provided above. On single payments made within
30 days of retirement, death or disability, the interest rate earned between
the date of retirement, death or disability until the date of disbursement
will be based on the average yield of the institutional money market fund in
which the Corporation invests.

 In the event of extreme hardship, any participant may make a written
request to the Compensation Committee for immediate payment. For this
purpose, an extreme hardship is an unanticipated emergency caused by an event
beyond the control of the participant that would result in severe financial
hardship if early withdrawal were not permitted. The amount to be withdrawn
must be limited to the amount necessary to meet the emergency. Amounts
deferred under this Section 5 (e) will be held as part of the general assets
of the Corporation and shall not be set aside or funded in any manner;
provided that deferred amounts and any earnings thereon may be set aside in
one or more non-qualified grantor trusts so long as such arrangements do
not result in benefits hereunder being considered funded for federal tax
purposes.

 Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, to the extent deferred
amounts are funded through one or more grantor trusts, then earnings or
appreciation thereon shall be determined solely by reference to the experience
of assets in such trust or trusts. This Corporation shall direct the trustee
or trustees of such trust or trusts, as the case may be, as to the investment
of assets in such trust or trusts and the Corporation may, in advising the
trustee, offer, in any manner and to any extent it deems appropriate,
Participants the opportunity to advise the Corporation as to how assets
allocated to their respective accounts are to be invested. In no event may
Participants communicate directly with any trustee in regard to asset
investment. Participants shall in no event have rights greater than those of
general creditors of the Corporation with respect to any amounts held in trust.
Any amounts deferred hereunder as well as any earnings are not subject to
anticipation, alienation or hypothecation by any Participant.

6. Termination of Employment

 (a) In the event of death, disability or retirement during the year
to which the award relates, a pro rata award shall be paid to any individual
who would have otherwise received an award under the Program. In the event
of disability or retirement, such award shall be paid to the individual. In
the event of death, such award shall be paid to the individual's estate or
legal representative, as determined by the Compensation Committee or, in the
event the individual has designated a beneficiary to receive payments of
awards under the Program in the case of such individual's death, to such
beneficiary.

 (b) In the event of termination of employment for any other reason
during the year to which the award relates, such individual's eligibility to
receive any award for such year shall be terminated, although the Chief
Executive Officer may, at his discretion, recommend to the Compensation
Committee that a pro rata award be made.

 (c) In the event of termination of a participant's employment in the
Deferred Payment Plan for any reason other than retirement, permanent
disability or death, payment of all deferred amounts in the Deferred Payment
Plan together with the appropriate interest equivalent will be made in a
single payment within 30 days after the employment termination date. From the
date of termination until distribution, Deferred amounts will earn an interest
rate based on the average yield of the institutional money market fund in
which the Corporation invests. 

7. Effective Date, Amendment and Termination of Program

 The amendments to the Program adopted by the Board of Directors on
August 5, 1983

5

shall be effective for the year ending December 31, 1983. The amendments

December 1997 and subsequent years. The Program may be amended or terminated
at any time by the Board. Such amendment or termination shall not adversely
affect or alter any right or obligation with respect to any award previously
made hereunder.

8. Special Rule

 Benefits under the Program, whether paid currently or deferred under
Section 5, constitute no more than an unsecured promise by the Corporation to
provide said benefits and no participant or beneficiary shall have rights
greater than those of a general creditor of the Corporation in either the
general assets of the Corporation or the assets of any trust established under
Section 7 hereof in connection with such benefits.

9. Governing Law

 This Program shall be governed by the laws of the State of

 "Extended Term"), unless, not later than twelve (12) months prior 
 to the expiration of the Initial Term or any Extended Term, the 
 Company shall have given notice to the Executive that it does not

 Control shall have occurred during the Initial Term or any
 Extended Term, the term of this Agreement shall be extended and
 shall continue in effect through the last day of the
 twenty-fourth (24th) month immediately following the date on which
 such Change in Control occurred; provided that, if such Potential
 Change in Control is abandoned prior to the occurrence of a Change
 in Control, this Agreement shall expire in accordance with the
 provisions hereof, without regard to such extension.

 3. Position and Duties. The Executive shall continue to serve in his 
 current position and shall have such responsibilities, duties and

 paid in such installments as are customary from time to 
 time for executive officers of the Company. This 
 compensation may be increased from time to time in 
 accordance with normal business practices of the Company 
 and, if so increased, shall not thereafter during the term 
 of this Agreement be decreased. Such compensation shall 
 not be deemed exclusive and shall not prevent the Executive 
 from participating in any other compensation or benefit 
 plan of the Company. The Cash Compensation payments 
 (including any increased salary payments) hereunder shall 
 not in any way limit or reduce any other obligation of the 
 Company hereunder, and no other compensation, benefit or

 Compensation hereunder.

 (b) Expenses. During the term of the Executive's employment 
 hereunder, the Executive shall be entitled to receive 
 prompt reimbursement for all reasonable and customary

 continue to participate in all Company and Parent 
 compensation, incentive, welfare or benefit plans or

 employees, subject to and on a basis consistent with the 
 terms, conditions and overall administration of such plans 
 and arrangements. Nothing paid to the Executive under any 
 Benefit Plan presently in effect or made available in the 
 future shall be deemed to be in lieu of the salary payable 
 to the Executive pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section. 
 Any payments or benefits payable to the Executive hereunder 
 in respect of any calendar year during which the

3

 Executive is employed by the Company for less than the

 compensation in respect of earned but unused vacation days, 
 determined in accordance with the Company's vacation policy 
 as in effect on the date hereof.

 6. Termination. Without prejudice to Section 2 hereof, the 
 Executive's employment hereunder may be terminated without any 
 breach of this Agreement only under the following circumstances:

 for Cause (for purposes of this Agreement) by mediation in 
 accordance with the provisions of this Agreement as set 
 forth in Section 17 herein.

 (d) Termination by the Executive. The Executive may terminate 
 his employment hereunder for Good Reason. For purposes of 
 any determination regarding the existence of Good Reason, 
 any claim by the Executive that Good Reason exists shall be 
 presumed to be correct unless the Company establishes to 
 the then existing Compensation Committee of the Board that 
 Good Reason does not exist.

 7. Compensation During Disability or Upon Termination.

 (a) During any period that the Executive fails to perform his 
 duties hereunder as a result of incapacity due to physical 
 or mental illness ("Disability Period"), the Executive 
 shall continue to receive his full salary at the rate then 
 in effect for such period until his employment is 
 terminated pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof; provided that, 
 payments so made to the Executive during the Disability 
 Period shall be reduced by the sum of the amounts, if any, 
 payable to the Executive at or prior to the time of any 
 such payment under disability benefit plans of the Company 
 or under the Social Security disability insurance program, 
 and which amounts were not previously applied to reduce any 
 such payment.

 4

(b) If the Executive's employment is terminated by his death, 
 the Company shall pay any amounts due to the Executive 
 under Section 5 through the date of his death in accordance 
 with Section 11(b).

 (c) If the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company 
 for Cause or by the Executive for other than Good Reason, 
 the Company shall pay the Executive his full salary through 
 the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time 
 Notice of Termination is given and the Company shall have 
 no further obligations to the Executive under this 
 Agreement.

 (d) If (1) in breach of this Agreement, the Company shall 
 terminate the Executive's employment other than for 
 Disability pursuant to Section 6(b) or for Cause (it being 
 understood that a purported termination for Disability 
 pursuant to Section 6(b) or for Cause which is disputed and 
 finally determined not to have been proper shall be a 
 termination by the Company in breach of this Agreement) or 
 (2) the Executive shall terminate his employment for Good 
 Reason, then, subject to the provisions of Section 10 
 hereof, the Company shall:

 (i) pay the Executive his full annual base salary through 
 the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the 
 time Notice of Termination is given and all other 
 unpaid amounts, if any, to which the Executive is 
 entitled as of the Date of Termination under any 
 Benefit Plan at the time such payments are due; 

 (ii) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, in 
 lieu of any further salary payments to the Executive 
 for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination, 
 pay as liquidated damages to the Executive an amount 
 equal to two (2) times the Executive's Cash 
 Compensation, such payment to be made in a lump sum 
 in cash, on or before the fifth day following the 
 Date of Termination;

 (iii) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, 
 arrange to provide the Executive for two (2) years 
 (or such shorter period as Executive may elect), with 
 disability, life, accident and health insurance 
 substantially similar to those insurance benefits 
 which Executive is receiving immediately prior to the 
 Notice of Termination (including coverage for 
 dependents at the same per person cost as the 
 Executive is then paying); provided that, benefits 
 otherwise receivable by Executive pursuant to this 
 subsection 6 (d)(iii) shall be reduced to the extent 
 comparable benefits are actually received by the 
 Executive during such two (2) year period following 
 his termination (or such shorter period elected by 
 the Executive), and any such benefits actually 
 received by Executive shall be reported by him to the 
 Company;

 (iv) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, pay 
 the Executive a benefit under the Premier Plan (or 
 other long term incentive plan) as if he had 
 terminated employment by reason of his retirement 
 (without regard to whether the Executive has, and 
 without deeming the Executive to have, reached his 
 normal retirement age) and as if any remaining 
 performance criteria and any time period of service 
 requirement had been waived; and

 (v) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, pay to 
 the Executive a single lump sum payment equal to the 
 excess of (x) over (y), where (x) is equal to the 
 present lump sum value of the combined pension 
 benefits that the Executive would receive under the
 Employees' Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan"),
 taking into account Article XV thereof, the Employee
 Benefits Restoration Plan (the 

 5

 "Restoration Plan") and providing supplemental
 pension benefits (collectively, the "Plans"), at his
 earliest benefit commencement date under the Pension
 Plan computed by increasing, in the case of each
 Plan, the number of years of credited service
 actually taken into account under each Plan as
 of the date of his termination of employment, or,
 if earlier, the termination of the Pension Plan, by
 two (2) years, and (y) is equal to the present lump
 sum value of the combined pension benefits actually
 payable to the Executive on his earliest benefit
 commencement date under the Pension Plan (taking into
 account Article XV thereof), the Restoration Plan
 and the Agreement based, in the case of each
 Plan, on the actual number of years of 
 credited service actually taken into account under 
 each Plan as of the date of his termination of 
 employment, or, if earlier, the termination of the 
 Pension Plan. The foregoing lump sum present value 
 amount, shall be computed using the actuarial factors 
 under the Pension Plan in effect on the date of the 
 Executive's termination of employment or, if earlier, 
 the termination of the Pension Plan.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Executive does
 not have two (2) full years remaining until the Executive's
 mandatory-retirement date under the Company's retirement
 policies, for purposes of this Section 7, the minimum two (2)
 year period set forth above shall automatically be reduced to 
 the number of years and/or partial years (measured by months)
 remaining until such Executive's retirement. For example, if
 Executive terminated his employment for Good Reason six months
 before mandatory retirement, the minimum two (2) year period set
 forth above would be reduced from 2 to 1.5. For purposes of this
 Agreement, the mandatory retirement age of an Executive shall
 be 65.

 8. Indemnification for Excise Tax.

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, in 
 the event that any of the payments or benefits received or 
 to be received by the Executive in connection with a 
 "change in control" (as defined in Section 280G of the 
 Code) (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or 
 any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, 
 any Person whose actions result in a change in control or 
 any Person affiliated with the Company or such Person) 
 (such payments or benefits, excluding the Gross-Up Payment, 
 being hereinafter referred to as the "Total Payments") will 
 be subject to the Excise Tax, the Company shall pay to the 
 Executive an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") 
 such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after 
 deduction of any Excise Tax on the Total Payments and any 
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes and 
 Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment, shall be equal to the 
 Total Payments.

 (b) For purposes of determining whether any of the Total 
 Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount 
 of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be 
 treated as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of 
 section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of 
 tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably acceptable to the 
 Executive and selected by the accounting firm which was, 
 immediately prior to the change in control, the Company's 
 independent auditor (the "Auditor"), such payments or 
 benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute 
 payments, including by reason of section 280G(b)(4)(A) of 
 the Code, (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the 
 meaning of section 280G(b)(1) of the Code shall be treated 
 as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax 
 Counsel, such excess parachute payments (in whole or in 
 part) represent reasonable compensation for services 
 actually rendered (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)
 (B) of the Code) in excess of the Base Amount allocable to 
 such reasonable compensation, or are otherwise not subject 
 to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of any noncash 
 benefits or any deferred payment 

6

 or benefit shall be determined by the Auditor in accordance
 with the principles of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the
 Code. For purposes of determining the amount of the
 Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay
 federal income tax at the highest marginal rate of federal
 income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up
 Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at
 the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and
 locality of the Executive's residence on the Date of
 Termination (or if there is no Date of Termination, then
 the date on which the Gross-Up Payment is calculated for
 purposes of this Section 8), net of the maximum reduction
 in federal income taxes which could be obtained from
 deduction of such state and local taxes.

 (c) In the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined to 
 be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in 
 calculating the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall repay 
 to the Company, within five (5) business days following the 
 time that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is 
 finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment 
 attributable to such reduction (plus that portion of the 
 Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and 
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes 
 imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the 
 Executive, to the extent that such repayment results in a 
 reduction in the Excise Tax and a dollar-for-dollar 
 reduction in the Executive's taxable income and wages for 
 purposes of federal, state and local income and employment 
 taxes, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at 
 120 of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the 
 Code. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to 
 exceed the amount taken into account hereunder in 
 calculating the Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of 
 any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be 
 determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the 
 Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in 
 respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or 
 additions payable by the Executive with respect to such 
 excess) within five (5) business days following the time 
 that the amount of such excess is finally determined. The 
 Executive and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate 
 with the other in connection with any administrative or 
 judicial proceedings concerning the existence or amount of 
 liability for Excise Tax with respect to the Total Payments.

 (d) Preparation of Tax Return. The Company, at its expense, 
 agrees to supply the Executive with advice from competent 
 tax counsel as to whether said Executive must reflect and 
 pay an excise tax under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code 
 on the filing of any federal income tax return of said 
 Executive relating to the period or periods in which said 
 Executive received payments or benefits under this 
 Agreement which may result in the imposition of such an 
 excise tax. If such tax counsel advises that such excise 
 tax must be reflected and paid on such tax return, said 
 Executive agrees to so reflect and pay such tax at which 
 time the Company will reimburse said Executive in 
 accordance with this Section 8. If such tax counsel 
 advises that such excise tax need not be reflected and paid 
 on such tax return, said Executive agrees to prepare and 
 file his tax return in accordance with such advice. In 
 either case the Company shall indemnify said Executive in 
 accordance with Section 8(a) of this Agreement for any 
 subsequent assessment of excise taxes made by the Internal 
 Revenue Service under Section 4999 of the Code in 
 accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.

 (e) Duty to Cooperate. The Executive agrees promptly to notify 
 the Company in the event of any audit by the Internal 
 Revenue Service ("IRS") in which the IRS asserts that any 
 excise tax should be assessed against said Executive and to 
 cooperate with the Company in contesting (at the Company's 
 expense) any such proposed assessment. Said Executive 
 agrees not to settle or compromise any such assessment 
 without the Company's consent. If said Executive's failure 
 to settle a proposed

7

 assessment with respect to such excise tax ("Proposed
 Assessment") at the direction of the Company is the reason
 his overall audit cannot be finally resolved, then said
 Executive may demand that the Company consent to 
 settle the Proposed Assessment. If the Company does not 
 settle the Proposed Assessment, or consent to allow said 
 Executive to settle, within sixty (60) days, the Company 
 shall indemnify and hold harmless said Executive from any 
 additional interest or penalties resulting from the delay 
 in finally resolving the audit.

 9. Effect of Agreement on Other Contractual Rights. The provisions 
 of this Agreement, and any payment provided for hereunder, shall 
 not reduce any amounts otherwise payable, or in any way diminish 
 the Executive's existing rights, or rights which would accrue 
 solely as a result of the passage of time, under any Benefit Plan 
 or other contract, plan or arrangement.

 10. Restrictive Covenants.

 (a) During the term of this Agreement, Executive shall not, 
 directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent 
 of the Company, provide consultative service to (with or 
 without pay), own, manage, operate, join, control, 
 participate in, or be connected with (as a stockholder, 
 partner, officer, director, employee or otherwise) any 
 business, individual, partner, firm, corporation, or other 
 entity that directly or indirectly competes with the 
 Company (a "Competitor of the Company"); provided that, the 
 "beneficial ownership" by Executive, either individually or 
 as a member of a "group," as such terms are used in Rule 
 13d of the General Rules and Regulations Exchange Act, of 
 not more than five percent (5 of the voting stock of any 
 publicly held corporation shall not be a violation of this 
 Agreement.

 (b) Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that in 
 his employment hereunder he occupies a position of trust 
 and confidence. During the term of the Agreement and for 
 all periods thereafter, Executive shall not, except as may 
 be required to perform his duties hereunder or as required 
 by applicable law, and except for information which is or 
 becomes publicly available other than as a result of a 
 breach by the Executive of the provisions hereof, disclose 
 to others or use, whether directly or indirectly, any 
 Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that such 
 Confidential Information is specialized, unique in nature 
 and of great value to the Company, and that such 
 information gives the Company a competitive advantage. The 
 Executive agrees to deliver or return to the Company, at 
 the Company's request at any time or upon termination or 
 expiration of his employment or as soon thereafter as 
 possible, all documents, computer tapes and disks, records, 
 lists, data, drawings, prints, notes and written 
 information (and all copies thereof) furnished by the 
 Company or prepared by the Executive during the term of his 
 employment by the Company.

 (c) Business Diversion. During the term of this Agreement and 
 any Severance Period thereafter, Executive shall not, 
 directly or indirectly, influence or attempt to influence 
 customers or suppliers of the Company to divert their 
 business to any Competitor of the Company.

 (d) Nonsolicitation. Executive recognizes that he will possess 
 confidential information about other employees of the 
 Company, relating to, among other things, their education, 
 experience, skills, abilities, compensation and benefits, 
 and inter-personal relationships with suppliers and 
 customers of the Company. Executive recognizes that the 
 information he will possess about these other employees is
 not generally known, is of substantial value to the
 Company and will be acquired by him because of his business
 position with the Company. Executive agrees that, during
 the term of

 8

 this Agreement and for one (1) year thereafter, he will
 not, directly or indirectly, solicit or recruit any
 employee of the Company for the purpose of being employed by
 him or by any other person on whose behalf he is acting as
 an agent, representative or employee and that he will not
 convey any such confidential information or trade secrets
 about other employees of the Company.

 11. Successors; Binding Agreement.

 (a) In connection with any agreement to which it is a party, the
 Company will require any successor (whether direct or
 indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise)
 to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of
 the Company, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory
 to the Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform
 this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent
 that the Company would be required to perform it if no such
 succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to
 obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the
 effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of
 this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to
 compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the
 same terms as he would be entitled to hereunder if he
 terminated his employment for Good Reason, except that for
 purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which
 any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the
 Date of Termination. As used in this Agreement, "Company"
 shall mean the Company as herein before defined and any
 successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which
 executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this
 Section 11 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms
 and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.

 (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
 enforceable by the Executive's personal and legal
 representatives, executors, administrators, successors,
 heirs, distributees, devises and legatees. If the
 Executive should die while any amounts are still payable to
 him hereunder, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided
 herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this
 Agreement to the Executive's devisee, legatee, or other
 designee or, if there be no such designee, to the
 Executive's estate.

 12. Notice/Notice of Termination. For purposes of this Agreement,
 notices and all other communications provided for in the Agreement
 shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given

 receipt requested, postage prepaid, as follows: if to the

 except that notices of change of address shall be effective only
 upon receipt. Any purported termination of the Executive's
 employment by the Company or the Executive hereunder shall be
 communicated by a Notice of Termination to the other party as set
 forth herein. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of
 Termination" shall mean a written notice which shall indicate

 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of October 15, 
1997, is made and entered into by and between Farmers Group, Inc., a Nevada 
corporation (the "Company") and Jason L. Katz (the "Executive").

 The Executive is presently employed by the Company.

 The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the 
Executive's contribution to the growth and success of the Company has been 
substantial. The Company, on behalf of itself and its stockholders, desires 
to continue to attract and retain well-qualified executive and key personnel 
who are an integral part of the management of the Company, such as the 
Executive, and to assure itself of continuity of management. The Executive is 
willing to commit himself to continue to serve the Company, on the terms and 
conditions herein provided.

 In order to effect the foregoing, the Company and the Executive wish to 
enter into an employment agreement on the terms and conditions set forth below.
Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the respective covenants 
and agreements of the parties herein contained, and intending to be legally 
bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 1. Employment. The Company hereby agrees to continue to employ the 
 Executive, and the Executive hereby agrees to continue to serve 
 the Company, on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 2. Term. This Agreement shall commence on the date set forth above 
 (the "Commencement Date") and shall expire on the last day of the 
 twenty-fourth (24th) month immediately following the Commencement 
 Date (the "Initial Term"), unless further extended or sooner 
 terminated as hereinafter provided. Commencing on the first day of 
 the twelfth (12th) month immediately following the Commencement 
 Date, and on each anniversary of such date thereafter, the term of 
 this Agreement shall automatically be extended for one additional 
 year (each such one-year extension referred to hereafter as an 
 "Extended Term"), unless, not later than twelve (12) months prior 
 to the expiration of the Initial Term or any Extended Term, the 
 Company shall have given notice to the Executive that it does not 
 wish to extend this Agreement. In no event, however, shall the 
 term of the Executive's employment hereunder extend beyond the 
 date of the Executive's actual retirement in accordance with the 
 Company's retirement policies in effect on the date hereof. 

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if a Potential Change in
 Control shall have occurred during the Initial Term or any
 Extended Term, the term of this Agreement shall be extended and
 shall continue in effect through the last day of the twenty-fourth
 (24th) month immediately following the date on which such
 Potential Change in Control occurred and (b) if a Change in
 Control shall have occurred during the Initial Term or any
 Extended Term, the term of this Agreement shall be extended and
 shall continue in effect through the last day of the
 twenty-fourth (24th) month immediately following the date on which
 such Change in Control occurred; provided that, if such Potential
 Change in Control is abandoned prior to the occurrence of a Change
 in Control, this Agreement shall expire in accordance with the
 provisions hereof, without regard to such extension.

 3. Position and Duties. The Executive shall continue to serve in his 
 current position and shall have such responsibilities, duties and 
 authority as he may have as of the date hereof (or any position to 
 which he may be promoted after the date hereof) and as may from 
 time to time be

 15

 assigned to the Executive by the Board that are consistent with
 such responsibilities, duties and authority. The Executive shall
 devote substantially all his working time and efforts to the
 business and affairs of the Company.

 4. Place of Performance. In connection with the Executive's 
 employment by the Company, the Executive shall continue to be 
 based in his current location, except for required travel on the 
 Company's business to an extent substantially consistent with 
 the duties of the Executive.

 5. Compensation and Related Matters.

 (a) Compensation. During the period of the Executive's 
 employment hereunder, the Company shall pay to the 
 Executive an annual amount equal to the Executive's Cash 
 Compensation at a rate not less than the rate in effect as 
 of the date hereof or such higher rate as may from time to 
 time be determined by the Board, such compensation to be 
 paid in such installments as are customary from time to 
 time for executive officers of the Company. This 
 compensation may be increased from time to time in 
 accordance with normal business practices of the Company 
 and, if so increased, shall not thereafter during the term 
 of this Agreement be decreased. Such compensation shall 
 not be deemed exclusive and shall not prevent the Executive 
 from participating in any other compensation or benefit 
 plan of the Company. The Cash Compensation payments 
 (including any increased salary payments) hereunder shall 
 not in any way limit or reduce any other obligation of the 
 Company hereunder, and no other compensation, benefit or 
 payment hereunder shall in any way limit or reduce the 
 obligation of the Company to pay the Executive's Cash 
 Compensation hereunder.

 (b) Expenses. During the term of the Executive's employment 
 hereunder, the Executive shall be entitled to receive 
 prompt reimbursement for all reasonable and customary 
 expenses incurred by the Executive in performing services 
 hereunder, including all expenses of travel and living 
 expenses while away from home on business or at the request 
 of and in the service of the Company; provided that, such 
 expenses are incurred and accounted for in accordance with 
 the policies and procedures established by the Company.

 (c) Other Benefits. The Executive shall be entitled to 
 continue to participate in all Company and Parent 
 compensation, incentive, welfare or benefit plans or 
 arrangements, as well as any plan or arrangement whereby 
 the Executive may acquire securities of the Company or 
 Parent in effect on the date hereof in which the Executive 
 is participating, or subsequent plans or arrangements 
 providing the Executive with substantially similar benefits 
 thereunder, including without limitation the Company's 
 Employees' Profit Sharing and Savings Plan, Employees' 
 Pension Plan, Farmers Stock Incentive Plan, Employees' 
 Stock Ownership Plan, the Farmers Executive Incentive 
 Program (the "EIP"), the Premier Award Unit Plan (the 
 "Premier Plan") and any other plan or arrangement to 
 receive and exercise stock options or stock appreciation 
 rights, supplemental pension plan, insured medical 
 reimbursement plan, automobile benefits, executive 
 financial planning, group life insurance plan, personal 
 catastrophe liability insurance, medical, dental, accident 
 and disability plans (each a "Benefit Plan"). The 
 Executive shall be entitled to participate in or receive 
 benefits under any Benefit Plan made available by the 
 Company in the future to its executives and key management 
 employees, subject to and on a basis consistent with the 
 terms, conditions and overall administration of such plans 
 and arrangements. Nothing paid to the Executive under any 
 Benefit Plan presently in effect or made available in the 
 future shall be deemed to be in lieu of the salary payable 
 to the Executive pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section. 
 Any payments or benefits payable to the Executive hereunder 
 in respect of any calendar year during which the

16

 Executive is employed by the Company for less than the
 entire such year shall, unless otherwise provided in the
 applicable Benefit Plan be prorated in accordance with the
 number of days in such calendar year during which he is so
 employed.

 (d) Vacations. The Executive shall be entitled to no less than 
 the number of vacation days in each calendar year, and to 
 compensation in respect of earned but unused vacation days, 
 determined in accordance with the Company's vacation policy 
 as in effect on the date hereof.

 (e) Services Furnished. The Company shall furnish the 
 Executive with office space, stenographic assistance and 
 such other facilities and services as shall be suitable to 
 the Executive's position and adequate for the performance 
 of his duties as set forth in Section 3 hereof.

 6. Termination. Without prejudice to Section 2 hereof, the 
 Executive's employment hereunder may be terminated without any 
 breach of this Agreement only under the following circumstances:

 (a) Death. The Executive's employment hereunder shall 
 terminate upon his death.

 (b) Disability. If, (i) as a result of the Executive's 
 incapacity due to physical or mental illness, the Executive 
 shall have been absent from his duties with the Company on 
 a full-time basis for the entire period of six (6) 
 consecutive months, and within thirty (30) days after 
 written "Notice of Termination" (as defined in Section 12 
 below) is thereafter given by the Company (which may occur 
 before or after the end of such six month period) the 
 Executive shall not have returned to the performance of his 
 duties hereunder on a full-time basis, or (ii) the 
 Executive becomes eligible for benefits under the Company's 
 long-term disability plan or any successor plan, the 
 Company may terminate this Agreement and the Executive's 
 employment hereunder for "Disability."

 (c) Cause. The Company may, in writing and without prior 
 notice, terminate the Executive's employment hereunder for 
 Cause (except as otherwise provided in clause (iv) of 
 subsection 13(d) (iv)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 
 Executive shall have the right to contest his termination 
 for Cause (for purposes of this Agreement) by mediation in 
 accordance with the provisions of this Agreement as set 
 forth in Section 17 herein.

 (d) Termination by the Executive. The Executive may terminate 
 his employment hereunder for Good Reason. For purposes of 
 any determination regarding the existence of Good Reason, 
 any claim by the Executive that Good Reason exists shall be 
 presumed to be correct unless the Company establishes to 
 the then existing Compensation Committee of the Board that 
 Good Reason does not exist.

 7. Compensation During Disability or Upon Termination.

 (a) During any period that the Executive fails to perform his 
 duties hereunder as a result of incapacity due to physical 
 or mental illness ("Disability Period"), the Executive 
 shall continue to receive his full salary at the rate then 
 in effect for such period until his employment is 
 terminated pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof; provided that, 
 payments so made to the Executive during the Disability 
 Period shall be reduced by the sum of the amounts, if any, 
 payable to the Executive at or prior to the time of any 
 such payment under disability benefit plans of the Company 
 or under the Social Security disability insurance program, 
 and which amounts were not previously applied to reduce any 
 such payment.

 17

(b) If the Executive's employment is terminated by his death, 
 the Company shall pay any amounts due to the Executive 
 under Section 5 through the date of his death in accordance 
 with Section 11(b).

 (c) If the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company 
 for Cause or by the Executive for other than Good Reason, 
 the Company shall pay the Executive his full salary through 
 the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time 
 Notice of Termination is given and the Company shall have 
 no further obligations to the Executive under this 
 Agreement.

 (d) If (1) in breach of this Agreement, the Company shall 
 terminate the Executive's employment other than for 
 Disability pursuant to Section 6(b) or for Cause (it being 
 understood that a purported termination for Disability 
 pursuant to Section 6(b) or for Cause which is disputed and 
 finally determined not to have been proper shall be a 
 termination by the Company in breach of this Agreement) or 
 (2) the Executive shall terminate his employment for Good 
 Reason, then, subject to the provisions of Section 10 
 hereof, the Company shall:

 (i) pay the Executive his full annual base salary through 
 the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the 
 time Notice of Termination is given and all other 
 unpaid amounts, if any, to which the Executive is 
 entitled as of the Date of Termination under any 
 Benefit Plan at the time such payments are due; 

 (ii) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, in 
 lieu of any further salary payments to the Executive 
 for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination, 
 pay as liquidated damages to the Executive an amount 
 equal to two (2) times the Executive's Cash 
 Compensation, such payment to be made in a lump sum 
 in cash, on or before the fifth day following the 
 Date of Termination;

 (iii) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, 
 arrange to provide the Executive for two (2) years 
 (or such shorter period as Executive may elect), with 
 disability, life, accident and health insurance 
 substantially similar to those insurance benefits 
 which Executive is receiving immediately prior to the 
 Notice of Termination (including coverage for 
 dependents at the same per person cost as the 
 Executive is then paying); provided that, benefits 
 otherwise receivable by Executive pursuant to this 
 subsection 6 (d)(iii) shall be reduced to the extent 
 comparable benefits are actually received by the 
 Executive during such two (2) year period following 
 his termination (or such shorter period elected by 
 the Executive), and any such benefits actually 
 received by Executive shall be reported by him to the 
 Company;

 (iv) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, pay 
 the Executive a benefit under the Premier Plan (or 
 other long term incentive plan) as if he had 
 terminated employment by reason of his retirement 
 (without regard to whether the Executive has, and 
 without deeming the Executive to have, reached his 
 normal retirement age) and as if any remaining 
 performance criteria and any time period of service 
 requirement had been waived; and

 (v) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, pay to 
 the Executive a single lump sum payment equal to the 
 excess of (x) over (y), where (x) is equal to the 
 present lump sum value of the combined pension 
 benefits that the Executive would receive under
 the Employees' Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan"),
 taking into account Article XV thereof, the Employee
 Benefits Restoration Plan (the 

18

 "Restoration Plan") and providing supplemental
 pension benefits (collectively, the "Plans"), at his
 earliest benefit commencement date under the Pension
 Plan computed by increasing, in the case of each
 Plan, the number of years of credited service
 actually taken into account under each Plan as of the
 date of his termination of employment, or, if
 earlier, the termination of the Pension Plan, by two
 (2) years, and (y) is equal to the present lump sum
 value of the combined pension benefits actually
 payable to the Executive on his earliest benefit
 commencement date under the Pension Plan (taking into
 account Article XV thereof), the Restoration Plan and
 the Agreement based, in the case of each Plan, on the
 actual number of years of credited service actually
 taken into account under each Plan as of the date of
 his termination of employment, or, if earlier,
 the termination of the Pension Plan. The foregoing
 lump sum present value amount, shall be computed
 using the actuarial factors under the Pension Plan in
 effect on the date of the Executive's termination of
 employment or, if earlier, the termination of the
 Pension Plan.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Executive does
 not have two (2) full years remaining until the Executive's
 mandatory-retirement date under the Company's retirement
 policies, for purposes of this Section 7, the minimum two (2)
 year period set forth above shall automatically be reduced to 
 the number of years and/or partial years (measured by months)
 remaining until such Executive's retirement. For example, if
 Executive terminated his employment for Good Reason six months
 before mandatory retirement, the minimum two (2) year period set
 forth above would be reduced from 2 to 1.5. For purposes of this
 Agreement, the mandatory retirement age of an Executive shall
 be 65.

 8. Indemnification for Excise Tax.

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, in 
 the event that any of the payments or benefits received or 
 to be received by the Executive in connection with a 
 "change in control" (as defined in Section 280G of the 
 Code) (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or 
 any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, 
 any Person whose actions result in a change in control or 
 any Person affiliated with the Company or such Person) 
 (such payments or benefits, excluding the Gross-Up Payment, 
 being hereinafter referred to as the "Total Payments") will 
 be subject to the Excise Tax, the Company shall pay to the 
 Executive an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") 
 such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after 
 deduction of any Excise Tax on the Total Payments and any 
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes and 
 Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment, shall be equal to the 
 Total Payments.

 (b) For purposes of determining whether any of the Total 
 Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount 
 of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be 
 treated as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of 
 section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of 
 tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably acceptable to the 
 Executive and selected by the accounting firm which was, 
 immediately prior to the change in control, the Company's 
 independent auditor (the "Auditor"), such payments or 
 benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute 
 payments, including by reason of section 280G(b)(4)(A) of 
 the Code, (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the 
 meaning of section 280G(b)(1) of the Code shall be treated 
 as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax 
 Counsel, such excess parachute payments (in whole or in 
 part) represent reasonable compensation for services 
 actually rendered (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)
 (B) of the Code) in excess of the Base Amount allocable to 
 such reasonable compensation, or are otherwise not subject 
 to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of any noncash 
 benefits or any deferred payment 

 19

 or benefit shall be determined by the Auditor in accordance
 with the principles of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the
 Code. For purposes of determining the amount of the
 Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay
 federal income tax at the highest marginal rate of federal
 income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up
 Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at
 the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and
 locality of the Executive's residence on the Date of
 Termination (or if there is no Date of Termination, then
 the date on which the Gross-Up Payment is calculated for
 purposes of this Section 8), net of the maximum reduction
 in federal income taxes which could be obtained from
 deduction of such state and local taxes.

 (c) In the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined to 
 be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in 
 calculating the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall repay 
 to the Company, within five (5) business days following the 
 time that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is 
 finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment 
 attributable to such reduction (plus that portion of the 
 Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and 
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes 
 imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the 
 Executive, to the extent that such repayment results in a 
 reduction in the Excise Tax and a dollar-for-dollar 
 reduction in the Executive's taxable income and wages for 
 purposes of federal, state and local income and employment 
 taxes, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at 
 120 of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the 
 Code. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to 
 exceed the amount taken into account hereunder in 
 calculating the Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of 
 any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be 
 determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the 
 Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in 
 respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or 
 additions payable by the Executive with respect to such 
 excess) within five (5) business days following the time 
 that the amount of such excess is finally determined. The 
 Executive and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate 
 with the other in connection with any administrative or 
 judicial proceedings concerning the existence or amount of 
 liability for Excise Tax with respect to the Total Payments.

 (d) Preparation of Tax Return. The Company, at its expense, 
 agrees to supply the Executive with advice from competent 
 tax counsel as to whether said Executive must reflect and 
 pay an excise tax under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code 
 on the filing of any federal income tax return of said 
 Executive relating to the period or periods in which said 
 Executive received payments or benefits under this 
 Agreement which may result in the imposition of such an 
 excise tax. If such tax counsel advises that such excise 
 tax must be reflected and paid on such tax return, said 
 Executive agrees to so reflect and pay such tax at which 
 time the Company will reimburse said Executive in 
 accordance with this Section 8. If such tax counsel 
 advises that such excise tax need not be reflected and paid 
 on such tax return, said Executive agrees to prepare and 
 file his tax return in accordance with such advice. In 
 either case the Company shall indemnify said Executive in 
 accordance with Section 8(a) of this Agreement for any 
 subsequent assessment of excise taxes made by the Internal 
 Revenue Service under Section 4999 of the Code in 
 accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.

 (e) Duty to Cooperate. The Executive agrees promptly to notify 
 the Company in the event of any audit by the Internal 
 Revenue Service ("IRS") in which the IRS asserts that any 
 excise tax should be assessed against said Executive and to 
 cooperate with the Company in contesting (at the Company's 
 expense) any such proposed assessment. Said Executive 
 agrees not to settle or compromise any such assessment 
 without the Company's consent. If said Executive's failure 
 to settle a proposed
 
 20

 assessment with respect to such excise tax ("Proposed
 Assessment") at the direction of the Company 
 is the reason his overall audit cannot be finally resolved, 
 then said Executive may demand that the Company consent to 
 settle the Proposed Assessment. If the Company does not 
 settle the Proposed Assessment, or consent to allow said 
 Executive to settle, within sixty (60) days, the Company 
 shall indemnify and hold harmless said Executive from any 
 additional interest or penalties resulting from the delay 
 in finally resolving the audit.

 9. Effect of Agreement on Other Contractual Rights. The provisions 
 of this Agreement, and any payment provided for hereunder, shall 
 not reduce any amounts otherwise payable, or in any way diminish 
 the Executive's existing rights, or rights which would accrue 
 solely as a result of the passage of time, under any Benefit Plan 
 or other contract, plan or arrangement.

 10. Restrictive Covenants.

 (a) During the term of this Agreement, Executive shall not, 
 directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent 
 of the Company, provide consultative service to (with or 
 without pay), own, manage, operate, join, control, 
 participate in, or be connected with (as a stockholder, 
 partner, officer, director, employee or otherwise) any 
 business, individual, partner, firm, corporation, or other 
 entity that directly or indirectly competes with the 
 Company (a "Competitor of the Company"); provided that, the 
 "beneficial ownership" by Executive, either individually or 
 as a member of a "group," as such terms are used in Rule 
 13d of the General Rules and Regulations Exchange Act, of 
 not more than five percent (5 of the voting stock of any 
 publicly held corporation shall not be a violation of this 
 Agreement.

 (b) Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that in 
 his employment hereunder he occupies a position of trust 
 and confidence. During the term of the Agreement and for 
 all periods thereafter, Executive shall not, except as may 
 be required to perform his duties hereunder or as required 
 by applicable law, and except for information which is or 
 becomes publicly available other than as a result of a 
 breach by the Executive of the provisions hereof, disclose 
 to others or use, whether directly or indirectly, any 
 Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that such 
 Confidential Information is specialized, unique in nature 
 and of great value to the Company, and that such 
 information gives the Company a competitive advantage. The 
 Executive agrees to deliver or return to the Company, at 
 the Company's request at any time or upon termination or 
 expiration of his employment or as soon thereafter as 
 possible, all documents, computer tapes and disks, records, 
 lists, data, drawings, prints, notes and written 
 information (and all copies thereof) furnished by the 
 Company or prepared by the Executive during the term of his 
 employment by the Company.

 (c) Business Diversion. During the term of this Agreement and 
 any Severance Period thereafter, Executive shall not, 
 directly or indirectly, influence or attempt to influence 
 customers or suppliers of the Company to divert their 
 business to any Competitor of the Company.

 (d) Nonsolicitation. Executive recognizes that he will possess 
 confidential information about other employees of the 
 Company, relating to, among other things, their education, 
 experience, skills, abilities, compensation and benefits, 
 and inter-personal relationships with suppliers and 
 customers of the Company. Executive recognizes that the 
 information he will possess about these other employees is
 not generally known, is of substantial value to the
 Company and will be acquired by him because of his business
 position with the Company. Executive agrees that, during
 the term of

 21

 this Agreement and for one (1) year thereafter, he will
 not, directly or indirectly, solicit or recruit any
 employee of the Company for the purpose of being employed by
 him or by any other person on whose behalf he is acting as
 an agent, representative or employee and that he will not
 convey any such confidential information or trade secrets
 about other employees of the Company.

 11. Successors; Binding Agreement.

 (a) In connection with any agreement to which it is a party, the
 Company will require any successor (whether direct or
 indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise)
 to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of
 the Company, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory
 to the Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform
 this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent
 that the Company would be required to perform it if no such
 succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to
 obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the
 effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of
 this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to
 compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the
 same terms as he would be entitled to hereunder if he
 terminated his employment for Good Reason, except that for
 purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which
 any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the
 Date of Termination. As used in this Agreement, "Company"
 shall mean the Company as herein before defined and any
 successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which
 executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this
 Section 11 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms
 and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.

 (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
 enforceable by the Executive's personal and legal
 representatives, executors, administrators, successors,

 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of October 15, 
1997, is made and entered into by and between Farmers Group, Inc., a Nevada 
corporation (the "Company") and James A. MacKinnon (the "Executive").

 The Executive is presently employed by the Company.

 The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the 
Executive's contribution to the growth and success of the Company has been 
substantial. The Company, on behalf of itself and its stockholders, desires 
to continue to attract and retain well-qualified executive and key personnel 
who are an integral part of the management of the Company, such as the 
Executive, and to assure itself of continuity of management. The Executive is 
willing to commit himself to continue to serve the Company, on the terms and 
conditions herein provided.

 In order to effect the foregoing, the Company and the Executive wish to 
enter into an employment agreement on the terms and conditions set forth below.
Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the respective covenants 
and agreements of the parties herein contained, and intending to be legally 
bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 1. Employment. The Company hereby agrees to continue to employ the 
 Executive, and the Executive hereby agrees to continue to serve 
 the Company, on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 2. Term. This Agreement shall commence on the date set forth above 
 (the "Commencement Date") and shall expire on the last day of the 
 twenty-fourth (24th) month immediately following the Commencement 
 Date (the "Initial Term"), unless further extended or sooner 
 terminated as hereinafter provided. Commencing on the first day of 
 the twelfth (12th) month immediately following the Commencement 
 Date, and on each anniversary of such date thereafter, the term of 
 this Agreement shall automatically be extended for one additional 
 year (each such one-year extension referred to hereafter as an 
 "Extended Term"), unless, not later than twelve (12) months prior 
 to the expiration of the Initial Term or any Extended Term, the 
 Company shall have given notice to the Executive that it does not 
 wish to extend this Agreement. In no event, however, shall the 
 term of the Executive's employment hereunder extend beyond the 
 date of the Executive's actual retirement in accordance with the 
 Company's retirement policies in effect on the date hereof. 

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if a Potential Change in
 Control shall have occurred during the Initial Term or any
 Extended Term, the term of this Agreement shall be extended and
 shall continue in effect through the last day of the twenty-fourth
 (24th) month immediately following the date on which such
 Potential Change in Control occurred and (b) if a Change in
 Control shall have occurred during the Initial Term or any
 Extended Term, the term of this Agreement shall be extended and
 shall continue in effect through the last day of the
 twenty-fourth (24th) month immediately following the date on which
 such Change in Control occurred; provided that, if such Potential
 Change in Control is abandoned prior to the occurrence of a Change
 in Control, this Agreement shall expire in accordance with the
 provisions hereof, without regard to such extension.

 3. Position and Duties. The Executive shall continue to serve in his 
 current position and shall have such responsibilities, duties and 
 authority as he may have as of the date hereof (or any position to 
 which he may be promoted after the date hereof) and as may from 
 time to time be assigned to the Executive by the Board that are 
 consistent with such responsibilities, duties

 28

 and authority. The Executive shall devote substantially all his
 working time and efforts to the business and affairs of the Company.

 4. Place of Performance. In connection with the Executive's 
 employment by the Company, the Executive shall continue to be 
 based in his current location, except for required travel on the 
 Company's business to an extent substantially consistent with 
 the duties of the Executive.

 5. Compensation and Related Matters.

 (a) Compensation. During the period of the Executive's 
 employment hereunder, the Company shall pay to the 
 Executive an annual amount equal to the Executive's Cash 
 Compensation at a rate not less than the rate in effect as 
 of the date hereof or such higher rate as may from time to 
 time be determined by the Board, such compensation to be 
 paid in such installments as are customary from time to 
 time for executive officers of the Company. This 
 compensation may be increased from time to time in 
 accordance with normal business practices of the Company 
 and, if so increased, shall not thereafter during the term 
 of this Agreement be decreased. Such compensation shall 
 not be deemed exclusive and shall not prevent the Executive 
 from participating in any other compensation or benefit 
 plan of the Company. The Cash Compensation payments 
 (including any increased salary payments) hereunder shall 
 not in any way limit or reduce any other obligation of the 
 Company hereunder, and no other compensation, benefit or 
 payment hereunder shall in any way limit or reduce the 
 obligation of the Company to pay the Executive's Cash 
 Compensation hereunder.

 (b) Expenses. During the term of the Executive's employment 
 hereunder, the Executive shall be entitled to receive 
 prompt reimbursement for all reasonable and customary 
 expenses incurred by the Executive in performing services 
 hereunder, including all expenses of travel and living 
 expenses while away from home on business or at the request 
 of and in the service of the Company; provided that, such 
 expenses are incurred and accounted for in accordance with 
 the policies and procedures established by the Company.

 (c) Other Benefits. The Executive shall be entitled to 
 continue to participate in all Company and Parent 
 compensation, incentive, welfare or benefit plans or 
 arrangements, as well as any plan or arrangement whereby 
 the Executive may acquire securities of the Company or 
 Parent in effect on the date hereof in which the Executive 
 is participating, or subsequent plans or arrangements 
 providing the Executive with substantially similar benefits 
 thereunder, including without limitation the Company's 
 Employees' Profit Sharing and Savings Plan, Employees' 
 Pension Plan, Farmers Stock Incentive Plan, Employees' 
 Stock Ownership Plan, the Farmers Executive Incentive 
 Program (the "EIP"), the Premier Award Unit Plan (the 
 "Premier Plan") and any other plan or arrangement to

 rights, supplemental pension plan, insured medical 
 reimbursement plan, automobile benefits, executive 
 financial planning, group life insurance plan, personal 
 catastrophe liability insurance, medical, dental, accident 
 and disability plans (each a "Benefit Plan"). The

 benefits under any Benefit Plan made available by the 
 Company in the future to its executives and key management 
 employees, subject to and on a basis consistent with the 
 terms, conditions and overall administration of such plans 
 and arrangements. Nothing paid to the Executive under any 
 Benefit Plan presently in effect or made available in the 
 future shall be deemed to be in lieu of the salary payable 
 to the Executive pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section. 
 Any payments or benefits payable to the Executive hereunder 
 in respect of any calendar year during which the Executive 
 is employed by the Company for less than the entire such 
 year shall, unless

 29

 otherwise provided in the applicable Benefit Plan be
 prorated in accordance with the number of days
 in such calendar year during which he is so employed.

 (d) Vacations. The Executive shall be entitled to no less than 
 the number of vacation days in each calendar year, and to 
 compensation in respect of earned but unused vacation days, 
 determined in accordance with the Company's vacation policy 
 as in effect on the date hereof.

 (e) Services Furnished. The Company shall furnish the 
 Executive with office space, stenographic assistance and 
 such other facilities and services as shall be suitable to 
 the Executive's position and adequate for the performance 
 of his duties as set forth in Section 3 hereof.

 6. Termination. Without prejudice to Section 2 hereof, the 
 Executive's employment hereunder may be terminated without any 
 breach of this Agreement only under the following circumstances:

 (a) Death. The Executive's employment hereunder shall 
 terminate upon his death.

 (b) Disability. If, (i) as a result of the Executive's 
 incapacity due to physical or mental illness, the Executive 
 shall have been absent from his duties with the Company on 
 a full-time basis for the entire period of six (6) 
 consecutive months, and within thirty (30) days after 
 written "Notice of Termination" (as defined in Section 12 
 below) is thereafter given by the Company (which may occur 
 before or after the end of such six month period) the 
 Executive shall not have returned to the performance of his 
 duties hereunder on a full-time basis, or (ii) the 
 Executive becomes eligible for benefits under the Company's 
 long-term disability plan or any successor plan, the 
 Company may terminate this Agreement and the Executive's 
 employment hereunder for "Disability."

 (c) Cause. The Company may, in writing and without prior 
 notice, terminate the Executive's employment hereunder for 
 Cause (except as otherwise provided in clause (iv) of 
 subsection 13(d) (iv)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 
 Executive shall have the right to contest his termination 
 for Cause (for purposes of this Agreement) by mediation in 
 accordance with the provisions of this Agreement as set 
 forth in Section 17 herein.

 (d) Termination by the Executive. The Executive may terminate 
 his employment hereunder for Good Reason. For purposes of 
 any determination regarding the existence of Good Reason, 
 any claim by the Executive that Good Reason exists shall be 
 presumed to be correct unless the Company establishes to 
 the then existing Compensation Committee of the Board that 
 Good Reason does not exist.

 7. Compensation During Disability or Upon Termination.

 (a) During any period that the Executive fails to perform his 
 duties hereunder as a result of incapacity due to physical 
 or mental illness ("Disability Period"), the Executive 
 shall continue to receive his full salary at the rate then 
 in effect for such period until his employment is 
 terminated pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof; provided that, 
 payments so made to the Executive during the Disability 
 Period shall be reduced by the sum of the amounts, if any, 
 payable to the Executive at or prior to the time of any 
 such payment under disability benefit plans of the Company 
 or under the Social Security disability insurance program, 
 and which amounts were not previously applied to reduce any 
 such payment.

 30

(b) If the Executive's employment is terminated by his death, 
 the Company shall pay any amounts due to the Executive 
 under Section 5 through the date of his death in accordance 
 with Section 11(b).

 (c) If the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company 
 for Cause or by the Executive for other than Good Reason, 
 the Company shall pay the Executive his full salary through 
 the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time 
 Notice of Termination is given and the Company shall have 
 no further obligations to the Executive under this 
 Agreement.

 (d) If (1) in breach of this Agreement, the Company shall 
 terminate the Executive's employment other than for 
 Disability pursuant to Section 6(b) or for Cause (it being 
 understood that a purported termination for Disability 
 pursuant to Section 6(b) or for Cause which is disputed and 
 finally determined not to have been proper shall be a 
 termination by the Company in breach of this Agreement) or 
 (2) the Executive shall terminate his employment for Good 
 Reason, then, subject to the provisions of Section 10 
 hereof, the Company shall:

 (i) pay the Executive his full annual base salary through 
 the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the 
 time Notice of Termination is given and all other 
 unpaid amounts, if any, to which the Executive is 
 entitled as of the Date of Termination under any 
 Benefit Plan at the time such payments are due; 

 (ii) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, in 
 lieu of any further salary payments to the Executive 
 for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination, 
 pay as liquidated damages to the Executive an amount 
 equal to two (2) times the Executive's Cash 
 Compensation, such payment to be made in a lump sum 
 in cash, on or before the fifth day following the 
 Date of Termination;

 (iii) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, 
 arrange to provide the Executive for two (2) years 
 (or such shorter period as Executive may elect), with 
 disability, life, accident and health insurance 
 substantially similar to those insurance benefits 
 which Executive is receiving immediately prior to the 
 Notice of Termination (including coverage for 
 dependents at the same per person cost as the 
 Executive is then paying); provided that, benefits 
 otherwise receivable by Executive pursuant to this 
 subsection 6 (d)(iii) shall be reduced to the extent 
 comparable benefits are actually received by the 
 Executive during such two (2) year period following 
 his termination (or such shorter period elected by 
 the Executive), and any such benefits actually 
 received by Executive shall be reported by him to the 
 Company;

 (iv) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, pay 
 the Executive a benefit under the Premier Plan (or 
 other long term incentive plan) as if he had 
 terminated employment by reason of his retirement 
 (without regard to whether the Executive has, and 
 without deeming the Executive to have, reached his 
 normal retirement age) and as if any remaining 
 performance criteria and any time period of service 
 requirement had been waived; and

 (v) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, pay to 
 the Executive a single lump sum payment equal to the 
 excess of (x) over (y), where (x) is equal to the 
 present lump sum value of the combined pension 
 benefits Executive would receive under the Employees' 
 Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan"), taking into 
 account Article XV thereof, the Employee Benefits 
 Restoration Plan (the "Restoration Plan") and 
 providing supplemental pension benefits 
 (collectively, the

 31

 "Plans"), at his earliest benefit commencement date
 under the Pension Plan computed by increasing, in the
 case of each Plan, the number of years of credited
 service actually taken into account under each Plan
 as of the date of his termination of employment, or,
 if earlier, the termination of the Pension Plan, by
 two (2) years, and (y) is equal to the present lump
 sum value of the combined pension benefits actually
 payable to the Executive on his earliest benefit
 commencement date under the Pension Plan (taking into
 account Article XV thereof), the Restoration Plan
 and the Agreement based, in the case of each
 Plan, on the actual number of years of credited
 service actually taken into account under each
 Plan as of the date of his termination of 
 employment, or, if earlier, the termination of the 
 Pension Plan. The foregoing lump sum present value 
 amount, shall be computed using the actuarial factors 
 under the Pension Plan in effect on the date of the 
 Executive's termination of employment or, if earlier, 
 the termination of the Pension Plan.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Executive does
 not have two (2) full years remaining until the Executive's
 mandatory-retirement date under the Company's retirement
 policies, for purposes of this Section 7, the minimum two (2)
 year period set forth above shall automatically be reduced to 
 the number of years and/or partial years (measured by months)
 remaining until such Executive's retirement. For example, if
 Executive terminated his employment for Good Reason six months
 before mandatory retirement, the minimum two (2) year period set
 forth above would be reduced from 2 to 1.5. For purposes of this
 Agreement, the mandatory retirement age of an Executive shall
 be 65.

 8. Indemnification for Excise Tax.

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, in 
 the event that any of the payments or benefits received or 
 to be received by the Executive in connection with a 
 "change in control" (as defined in Section 280G of the 
 Code) (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or 
 any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, 
 any Person whose actions result in a change in control or 
 any Person affiliated with the Company or such Person) 
 (such payments or benefits, excluding the Gross-Up Payment, 
 being hereinafter referred to as the "Total Payments") will 
 be subject to the Excise Tax, the Company shall pay to the 
 Executive an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") 
 such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after 
 deduction of any Excise Tax on the Total Payments and any 
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes and 
 Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment, shall be equal to the 
 Total Payments.

 (b) For purposes of determining whether any of the Total 
 Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount 
 of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be 
 treated as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of 
 section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of 
 tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably acceptable to the 
 Executive and selected by the accounting firm which was, 
 immediately prior to the change in control, the Company's 
 independent auditor (the "Auditor"), such payments or 
 benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute 
 payments, including by reason of section 280G(b)(4)(A) of 
 the Code, (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the 
 meaning of section 280G(b)(1) of the Code shall be treated 
 as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax 
 Counsel, such excess parachute payments (in whole or in 
 part) represent reasonable compensation for services 
 actually rendered (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)
 (B) of the Code) in excess of the Base Amount allocable to 
 such reasonable compensation, or are otherwise not subject 
 to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of any noncash 
 benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be 
 determined by the Auditor in accordance with the principles 
 of

 32

 sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes 
 of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the 
 Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income tax at the 
 highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the 
 calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made 
 and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal 
 rate of taxation in the state and locality of the 
 Executive's residence on the Date of Termination (or if 
 there is no Date of Termination, then the date on which 
 the Gross-Up Payment is calculated for purposes of this 
 Section 8), net of the maximum reduction in federal income 
 taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state 
 and local taxes.

 (c) In the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined to 
 be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in 
 calculating the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall repay 
 to the Company, within five (5) business days following the 
 time that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is 
 finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment 
 attributable to such reduction (plus that portion of the 
 Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and 
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes 
 imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the 
 Executive, to the extent that such repayment results in a 
 reduction in the Excise Tax and a dollar-for-dollar 
 reduction in the Executive's taxable income and wages for 
 purposes of federal, state and local income and employment 
 taxes, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at 
 120 of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the 
 Code. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to 
 exceed the amount taken into account hereunder in 
 calculating the Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of 
 any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be 
 determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the 
 Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in 
 respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or 
 additions payable by the Executive with respect to such 
 excess) within five (5) business days following the time 
 that the amount of such excess is finally determined. The 
 Executive and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate 
 with the other in connection with any administrative or 
 judicial proceedings concerning the existence or amount of 
 liability for Excise Tax with respect to the Total Payments.

 (d) Preparation of Tax Return. The Company, at its expense, 
 agrees to supply the Executive with advice from competent 
 tax counsel as to whether said Executive must reflect and 
 pay an excise tax under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code 
 on the filing of any federal income tax return of said 
 Executive relating to the period or periods in which said 
 Executive received payments or benefits under this 
 Agreement which may result in the imposition of such an 
 excise tax. If such tax counsel advises that such excise 
 tax must be reflected and paid on such tax return, said 
 Executive agrees to so reflect and pay such tax at which 
 time the Company will reimburse said Executive in 
 accordance with this Section 8. If such tax counsel 
 advises that such excise tax need not be reflected and paid 
 on such tax return, said Executive agrees to prepare and 
 file his tax return in accordance with such advice. In 
 either case the Company shall indemnify said Executive in 
 accordance with Section 8(a) of this Agreement for any 
 subsequent assessment of excise taxes made by the Internal 
 Revenue Service under Section 4999 of the Code in 
 accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.

 (e) Duty to Cooperate. The Executive agrees promptly to notify 
 the Company in the event of any audit by the Internal 
 Revenue Service ("IRS") in which the IRS asserts that any 
 excise tax should be assessed against said Executive and to 
 cooperate with the Company in contesting (at the Company's 
 expense) any such proposed assessment. Said Executive 
 agrees not to settle or compromise any such assessment 
 without the Company's consent. If said Executive's failure 
 to settle a proposed assessment with respect to such excise 
 tax ("Proposed Assessment") at the direction

 33

 of the Company is the reason his overall audit cannot be
 finally resolved, then said Executive may demand that the
 Company consent to settle the Proposed Assessment. If the
 Company does not settle the Proposed Assessment, or consent
 to allow said Executive to settle, within sixty (60) days,
 the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless said
 Executive from any additional interest or penalties
 resulting from the delay in finally resolving the audit.

 9. Effect of Agreement on Other Contractual Rights. The provisions 
 of this Agreement, and any payment provided for hereunder, shall 
 not reduce any amounts otherwise payable, or in any way diminish 
 the Executive's existing rights, or rights which would accrue 
 solely as a result of the passage of time, under any Benefit Plan 
 or other contract, plan or arrangement.

 10. Restrictive Covenants.

 partner, officer, director, employee or otherwise) any 
 business, individual, partner, firm, corporation, or other 
 entity that directly or indirectly competes with the 
 Company (a "Competitor of the Company"); provided that, the 
 "beneficial ownership" by Executive, either individually or 
 as a member of a "group," as such terms are used in Rule 
 13d of the General Rules and Regulations Exchange Act, of 
 not more than five percent (5 of the voting stock of any 
 publicly held corporation shall not be a violation of this 
 Agreement.

 (b) Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that in 
 his employment hereunder he occupies a position of trust 
 and confidence. During the term of the Agreement and for 
 all periods thereafter, Executive shall not, except as may 
 be required to perform his duties hereunder or as required 
 by applicable law, and except for information which is or 
 becomes publicly available other than as a result of a 
 breach by the Executive of the provisions hereof, disclose 
 to others or use, whether directly or indirectly, any 
 Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that such 
 Confidential Information is specialized, unique in nature 
 and of great value to the Company, and that such 
 information gives the Company a competitive advantage. The 
 Executive agrees to deliver or return to the Company, at 
 the Company's request at any time or upon termination or 
 expiration of his employment or as soon thereafter as 
 possible, all documents, computer tapes and disks, records, 
 lists, data, drawings, prints, notes and written 
 information (and all copies thereof) furnished by the 
 Company or prepared by the Executive during the term of his 
 employment by the Company.

 confidential information about other employees of the 
 Company, relating to, among other things, their education, 
 experience, skills, abilities, compensation and benefits, 
 and inter-personal relationships with suppliers and

 information he will possess about these other employees is
 not generally known, is of substantial value to the
 Company and will be acquired by him because of his business
 position with the Company. Executive agrees that, during
 the term of this Agreement and for one (1) year thereafter,
 he will not, directly or indirectly, solicit 
 34

 or recruit any employee of the Company for the purpose of
 being employed by him or by any other person on whose
 behalf he is acting as an agent, representative or
 employee and that he will not convey any such confidential
 information or trade secrets about other employees of the
 Company.

 11. Successors; Binding Agreement.

 (a) In connection with any agreement to which it is a party, the
 Company will require any successor (whether direct or
 indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise)
 to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of
 the Company, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory
 to the Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform
 this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent
 that the Company would be required to perform it if no such
 succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to
 obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the
 effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of
 this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to
 compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the
 same terms as he would be entitled to hereunder if he
 terminated his employment for Good Reason, except that for
 purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which
 any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the
 Date of Termination. As used in this Agreement, "Company"
 shall mean the Company as herein before defined and any

 executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this
 Section 11 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms

 enforceable by the Executive's personal and legal
 representatives, executors, administrators, successors,
 heirs, distributees, devises and legatees. If the
 Executive should die while any amounts are still payable to
 him hereunder, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided
 herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this
 Agreement to the Executive's devisee, legatee, or other
 designee or, if there be no such designee, to the
 Executive's estate.

 12. Notice/Notice of Termination. For purposes of this Agreement,
 notices and all other communications provided for in the Agreement
 shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given

 employment by the Company or the Executive hereunder shall be

 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of October 15, 
1997, is made and entered into by and between Farmers Group, Inc., a Nevada 
corporation (the "Company") and Keitha T. Schofield (the "Executive").

 The Executive is presently employed by the Company.

 The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the 
Executive's contribution to the growth and success of the Company has been 
substantial. The Company, on behalf of itself and its stockholders, desires 
to continue to attract and retain well-qualified executive and key personnel 
who are an integral part of the management of the Company, such as the 
Executive, and to assure itself of continuity of management. The Executive is 
willing to commit himself to continue to serve the Company, on the terms and 
conditions herein provided.

 In order to effect the foregoing, the Company and the Executive wish to 
enter into an employment agreement on the terms and conditions set forth below.
Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the respective covenants 
and agreements of the parties herein contained, and intending to be legally 
bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 twenty-fourth (24th) month immediately following the Commencement 
 Date (the "Initial Term"), unless further extended or sooner 
 terminated as hereinafter provided. Commencing on the first day of 
 the twelfth (12th) month immediately following the Commencement

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if a Potential Change in
 Control shall have occurred during the Initial Term or any

 (24th) month immediately following the date on which such

 Control shall have occurred during the Initial Term or any
 Extended Term, the term of this Agreement shall be extended and
 shall continue in effect through the last day of the
 twenty-fourth (24th) month immediately following the date on which
 such Change in Control occurred; provided that, if such Potential
 Change in Control is abandoned prior to the occurrence of a Change
 in Control, this Agreement shall expire in accordance with the
 provisions hereof, without regard to such extension.

 3. Position and Duties. The Executive shall continue to serve in his 
 current position and shall have such responsibilities, duties and 
 authority as he may have as of the date hereof (or any position to 
 which he may be promoted after the date hereof) and as may from 
 time to time be

 41

 assigned to the Executive by the Board that are consistent with
 such responsibilities, duties and authority. The Executive shall
 devote substantially all his working time and efforts to the
 business and affairs of the Company.

 4. Place of Performance. In connection with the Executive's 
 employment by the Company, the Executive shall continue to be

 5. Compensation and Related Matters.

 (a) Compensation. During the period of the Executive's 
 employment hereunder, the Company shall pay to the

 of the date hereof or such higher rate as may from time to 
 time be determined by the Board, such compensation to be 
 paid in such installments as are customary from time to 
 time for executive officers of the Company. This 
 compensation may be increased from time to time in 
 accordance with normal business practices of the Company 
 and, if so increased, shall not thereafter during the term 
 of this Agreement be decreased. Such compensation shall 
 not be deemed exclusive and shall not prevent the Executive 
 from participating in any other compensation or benefit 
 plan of the Company. The Cash Compensation payments 
 (including any increased salary payments) hereunder shall 
 not in any way limit or reduce any other obligation of the 
 Company hereunder, and no other compensation, benefit or 
 payment hereunder shall in any way limit or reduce the 
 obligation of the Company to pay the Executive's Cash 
 Compensation hereunder.

 (b) Expenses. During the term of the Executive's employment 
 hereunder, the Executive shall be entitled to receive 
 prompt reimbursement for all reasonable and customary 
 expenses incurred by the Executive in performing services 
 hereunder, including all expenses of travel and living 
 expenses while away from home on business or at the request 
 of and in the service of the Company; provided that, such 
 expenses are incurred and accounted for in accordance with 
 the policies and procedures established by the Company.

 (c) Other Benefits. The Executive shall be entitled to 
 continue to participate in all Company and Parent 
 compensation, incentive, welfare or benefit plans or 
 arrangements, as well as any plan or arrangement whereby 
 the Executive may acquire securities of the Company or 
 Parent in effect on the date hereof in which the Executive

 providing the Executive with substantially similar benefits 
 thereunder, including without limitation the Company's 
 Employees' Profit Sharing and Savings Plan, Employees' 
 Pension Plan, Farmers Stock Incentive Plan, Employees' 
 Stock Ownership Plan, the Farmers Executive Incentive

 rights, supplemental pension plan, insured medical 
 reimbursement plan, automobile benefits, executive 
 financial planning, group life insurance plan, personal 
 catastrophe liability insurance, medical, dental, accident 
 and disability plans (each a "Benefit Plan"). The

 Company in the future to its executives and key management 
 employees, subject to and on a basis consistent with the 
 terms, conditions and overall administration of such plans 
 and arrangements. Nothing paid to the Executive under any 
 Benefit Plan presently in effect or made available in the 
 future shall be deemed to be in lieu of the salary payable 
 to the Executive pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section. 
 Any payments or benefits payable to the Executive hereunder 
 in respect of any calendar year during which the

 42 

 Executive is employed by the Company for less than the
 entire such year shall, unless otherwise provided in the
 applicable Benefit Plan be prorated in accordance with the
 number of days in such calendar year during which he is
 so employed.

 (d) Vacations. The Executive shall be entitled to no less than 
 the number of vacation days in each calendar year, and to 
 compensation in respect of earned but unused vacation days, 
 determined in accordance with the Company's vacation policy 
 as in effect on the date hereof.

 (e) Services Furnished. The Company shall furnish the 
 Executive with office space, stenographic assistance and 
 such other facilities and services as shall be suitable to 
 the Executive's position and adequate for the performance 
 of his duties as set forth in Section 3 hereof.

 6. Termination. Without prejudice to Section 2 hereof, the 
 Executive's employment hereunder may be terminated without any 
 breach of this Agreement only under the following circumstances:

 (a) Death. The Executive's employment hereunder shall 
 terminate upon his death.

 (b) Disability. If, (i) as a result of the Executive's 
 incapacity due to physical or mental illness, the Executive 
 shall have been absent from his duties with the Company on 
 a full-time basis for the entire period of six (6) 
 consecutive months, and within thirty (30) days after 
 written "Notice of Termination" (as defined in Section 12 
 below) is thereafter given by the Company (which may occur 
 before or after the end of such six month period) the 
 Executive shall not have returned to the performance of his 
 duties hereunder on a full-time basis, or (ii) the 
 Executive becomes eligible for benefits under the Company's 
 long-term disability plan or any successor plan, the 
 Company may terminate this Agreement and the Executive's 
 employment hereunder for "Disability."

 (c) Cause. The Company may, in writing and without prior 
 notice, terminate the Executive's employment hereunder for 
 Cause (except as otherwise provided in clause (iv) of 
 subsection 13(d) (iv)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 
 Executive shall have the right to contest his termination 
 for Cause (for purposes of this Agreement) by mediation in 
 accordance with the provisions of this Agreement as set 
 forth in Section 17 herein.

 (d) Termination by the Executive. The Executive may terminate 
 his employment hereunder for Good Reason. For purposes of 
 any determination regarding the existence of Good Reason, 
 any claim by the Executive that Good Reason exists shall be 
 presumed to be correct unless the Company establishes to 
 the then existing Compensation Committee of the Board that 
 Good Reason does not exist.

 7. Compensation During Disability or Upon Termination.

 (a) During any period that the Executive fails to perform his 
 duties hereunder as a result of incapacity due to physical 
 or mental illness ("Disability Period"), the Executive 
 shall continue to receive his full salary at the rate then 
 in effect for such period until his employment is 
 terminated pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof; provided that, 
 payments so made to the Executive during the Disability 
 Period shall be reduced by the sum of the amounts, if any, 
 payable to the Executive at or prior to the time of any 
 such payment under disability benefit plans of the Company 
 or under the Social Security disability insurance program, 
 and which amounts were not previously applied to reduce any 
 such payment.

 43

(b) If the Executive's employment is terminated by his death, 
 the Company shall pay any amounts due to the Executive 
 under Section 5 through the date of his death in accordance 
 with Section 11(b).

 (c) If the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company 
 for Cause or by the Executive for other than Good Reason, 
 the Company shall pay the Executive his full salary through 
 the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time 
 Notice of Termination is given and the Company shall have 
 no further obligations to the Executive under this 
 Agreement.

 (d) If (1) in breach of this Agreement, the Company shall 
 terminate the Executive's employment other than for 
 Disability pursuant to Section 6(b) or for Cause (it being 
 understood that a purported termination for Disability 
 pursuant to Section 6(b) or for Cause which is disputed and 
 finally determined not to have been proper shall be a 
 termination by the Company in breach of this Agreement) or 
 (2) the Executive shall terminate his employment for Good 
 Reason, then, subject to the provisions of Section 10 
 hereof, the Company shall:

 (i) pay the Executive his full annual base salary through 
 the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the 
 time Notice of Termination is given and all other 
 unpaid amounts, if any, to which the Executive is 
 entitled as of the Date of Termination under any 
 Benefit Plan at the time such payments are due; 

 (ii) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, in 
 lieu of any further salary payments to the Executive 
 for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination, 
 pay as liquidated damages to the Executive an amount 
 equal to two (2) times the Executive's Cash 
 Compensation, such payment to be made in a lump sum 
 in cash, on or before the fifth day following the 
 Date of Termination;

 (iii) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, 
 arrange to provide the Executive for two (2) years 
 (or such shorter period as Executive may elect), with 
 disability, life, accident and health insurance 
 substantially similar to those insurance benefits 
 which Executive is receiving immediately prior to the 
 Notice of Termination (including coverage for 
 dependents at the same per person cost as the 
 Executive is then paying); provided that, benefits 
 otherwise receivable by Executive pursuant to this 
 subsection 6 (d)(iii) shall be reduced to the extent 
 comparable benefits are actually received by the 
 Executive during such two (2) year period following 
 his termination (or such shorter period elected by 
 the Executive), and any such benefits actually 
 received by Executive shall be reported by him to the 
 Company;

 (iv) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, pay 
 the Executive a benefit under the Premier Plan (or 
 other long term incentive plan) as if he had 
 terminated employment by reason of his retirement 
 (without regard to whether the Executive has, and 
 without deeming the Executive to have, reached his 
 normal retirement age) and as if any remaining 
 performance criteria and any time period of service 
 requirement had been waived; and

 (v) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, pay to 
 the Executive a single lump sum payment equal to the 
 excess of (x) over (y), where (x) is equal to the 
 present lump sum value of the combined pension 
 benefits that the Executive would receive under the
 Employees' Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan"), taking
 into account Article XV thereof, the Employee
 Benefits Restoration Plan (the

44

 "Restoration Plan") and providing supplemental
 pension benefits (collectively, the "Plans"), at his
 earliest benefit commencement date under the Pension
 Plan computed by increasing, in the case of each
 Plan, the number of years of credited service
 actually taken into account under each Plan as of
 the date of his termination of employment, or,
 if earlier, the termination of the Pension Plan, by
 two (2) years, and (y) is equal to the present lump
 sum value of the combined pension benefits actually
 payable to the Executive on his earliest
 benefit commencement date under the Pension 
 Plan (taking into account Article XV thereof), the 
 Restoration Plan and the Agreement based, in the case 
 of each Plan, on the actual number of years of 
 credited service actually taken into account under 
 each Plan as of the date of his termination of 
 employment, or, if earlier, the termination of the
 Pension Plan. The foregoing lump sum present value 
 amount, shall be computed using the actuarial factors 
 under the Pension Plan in effect on the date of the 
 Executive's termination of employment or, if earlier, 
 the termination of the Pension Plan.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Executive does
 not have two (2) full years remaining until the Executive's
 mandatory-retirement date under the Company's retirement
 policies, for purposes of this Section 7, the minimum two (2)
 year period set forth above shall automatically be reduced to 
 the number of years and/or partial years (measured by months)
 remaining until such Executive's retirement. For example, if
 Executive terminated his employment for Good Reason six months
 before mandatory retirement, the minimum two (2) year period set
 forth above would be reduced from 2 to 1.5. For purposes of this
 Agreement, the mandatory retirement age of an Executive shall
 be 65.

 8. Indemnification for Excise Tax.

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, in 
 the event that any of the payments or benefits received or 
 to be received by the Executive in connection with a 
 "change in control" (as defined in Section 280G of the 
 Code) (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or 
 any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, 
 any Person whose actions result in a change in control or 
 any Person affiliated with the Company or such Person) 
 (such payments or benefits, excluding the Gross-Up Payment, 
 being hereinafter referred to as the "Total Payments") will 
 be subject to the Excise Tax, the Company shall pay to the 
 Executive an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") 
 such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after 
 deduction of any Excise Tax on the Total Payments and any 
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes and 
 Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment, shall be equal to the 
 Total Payments.

 (b) For purposes of determining whether any of the Total 
 Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount 
 of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be 
 treated as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of 
 section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of 
 tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably acceptable to the 
 Executive and selected by the accounting firm which was, 
 immediately prior to the change in control, the Company's 
 independent auditor (the "Auditor"), such payments or 
 benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute 
 payments, including by reason of section 280G(b)(4)(A) of 
 the Code, (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the 
 meaning of section 280G(b)(1) of the Code shall be treated 
 as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax 
 Counsel, such excess parachute payments (in whole or in 
 part) represent reasonable compensation for services 
 actually rendered (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)
 (B) of the Code) in excess of the Base Amount allocable to 
 such reasonable compensation, or are otherwise not subject 
 to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of any noncash 
 benefits or any deferred payment 

 45

or benefit shall be determined by the Auditor in accordance
 with the principles of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the
 Code. For purposes of determining the amount of the
 Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay
 federal income tax at the highest marginal rate of federal
 income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up
 Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at
 the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and
 locality of the Executive's residence on the Date of
 Termination (or if there is no Date of Termination, then
 the date on which the Gross-Up Payment is calculated
 for purposes of this Section 8), net of the maximum
 reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained
 from deduction of such state and local taxes.

 (c) In the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined to 
 be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in 
 calculating the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall repay 
 to the Company, within five (5) business days following the 
 time that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is 
 finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment 
 attributable to such reduction (plus that portion of the 
 Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and 
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes 
 imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the 
 Executive, to the extent that such repayment results in a 
 reduction in the Excise Tax and a dollar-for-dollar 
 reduction in the Executive's taxable income and wages for 
 purposes of federal, state and local income and employment 
 taxes, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at 
 120 of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the 
 Code. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to 
 exceed the amount taken into account hereunder in 
 calculating the Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of 
 any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be 
 determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the 
 Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in 
 respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or 
 additions payable by the Executive with respect to such 
 excess) within five (5) business days following the time 
 that the amount of such excess is finally determined. The 
 Executive and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate 
 with the other in connection with any administrative or 
 judicial proceedings concerning the existence or amount of 
 liability for Excise Tax with respect to the Total Payments.

 (d) Preparation of Tax Return. The Company, at its expense, 
 agrees to supply the Executive with advice from competent 
 tax counsel as to whether said Executive must reflect and 
 pay an excise tax under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code 
 on the filing of any federal income tax return of said 
 Executive relating to the period or periods in which said 
 Executive received payments or benefits under this 
 Agreement which may result in the imposition of such an 
 excise tax. If such tax counsel advises that such excise 
 tax must be reflected and paid on such tax return, said 
 Executive agrees to so reflect and pay such tax at which 
 time the Company will reimburse said Executive in 
 accordance with this Section 8. If such tax counsel 
 advises that such excise tax need not be reflected and paid 
 on such tax return, said Executive agrees to prepare and 
 file his tax return in accordance with such advice. In 
 either case the Company shall indemnify said Executive in 
 accordance with Section 8(a) of this Agreement for any 
 subsequent assessment of excise taxes made by the Internal 
 Revenue Service under Section 4999 of the Code in 
 accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.

 (e) Duty to Cooperate. The Executive agrees promptly to notify 
 the Company in the event of any audit by the Internal 
 Revenue Service ("IRS") in which the IRS asserts that any 
 excise tax should be assessed against said Executive and to 
 cooperate with the Company in contesting (at the Company's 
 expense) any such proposed assessment. Said Executive 
 agrees not to settle or compromise any such assessment 
 without the Company's consent. If said Executive's failure 
 to settle a proposed

 46

 assessment with respect to such excise tax ("Proposed
 Assessment") at the direction of the Company is the
 reason his overall audit cannot be finally resolved, then
 said Executive may demand that the Company consent to 
 settle the Proposed Assessment. If the Company does not 
 settle the Proposed Assessment, or consent to allow said 
 Executive to settle, within sixty (60) days, the Company 
 shall indemnify and hold harmless said Executive from any 
 additional interest or penalties resulting from the delay 
 in finally resolving the audit.

 9. Effect of Agreement on Other Contractual Rights. The provisions 
 of this Agreement, and any payment provided for hereunder, shall 
 not reduce any amounts otherwise payable, or in any way diminish 
 the Executive's existing rights, or rights which would accrue 
 solely as a result of the passage of time, under any Benefit Plan 
 or other contract, plan or arrangement.

 10. Restrictive Covenants.

 (a) During the term of this Agreement, Executive shall not, 
 directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent 
 of the Company, provide consultative service to (with or 
 without pay), own, manage, operate, join, control, 
 participate in, or be connected with (as a stockholder, 
 partner, officer, director, employee or otherwise) any 
 business, individual, partner, firm, corporation, or other 
 entity that directly or indirectly competes with the 
 Company (a "Competitor of the Company"); provided that, the 
 "beneficial ownership" by Executive, either individually or 
 as a member of a "group," as such terms are used in Rule 
 13d of the General Rules and Regulations Exchange Act, of 
 not more than five percent (5 of the voting stock of any 
 publicly held corporation shall not be a violation of this 
 Agreement.

 (b) Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that in 
 his employment hereunder he occupies a position of trust 
 and confidence. During the term of the Agreement and for 
 all periods thereafter, Executive shall not, except as may 
 be required to perform his duties hereunder or as required 
 by applicable law, and except for information which is or 
 becomes publicly available other than as a result of a 
 breach by the Executive of the provisions hereof, disclose 
 to others or use, whether directly or indirectly, any 
 Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that such 
 Confidential Information is specialized, unique in nature 
 and of great value to the Company, and that such 
 information gives the Company a competitive advantage. The 
 Executive agrees to deliver or return to the Company, at 
 the Company's request at any time or upon termination or 
 expiration of his employment or as soon thereafter as 
 possible, all documents, computer tapes and disks, records, 
 lists, data, drawings, prints, notes and written 
 information (and all copies thereof) furnished by the 
 Company or prepared by the Executive during the term of his 
 employment by the Company.

 (c) Business Diversion. During the term of this Agreement and 
 any Severance Period thereafter, Executive shall not, 
 directly or indirectly, influence or attempt to influence 
 customers or suppliers of the Company to divert their 
 business to any Competitor of the Company.

 (d) Nonsolicitation. Executive recognizes that he will possess 
 confidential information about other employees of the 
 Company, relating to, among other things, their education, 
 experience, skills, abilities, compensation and benefits, 
 and inter-personal relationships with suppliers and 
 customers of the Company. Executive recognizes that the 
 information he will possess about these other employees is
 not generally known, is of substantial value to the
 Company and will be acquired by him because of his business
 position with the Company. Executive agrees that, during
 the term of

47

 this Agreement and for one (1) year thereafter, he will
 not, directly or indirectly, solicit or recruit any
 employee of the Company for the purpose of being employed by
 him or by any other person on whose behalf he is acting as
 an agent, representative or employee and that he will not
 convey any such confidential information or trade secrets
 about other employees of the Company.

 11. Successors; Binding Agreement.

 (a) In connection with any agreement to which it is a party, the
 Company will require any successor (whether direct or
 indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise)
 to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of
 the Company, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory
 to the Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform
 this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent
 that the Company would be required to perform it if no such
 succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to
 obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the
 effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of
 this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to
 compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the
 same terms as he would be entitled to hereunder if he
 terminated his employment for Good Reason, except that for
 purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which
 any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the
 Date of Termination. As used in this Agreement, "Company"
 shall mean the Company as herein before defined and any
 successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which
 executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this
 Section 11 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms
 and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.

 (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
 enforceable by the Executive's personal and legal
 representatives, executors, administrators, successors,
 heirs, distributees, devises and legatees. If the
 Executive should die while any amounts are still payable to
 him hereunder, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided
 herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this
 Agreement to the Executive's devisee, legatee, or other
 designee or, if there be no such designee, to the
 Executive's estate.

 12. Notice/Notice of Termination. For purposes of this Agreement,
 notices and all other communications provided for in the Agreement
 shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given
 when delivered or mailed by United States registered mail, return
 receipt requested, postage prepaid, as follows: if to the

 Angeles, California 90010, Attention: Secretary; and if to the

 have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith,
 except that notices of change of address shall be effective only
 upon receipt. Any purported termination of the Executive's
 employment by the Company or the Executive hereunder shall be
 communicated by a Notice of Termination to the other party as set
 forth herein. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of
 Termination" shall mean a written notice which shall indicate
 those specific termination provisions in this Agreement relied
 upon and which sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and
 circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the
 Executive's employment under the provision of Sections 6(b),

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of October 15, 
1997, is made and entered into by and between Farmers Group, Inc., a Nevada 
corporation (the "Company") and Paul G. Secord (the "Executive").

 The Executive is presently employed by the Company.

 The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the 
Executive's contribution to the growth and success of the Company has been 
substantial. The Company, on behalf of itself and its stockholders, desires 
to continue to attract and retain well-qualified executive and key personnel 
who are an integral part of the management of the Company, such as the 
Executive, and to assure itself of continuity of management. The Executive is 
willing to commit himself to continue to serve the Company, on the terms and 
conditions herein provided.

 In order to effect the foregoing, the Company and the Executive wish to 
enter into an employment agreement on the terms and conditions set forth below.
Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the respective covenants 
and agreements of the parties herein contained, and intending to be legally 
bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 1. Employment. The Company hereby agrees to continue to employ the 
 Executive, and the Executive hereby agrees to continue to serve 
 the Company, on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 2. Term. This Agreement shall commence on the date set forth above 
 (the "Commencement Date") and shall expire on the last day of the 
 twenty-fourth (24th) month immediately following the Commencement 
 Date, unless further extended or sooner terminated as hereinafter
 provided. In no event, however, shall the term of the
 Executive's employment hereunder extend beyond the date of the
 Executive's actual retirement in accordance with the Company's
 retirement policies in effect on the date hereof. 

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if a Potential Change in
 Control shall have occurred during the Initial Term or any
 Extended Term, the term of this Agreement shall be extended and
 shall continue in effect through the last day of the twenty-fourth
 (24th) month immediately following the date on which such
 Potential Change in Control occurred and (b) if a Change in
 Control shall have occurred during the Initial Term or any
 Extended Term, the term of this Agreement shall be extended and
 shall continue in effect through the last day of the
 twenty-fourth (24th) month immediately following the date on which
 such Change in Control occurred; provided that, if such Potential
 Change in Control is abandoned prior to the occurrence of a Change
 in Control, this Agreement shall expire in accordance with the
 provisions hereof, without regard to such extension.

 3. Position and Duties. The Executive shall serve in his current
 position or any other position to which he may from time to time
 be assigned by the Board and shall have such responsibilities,
 duties and authority as may be appropriate for his then existing
 position whether or not consistent with his current
 responsibilities, duties and authority. The Executive shall
 devote substantially all his working time and efforts to the
 business and affairs of the Company.

54

 4. Place of Performance. In connection with the Executive's employment
 by the Company, the Executive shall be based in his current location
 or such other location to which he may be assigned by the Board
 from time to time.

 5. Compensation and Related Matters.

 (a) Compensation. During the period of the Executive's 
 employment hereunder, the Company shall pay to the 
 Executive an annual amount equal to the Executive's Cash 
 Compensation at a rate not less than the rate in effect as 
 of the date hereof or such higher rate as may from time to 
 time be determined by the Board, such compensation to be 
 paid in such installments as are customary from time to 
 time for executive officers of the Company. This 
 compensation may be increased from time to time in 
 accordance with normal business practices of the Company 
 and, if so increased, shall not thereafter during the term 
 of this Agreement be decreased. Such compensation shall 
 not be deemed exclusive and shall not prevent the Executive 
 from participating in any other compensation or benefit 
 plan of the Company. The Cash Compensation payments 
 (including any increased salary payments) hereunder shall 
 not in any way limit or reduce any other obligation of the 
 Company hereunder, and no other compensation, benefit or 
 payment hereunder shall in any way limit or reduce the 
 obligation of the Company to pay the Executive's Cash 
 Compensation hereunder.

 (b) Expenses. During the term of the Executive's employment 
 hereunder, the Executive shall be entitled to receive 
 prompt reimbursement for all reasonable and customary 
 expenses incurred by the Executive in performing services 
 hereunder, including all expenses of travel and living 
 expenses while away from home on business or at the request 
 of and in the service of the Company; provided that, such 
 expenses are incurred and accounted for in accordance with 
 the policies and procedures established by the Company.

 (c) Other Benefits. The Executive shall be entitled to 
 continue to participate in all Company and Parent 
 compensation, incentive, welfare or benefit plans or 
 arrangements, as well as any plan or arrangement whereby 
 the Executive may acquire securities of the Company or 
 Parent in effect on the date hereof in which the Executive 
 is participating, or subsequent plans or arrangements 
 providing the Executive with substantially similar benefits 
 thereunder, including without limitation the Company's 
 Employees' Profit Sharing and Savings Plan, Employees' 
 Pension Plan, Farmers Stock Incentive Plan, Employees' 
 Stock Ownership Plan, the Farmers Executive Incentive 
 Program (the "EIP"), the Premier Award Unit Plan (the 
 "Premier Plan") and any other plan or arrangement to

 rights, supplemental pension plan, insured medical 
 reimbursement plan, automobile benefits, executive 
 financial planning, group life insurance plan, personal 
 catastrophe liability insurance, medical, dental, accident 
 and disability plans (each a "Benefit Plan"). The 
 Executive shall be entitled to participate in or receive 
 benefits under any Benefit Plan made available by the 
 Company in the future to its executives and key management 
 employees, subject to and on a basis consistent with the 
 terms, conditions and overall administration of such plans 
 and arrangements. Nothing paid to the Executive under any 
 Benefit Plan presently in effect or made available in the 
 future shall be deemed to be in lieu of the salary payable 
 to the Executive pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section. 
 Any payments or benefits payable to the Executive hereunder 
 in respect of any calendar year during which the Executive 
 is employed by the Company for less than the entire such 
 year shall, unless otherwise provided in the applicable 
 Benefit Plan be prorated in accordance with the number of 
 days in such calendar year during which he is so employed.

55

(d) Vacations. The Executive shall be entitled to no less than 
 the number of vacation days in each calendar year, and to 
 compensation in respect of earned but unused vacation days, 
 determined in accordance with the Company's vacation policy 
 as in effect on the date hereof.

 (e) Services Furnished. The Company shall furnish the 
 Executive with office space, stenographic assistance and 
 such other facilities and services as shall be suitable to 
 the Executive's position and adequate for the performance 
 of his then existing duties in accordance with the terms of
 Section 3 hereof.

 6. Termination. Without prejudice to Section 2 hereof, the 
 Executive's employment hereunder may be terminated without any 
 breach of this Agreement only under the following circumstances:

 (a) Death. The Executive's employment hereunder shall 
 terminate upon his death.

 (b) Disability. If, (i) as a result of the Executive's 
 incapacity due to physical or mental illness, the Executive 
 shall have been absent from his duties with the Company on 
 a full-time basis for the entire period of six (6) 
 consecutive months, and within thirty (30) days after 
 written "Notice of Termination" (as defined in Section 12 
 below) is thereafter given by the Company (which may occur 
 before or after the end of such six month period) the 
 Executive shall not have returned to the performance of his 
 duties hereunder on a full-time basis, or (ii) the 
 Executive becomes eligible for benefits under the Company's 
 long-term disability plan or any successor plan, the 
 Company may terminate this Agreement and the Executive's 
 employment hereunder for "Disability."

 (c) Cause. The Company may, in writing and without prior 
 notice, terminate the Executive's employment hereunder for 
 Cause (except as otherwise provided in clause (iv) of 
 subsection 13(c)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 
 Executive shall have the right to contest his termination 
 for Cause (for purposes of this Agreement) by mediation in 
 accordance with the provisions of this Agreement as set 
 forth in Section 17 herein.

 (d) Termination by the Executive. The Executive may terminate 
 his employment hereunder for Good Reason. For purposes of 
 any determination regarding the existence of Good Reason, 
 any claim by the Executive that Good Reason exists shall be 
 presumed to be correct unless the Company establishes to 
 the then existing Compensation Committee of the Board that 
 Good Reason does not exist.

 7. Compensation During Disability or Upon Termination.

 (a) During any period that the Executive fails to perform his 
 duties hereunder as a result of incapacity due to physical 
 or mental illness ("Disability Period"), the Executive 
 shall continue to receive his full salary at the rate then 
 in effect for such period until his employment is 
 terminated pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof; provided that, 
 payments so made to the Executive during the Disability 
 Period shall be reduced by the sum of the amounts, if any, 
 payable to the Executive at or prior to the time of any 
 such payment under disability benefit plans of the Company 
 or under the Social Security disability insurance program, 
 and which amounts were not previously applied to reduce any 
 such payment.

 (b) If the Executive's employment is terminated by his death, 
 the Company shall pay any amounts due to the Executive 
 under Section 5 through the date of his death in accordance 
 with Section 11(b).

 56

(c) If the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company 
 for Cause or by the Executive for other than Good Reason, 
 the Company shall pay the Executive his full salary through 
 the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time 
 Notice of Termination is given and the Company shall have 
 no further obligations to the Executive under this 
 Agreement.

 (d) If (1) in breach of this Agreement, the Company shall 
 terminate the Executive's employment other than for 
 Disability pursuant to Section 6(b) or for Cause (it being 
 understood that a purported termination for Disability 
 pursuant to Section 6(b) or for Cause which is disputed and 
 finally determined not to have been proper shall be a 
 termination by the Company in breach of this Agreement) or 
 (2) the Executive shall terminate his employment for Good 
 Reason, then, subject to the provisions of Section 10 
 hereof, the Company shall:

 (i) pay the Executive his full annual base salary through 
 the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the 
 time Notice of Termination is given and all other 
 unpaid amounts, if any, to which the Executive is 
 entitled as of the Date of Termination under any 
 Benefit Plan at the time such payments are due; 

 (ii) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, in
 lieu of any further salary payments to the Executive
 for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination,
 pay as liquidated damages to the Executive an amount
 equal to the Executive's Cash Compensation (as
 defined below), times a fraction the numerator of
 which is the number of months remaining in the then
 current term of the Agreement, and the denominator of
 which is twelve (12), such payment to be made in a
 lump sum in cash, on or before the fifth day
 following the Date of Termination;

 (iii) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, 
 arrange to provide the Executive for one (1) year 
 (or such shorter period as Executive may elect), with 
 disability, life, accident and health insurance 
 substantially similar to those insurance benefits 
 which Executive is receiving immediately prior to the 
 Notice of Termination (including coverage for 
 dependents at the same per person cost as the 
 Executive is then paying); provided that, benefits 
 otherwise receivable by Executive pursuant to this 
 subsection 6 (d)(iii) shall be reduced to the extent 
 comparable benefits are actually received by the 
 Executive during such one (1) year period following 
 his termination (or such shorter period elected by 
 the Executive), and any such benefits actually 
 received by Executive shall be reported by him to the 
 Company;

 (iv) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, pay 
 the Executive a benefit under the Premier Plan (or 
 other long term incentive plan) as if he had 
 terminated employment by reason of his retirement 
 (without regard to whether the Executive has, and 
 without deeming the Executive to have, reached his 
 normal retirement age) and as if any remaining 
 performance criteria and any time period of service 
 requirement had been waived; and

 (v) subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, pay to 
 the Executive a single lump sum payment equal to the 
 excess of (x) over (y), where (x) is equal to the 
 present lump sum value of the combined pension 
 benefits that the Executive would receive under
 the Employees' Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan"),
 taking into account Article XV thereof, the Employee
 Benefits Restoration Plan (the "Restoration Plan")
 and providing supplemental pension benefits 
 (collectively, the "Plans"), at his earliest benefit 
 commencement date under the Pension Plan 

57 

 computed by increasing, in the case of each Plan,
 the number of years of credited service actually
 taken into account under each Plan as of the date of
 his termination of employment, or, if earlier, the
 termination of the Pension Plan, by two (2) years,
 and (y) is equal to the present lump sum value of
 the combined pension benefits actually payable to
 the Executive on his earliest benefit commencement
 date under the Pension Plan (taking into account
 Article XV thereof), the Restoration Plan and the
 Agreement based, in the case of each Plan, on the
 actual number of years of credited service actually
 taken into account under each Plan as of the date of
 his termination of employment, or, if earlier, the
 termination of the Pension Plan. The foregoing lump
 sum present value amount, shall be computed using the
 actuarial factors under the Pension Plan in effect on
 the date of the Executive's termination of employment
 or, if earlier, the termination of the Pension Plan.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Executive does
 not have two (2) full years remaining until the Executive's
 mandatory-retirement date under the Company's retirement
 policies, for purposes of this Section 7, the minimum two (2)
 year period set forth above shall automatically be reduced to 
 the number of years and/or partial years (measured by months)
 remaining until such Executive's retirement. For example, if
 Executive terminated his employment for Good Reason six months
 before mandatory retirement, the minimum two (2) year period set
 forth above would be reduced from 2 to 1.5. For purposes of this
 Agreement, the mandatory retirement age of an Executive shall
 be 65.

 8. Indemnification for Excise Tax.

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, in 
 the event that any of the payments or benefits received or 
 to be received by the Executive in connection with a 
 "change in control" (as defined in Section 280G of the 
 Code) (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or 
 any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, 
 any Person whose actions result in a change in control or 
 any Person affiliated with the Company or such Person) 
 (such payments or benefits, excluding the Gross-Up Payment, 
 being hereinafter referred to as the "Total Payments") will 
 be subject to the Excise Tax, the Company shall pay to the 
 Executive an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") 
 such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after 
 deduction of any Excise Tax on the Total Payments and any 
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes and 
 Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment, shall be equal to the 
 Total Payments.

 (b) For purposes of determining whether any of the Total 
 Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount 
 of such Excise Tax, (i) all of the Total Payments shall be 
 treated as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of 
 section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of 
 tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably acceptable to the 
 Executive and selected by the accounting firm which was, 
 immediately prior to the change in control, the Company's 
 independent auditor (the "Auditor"), such payments or 
 benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute 
 payments, including by reason of section 280G(b)(4)(A) of 
 the Code, (ii) all "excess parachute payments" within the 
 meaning of section 280G(b)(1) of the Code shall be treated 
 as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of Tax 
 Counsel, such excess parachute payments (in whole or in 
 part) represent reasonable compensation for services 
 actually rendered (within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)
 (B) of the Code) in excess of the Base Amount allocable to 
 such reasonable compensation, or are otherwise not subject 
 to the Excise Tax, and (iii) the value of any noncash 
 benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be 
 determined by the Auditor in accordance with the principles 
 of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes 
 of determining the amount of

 58

 the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay
 federal income tax at the highest marginal rate of federal
 income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up
 Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at
 the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and
 locality of the Executive's residence on the Date of
 Termination (or if there is no Date of Termination, then
 the date on which the Gross-Up Payment is calculated for
 purposes of this Section 8), net of the maximum reduction
 in federal income taxes which could be obtained from
 deduction of such state and local taxes.

 (c) In the event that the Excise Tax is finally determined to 
 be less than the amount taken into account hereunder in 
 calculating the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall repay 
 to the Company, within five (5) business days following the 
 time that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax is 
 finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment 
 attributable to such reduction (plus that portion of the 
 Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and 
 federal, state and local income and employment taxes 
 imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the 
 Executive, to the extent that such repayment results in a 
 reduction in the Excise Tax and a dollar-for-dollar 
 reduction in the Executive's taxable income and wages for 
 purposes of federal, state and local income and employment 
 taxes, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at 
 120 of the rate provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the 
 Code. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to 
 exceed the amount taken into account hereunder in 
 calculating the Gross-Up Payment (including by reason of 
 any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be 
 determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the 
 Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in 
 respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or 
 additions payable by the Executive with respect to such 
 excess) within five (5) business days following the time 
 that the amount of such excess is finally determined. The 
 Executive and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate 
 with the other in connection with any administrative or 
 judicial proceedings concerning the existence or amount of 
 liability for Excise Tax with respect to the Total Payments.

 (d) Preparation of Tax Return. The Company, at its expense, 
 agrees to supply the Executive with advice from competent 
 tax counsel as to whether said Executive must reflect and 
 pay an excise tax under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code 
 on the filing of any federal income tax return of said 
 Executive relating to the period or periods in which said 
 Executive received payments or benefits under this 
 Agreement which may result in the imposition of such an 
 excise tax. If such tax counsel advises that such excise 
 tax must be reflected and paid on such tax return, said 
 Executive agrees to so reflect and pay such tax at which 
 time the Company will reimburse said Executive in 
 accordance with this Section 8. If such tax counsel 
 advises that such excise tax need not be reflected and paid 
 on such tax return, said Executive agrees to prepare and 
 file his tax return in accordance with such advice. In 
 either case the Company shall indemnify said Executive in 
 accordance with Section 8(a) of this Agreement for any 
 subsequent assessment of excise taxes made by the Internal 
 Revenue Service under Section 4999 of the Code in 
 accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.

 (e) Duty to Cooperate. The Executive agrees promptly to notify 
 the Company in the event of any audit by the Internal 
 Revenue Service ("IRS") in which the IRS asserts that any 
 excise tax should be assessed against said Executive and to 
 cooperate with the Company in contesting (at the Company's 
 expense) any such proposed assessment. Said Executive 
 agrees not to settle or compromise any such assessment 
 without the Company's consent. If said Executive's failure 
 to settle a proposed assessment with respect to such excise 
 tax ("Proposed Assessment") at the direction of the Company 
 is the reason his overall audit cannot be finally resolved, 
 then said

59

 Executive may demand that the Company consent to settle
 the Proposed Assessment. If the Company does not settle
 the Proposed Assessment, or consent to allow said 
 Executive to settle, within sixty (60) days, the Company 
 shall indemnify and hold harmless said Executive from any 
 additional interest or penalties resulting from the delay 
 in finally resolving the audit.

 9. Effect of Agreement on Other Contractual Rights. The provisions 
 of this Agreement, and any payment provided for hereunder, shall 
 not reduce any amounts otherwise payable, or in any way diminish 
 the Executive's existing rights, or rights which would accrue 
 solely as a result of the passage of time, under any Benefit Plan. 

 10. Restrictive Covenants.

 (a) During the term of this Agreement, Executive shall not, 
 directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent 
 of the Company, provide consultative service to (with or 
 without pay), own, manage, operate, join, control, 
 participate in, or be connected with (as a stockholder, 
 partner, officer, director, employee or otherwise) any 
 business, individual, partner, firm, corporation, or other 
 entity that directly or indirectly competes with the 
 Company (a "Competitor of the Company"); provided that, the 
 "beneficial ownership" by Executive, either individually or 
 as a member of a "group," as such terms are used in Rule 
 13d of the General Rules and Regulations Exchange Act, of 
 not more than five percent (5 of the voting stock of any 
 publicly held corporation shall not be a violation of this 
 Agreement.

 (b) Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that in 
 his employment hereunder he occupies a position of trust 
 and confidence. During the term of the Agreement and for 
 all periods thereafter, Executive shall not, except as may 
 be required to perform his duties hereunder or as required 
 by applicable law, and except for information which is or 
 becomes publicly available other than as a result of a 
 breach by the Executive of the provisions hereof, disclose 
 to others or use, whether directly or indirectly, any 
 Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that such 
 Confidential Information is specialized, unique in nature 
 and of great value to the Company, and that such 
 information gives the Company a competitive advantage. The 
 Executive agrees to deliver or return to the Company, at 
 the Company's request at any time or upon termination or 
 expiration of his employment or as soon thereafter as 
 possible, all documents, computer tapes and disks, records, 
 lists, data, drawings, prints, notes and written 
 information (and all copies thereof) furnished by the 
 Company or prepared by the Executive during the term of his 
 employment by the Company.

 (c) Business Diversion. During the term of this Agreement and 
 any Severance Period thereafter, Executive shall not, 
 directly or indirectly, influence or attempt to influence 
 customers or suppliers of the Company to divert their 
 business to any Competitor of the Company.

 (d) Nonsolicitation. Executive recognizes that he will possess 
 confidential information about other employees of the 
 Company, relating to, among other things, their education, 
 experience, skills, abilities, compensation and benefits, 
 and inter-personal relationships with suppliers and 
 customers of the Company. Executive recognizes that the 
 information he will possess about these other employees is
 not generally known, is of substantial value to the
 Company and will be acquired by him because of his business
 position with the Company. Executive agrees that, during
 the term of this Agreement and for one (1) year thereafter,
 he will not, directly or indirectly, solicit or recruit any
 employee of the Company for the purpose of being employed by
 him or

60

 by any other person on whose behalf he is acting as
 an agent, representative or employee and that he will not
 convey any such confidential information or trade secrets
 about other employees of the Company.

 11. Successors; Binding Agreement.

 (a) In connection with any agreement to which it is a party, the
 Company will require any successor (whether direct or
 indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise)
 to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of
 the Company, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory
 to the Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform
 this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent
 that the Company would be required to perform it if no such
 succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to
 obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the
 effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of
 this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to
 compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the
 same terms as he would be entitled to hereunder if he
 terminated his employment for Good Reason, except that for
 purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which
 any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the
 Date of Termination. As used in this Agreement, "Company"
 shall mean the Company as herein before defined and any
 successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which
 executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this
 Section 11 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms
 and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.

 (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
 enforceable by the Executive's personal and legal
 representatives, executors, administrators, successors,
 heirs, distributees, devises and legatees. If the
 Executive should die while any amounts are still payable to
 him hereunder, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided
 herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this
 Agreement to the Executive's devisee, legatee, or other
 designee or, if there be no such designee, to the
 Executive's estate.

 12. Notice/Notice of Termination. For purposes of this Agreement,
 notices and all other communications provided for in the Agreement
 shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given
 when delivered or mailed by United States registered mail, return
 receipt requested, postage prepaid, as follows: if to the
 Company - Farmers Group, Inc., 4680 Wilshire Boulevard, Los
 Angeles, California 90010, Attention: Secretary; and if to the
 Executive at the address specified at the end of this Agreement.
 Notice may also be given at such other address as either party may
 have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith,
 except that notices of change of address shall be effective only
 upon receipt. Any purported termination of the Executive's
 employment by the Company or the Executive hereunder shall be
 communicated by a Notice of Termination to the other party as set
 forth herein. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of
 Termination" shall mean a written notice which shall indicate
 those specific termination provisions in this Agreement relied
 upon and which sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and
 circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the
 Executive's employment under the provision of Sections 6(b), (c)
 and (d) hereof.

 waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other
 party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of
 this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a
 waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same
 or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or
 representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect
 to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which

 65

 mediator. In connection with the mediation, each party shall bear
 his or its own attorneys' fees and costs and the mediator's fee

 a restraining order or injunction in any court of competent
 jurisdiction to prevent any continuation of any violation of the
 provisions of Section 10 of the Agreement and the Executive hereby
 consents that such restraining order or injunction may be granted
 without the necessity of the Company's posting any bond and,
 provided further that, the Executive shall be entitled to seek
 specific performance of his right to be paid until the Date of
 Termination during the pendency of any dispute or controversy
 arising under or in connection with this Agreement.

 18. Controlling Law. This Agreement and the rights of the parties
 hereunder shall be governed by and construed and enforced in

 including all matters of construction, validity, performance and
 enforcement.

 19. Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of
 the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein
 and supersedes all prior agreements, promises, covenants,
 arrangements, communications, representations or warranties, whether
 oral or written, by any officer, employee or representative of any
 party hereto; and any prior agreement of the parties hereto in
 respect of the subject matter contained herein is hereby terminated
 and cancelled.
