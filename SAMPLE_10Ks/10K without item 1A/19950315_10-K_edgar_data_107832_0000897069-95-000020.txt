PART I
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

 THE COMPANY

 On March 1, 1988, after obtaining shareowner and all the
 necessary regulatory approvals, Wisconsin Power and Light Company (the
 "Company" or "WPL") effected a corporate restructuring which included the
 formation of a holding company, WPL Holdings, Inc. WPL Holdings, Inc. is
 the parent company of WPL and its utility subsidiaries and of Heartland
 Development Corporation, the parent corporation for nonregulated
 businesses.

 WPL, incorporated in Wisconsin on February 21, 1917 as the
 Eastern Wisconsin Electric Company, is a public utility predominately
 engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric energy and the
 generation and bulk purchase of electric energy for sale. It also
 transports, distributes and sells natural gas purchased from gas
 suppliers. Nearly all of WPL's customers are located in south and central
 Wisconsin. WPL operates in municipalities pursuant to permits of
 indefinite duration which are regulated by Wisconsin law. WPL does not
 derive a material portion of its revenues from any one customer.

 WPL owns all of the outstanding capital stock of South Beloit
 Water, Gas and Electric Company ("South Beloit"), a public utility
 supplying electric, gas and water service, principally in Winnebago
 County, Illinois, which was incorporated on July 23, 1908.

 WPL also owns varying interests in several other subsidiaries
 and investments which are not material to WPL's operations.

 Regulation

 WPL is subject to regulation by the Public Service Commission of
 Wisconsin ("PSCW") as to retail utility rates and service, accounts,
 issuance and use of proceeds of securities, certain additions and
 extensions to facilities, and in other respects. South Beloit is subject
 to regulation by the Illinois Commerce Commission ("ICC") for similar
 items. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") has jurisdiction
 under the Federal Power Act over certain of the electric utility
 facilities and operations, wholesale rates and accounting practices of WPL
 and in certain other respects. Certain of WPL's natural gas facilities
 and operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the
 Natural Gas Act. The Company is presently exempt from all provisions of
 the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, except provisions relating
 to the acquisition of securities of other public utility companies.

 The PSCW has recently opened a formal docket initiating and
 inquiry into the future structure of the electric utility industry in
 Wisconsin. The goals of Wisconsin utility regulation and the principles
 to be used in choosing among alternative proposals have been identified. 
 WPL has submitted its preferred structure which, in summary form, calls
 for open access to transmission and distribution systems and a competitive
 power generation market place. It is not possible at this time to predict
 the outcome of these proceedings.

 With respect to environmental matters, the United States
 Environmental Protection Agency administers certain federal statutes with
 administrative responsibility with respect to others being delegated to the
 Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ("DNR"). In addition, the DNR
 has jurisdiction over air and water quality standards associated with
 fossil fuel fired electric generation and the level and flow of water,
 safety and other matters pertaining to hydroelectric generation.

 WPL is subject to the jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory
 Commission ("NRC") with respect to the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant
 ("Kewaunee") and to the jurisdiction of the United States Department of
 Energy ("DOE") with respect to the disposal of nuclear fuel and other
 radioactive wastes from Kewaunee.

 Employees

 At year-end 1994, WPL employed 2,391 persons, of whom 1,924 were
 considered electric utility employees, 334 were considered gas utility
 employees and 133 were considered other utility employees. WPL has a
 three-year contract with members of the International Brotherhood of
 Electrical Workers, Local 965, that is in effect until June 1, 1996. The
 contract covers 1,647 of WPL's employees.

 ELECTRIC OPERATIONS:

 General

 WPL provides electricity in a service territory of approximately
 16,000 square miles in 35 counties in southern and central Wisconsin and
 four counties in northern Illinois. As of December 31, 1994, WPL provided
 retail electric service to approximately 371,000 customers in 663 cities,
 villages and towns, and wholesale service to 27 municipal utilities, one
 privately owned utility, three rural electric cooperatives and to the
 Wisconsin Public Power, Inc. system, which provides retail service to nine
 communities.

 WPL owns 20,969 miles of electric transmission and distribution
 lines and 362 substations located adjacent to the communities served.

 WPL's electric sales are seasonal to some extent with the yearly
 peak normally occurring in the summer months. WPL also experiences a
 smaller winter peak in December or January.

 Fuel

 In 1994, approximately 80 percent of WPL's net kilowatthour
 generation of electricity was fueled by coal and 17 percent by nuclear
 fuel (provided by WPL's 41 percent ownership interest in Kewaunee). The
 remaining electricity generated was produced by hydroelectric, oil-fired
 and natural gas generation.

 Coal

 WPL anticipates that its average fuel costs will likely increase
 in the future, due to cost escalation provisions in existing coal and
 transportation contracts.

 The estimated coal requirements of WPL's generating units
 (including jointly-owned facilities) for the years 1995 through 2014 total
 about 167 million tons. Present coal supply contracts and transportation
 contracts (excluding extension options) cover approximately 14 percent and
 21 percent, respectively, of this estimated requirement. WPL will seek
 renewals of existing contracts or additional sources of supply and
 negotiate new or additional transportation contracts to satisfy these
 requirements and to comply with environmental regulations.

 Nuclear

 Kewaunee is jointly-owned by WPL (41 ), Wisconsin Public Service
 Corporation (41.2 and Madison Gas & Electric Company (17.8 ). Wisconsin
 Public Service Corporation (WPSC) is the operating partner. The plant
 began commercial operation in 1974.

 WPSC, the plant operator, is a member of the INPO, an
 organization of nuclear utilities which promotes excellence in all aspects
 of nuclear plant operations. INPO manages the accreditation process for
 industry training programs, which includes periodic accreditation of those
 training programs by an independent organization, the NNAB. All ten
 accredited training programs at Kewaunee are currently in good standing
 with the NNAB.

 The supply of nuclear fuel for the Kewaunee plant involves the
 mining and milling of uranium ore to uranium concentrates, the conversion
 of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, enrichment of the uranium
 hexafluoride and fabrication of the enriched uranium into usable fuel
 assemblies. After a region (approximately one-third of the nuclear fuel
 assemblies in the reactor) of spent fuel is removed from the reactor, it
 is placed in temporary storage for cooling in a spent fuel pool at the
 plant site. Permanent storage is addressed below. Presently, there are
 no operating facilities in the United States reprocessing commercial
 nuclear fuel. A discussion of the nuclear fuel supply for Kewaunee, which
 requires approximately 250,000 pounds of uranium concentrates per year
 follows:

 (a) Requirements for uranium are met through spot market
 purchases of uranium. In general, a four-year supply of
 uranium is maintained.

 (b) Uranium hexafluoride, from inventory and from spot market
 purchases, was used to satisfy converted material
 requirements in 1994. Conversion services relating to
 uranium hexafluoride will be purchased on the spot market
 in the future.

 (c) In 1994, enriched uranium was procured from COGEMA, Inc.
 pursuant to a contract last amended in 1993. Enrichment
 services were purchased from the DOE, under the terms of
 the utility services contract. This contract is in effect
 for the life of Kewaunee. The partnership is committed to
 take 70 percent of its annual requirements in 1995, and in
 alternate years thereafter, from the DOE.

 (d) Fuel fabrication requirements through June 15, 1995 are
 covered by contract. This contract contains an option to
 allow extension of the contract through 1998. WPSC is
 negotiating a contract for fuel fabrication extending
 through 2001.

 (e) Beyond the stated periods for Kewaunee, additional
 contracts for uranium concentrates, conversion to uranium
 hexafluoride, fabrication and spent fuel storage will have
 to be procured. The prices for the foregoing are expected
 to increase.

 The National Energy Policy Act of 1992 provides that both the
 Federal government and the nuclear utilities fund the decontamination and
 decommissioning of the three federal gaseous diffusion plants in the
 United States. This will require the owners of Kewaunee to pay
 approximately 15 million in current dollars over a period of 15 years. 
 WPL's share amounts to an annual payment of approximately 410,000.

 The steam generator tubes at the Kewaunee plant are susceptible
 to corrosion characteristics, a condition that has been experienced
 throughout the nuclear industry. Annual inspections are performed to
 identify degraded tubes. Degraded tubes are either repaired by sleeving
 or are removed from service plugging. The steam generators were designed
 with approximately 15 percent heat transfer margin, meaning that full
 power should be sustainable with the equivalent of 15 percent of the steam
 generator tubes plugged. Tube plugging and the build-up of deposits on
 the tubes affect the heat-transfer capability of the steam generators to
 the point where eventually full power operation is not possible and there
 is a gradual decrease in the capacity of the plant. As a result of this
 process, Kewaunee's capacity could be reduced by as much as 20 by the
 year 2013 when the current operating license expires. Currently, the
 equivalent of approximately 12 percent of the tubes in the steam generator
 are plugged. WPL and the joint-owners recently completed studies
 evaluating the economics of replacing the two steam generators at
 Kewaunee. The studies resulted in the conclusion that the most prudent
 course of action is to continue operation of the existing steam
 generators. WPL and the other joint-owners continue to evaluate
 appropriate strategies, including replacement, as well as continued
 operation of the steam generator without replacement. WPL and the joint-
 owners also continue to fund the development of welded repair technology
 for steam generator tubes. The plant is expected to be operated until at
 least 2013. WPL and the joint-owners are also continuing to evaluate and
 implement initiatives to improve the performance of Kewaunee which already
 performs at above average levels for the industry. These initiatives
 include conversion from a 12-month to an 18-month fuel cycle and numerous
 other cost reduction measures. These initiatives have resulted in
 reductions in Kewaunee operating and maintenance costs since 1991.

 Physical decommissioning is expected to occur during the period
 2014 to 2021 with additional expenditures being incurred during the period
 2022 to 2050 related to the storage of spent nuclear fuel at the site. 
 Wisconsin utilities operating nuclear generating plants are required by
 the PSCW to establish external trust funds to provide for the
 decommissioning of such plants. The market value of the investments in
 the funds established by WPL at December 31, 1994 totaled 51.8 million. 
 Additionally, in July 1994, the PSCW issued a generic order covering
 utilities that have nuclear generation. This order standardizes the
 escalation assumptions to be used in determining nuclear decommissioning
 liabilities.

 WPL's share of the decommissioning costs is estimated to be 159
 million (in 1994 dollars, assuming the plant is operating through 2013)
 based on a 1992 study, using the immediate dismantlement method of
 decommissioning. The undiscounted amount of decommissioning costs
 estimated to be expended between the years 2014 and 2050 is 1,016
 million. After-tax earnings on the tax-qualified and nontax-qualified
 decommissioning funds are assumed to be 6.1 and 5.1 , respectively. The
 future escalation rate is assumed to be 6.5 .

 Pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE has
 entered into a contract with WPL to accept, transport and dispose of spent
 nuclear fuel beginning no later than January 31, 1998. It is likely that
 the DOE will delay the acceptance of spent nuclear fuel beyond 1998. A
 fee to offset the costs of the DOE's disposal for all spent fuel used
 since April 7, 1983 has been assessed by the DOE at one mill per net
 kilowatthour of electricity generated and sold by the Kewaunee nuclear
 power plant. An additional one-time fee was paid for the disposal of
 spent nuclear fuel used to generate electricity prior to April 7, 1983.

 Spent fuel is currently stored at Kewaunee. The existing
 capacity of the spent fuel storage facility will enable storage of the
 projected quantities of spent fuel through April 2001. WPL is currently
 evaluating options for the storage of additional quantities beyond 2001. 
 Several technologies are available. An investment of approximately 2.5
 million in the early 2000's could provide additional storage sufficient to
 meet spent fuel storage needs until the expiration of the current
 operating license.

 The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 as amended in
 1985 provides that states may enter into compacts to provide for regional
 low-level waste disposal facilities. Wisconsin is a member of the Midwest
 Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact. The state of Ohio has
 been selected as the host state for the Midwest Compact and is proceeding
 with the preliminary phases of site selection. In June of 1994, the
 Branwell, South Carolina disposal facility, which had been accepting
 Kewaunee low level radioactive waste materials, discontinued taking waste
 materials from outside its region. WPL expects to have sufficient storage
 space of its own to satisfy low level radioactive waste disposal needs
 until the Ohio facility accepts low level radioactive waste materials.

 Recovery of Electric Fuel Costs

 In 1994 WPL did not automatically pass changes in electric fuel
 costs through to its Wisconsin retail electric customers. Instead, rates
 were based on estimated per unit fuel costs established during rate
 proceedings and were not subject to change by fuel cost fluctuations
 unless actual costs were outside specified limits. If actual fuel costs
 had varied from the estimated costs by more than +10 percent in a month or
 by more than +3 percent for the test year to date, rates could have been
 adjusted based on the results of a special fuel cost hearing. During
 1994, fuel costs remained within the aforementioned parameters. See Note
 1F in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of Item
 8 hereto.

 WPL's wholesale rates and South Beloit's retail rates contain
 fuel adjustment clauses pursuant to which rates are adjusted monthly to
 reflect changes in the costs of fuel.

GAS OPERATIONS:

 General

 As of December 31, 1994, WPL provided retail natural gas service
 to approximately 141,000 customers in 239 cities, villages and towns in
 22 counties in southern and central Wisconsin and one county in northern
 Illinois.

 WPL's gas sales follow a seasonal pattern. There is an annual
 base load of gas used for heating, cooking, water heating and other
 purposes, with a large peak occurring during the heating season.

 In 1994, WPL continued to purchase significant volumes of lower
 cost gas directly from producers and marketers and transported those
 volumes over its two major pipeline supplier's systems. This replaced
 higher cost gas historically purchased directly from the major pipeline
 systems.

 Gas Supplies

 During 1993, both of the interstate pipelines which serve WPL,
 ANR Pipeline and Northern Natural Pipeline, completed their transition to
 providing unbundled services as mandated by the FERC in its Order 636. As
 a result, WPL now contracts with these two parties for various unbundled
 services such as firm and interruptible transportation, firm and
 interruptible storage service and "no-notice" service. WPL and its gas
 customers have benefited from enhanced access to competitively priced gas
 supplies, and from more flexible transportation services. As part of this
 restructuring, pipelines have sought and received authorization to recover
 from their customers certain transition costs associated with
 restructuring. WPL is passing these costs along to its retail gas
 customers pursuant to provisions of its retail gas tariffs.

 The gas industry, in general, was put to a severe test during
 the first quarter of 1994 in the wake of the coldest weather on record. 
 On January 18, 1994, the temperature averaged -17F in Madison, Wisconsin
 and did not rise above -7F. WPL set a record peak day load of 251,194
 MMBTU. Overall throughput for January was 23 above forecast. Through
 effective use of transportation, supply, and storage contracts and by
 invoking tariff language allowing interruption and constraint of gas
 supplies to WPL's large industrial and commercial customers, WPL was able
 to maintain gas flows within the parameters imposed by its pipeline
 contracts. By doing so, WPL avoided substantial penalty exposure from the
 pipeline companies for unauthorized use of gas. WPL's large industrial
 and commercial customers served under interruptible rates moved to
 alternate fuel supplies during the periods of interruption and constraint. 
 These customers pay a discounted rate year round in exchange for WPL's
 right to interrupt service to their facilities.

 WPL's portfolio of natural gas contracts over the last several
 years is as follows:

(a) Total no longer equals sum of components. Currently, Northern Natural requires that WPL hold firm transportation equal
 to its total peak-day requirements. Firm storage, "unbundled" sales from Northern Natural, and third party gas supply
 (not shown) are all eligible gas sources to be moved to WPL's city gates via this firm transportation. Contract demand
 services from Northern Natural have been eliminated.

As the natural gas market continues to evolve, WPL continuously
 evaluates products and services provided by pipelines and gas suppliers to
 meet the changing needs of its firm and interruptible gas customers.

Environmental Matters

 WPL cannot precisely forecast the effect of future environmental
 regulations by Federal, state and local authorities upon its generating,
 transmission and other facilities, or its operations, but has taken steps
 to anticipate the future while meeting the requirements of current
 environmental regulations. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 and
 subsequent amendments to the Clean Air Act, as well as the new laws
 affecting the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes along
 with clean air legislation passed in 1990 by Congress, could affect the
 siting, construction and operating costs of both present and future
 generating units.

 Under the Federal Clean Water Act, National Pollutant Discharge
 Elimination System permits for generating station discharge into water
 ways are required to be obtained from the DNR to which the permit program
 has been delegated. These permits must be periodically renewed. WPL has
 obtained such permits for all of its generating stations or has filed
 timely applications for renewals of such permits.

 Air quality regulations promulgated by the DNR in accordance
 with Federal standards impose statewide restrictions on the emission of
 particulates, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and other air pollutants and
 require permits from the DNR for the operation of emission sources. WPL
 currently has the necessary permits to operate its fossil-fueled
 generating facilities. With the passage of the new Federal Clean Air Act
 Amendments, the state is required to include these provisions into their
 permit requirements. WPL has submitted timely Title V permit applications
 in compliance with schedules set forth by the regulators. The operating
 permits, when issued, will consolidate all existing air permit conditions
 and regulatory requirements into one permit for each facility. Permits may
 be issued in late 1995 and 1996. Until such time, the facilities will
 continue to operate under their existing permit conditions.

 Pursuant to Section 144.386(2) of the Wisconsin Statutes, WPL
 has submitted data and plans for 1995 sulfur dioxide emissions compliance. 
 Actual 1994 emissions were reported to the DNR. WPL is currently in
 compliance with the state requirement. WPL will make any necessary
 operational changes in fuel types and power plant dispatch to comply with
 the system emissions limit of 1.2 pounds SO2 per million BTU.

 WPL's compliance strategy for Wisconsin's sulfur dioxide law
 (discussed above) and the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments required plant
 upgrades at its generating facilities. The majority of these projects
 were completed in 1993. WPL has installed continuous emission monitoring
 systems at all of its coal fired boilers in compliance with federal
 requirements. Monitoring for sulfur dioxide was also required by Title IV
 of the Federal Clean Air Act at WPL's South Fond du Lac Combustion Turbine
 Site. These requirements were also met. Additional monitoring systems
 for nitrogen oxides will be required by January 1, 1996 at the combustion
 turbine site. WPL will install these monitors in 1995. No significant
 investments are anticipated at this time to meet the requirements of the
 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments.

 Pursuant to Section 311(j)(5) of the Clean Water Act, WPL has
 submitted Facility Response Plans for the Rock River generating station
 and the South Fond du Lac combustion turbine site. The plans address
 pollution prevention and spill response activities for those facilities
 with capacity to store in excess of one million gallons of oil.

 WPL maintains licenses for all of its ash disposal facilities
 and regularly reports to the DNR groundwater data and quantities of ash
 landfilled or reused. The landfills are operated according to a plan of
 operation approved by the DNR.

 WPL's accumulated pollution abatement expenditures through
 December 31, 1994, totalled approximately 133 million. The major
 expenditures consist of about 60 million for the installation of
 electrostatic precipitators for the purpose of reducing particulate
 emissions from WPL's coal-fired generating stations and approximately 73
 million for other pollution abatement equipment at the Columbia, Edge-
 water, Kewaunee, Nelson Dewey, Rock River and Blackhawk plants. 
 Expenditures during 1994 totalled approximately 5.0 million. Estimated
 future pollution abatement expenditures total 1.5 million through 1996. 
 WPL's estimated pollution abatement expenditures are subject to continuing
 review and are revised from time to time due to escalation of construction
 costs, changes in construction plans and changes in environmental
 regulations.

 See "Electric Operations - Fuel" for information concerning the
 disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high level nuclear waste.

 Manufactured Gas Plant Sites

 Historically, WPL has owned 11 properties that have been
 associated with the production of manufactured gas. Currently, WPL owns
 five of these sites, three are owned by municipalities, and the remaining
 three are owned by private companies. In 1989, WPL initiated
 investigation of these manufactured gas plant sites. The DNR has been
 involved in reviewing investigation plans and has received ongoing reports
 regarding these investigations.

 In 1992, and into the beginning of 1993, WPL continued its
 investigations and studies. WPL confirmed that there was no contamination
 at two of the sites and received a close out letter from the DNR related
 to one of those sites and requested a close out letter for the other site. 
 Additionally, the investigation of historical records at a third site
 indicated a minimal likelihood of any significant environmental impacts. 
 In February 1993, WPL completed cost estimates for the environmental
 remediation of the eight remaining sites. The results of this analysis
 indicate that during the next 34 years, WPL will expend approximately 81
 million for feasibility studies, data collection, soil remediation
 activities, groundwater research and groundwater remediation activities,
 including construction of slurry containment walls and the installation of
 groundwater pump and treatment facilities. This estimate was based on
 various assumptions, and is subject to continuous review and revision by
 management.

 The cost estimate set forth above assumes 4 percent average
 inflation over a 34 year period. The cost estimate also contemplates that
 primarily groundwater pump and treatment activities will take place after
 1998 through and including 2027. During this time, WPL estimates that it
 will incur average annual costs of 2.0 million to complete the planned
 groundwater remediation activities.

 With respect to rate recovery of these costs, the PSCW has
 approved a five year amortization of the unamortized balance of
 environmental costs expended to date.

 In addition, WPL is pursuing insurance recovery for the costs of
 remediating these sites and is investigating to determine whether there
 are other parties who may be responsible for some of the clean-up costs.

 Through 1994, management has continued its oversight of the
 issues related to the above manufactured gas plant sites without
 significant revision to the above estimates and assumptions.

 Based on the present regulatory record at the PSCW, management
 believes that future costs of remediating these manufactured gas plant
 sites will be recovered in rates.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
 ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 1994 COMPARED WITH 1993

 OVERVIEW

 Net income of Wisconsin Power and Light Company ("WPL" or the "Company")
 increased to 68.2 million in 1994 compared with 60.2 million in 1993. 
 Net income for 1994 was significantly affected by two non-recurring items. 
 These items were the reversal of a coal contract penalty in the 1st
 quarter and costs associated with early retirement and severance programs
 which primarily occurred in the 4th quarter. Both of these items are
 discussed in the "Other Events" section of Management's Discussion and
 Analysis. The following breakout presents the recurring aspects of 1994's
 operations.

WPL's electric margin increased during 1994 compared to 1993. The primary
 factor was a 3.8 percent retail rate increase effective October 1, 1993. 
 Strong economic conditions in the industrial and commercial customer
 classes contributed higher sales and customer growth. A colder than
 normal January and a very warm mid-September offset relatively mild summer
 conditions in July and August making 1994 a relatively average year in
 terms of impacts on sales volumes. Electric production fuel costs were
 reasonably stable for 1994. The volume of purchased power increased as a
 result of WPL's efforts to conserve coal inventories during a rail strike
 in the 3rd quarter of 1994. See "Other Events" for details.

Gas margin increased in 1994 from 1993 primarily based on two factors: 1)
 a 1.4 percent retail rate increase effective October 1, 1993 and, 2) an
 increase in customers in the higher rate firm service which improved the
 sales mix. The overall cost of purchased gas declined reflecting WPL's
 effective use of opportunities on the gas spot market.

 Other Operation

 Other operation expense increased due to the early retirement and
 severance programs discussed in the "Other Events" section.
 
 Maintenance

 Maintenance expense decreased between years due to variation in the timing
 and extent of maintenance on its generating facilities between years. 
 Secondarily, a severe storm in the summer of 1993 increased 1993's
 maintenance expense related to service restoration.

 Depreciation and Amortization

 Depreciation expense increased, principally reflecting increased property
 additions and increased decommissioning costs.

 Other Income and (Deductions)

 Other income increased resulting from the reversal of a coal contract
 penalty discussed later in the "Other Events" section.

 Income Taxes

 Income taxes increased between years primarily due to higher taxable
 income.

1993 COMPARED WITH 1992

 OVERVIEW

 Net income of the Company increased to 60.2 million in 1993 compared with
 55.4 million in 1992. The principle factors leading to increased
 earnings included warmer summer weather and lower electric fuel costs per
 kWh which yielded higher electric margins. These increases were somewhat
 offset by increased depreciation expense resulting from additional
 investment in utility plant and property additions, a change in the mix of
 gas sales from higher margin sales to lower margin sales, the increase in
 the Federal corporate tax rate from 34 percent to 35 percent and a one-
 time 4-cent-per-share charge associated with a voluntary separation
 program for the executive management group.

Electric margin in dollars increased during 1993 compared with 1992 due to
 increased demand for electricity brought on by warmer summer weather. 
 Residential customers, being the most weather sensitive, experienced the
 most significant increases. Wisconsin's strong economy kept the
 commercial and industrial classes growing steadily. These increases were
 coupled with declining electric production fuel costs per kWh. The
 decrease in electric production fuel cost per kWh was due to WPL's
 aggressive pursuit of additional spot coal purchase opportunities as its
 longer term contracts began to expire. Additionally, a highly competitive
 rail transportation environment significantly reduced the cost of
 transporting the coal. Also, lower cost purchased power became available
 due to excess capacity in the bulk power market.

Gas revenues for 1992 were affected by the recognition of a 4.9 million
 before-tax refund to its natural gas customers resulting from an
 adjustment in the calculation of the purchased gas adjustment clause. 
 Without the impact of this revenue adjustment, comparative gas margins
 would have declined for 1993 compared with 1992.

 The overall increases in gas revenues and purchased gas costs between
 years resulted primarily from increased volumes procured on behalf of
 transportation customers. This had the impact of decreasing margins as a
 percentage of total revenues. A change in the mix of gas sales from
 higher margin residential sales to lower margin sales also moved margins
 downward. Offsetting this decline, Wisconsin's strong economy enabled
 growth in the Commercial and Industrial classes, and there was also some
 overall increase in the demand for natural gas due to colder weather.

 Other Operation Expense

 An increase in other operation expense resulted from higher WPL employee
 benefit expense (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7). 
 These increases were offset somewhat by decreases in conservation program
 expenditures and decreases in fees associated with the sale of accounts
 receivable due to a decline in interest rates. Additionally, cost
 management efforts have helped control annual inflationary pressures on
 general and administrative costs.

 Depreciation and Amortization

 Depreciation and amortization expense increased, principally reflecting
 increased property additions and the commencement of deferred charge
 amortizations approved in WPL's rate orders received in December 1992 and
 October 1993. The most significant amortizations include the amortization
 related to an acquisition adjustment which resulted from the purchase of
 transmission facilities and the amortization of costs incurred related to
 the remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites (see Notes to the
 Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11).
 
 Allowance for Funds Used During Construction ("AFUDC")

 Total AFUDC increased in 1993 compared with 1992, reflecting the greater
 amounts of construction work in progress including the costs associated
 with WPL's construction of two 86-megawatt combustion-turbine generators.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 Rates and Regulatory Matters

 On December 9, 1994, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW)
 issued rate order UR-109, effective for a two-year period beginning
 January 1, 1995. The order included the following decisions on WPL's
 retail rate application as filed on February 4, 1994: 1) electric
 revenues will be decreased by approximately 12.3 million (2.8 percent)
 annually, 2) natural gas revenues will be increased by approximately .7
 million (.5 percent) annually, 3) return on common equity will be 11.5
 percent versus WPL's previously allowed return on equity of 11.6 percent.

Further, the PSCW approved certain incentive programs described below:

 1. The electric fuel adjustment mechanism was eliminated. In its
 absence, WPL will benefit from reductions in fuel cost. Conversely, WPL
 will be exposed to increases in fuel costs.

 2. The automatic purchased gas adjustment clause was also
 eliminated. In the future, the fluctuations in the commodity cost of gas
 above or below a prescribed commodity price index will serve to increase
 or decrease WPL's margin on gas sales. Fixed demand costs are excluded
 from the incentive program. Both benefits and exposures are subject to
 ratepayer sharing provisions, which are capped at 1.1 million.

 3. In order to promote air quality and reliability, there are SO2
 emissions and service reliability incentive clauses. Positive incentive
 available under these clauses is 1.5 million for the SO2 emissions and
 .5 million for the service reliability. WPL's earnings are also
 negatively exposed for equal amounts. Since WPL is allowed to collect
 all revenues under these programs in advance, up to 4.0 million annually
 of pre-tax revenue may be collected subject to refund upon final
 determination of performance under this program.

 Industry Outlook

 The PSCW has recently opened a formal docket initiating an inquiry into
 the future structure of the electric utility industry in Wisconsin. The
 goals of Wisconsin utility regulation and the principles to be used in
 choosing among alternative proposals have been identified. WPL has
 submitted its preferred structure which, in summary form, calls for open
 access to transmission and distribution systems and a competitive power
 generation market place. It is not possible at this time to predict the
 outcome of these proceedings.

 Financing and Capital Structure

 The level of short-term borrowings fluctuates based on seasonal corporate
 needs, the timing of long-term financing and capital market conditions. 
 WPL generally issues short-term debt to provide interim financing of
 construction and capital expenditures in excess of available internally
 generated funds. WPL periodically reduces its outstanding short-term debt
 through the issuance of long-term debt and through equity contributions 
 from its parent, WPL Holdings, Inc. To maintain flexibility in its
 capital structure and to take advantage of favorable short-term rates
 WPL also uses proceeds from the sales of accounts receivable and unbilled
 revenues to finance a portion of its long-term cash needs. The Company
 also anticipates that short-term debt funds will continue to be available
 at reasonable costs due to strong ratings by independent utility analysts
 and rating services. Commercial paper has been rated A-1+ by Standard &
 Poor's Corp. and P-1 by Moody's Investors Service.

 Bank lines of credit of 70 million at December 31, 1994 are available to
 support these borrowings.

 The Company's capitalization at December 31, 1994, including the current
 maturities of long-term debt, variable rate demand bonds and short-term
 debt, consisted of 52 percent common equity, 6 percent preferred stock and
 42 percent long-term debt. The common equity to total capitalization
 ratio at December 31, 1994 increased to 52 percent from 51 percent at
 December 31, 1993.

 The retail rate order effective January 1, 1995, requires WPL to maintain
 a utility common equity level of 51.93 percent of total utility
 capitalization during the two-year test year ending December 31, 1996. In
 addition, the PSCW ordered that it must approve the payment of dividends
 by WPL that are in excess of the level forecasted for 1995 58.1
 million), if such dividends would reduce WPL's average common equity ratio
 below 51.93 percent.

 Capital Requirements

 WPL is a capital-intensive business and requires large investments in
 long-lived assets. Therefore, the Company's most significant capital
 requirements relate to construction expenditures. Estimated capital
 requirements for the next five years are as follows:

Capital Requirements

 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 
 (in millions)

Construction expenditures 131.2 100.4 132.2 119.6 130.6

 ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
 Total capital requirements 128.6 104.1 209.7 145.5 127.4
 ====== ====== ====== ====== ======

Included in the construction expenditure estimates, in addition to the
 recurring additions and improvements to the distribution and transmission
 systems, are the following: 1) expenditures for managing and controlling
 electric line losses and for the electric delivery system that will reduce
 electric line losses and enhance WPL's interconnection capability with
 other utilities; 2) expenditures related to environmental compliance
 issues including the installation of additional emissions monitoring
 equipment and coal handling equipment; 3) expenditures associated with the
 construction of an 86-megawatt combustion-turbine generator expected to
 become operational in 1996.

 The Company's capital requirements may also be impacted by decisions 
 relating to the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant ("Kewaunee"). The steam
 generator tubes at Kewaunee are susceptible to corrosion characteristics,
 a condition that has been experienced throughout the nuclear industry. 
 Annual inspections are performed to identify degraded tubes. Degraded 
 tubes are either repaired by sleeving or are removed from service
 plugging. The steam generators were designed with an approximately 15
 percent heat transfer margin, meaning that full power should be
 sustainable with the equivalent of 15 percent of the steam generator
 tubes plugged. Tube plugging and the build-up of deposits on the tubes 
 affect the heat-transfer capability of the steam generators to the point 
 where eventually full-power operation is not possible and there is a
 gradual decrease in the capacity of the plant. The plant's capacity could
 be reduced by as much as 20 by the year 2013 when the current operating
 license expires. Currently, the equivalent of approximately 12 percent of
 the tubes in the steam generators are plugged. WPL and the joint-owners 
 recently completed studies evaluating the economics of replacing the two 
 steam generators at Kewaunee. The studies resulted in the conclusion that 
 the most prudent course of action is to continue operation of the existing 
 steam generators. WPL and the other joint-owners continue to evaluate 
 appropriate strategies, including replacement, as well as continued 
 operation of the steam generators without replacement. WPL and the 
 joint-owners also continue to fund the development of welded repair 
 technology for steam generator tubes. The plant is expected to be 
 operated until at least 2013. WPL and the joint-owners are also 
 continuing to evaluate and implement initiatives to improve the 
 performance of Kewaunee, which already performs at above average levels 
 for the industry. These initiatives include conversion from a 12-month 
 to an 18-month fuel cycle and numerous other cost reduction measures. 
 These initiatives have resulted in reductions in Kewaunee operating 
 and maintenance costs since 1991.

 Capital Resources

 One of the Company's objectives is to finance construction expenditures
 through internally generated funds supplemented, when required, by outside
 financing. With this objective in place, the Company has financed an
 average of 79 percent of its construction expenditures during the last
 five years from internal sources. However, during the next five years,
 the Company expects this percentage to be reduced primarily due to the
 continuation of major construction expenditures and the maturity of 64
 million of WPL first mortgage bonds. External financing sources such as
 the issuance of long-term debt, short-term borrowings and equity 
 contributions from its parent, WPL Holdings, Inc. will be used by the
 Company to finance the remaining construction expenditure requirements for 
 this period. Expectations are that 65 million of long-term debt will
 be issued over the next three years. 

 INFLATION

 Under current rate-making methodologies prescribed by the various
 commissions that regulate WPL, projected or forecasted operating costs,
 including the impacts of inflation, are incorporated into WPL revenue
 requirements. Accordingly, the impacts of inflation on WPL are currently
 mitigated. Although rates will be held flat until at least 1997,
 management expects that any impact of inflation will be mitigated by
 customer growth and productivity improvements. Inflationary impacts on
 the non-regulated businesses are not anticipated to be material to the
 Company.

 OTHER EVENTS

 Coal Contract Penalty

 In November 1989, the PSCW concluded that WPL did not properly administer
 a coal contract, resulting in an assessment to compensate ratepayers for
 excess fuel costs having been incurred. As a result, WPL recorded a
 reserve in 1989 that had an after-tax affect of reducing 1989 net income
 by 4.9 million. The PSCW decision was found to represent unlawful
 retroactive rate-making by both the Dane County Circuit Court and the
 Wisconsin Court of Appeals. The case was then appealed to the Wisconsin
 Supreme Court.

 In January, 1994, the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the decisions of
 the Dane County Circuit Court and Wisconsin Court of Appeals. In
 management's opinion, all avenues for appeal have been exhausted. As a
 result, WPL reversed the entire reserve and was also allowed to collect
 interest on amounts of the penalty previously refunded to ratepayers. The
 reversal of the reserve plus interest had an after-tax affect of
 increasing net income in 1994 by 5.3 million.

 Early Retirement and Severance Programs

 Given the expectation of increasing competition, WPL has continued to
 reengineer its processes to implement cost efficiencies in its operations. 
 In connection with these efforts, WPL offered voluntary early retirement
 programs and voluntary severance programs to affected employees in 1994
 and 1993. These programs primarily closed late in the fourth quarter of
 1994 and 1993.

 For 1994, in terms of cost, the early retirement programs totalled 9.8
 million and the severance programs totalled 3.9 million for a grand total
 of 13.7 million. For 1993, program costs totalled 1.8 million.

 Coal Transporter's Strike

 One of WPL's major coal transporters experienced a labor strike during the
 third quarter of 1994. During the term of the strike (55 days), WPL's
 ability to receive coal from its suppliers was impaired, which required
 WPL to use some of its existing coal reserves and to purchase additional
 power. On August 29, 1994, President Clinton, acting under the Railway
 Labor Act, forced a temporary end (the "cooling off period") to the strike
 by ordering the railroad union employees back to work and establishing a
 three member Presidential Emergency Board to draft a recommended
 settlement. Railroad management and the United Transportation Union have
 subsequently settled on a contract. As of December 31, 1994, the existing
 and anticipated financial impact on WPL's operating results was not
 material.

 Environmental

 WPL cannot precisely forecast the effect of future environmental
 regulations by federal, state and local authorities upon its generating,
 transmission and other facilities, or its operations, but has taken steps
 to anticipate the future while meeting the requirements of current
 environmental regulations. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 and
 subsequent amendments to the Clean Air Act, as well as the new laws
 affecting the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes along
 with the clean air legislation passed in 1990 by Congress, could affect
 the siting, construction and operating costs of both present and future
 generating units.

 Under the Federal Clean Water Act, National Pollutant Discharge
 Elimination System permits for generating station discharge into water
 ways are required to be obtained from the Wisconsin Department of Natural
 Resources (DNR). WPL has obtained such permits for all of its generating
 stations or has filed timely applications for renewals.

 Air quality regulations promulgated by the DNR in accordance with federal
 standards impose statewide restrictions on the emission of particulates,
 sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and other air pollutants and require
 permits from the DNR for the operation of emission sources. WPL currently
 has the necessary permits to operate its fossil-fueled generating
 facilities. However, beginning in 1994, new permits were required for all
 major facilities in Wisconsin. WPL's Columbia Generating facility
 submitted a permit application on May 1, 1994. The remaining facilities
 will be addressed in early 1995.

 WPL's compliance strategy for Wisconsin's 1993 sulfur dioxide law and the
 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments required plant upgrades at its generating
 facilities. The majority of these projects were completed in 1993 and
 1994. WPL has installed continuous emissions monitoring systems at all of
 its coal fired boilers. No additional costs for compliance with these
 acid-rain-prevention requirements are anticipated at this time.

 Also see Note 11c in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 for a discussion of WPL's manufactured gas plant sites.

WISCONSIN POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (dollars in thousands except as
 otherwise indicated)

 NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND 

 REPORTING POLICIES:

 a. Business and Consolidation:

 Wisconsin Power and Light Company ("WPL" or the "Company") is a wholly-
 owned subsidiary of WPL Holdings, Inc. ("WPLH").

 WPL is a public utility predominantly engaged in the transmission and
 distribution of electric energy and the generation and bulk purchase of
 electric energy for sale. WPL also transports, distributes and sells
 natural gas purchased from gas suppliers. Nearly all of WPL's retail
 customers are located in south and central Wisconsin. WPL's principal
 consolidated subsidiary is South Beloit Water, Gas and Electric Company. 
 Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform with
 the current year presentation.

 b. Regulation:

 WPL's financial records are maintained in accordance with the uniform
 system of accounts prescribed by its regulators. The Public Service
 Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW") and the Illinois Commerce Commission have
 jurisdiction over retail rates, which represent approximately 83 percent
 of electric revenues plus all gas revenues. The Federal Energy Regulatory
 Commission ("FERC") has jurisdiction over wholesale electric rates
 representing the balance of electric revenues. Statement of Financial
 Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of
 Certain Types of Regulation" provides that rate-regulated public utilities
 such as WPL record certain costs and credits allowed in the ratemaking
 process in different periods than for unregulated entities. These are
 deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and are recognized
 in the Consolidated Statements of Income at the time they are reflected in
 rates.

 c. Utility Plant and Other Property and Equipment:

 Utility plant and other property and equipment are recorded at original
 cost and cost, respectively. Utility plant costs include financing costs
 that are capitalized through the PSCW-approved allowance for funds used
 during construction ("AFUDC"). The AFUDC capitalization rates approximate
 WPL's cost of capital. These capitalized costs are recovered in rates as
 the cost of the utility plant is depreciated.

 Normal repairs, maintenance and minor items of utility plant and other
 property and equipment are expensed. Ordinary utility plant retirements,
 including removal costs less salvage value, are charged to accumulated
 depreciation upon removal from utility plant accounts, and no gain or loss
 is recognized. Upon retirement or sale of other property and equipment,
 the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
 accounts and any gain or loss is included in other income and deductions. 

 d. Nuclear Fuel:

 Nuclear fuel is recorded at its original cost and is amortized to expense
 based upon the quantity of heat produced for the generation of
 electricity. This accumulated amortization assumes spent nuclear fuel
 will have no residual value. Estimated future disposal costs of such fuel
 are expensed based on kilowatthours generated.

 e. Revenue:

 WPL accrues utility revenues for services provided but not yet billed.

 f. Electric Production Fuels and Purchased Gas:

 (1) Electric Production Fuels:

 Through 1994, the PSCW retail electric rates provided a range
 from which actual fuel costs could vary in relation to costs
 forecasted and used in rates. If actual fuel costs fell outside
 this range, a hearing could be held to determine if a rate
 change was necessary, and a rate increase or decrease could
 result.

 Beginning with WPL's latest rate order UR-109, effective January
 1, 1995, the automatic fuel adjustment clause was eliminated. 
 In its absence, WPL will benefit from reductions in fuel cost. 
 Conversely, WPL will be exposed to increases in fuel costs.

 An automatic fuel adjustment clause for the FERC wholesale
 portion of WPL's electric business operates to increase or
 decrease monthly rates based on changes in fuel costs.

 (2) Purchased Gas:

 Through 1994, WPL's base gas cost recovery rates permitted the
 recovery of or refund to all customers for any increases or
 decreases in the cost of gas purchased from WPL's suppliers
 through a monthly purchased gas adjustment clause.

 Beginning with UR-109, the monthly purchased gas adjustment
 clause was also eliminated. In the future, the fluctuations in
 the commodity cost of gas above or below a prescribed commodity
 price index will serve to increase or decrease WPL's margin on
 gas sales. Fixed demand costs are excluded from the incentive
 program. Both benefits and exposures are subject to ratepayer
 sharing provisions, which are capped at 1.1 million.

 g. Cash and Equivalents:

 The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a
 maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying
 amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these
 items.

h. Income Taxes:

 Under the terms of an agreement with WPLH, the Company calculates its
 federal tax provisions and makes payments to WPLH as if it were a separate
 taxable entity. Beginning in 1993, WPL fully provides deferred income
 taxes in accordance with SFAS No.109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," to
 reflect tax effects of reporting book and tax items in different periods.

 NOTE 2. PROPERTY:
 
 a. Jointly-Owned Utility Plants:

 WPL participates with other Wisconsin utilities in the construction and
 operation of several jointly-owned utility generating plants. The chart
 below represents WPL's proportionate share of such plants as reflected in
 the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 1994 and 1993

 ======= ======== ====== ======== ======== ======

Each of the respective joint owners finances its portion of construction
 costs. WPL's share of operation and maintenance expenses is included in
 the Consolidated Statements of Income.

 b. Capital Expenditures:

 The Company's capital expenditures for 1995 are estimated to total 128.6
 million. Substantial commitments have been incurred for such
 expenditures.

 NOTE 3. DEPRECIATION:

 The Company uses the straight-line method of depreciation. For utility
 plant, straight-line depreciation is computed on the average balance of
 depreciable property at individual straight-line PSCW approved rates that
 consider the estimated useful life and removal cost or salvage value as
 follows:

 Electric Gas Water Common
 1994 3.2 3.7 2.5 7.2 
 1993 3.2 3.7 2.5 7.3 
 1992 3.2 3.7 2.6 7.1 

NOTE 4. NUCLEAR OPERATIONS:

 Depreciation expense related to the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant
 ("Kewaunee") includes a provision to accrue for the cost of
 decommissioning over the life of the plant, which totalled 13.4 million,
 6.1 million and 3.9 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. 
 Wisconsin utilities with ownership of nuclear generating plants are
 required by the PSCW to establish and make annual contributions to
 external trust funds to provide for plant decommissioning. Additionally,
 in July 1994, the PSCW issued a generic order covering utilities that have
 nuclear generation. This order standardizes the escalation assumptions to
 be used in determining nuclear decommissioning liabilities.

 WPL's share of the decommissioning costs is estimated to be 159 million
 (in 1994 dollars, assuming the plant is operating through 2013) based on a
 1992 study, using the immediate dismantlement method of decommissioning. 
 The undiscounted amount of decommissioning costs estimated to be expended
 between the years 2014 and 2050 is 1.016 billion. After-tax earnings on
 the tax-qualified and nontax-qualified decommissioning funds are assumed
 to be 6.1 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively. The future escalation
 rate is assumed to be 6.5 percent.

 Decommissioning costs and a charge to offset earnings on the external
 trusts are recorded as portions of depreciation expense and accumulated
 provision for depreciation on the Statements of Consolidated Income and
 the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. As of December 31, 1994,
 the total decommissioning costs included in the accumulated provision for
 depreciation were approximately 62.8 million.

 WPL has established external trusts to hold decommissioning funds, and the
 PSCW has approved WPL's funding plan which provides for annual
 contributions of current accruals over the remaining service lives of the
 nuclear plants. The earnings on the external trusts accumulate in the
 fund balance and in the accumulated provision for depreciation. Such
 earnings on the external trust funds, which have been offset by a charge
 to depreciation expense on the Statements of Consolidated Income, were
 2.7, 1.1 and 1.2 for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
 respectively.

 Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the U.S. Department of Energy
 ("DOE") is responsible for the ultimate storage and disposal of spent
 nuclear fuel removed from nuclear reactors. Interim storage space for
 spent nuclear fuel is currently provided at the Kewaunee Nuclear Power
 Plant. Currently there is on-site storage capacity for spent fuel through
 the year 1999. Nuclear fuel, net, at December 31, consists of:

 1994 1993
 Original cost of nuclear fuel 155,190 147,325
 Less--Accumulated amortization 135,794 129,325
 -------- --------
 Nuclear fuel, net 19,396 18,000
 ======== ========

 The Price Anderson Act provides for the payment of funds for public
 liability claims arising from a nuclear incident. Accordingly, in the
 event of a nuclear incident, WPL, as a 41-percent owner of the Kewaunee
 Nuclear Power Plant, is subject to an overall assessment of approximately
 32.5 million per incident for its ownership share of this reactor, not to
 exceed 4.1 million payable in any given year.

 Through its membership in Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, WPL has
 obtained property damage and decontamination insurance totalling 1.5
 billion for loss from damage at the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant. In
 addition, WPL maintains outage and replacement power insurance coverage
 totalling 101.4 million in the event an outage exceeds 21 weeks.

 NOTE 5. NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE:

 WPL has a contract with a financial organization to sell, with limited
 recourse, certain accounts receivable and unbilled revenues. These
 receivables include customer receivables resulting from sales to other
 public utilities as well as from billings to the co-owners of the jointly-
 owned electric generating plants that WPL operates. The contract allows
 WPL to sell up to 150 million of receivables at any time. Expenses
 related to the sale of receivables are paid to the financial organization
 under this contract and include, along with various other fees, a monthly
 discount charge on the outstanding balance of receivables sold that
 approximated a 4.86 percent annual rate during 1994. These costs are
 recovered in retail utility rates as an operating expense. All billing
 and collection functions remain the responsibility of WPL. The contract
 expires August 19, 1995, unless extended by mutual agreement.

 As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, proceeds from the sale of accounts
 receivable totalled 76.5 million and 74 million, respectively. During
 1994, WPL sold an average of 82.3 million of accounts receivable per
 month, compared with 75.9 million in 1993.

 As a result of its diversified customer base and WPL's sale of
 receivables, the Company does not have any significant concentrations of
 credit risk in the December 31, 1994, net accounts receivable balance.

 NOTE 6. REGULATORY ASSETS AND REGULATORY LIABILITIES:

 Certain costs and credits are deferred and amortized in accordance with
 authorized or expected rate-making treatment. As of December 31, 1994 and
 1993, regulatory created assets include the following:

 1994 1993
 Environmental remediation costs 82,179 82,380
 Tax related (see Note 8) 43,736 47,787
 Jurisdictional plant differences 7,173 6,533
 Decontamination and decommissioning
 costs of federal enrichment facilities 7,100 6,181
 Other 4,288 5,924
 -------- --------
 144,476 148,805
 ======== ========

 As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, regulatory created liabilities included
 6,738 and 6,618, respectively, for amounts due to customers related to
 the sale of air emissions credits.

 NOTE 7. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

 a. Pension Plans:

 WPL has non-contributory, defined benefit retirement plans covering
 substantially all employees. The benefits are based upon years of service
 and levels of compensation. WPL's funding policy is to contribute at
 least the statutory minimum to a trust.

 The projected unit credit actuarial cost method was used to compute net
 pension costs and the accumulated and projected benefit obligations. The
 discount rate used in determining those benefit obligations was 8.25, 7.25
 and 8.00 percent for 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The long-term
 rate of return on assets used in determining those benefit obligations
 9.00, 9.75, and 10.00 percent for 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

 The following table sets forth the funded status of the WPL plans and
 amounts recognized in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets at
 December 31, 1994 and 1993:

 1994 1993
 Accumulated benefit obligation--
 Vested benefits (134,829) (135,303)
 Non-vested benefits (3,295) (2,962)
 --------- ----------
 (138,124) (138,265)
 --------- ----------
 Projected benefit obligation (154,283) (164,271)
 Plan assets at fair value, primarily
 common stocks and fixed income
 securities 178,095 183,881
 --------- ----------
 Plan assets in excess of projected
 benefit obligation 23,812 19,610
 Unrecognized net transition asset (19,376) (21,823)
 Unrecognized prior service cost 5,679 7,691
 Unrecognized net loss 14,737 20,650
 --------- ----------
 Pre-paid pension costs, included in
 deferred charges and other 24,852 26,128
 ========= ==========

 The net pension (benefit) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of
 Income for 1994, 1993 and 1992 included the following components:

 1994 1993 1992
 Service cost 5,123 4,263 3,912
 Interest cost on projected benefit
 obligation 12,051 11,614 10,615
 Actual return on assets 1,016 (24,759) (12,143)
 Amortization and deferral (17,795) 8,430 (5,317)
 -------- -------- --------
 Net pension (benefit) 395 (452) (2,933)
 ======== ======== ========

b. Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance:

 Effective January 1, 1993, the Company prospectively adopted SFAS No. 106,
 "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions". 
 SFAS No. 106 establishes standards of financial accounting and reporting
 for the company's postretirement health care and life insurance benefits. 
 SFAS No. 106 requires the accrual of the expected cost of such benefits
 during the employees' years of service based on actuarial methodologies
 that closely parallel pension accounting requirements. WPL has elected
 delayed recognition of the transition obligation and is amortizing the
 discounted present value of the transition obligation to expense over 20
 years. The cost of providing postretirement benefits, including the
 transition obligation, is being recovered in retail rates under current
 regulatory practices.

 The following table sets forth the plans' funded status:

 1994 1993
 Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation-- 
 Retirees (29,273) (27,358) 
 Fully eligible active plan participants (5,998) (5,429)
 Other active plan participants (7,675) (9,980)
 -------- --------
 Accumulated benefit obligation (42,946) (42,767)
 Plan assets at fair value 9,767 7,073 
 -------- --------
 Accumulated benefit obligation
 in excess of plan assets (33,179) (35,694)
 Unrecognized transition obligation 26,474 29,638
 Unrecognized loss (2,570) 2,025 
 -------- --------
 Accrued postretirement benefits liability (9,275) (4,031)
 ======== ========

 For 1994 and 1993, the annual net postretirement benefits costs recognized
 in the Consolidated Statements of Income consist of the following
 components:

 1994 1993
 Service cost 1,739 1,463
 Interest cost on projected benefit
 obligation 3,135 3,151
 Actual return on plan assets (253) (696)
 Amortization of transition obligation 1,527 1,560
 Amortization and deferral (381) (27)
 ------- -------
 Net postretirement benefits cost 5,767 5,451 
 ======= =======

 The postretirement benefits cost components for 1994 were calculated
 assuming health care cost trend rates ranging from 11.5 percent for 1994
 and decreasing to 5 percent by the year 2002. The health care cost trend
 rate considers estimates of health care inflation, changes in utilization
 or delivery, technological advances, and changes in the health status of
 the plan participants. Increasing the health care cost trend rate by one
 percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated
 postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1994 by 2.5 million
 and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of the net
 periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year by .4 million.

 The assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated
 postretirement obligation was 8.25 and 7.25 percent in 1994 and 1993,
 respectively. The long-term rate of return on assets was 9.00 and 9.50
 percent in 1994 and 1993, respectively. Plan assets are primarily
 invested in common stock, bonds and fixed income securities. The
 Company's funding policy is to contribute the tax-advantaged maximum to a
 trust.

 The costs for the postretirement health care and life insurance benefits,
 based on an actuarial determination were 1.3 million in 1992.

 c. Other Postemployment Benefits:

 In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued No.
 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits". SFAS No. 112,
 which was effective January 1, 1994, establishes standards of financial
 accounting and reporting for the estimated cost of benefits provided by an
 employer to former or inactive employees after employment but before
 retirement. The effect of adopting SFAS No. 112 was not material.

NOTE 8. INCOME TAXES:

 The following table reconciles the statutory federal income tax rate to
 the effective income tax rate:

 1994 1993 1992
 Statutory federal income tax rate 35.0 35.0 34.0 
 State income taxes, net of
 federal benefit 5.6 6.1 6.0
 Investment tax credits restored (1.7) (2.0) (2.4)
 Amortization of excess deferred taxes (1.5) (1.5) (1.6)
 Other differences, net 1.1 (1.9) (2.0)
 ---- ---- ----
 Effective income tax rate 38.5 35.7 34.0 
 ==== ==== ====

 In 1992, deferred taxes arising from utility plant timing differences, the
 qualified nuclear decommissioning trust contribution, employee benefits
 and other totalled 4,104, 709, 2,081, and 755), respectively.

 The temporary differences that resulted in accumulated deferred income tax
 (assets) and liabilities as of December 31 are as follows:

 1994 1993
 Accelerated depreciation and other
 plant related 186,565 171,993
 Excess deferred taxes 21,215 22,744
 Unamortized investment tax credits (21,784) (22,812)
 Allowance for equity funds used during
 construction 14,384 13,518
 Regulatory liability 17,553 19,179
 Other 4,440 6,140
 -------- --------
 222,373 210,762
 ======== ========

 Changes in WPL's deferred income taxes arising from the adoption of SFAS
 No. 109 represent amounts recoverable or refundable through future rates
 and have been recorded as net regulatory assets totalling approximately
 26 million and 29 million in 1994 and 1993, respectively, on the
 Consolidated Balance Sheets. These net regulatory assets are being
 recovered in rates over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets
 to which they pertain. 

 NOTE 9. SHORT-TERM DEBT AND LINES OF CREDIT:

 The Company maintains bank lines of credit, most of which are at the bank
 prime rates, to obtain short-term borrowing flexibility, including
 pledging lines of credit as security for any commercial paper outstanding. 
 Amounts available under these lines of credit totalled 70 million as of
 December 31, 1994. Information regarding short-term debt and lines of
 credit is as follows:

 1994 1993 1992
 As of end of year--
 Commercial paper outstanding 50,500 49,000 26,000
 Notes payable outstanding -- 10,000 25,000
 Discount rates on commercial
 paper 5.64 -6.12 3.24 -3.40 3.15 -3.90 
 Interest rates on notes
 payable -- 3.34 3.46 -3.62 

 For the year ended--
 Maximum month-end amount of
 short-term debt 50,500 59,000 51,000
 Average amount of short-term
 debt (based on daily
 outstanding balances) 25,374 30,423 22,160
 Average interest rate on
 short-term debt 5.89 3.29 3.63 

NOTE 10. CAPITALIZATION:

 a. Common Shareowners' Investment:

 A retail rate order effective January 1, 1995, requires WPL to maintain a
 utility common equity level of 51.93 percent of total utility
 capitalization during the test year January 1, 1995 to December 31, 1996. 
 In addition, the PSCW ordered that it must approve the payment of
 dividends by WPL to WPLH that are in excess of the level forecasted in the
 rate order 58.1 million), if such dividends would reduce WPL's average
 common equity ratio below 51.93 percent.

 b. Preferred Stock:

 On October 27, 1993, WPL issued two new series of preferred stock through
 two separate public offerings. The 6.2 percent Series is non-redeemable
 for ten years and the 6.5 percent Series is non-redeemable for five years. 
 The proceeds from the sale were used to retire 150,000 shares of 7.56
 percent Series and 149,865 shares of 8.48 percent Series preferred stock.

 c. Long-term Debt:

 Substantially all of WPL's utility plant is secured by its first mortgage
 bonds. Current maturities of long-term debt are as follows: 0 in 1995
 and 1996, 55 million in 1997, 8.9 million in 1998 and 0 in 1999.

 The Company has 130 million of notional principal under interest rate
 swap contracts. The fair value of these contracts was not material as of
 December 31, 1994.

 The fair value of the Company's long-term debt based on quoted market
 prices for similar issues at December 31, 1994 and 1993 was 386,520 and
 428,841, respectively.

 NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

 a. Coal Contract Commitments:

 To ensure an adequate supply of coal, WPL has entered into certain
 long-term coal contracts. These contracts include a demand or take-or-pay
 clause under which payments are required if contracted quantities are not
 purchased. Purchase obligations on these coal and related rail contracts
 total approximately 149 million through December 31, 2003. WPL's
 management believes it will meet minimum coal and rail purchase
 obligations under the contracts. Minimum purchase obligations on these
 contracts over the next five years are estimated to be 25 million in 1995
 and 26 million in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999.

 b. Purchased Power and Gas:

 Under firm purchase power and gas contracts, WPL is obligated as follows
 (dollars in millions):

 Purchased Power Purchased Gas 
 ------------------- --------------------------
 Purchase Purchase Decatherms
 Obligation MW's Obligation (in millions)

 1995 8.3 1,920 67 89
 1996 8.1 1,830 67 90
 1997 10.9 1,944 55 78
 1998 15.6 2,505 45 66
 1999 18.8 2,910 41 53
 Thereafter 106.5 12,720 77 101
 ----- ------ ---- ---
 168.2 23,829 352 477
 ====== ====== ==== ===

 c. Manufactured Gas Plant Sites:

 Historically, WPL has owned 11 properties that have been associated with
 the production of manufactured gas. Currently, WPL owns five of these
 sites, three are owned by municipalities, and the remaining three are
 owned by private companies. In 1989, WPL initiated investigation of these
 manufactured gas plant sites. The Wisconsin Department of Natural
 Resources ("DNR") has been involved in reviewing investigation plans and
 has received ongoing reports regarding these investigations.

 In 1992, and into the beginning of 1993, WPL continued its investigations
 and studies. WPL confirmed that there was no contamination at two of the
 sites. WPL received a close-out letter from the DNR related to one of
 those sites and requested a close-out letter for the other site. 
 Additionally, the investigation of historical records at a third site
 indicated a minimal likelihood of any significant environmental impacts. 
 In February 1993, WPL completed cost estimates for the environmental
 remediation of the eight remaining sites. The results of this analysis
 indicate that during the next 35 years, WPL will expend approximately 81
 million for feasibility studies, data collection, soil remediation
 activities, groundwater research and groundwater remediation activities,
 including construction of slurry containment walls and the installation of
 groundwater pump and treatment facilities. This estimate was based on
 various assumptions, and is subject to continuous review and revision by
 management.

 The cost estimate set forth above assumes 4 percent average inflation over
 a 35 year period. The cost estimate also contemplates that primarily
 groundwater pump and treatment activities will take place after 1998
 through and including 2027. During this time, WPL estimates that it will
 incur average annual costs of 2.0 million to complete the planned
 groundwater remediation activities.

 With respect to rate recovery of these costs, the PSCW has approved a five
 year amortization of the unamortized balance of environmental costs
 expended to date.

 In addition, WPL is pursuing insurance recovery for the costs of
 remediating these sites and is investigating to determine whether there
 are other parties who may be responsible for some of the clean-up costs.

 Through 1994, management has continued its oversight of the issues related
 to the above manufactured gas plant sites without significant revision to
 the above estimates and assumptions.

 Based on the present regulatory record at the PSCW, management believes
 that future costs of remediating these manufactured gas plant sites will
 be recovered in rates.

To WISCONSIN POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY:

We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
 the consolidated financial statements included in the 1994 Form 10-K of
 Wisconsin Power and Light Company and have issued our report thereon dated
 February 1, 1995. Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an
 opinion on those statements taken as a whole. Supplemental Schedule II is
 the responsibility of the Company's management and are presented for
 purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules

 fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to be
 set forth therein in relation to the basic consolidated financial
 statements taken as a whole.

 issued. All stock certificates shall be signed by the President or a Vice
 President and by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company,
 and be sealed with the corporate seal of the Company, which seal may be
 facsimile, engraved or printed. If and when a Transfer Agent and/or a
 Registrar shall have been appointed by the Board with respect to the
 shares of any class of stock, or series thereof, of the Company, the
 certificates representing such shares shall also be countersigned by such
 Transfer Agent and/or countersigned and registered by such Registrar, as
 the case may be. Certificates which have been countersigned by a Transfer
 Agent and countersigned and registered by a Registrar, in both cases duly
 appointed by the Board of Directors for such purpose, may bear the
 signatures of the President or a Vice President and the Secretary or an
 Assistant Secretary of the Company in facsimile, engraved or printed;
 provided, that no certificate bearing the facsimile signatures of the
 Officers of the Company shall be valid or effective for any purpose unless
 and until it shall have been so countersigned and registered. In case any
 such Officer who has signed any stock certificate, or whose facsimile
 signature has been placed thereon, shall have ceased to be such Officer
 before such certificate is issued, such certificate may be issued by the
 Company with the same effect as if such Officer had not ceased to be such
 at the date of its issue.

 Section 2 - The stock of the Company shall be divided into such
 Classes, with such relative rights and preferences, as shall be provided
 by the Articles of Organization of the Company as the same may from time
 to time be amended in accordance with the laws of Wisconsin.

 Section 3 - Shares of stock shall be transferable only on the books
 of the Company; and upon proper endorsement and surrender of the
 outstanding certificates representing the same. Subject to such
 conditions as the Board of Directors may, by Resolution, establish: (a)
 If an outstanding certificate of stock shall be lost, destroyed or stolen,
 the holder thereof may have a new certificate issued, upon producing
 evidence satisfactory to the Officers of the Company, of such loss,
 destruction or theft; and upon furnishing to the Company a bond of
 indemnity, surety bond, or such other assurance as the Officers may
 require. (b) Where any outstanding certificates of stock are deemed
 abandoned by the holder thereof, pursuant to the unclaimed property or
 escheatment laws of any state having jurisdiction thereof, the Officers of
 the Company are authorized and directed to cause the transfer and delivery
 of said certificates or to cause the issuance of replacement certificates,
 to such person or persons as may be entitled thereto in accordance with
 such escheatment laws.

 Section 4 - Transfer books may be closed by order of the Board of
 Directors for short periods, not exceeding forty days at any one time, for

 other than (a) adjourning from time to time until a quorum shall be
