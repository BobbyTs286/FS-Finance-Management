PART I

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

 As used in this report, the "Company" means First Enterprise Financial
Group, Inc., an Illinois corporation ("FEFG"), and First Enterprise Acceptance
Company, an Illinois corporation ("FEAC") and wholly owned subsidiary of FEFG.

GENERAL

 The Company is a specialty finance company primarily engaged in
purchasing and servicing installment contracts originated by dealers for
financing the sale of automobiles. The Company purchases installment contracts
which provide financing for non-prime consumers. The Company also offers, as
agent, ancillary products in conjunction with the installment contracts the
Company purchases. The Company commenced operations in 1990 and began
purchasing installment contracts in May 1992 through three branch offices. As
of December 31, 1996, the Company operated 35 branch offices in eight
southeastern states.

THE INDUSTRY

 The automobile finance industry is the second largest consumer finance
market in the United States, estimated by the Federal Reserve Board to have
been a 354 billion market in terms of outstanding automobile installment
credit at the end of 1995. Generally, the industry classifies prime and
non-prime consumers based on the creditworthiness of the consumer. The Company
does not further categorize its consumers within the classification of
non-prime. Every non-prime consumer is evaluated by the branch manager and
branch personnel in accordance with the Company's uniform credit guidelines and
procedures which are specifically designed to support its evaluation of
non-prime consumers.

 The Company believes that the non-prime portion of the automobile
finance market ranges from 30 billion to 50 billion or more and is highly
fragmented. Many large financial service entities, such as commercial banks,
savings and loans, credit unions and captive finance companies do not
consistently provide financing to the non-prime market. The Company believes
that some of the factors contributing to the limited activities of traditional
lenders in the non-prime segment of the market are (i) the higher risk of the
obligers and the installment contracts, (ii) the lack of effective experience
in servicing non-prime consumers, and (iii) the regulatory oversight and
capital requirements imposed by governmental agencies on traditional lenders
which limit their ability to extend credit to such non-prime consumers. In
many cases, those organizations electing to remain in the automobile finance
business have migrated toward higher credit quality customers in order to
reduce collection and processing costs and to maintain higher levels of credit
quality. Many of the largest providers of financing to the non-prime
automobile finance market are the publicly-traded specialty automobile finance
companies. The Company estimates that these companies collectively have less
than a 15 market share. The

2

 3

remainder is primarily comprised of privately held finance companies and
dealers who provide financing programs directly to the consumer.

 The Company believes that several demographic and economic trends
favor increased growth in the nonprime segment of the automobile finance
industry. Currently, the average American family must spend a significantly
higher percentage of its income to purchase a new or used automobile than it
did several years ago. According to industry data, the average price of a new
automobile in 1994 represented approximately 51 of the U.S. median family
income for that year, an increase from approximately 44 in 1986. The Company
believes this increase, combined with increases in the average useful life of
automobiles and the number of late-model used automobiles available for sale
(including rental cars and cars that were formerly leased) will continue to
expand the used automobile market.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

 The Company's strategy is to grow its Total Portfolio by increasing
its penetration of existing markets and by expanding into new market areas.
The principal components of the Company's strategy include:

 - Decentralized Structure. The Company operates with a
 decentralized branch office network that provides branch
 managers with a significant degree of autonomy and
 accountability. Within guidelines set by the Company, branch
 managers are responsible for the development of dealer
 relationships, underwriting of installment contract purchases,
 servicing and collection of accounts and implementation of
 repossession procedures. Performance goals are established
 for each branch office, and the branch manager's incentive
 compensation is tied to the performance results of the branch
 office. Management believes that its decentralized
 operational structure enhances dealer service, results in
 better portfolio quality through personal knowledge of local
 market conditions and improves collection rates by requiring
 collection activity to be handled through direct local contact
 with consumers. Decentralization enhances dealer service by
 allowing branch managers to frequently meet one-on-one with
 local dealers, quickly respond to contract applications and
 respond to changes in competitive conditions. The
 decentralized structure also enables branch managers to
 interact personally with consumers during the origination and
 servicing of installment contracts. Decentralization requires
 more effective management information systems, internal audit
 procedures and credit guidelines to maintain control over the
 Company's business.

 - Experienced Management Personnel. The Company's growth and
 profitability have been largely the result of the services of
 its management at the executive, supervisory and branch
 levels. The executive officers of the Company have an average
 of over 34 years of experience in the financial services
 industry. The Company's regional supervisors and branch
 managers have an average of 31

3

 4

 years and 20 years of experience, respectively, in the
 consumer and automobile finance industries. The Company
 believes that hiring and retaining experienced management
 personnel, particularly at the branch and supervisory levels,
 is essential for the Company to accomplish its bjectives. The
 Company believes it attracts and retains experienced
 management personnel by providing competitive compensation,
 significant autonomy in the Company's decentralized
 operational structure and equity participation.

 - Focus on Smaller Markets. The Company generally targets
 smaller markets with populations of less than 150,000. The
 Company believes that these markets tend to be less
 competitive than larger markets and that dealers in such
 markets are more relationship oriented than in larger markets.
 Management believes the Company gains a competitive advantage
 by opening branch offices headed by experienced branch
 managers who typically have established relationships with
 local dealers and extensive knowledge of the market. The
 Company considers the availability of experienced branch
 managers with knowledge of the local market to be the most
 important factor in selecting additional branch office
 locations. Other factors considered in the selection of
 additional branch office locations include competition,
 demographics and the regulatory climate. The Company had 35
 branch offices in eight southeastern states as of December 31,
 1996. The Company opened ten new branch offices in 1996 and
 plans to open five additional branch offices by March 31,
 1997, some of which may be in new states.

 - Service to Dealers. The Company helps to expand its dealers'
 customer bases by providing financing to consumers who
 otherwise might not be able to obtain credit. The Company
 further assists dealers by promptly responding to credit
 applications, by providing a consistent source of financing
 and by typically paying dealers within 24 hours after
 receiving all required documentation. As of December 31,
 1996, the Company purchased installment contracts from a total
 of 1,313 dealers in eight southeastern states and had active
 relationships with 573 of such dealers. The Company defines
 an active relationship with a dealer as one in which the
 Company purchases at least five contracts per twelve month
 period from such dealer. As of December 31, 1996, no single
 dealer accounted for more than 2.1 of the Total Portfolio.

 - Management Information System. The Company utilizes an
 on-line, real-time data processing system of a third party
 vendor to process its installment contract transactions, to
 assist in compliance with its credit policies and certain
 applicable laws and regulations and to monitor its
 decentralized branch office network. This system has been
 customized to meet the Company's processing, compliance and
 reporting requirements. The executive, operations and branch
 offices have immediate access to data from the management
 information system. Management believes that the Company's
 information system will permit sustained growth in the Total
 Portfolio.

BRANCH OFFICES

 While the Company generally targets smaller markets with populations
of less than 150,000, the Company has opened and may continue to open branch
offices in larger communities. As of December 31, 1996, the Company had 35
branch offices in eight southeastern states. Ten new branch offices were
opened in 1996 and the Company plans to open five additional branch offices by
March 31, 1997. The Company has never closed a branch office.

 The following table summarizes certain information regarding the Company's
branch offices.

 (in thousands) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19,248 35,137 70,184 120,154

The actual selection of a new branch office location is generally
based on the availability of an experienced branch manager with industry and
market knowledge in the selected community, competition, certain demographic
factors and the regulatory climate. The Company expects to attract additional
qualified managers to staff new branch offices and has recently established a
training program to provide an expanding pool of qualified branch managers.

 Branch managers operate their branch offices with a significant degree
of autonomy and accountability. Operating within the guidelines set by the
Company, branch managers are responsible for the development of new dealer
relationships, underwriting of automobile installment contract purchases,
servicing and collection of accounts and implementation of repossession
procedures. Decentralization allows branch managers to frequently meet
one-on-one with local dealers, quickly respond to contract applications and
respond to changes in competitive conditions. This decentralized structure
also enables branch managers to interact personally with the consumers during
the origination and servicing of installment contracts.

 After several months of orientation, a branch manager typically opens
a new branch office with two or three employees. Staff is expanded as growth
warrants. The Company's initial capital expenditure for a new branch office is
approximately 15,000, which includes computer equipment, furniture and signs.
Based on previous experience, the Company's branch offices are expected to be
profitable within nine to 12 months of commencing operations. During the
startup

5

 6

period, all costs, net of revenue, are treated as current period operating
expenses. The Company leases all of its branch offices with average monthly
rent of approximately 1,000 per branch office.

MONITORING OF BRANCH OFFICES

 The Company monitors the performance of each of its branch offices
through daily and monthly review of operating and financial reports from its
management information system, quarterly site reviews of branch offices by the
Company's five regional supervisors and operational reviews of branch offices
by its internal auditor.

 The Company's management information system enables the executive
officers and regional supervisors to immediately access branch and portfolio
information. Some of the more important reports received by management from its
information system include: (i) delinquency reports, (ii) charge-off reports,
(iii) inventory repossession reports, (iv) cash reports, (v) trial balances,
(vi) branch income statements and (vii) volume reports. The Company also uses
its management information system to transfer deposits from its local branch
bank accounts to its central bank utilizing the Automated Clearing House.
Branch disbursement checks are drawn on a central bank account which provides
additional controls.

DEALER RELATIONSHIPS

 Generally, for each dealer, branch managers evaluate (i) the level and
quality of the dealer's inventory, (ii) the length of time the dealer has been
in business, (iii) historical financial information to determine financial
viability and (iv) the dealer's reputation in the community. Branch managers
review, on an ongoing basis through the Company's management information
system, the loss experience on the installment contracts purchased from each
dealer.

 Generally, the Company enters into a non-exclusive written dealer
agreement (a "Dealer Agreement") with each dealer from which the Company
purchases installment contracts on a continuing basis. The Dealer Agreement
does not obligate the Company to purchase installment contracts from the dealer
or the dealer to offer any installment contracts for sale to the Company.
Dealer Agreements generally provide representations and warranties relating to
such matters as to whether (i) the financed automobile is free of all liens,
claims and encumbrances except the Company's lien, (ii) the down payment
specified in the installment contract has been paid in full and no part of the
down payment was loaned to the consumer by the dealer and (iii) the dealer has
complied with applicable law. Dealer Agreements generally also provide that the
dealer shall indemnify the Company against any damages or liabilities,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and including in certain instances
repurchases of the installment contract on demand, arising out of (i) any
breach of a representation or warranty of the dealer set forth in the Dealer
Agreement or (ii) any claim or defense that a consumer may have against a
dealer relating to an installment contract.

 The Company believes it has strong relationships with dealers and that
such relationships will continue. The Company is not affiliated with any
dealers, nor is there common ownership with any dealer. The Company's
relationships with dealers are not regulated at the federal or state level.

CREDIT UNDERWRITING PROCEDURES

 If a non-prime consumer elects to finance the purchase of an
automobile through a dealer, the dealer may submit the consumer's credit
application to the Company for review of the consumer's creditworthiness and
the proposed transaction terms. The branch manager reviews the transaction in
accordance with the Company's credit guidelines and procedures, which generally
take into account, among other things, the individual's stability of residence,
employment history, credit history, ability to pay and ratio of debt service
payments to income, the down payment, as well as the value of the collateral.
In addition, the branch manager evaluates a credit bureau report in order to
determine if (i) the individual's credit quality is deteriorating, (ii) the
individual's credit history suggests a high probability of default or (iii) the
individual's credit experience is too limited for the Company to assess the
probability of performance. The branch personnel may also require verification
of certain applicant or dealer provided information prior to making the credit
decision. Such verification is performed solely by Company branch personnel
and typically includes (i) submission of supporting documentation, such as a
paycheck stub or other substantiation of income, (ii) evidence of residency and
(iii) proof of physical damage insurance. Within the parameters set by the
Company's credit guidelines and procedures, the branch manager is permitted to
supplement the data received with subjective judgment and knowledge of local
conditions. By using a wide variety of criteria and the knowledge and
experience of the local branch manager, the Company attempts to reduce its
default rate and thus limit its losses.

 After reviewing the credit application and the terms of the sale, the
branch office notifies the dealer whether the Company would be willing to
purchase the installment contract upon sale of the automobile to the applicant.
The Company typically responds to submitted dealer applications on the date
received, and in many cases within two to three hours. For the year ended
December 31, 1996, the Company approved approximately 27 of all submitted
credit applications and approximately 61 of the installment contracts related
to approved credit applications were purchased by the Company. The difference
between the number of applications approved and the number of installment
contracts purchased is primarily due to dealers submitting credit applications
to more than one finance company. In cases where the Company is unwilling to
purchase an installment contract from a dealer under the proposed terms but
believes the applicant has the capacity to meet other repayment obligations,
the branch office will work with the dealer to restructure the terms of the
financing or suggest the sale of an alternative automobile with a price more
suited to the applicant's financial means.

INSTALLMENT CONTRACT PURCHASE

 When the branch manager approves the purchase of an installment
contract, the branch office notifies the dealer by facsimile. Such notice
confirms all pertinent information relating to the terms of the approval,
including the finance charge, the term, information about the automobile to be
sold, a list of ancillary products purchased by the consumer and the amount of
non-refundable contract acquisition discount that the Company will deduct from
the initial principal balance of the installment contract. Since inception of
the Company's automobile finance activities, the nonrefundable contract
acquisition discount charged by the Company has averaged approximately 10 of
the initial principal balance of the installment contracts. Generally, the
amount paid in cash to dealers for installment contracts ranges between 80 to
110 of the wholesale value of the automobile, with an average of approximately
100 . The consumer is typically required to make a down payment of at least 10 
of the purchase price.

 After the dealer delivers all required documentation to the Company,
the Company remits funds to the dealer, generally within 24 hours. In most
cases, the consumer is contacted directly to verify the terms of the
transaction. Upon purchase of the installment contract, the Company acquires a
perfected security interest in the financed automobile. Each installment
contract requires that the automobile be properly insured against physical
damage and that the Company be named as a loss payee on the insurance policy.
Compliance with these requirements is verified prior to the remittance of funds
to the dealer.

The following table summarizes the Company's installment contract volume by
state since 1993.

INSTALLMENT CONTRACT TERMS

 The Company purchases precomputed, fixed rate, fully secured, retail
installment contracts on a nonrecourse basis. The installment contracts are
purchased from dealers for the principal balance less the nonrefundable
contract acquisition discount. The non-refundable contract acquisition discount
is determined based on, among other factors, the competitive condition of the
market, the age and value of the automobile and the creditworthiness of the
consumer.

 In 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996, the Company purchased 2,685, 4,935,
10,021 and 15,810 installment contracts, respectively, representing aggregate
principal balances of 19.2 million, 35.1 million, 70.2 million and 120.2
million, respectively. Installment contracts purchased in 1996 had an average
initial principal balance of approximately 7,600, a weighted average
contractual APR of approximately 24.9 , a weighted average non-refundable
contract acquisition discount of approximately 10.8 and a weighted average
initial contract term of approximately 41 months.

INSTALLMENT CONTRACT SERVICING

 The Company's installment contract servicing activities are
specifically tailored for the higher risks associated with non-prime consumers.
Each branch office collects and posts all payments received, responds to
consumer inquiries, takes all necessary action to maintain the security
interest granted in the financed automobiles, investigates delinquencies,
communicates with the consumer to obtain timely payments and, when necessary,
contracts with third parties to recover and sell the financed automobile.

 The Company has established a process through which it attempts to
educate consumers, both in writing and by telephone, upon the Company's
purchase of their installment contracts. This process is designed to ensure
that consumers clearly understand their obligations and includes a review of
the terms of the installment contract with particular emphasis on the amount
and due date of each payment obligation, the Company's expectations as to the
timely receipt of payments, maintenance of insurance coverage and the Company's
delinquency and repossession policies. The branch offices send their
respective customers a payment coupon book prior to the first payment due date.

 Branch office personnel typically contact delinquent consumers within
one to two days after such consumer's due date and collection efforts continue
until payment has been received. The Company believes that early and frequent
contact with the consumer reinforces the consumer's recognition of his or her
contractual obligation and the Company's expectation of timely payment. If
early collection efforts are not successful, branch office personnel design a
collection strategy that includes a specific deadline by which each delinquent
obligation should be collected. Accounts that have not been collected by such
deadline are again reviewed and unless there are specific circumstances which
warrant further collection efforts, such accounts are assigned to an outside
recovery agency for repossession. Only branch managers can

9

 10

authorize repossession of an automobile. Repossessed automobiles are generally
resold through wholesale auctions. The elapsed time between repossession and
resale is generally 15 to 45 days, including passage of the period during which
the law of the applicable jurisdiction permits the consumer to redeem the
automobile.

 The Company provides its branch managers with flexibility in working
with consumers in the collection of payments. Specifically, if a consumer is
unable to make a scheduled payment the branch manager can grant a payment
deferment. The consumer must pay a fee and must sign a deferment agreement as
acceptance of the contract modification. The scheduled payment is then
deferred for the period of time agreed upon between the branch manager and the
consumer but will not exceed 30 days. Generally, no more than two deferments
may be granted in any 12 month period. The branch manager and consumer may
also change the day of the month that each contractual payment is due. Each
contract can generally have the due date changed only once and the change
cannot be greater than 30 days from the original due date.

ANCILLARY PRODUCTS

 The Company offers to consumers, as agent for unaffiliated providers,
optional credit life and accident and health insurance, extended warranty
coverage and motor club memberships solely in connection with its purchase of
consumer installment contracts. The consumers are obligated to secure physical
damage insurance from any acceptable source. If a consumer fails to maintain
physical damage insurance, under the terms of the installment contract the
Company is permitted to and does force place such insurance with the insurer
that it represents. The Company receives commissions on its sales of all such
ancillary products.

MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

 Management believes that operational information available on a
continuous basis at all levels of management is a key factor in managing the
growth and profitability of a decentralized company in a highly competitive
market. The Company has contracted with a third party, Florida Informanagement
Services, Inc. ("FIS"), to provide daily processing of the Company's
installment contract receivables and all other management reporting and
information needs through December 5, 1999. FIS is required to maintain the
data network, provide customized programming services and provide data backup,
recovery and disaster recovery for the Company's records. The system has been
customized by FIS to process the Company's installment contract transactions,
to assist in compliance with its credit policies and certain applicable laws
and regulations and to monitor its decentralized branch office network. The
management information system provides on-line, real-time data processing that
uses personal computers as terminals with automatic download functions and
customized report writer capability at each branch office location.

 All of the Company's offices are connected to the FIS main computer
center in Orlando, Florida. The system provides all of the data processing
with respect to the Company's

10

 11

installment contract transactions, including application processing, retrieval
of credit bureau reports, purchases of installment contracts, payments to
dealers, customer payment posting, credit and collection monitoring activity
and recording and posting of all general ledger information. The system
requires each branch office to balance all daily transactions before closing
out for the day. In addition, each branch office and the Company's operations
headquarters and executive office have selective access to retrieve data from
the system.

 The Company's management information system is programmed with Company
guidelines and legal parameters that limit the acceptance of installment
contracts outside such guidelines and parameters. When certain installment
contract information that does not meet these guidelines is entered into the
system, it will be rejected and only accepted after it is corrected. In
addition, all branch office entries are automatically sorted and classified
into the general ledger system. As a result, the Company is able to compile
financial statements promptly at month-end. The system produces monthly
reports related to selected operational functions and administrative activity
as well as maintains a cash management system to control cash on a daily basis.

 The Company believes that the system has the capacity to support
sustained growth in the Total Portfolio.

COMPETITION

 The automobile finance business is highly fragmented and competitive.
The Company believes that there are numerous competitors providing, or capable
of providing, financing through dealers to non-prime consumers of automobiles
and that many companies have entered the market for non-prime consumers during
the last several years. The Company does not believe that it currently
competes, in any significant manner, with commercial banks, savings and loans,
credit unions, financing arms of automobile manufacturers such as General
Motors Acceptance Corporation, Ford Motor Credit Corporation and Chrysler
Credit Corporation, and other consumer lenders that apply more traditional
lending criteria to the credit approval process. Traditional lenders such as
banks and credit unions generally lend to "prime" consumers. These consumers
generally borrow at lower finance rates, purchase newer model automobiles and
have a lower default rate than non-prime customers. Many of the largest
providers of financing to the non-prime automobile finance market are
publicly-traded specialty automobile finance companies. The Company estimates
that these companies collectively have less than a 15 market share. The
remainder of providers is primarily comprised of privately held finance
companies and dealers who provide financing programs directly to the consumer.
The Company believes that it competes principally on the basis of the service
provided and terms offered to participating dealers.

 Most non-prime lenders require an acquisition discount for each
installment contract purchased. The Company's non-refundable acquisition
discounts are based on the value and condition of the automobile, the
relationship between the amount financed and the automobile's value and the
consumer's creditworthiness which includes length of employment, net income,

11

 12

stability of residency, indebtedness and payment history. During 1996, the
average non-refundable acquisition discount charged by the Company was 10.8 .

REGULATION

 The Company's business is subject to regulation and licensing under
various federal, state and local statutes and regulations. As of December 31,
1996, the Company's business operations were conducted with dealers located in
eight states, and, accordingly, the laws and regulations of such states govern
the Company's operations. Most states where the Company operates (i) limit
finance charges, fees and other charges that may be imposed by, or prescribe
certain other terms of, the installment contracts that the Company purchases,
(ii) govern the sale and type of insurance products offered by the Company and
the insurers for which it acts as agent, (iii) define the Company's rights to
repossess and sell collateral and (iv) prohibit the practice of increasing the
cash sale price for consumers who pay for automobiles on credit rather than in
cash ("cash sale differential"). It is the Company's policy not to purchase
installment contracts from dealers who charge a cash sale differential. In
addition, the Company is required to be licensed or registered to conduct its
finance operations in certain states in which the Company purchases installment
contracts. As the Company expands its operations into other states, it will be
required to comply with the laws of such states.

 Numerous federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations
impose substantive disclosure requirements upon lenders and servicers involved
in automobile financing. Some of the federal laws and regulations include the
Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, the Federal
Reserve Board's Regulations B and Z and the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief
Act.

 The Company is subject to state regulations governing insurance agents
in connection with its sales of credit and other insurance, which require that
insurance agents (such as the Company's personnel) be licensed, govern the
commissions that may be paid to agents in connection with the sale of credit
insurance and limit the premium amount charged for insurance.

 In addition, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") has adopted a
holder-in-due-course rule which has the effect of subjecting persons that
finance consumer credit transactions (and certain related lenders and their
assignees) to all claims and defenses which the consumer could assert against
the seller of the goods and services. With respect to used automobiles
specifically, the FTC's Rule on Sale of Used Automobiles requires that all
sellers of used automobiles prepare, complete and display a Buyer's Guide which
explains the warranty coverage for such automobiles. The Credit Practices Rules
of the FTC impose additional restrictions on sales contract provisions and
credit practices.

ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES

PROPERTIES

 The principal executive office of the Company is located in Evanston,
Illinois in a leased office facility of approximately 2,600 square feet, and
the lease for such office expires on October 31, 2000. The operations
headquarters is located in Enterprise, Alabama in a leased office facility of
approximately 7,200 square feet, and the lease for such office expires on June
30, 1999. As of December 31, 1996, the Company leased office space for 35
branch offices

14

 15

ranging from approximately 1,000 square feet to 3,000 square feet, and was
obligated under leases expiring on dates ranging from May 1997 to December
2005.

ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 The Company is involved from time to time in ordinary routine
litigation incidental to its business. The litigation is generally based upon
claims that certain of the Company's business practices such as acquiring
installment contracts at an acquisition discount, force placing insurance and
offering other insurance products violate laws, including the Alabama Consumer
Credit Act, the Alabama Deceptive Practices Act and the Federal Truth in
Lending Act. Three of the suits pending against the Company as of March 1, 1997
are purported class actions. One of the purported class actions was
conditionally certified as a class action, but the other class actions have not
been so certified. The Company believes that the ultimate outcome of all
pending litigation as of March 1, 1997, will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company, its profitability and its financial position. The Company
intends to vigorously defend all such actions.

 Due to the consumer-oriented nature of the Company's industry and the
application of certain laws and regulations, industry participants are
regularly named as defendants in litigation alleging violations of federal and
state laws and regulations and consumer law torts, including fraud. Many of
these actions allege violations of consumer protection laws. Therefore, there
can be no assurance that the Company will not be named as a defendant in future
suits or that such suits will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company, its profitability and its financial condition.

ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the
preceding "Selected Financial and Operating Data" and the Company's Financial
Statements and the Notes thereto and the other financial data included in this
report. The financial information provided below has been rounded in order to
simplify its presentation. The ratios and percentages provided below are
calculated using the detailed financial information contained in the Financial
Statements, the Notes thereto and the financial data elsewhere in this report.

GENERAL

 The Company is a specialty finance company engaged primarily in
purchasing and servicing installment contracts originated by dealers in the
sale of automobiles. The Company derives most of its revenue from (i) finance
charges earned on the installment contracts, (ii) contractual servicing fees
and bonus servicing fees resulting from the sales of certain receivables and
(iii) fees and commissions derived from the sale of ancillary products. The
following table summarizes the Company's sources of revenues,

 ===== ===== ===== 

From its inception in 1990 through May 1992, the Company engaged in
the financing of timeshare receivables at resort properties. In May 1992 the
Company changed its operating strategy to focus on the financing of automobile
installment contracts. As of December 31, 1996, the Company had sold or
collected all remaining timeshare receivables. The Company's automobile
installment contract portfolio has grown significantly since 1992. The Total
Portfolio increased from 6.2 million at December 31, 1992 to 149.5 million at
December 31, 1996.

 Installment contracts are generally purchased from dealers at a
discount from the principal amount financed by consumers which is
non-refundable to dealers ("non-refundable contract acquisition discount").
The amount of the non-refundable contract acquisition discount is negotiated
between the dealers and the branch managers based on several factors, including
the creditworthiness of the consumers, the value and condition of the
automobiles and the relationship between the amount to be financed and the
automobile's value. Installment contracts purchased during the year ended
December 31, 1996 had a weighted average non-refundable contract acquisition
discount of approximately 10.8 . The portfolio of owned and sold installment
contracts is grouped into pools on a chronological basis (quarterly beginning
in 1995) for purposes of evaluating the non-refundable contract acquisition
discounts. The non-refundable contract acquisition discount represents both a
credit allowance and a yield enhancement, with the portion necessary to absorb
credit losses allocated to the allowance for credit losses. The remaining
portion of the non-refundable contract acquisition discount, if any, is
allocated to the unamortized contract acquisition discount and is accreted into
finance charge income over the estimated life of the installment contracts
using the sum-of-the-months'-digits method which approximates the interest
method. Since August 1995, all of the Company's non-refundable contract
acquisition discount has been allocated to the allowance for credit losses.
See "---Credit Loss Experience."

 The Company records an installment contract on its books as the total
of contractually scheduled payments under such contract, reduced by: (i)
unearned finance charges, which are recognized as income using the interest
method; (ii) unearned insurance commissions, which are recognized as income
over the average terms of the related policies using the
sum-of-the-months'-digits method; (iii) the unamortized contract acquisition
discount, which

18

 19

represents the portion of the non-refundable contract acquisition discount not
allocated to the allowance for credit losses and (iv) that portion of the
contract acquisition discount allocated to the allowance for credit losses. If
an installment contract becomes 90 or more days contractually delinquent and no
full contractual payment is received in the month the account reaches such
delinquency status, the accrual of income is suspended until one or more full
contractual monthly payments are received. Late charges, deferment fees and
extensions fees are recognized as income when collected.

 As part of its overall funding strategy, the Company has sold finance
receivables under various asset purchase agreements. During the years ended
December 31, 1993, 1995 and 1996, the Company sold 12.1 million, 27.5
million, and 35.2, respectively, under such agreements. The sales were
without recourse and no gain or loss was recognized for those sales in 1993 and
1995 as they were not material to the financial statements. Gains were
recognized for the sales in the year ended December 31, 1996 in the amount of
 524,000 primarily due to a decrease in the fixed rate to the purchaser
compared to previous sales. The gains on the sales of finance receivables were
determined by the difference between sales proceeds and the cost of the finance
receivables and adjusted for the present value of the difference between the
estimated future servicing revenues (net of a fixed rate to the purchaser) and
the normal servicing costs ("excess servicing rights"). The excess servicing
rights were capitalized and are being amortized over the expected life of the
finance receivables. In conjunction with the sale of these receivables, the
Company and the purchasers have entered into servicing agreements whereby the
Company retained servicing rights on the installment contracts sold and
receives contractual servicing fees equal to 3 per annum of the remaining
principal balance of the installment contracts sold. Under the terms of the
existing agreements, the Company is also eligible to receive additional
servicing fees, based upon portfolio performance, on the installment contracts
("bonus servicing fees"). The bonus servicing fees represent the difference
between the yield received by the Company and the sum of (i) the Company's 3 
contractual servicing fee, (ii) the yield due to the purchaser and (iii) the
addition or reduction necessary to maintain the purchaser's reserve at the
required level. At December 31, 1996, the outstanding balance of installment
contracts sold and serviced by the Company was 30.9 million. All servicing
fees earned by the Company are recognized in the Company's financial statements
as servicing income.

 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. The Company's actual results may differ materially from the
results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause
such a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed in "Risk
Factors."

GROWTH, PROFITABILITY AND RECENT TRENDS AND DEVELOPMENTS

 The Company has experienced significant growth since it changed its
operating strategy to focus on the financing of automobile installment
contracts. From December 31, 1992 to December 31, 1996, the Total Portfolio
increased from 6.2 million to 149.5 million. The Company's strategy is to
grow the Total Portfolio by increasing its penetration of existing markets and
by expanding into new market areas. The Company has grown from four branch
offices at December 31, 1992 to 35 branch offices at December 31, 1996.

 The principal determinant of the Company's net interest income is the
difference between the finance charge income earned on the Owned Portfolio and
the interest paid on borrowed funds. The laws of most states establish the
maximum finance charge rates and prescribe the types and maximum amounts of
fees, insurance premiums and other amounts that consumers may be charged. As
is common in the non-prime consumer market, the Company's installment contracts
generally bear the maximum allowable interest rates and other charges permitted
under applicable state laws.

 The Company's liabilities are generally more interest-rate sensitive
than are its earning assets. As a result, significant increases in the
Company's cost of funds could have a material adverse effect on its
profitability and financial condition. To a degree, the Company can mitigate
the adverse effect of an increase in interest rates by (i) selling or
financing portions of its Total Portfolio with fixed liabilities, (ii)
focusing on purchasing only installment contracts which bear the maximum
finance charge rates permitted by law or which are originated in states where
finance charge rate ceilings have not been established, (iii) expanding into
states that permit higher finance charge rates on consumer installment
contracts, (iv) reducing the amount it pays for an installment contract (e.g.,

19
 20

increasing the non-refundable contract acquisition discount) and (v) entering
into interest rate protection agreements. Additionally, management believes
that the improved capitalization resulting from its Initial Public Offering
done in July 1996, will allow the Company to take advantage of financing
structures which may reduce the Company's cost of funds or mitigate interest
rate exposures.

 The following table sets forth information with regard to the
Company's net interest spread, which represents the difference between the
yield on installment contracts and the Company's cost of borrowed funds.

(1) Represents automobile portfolio finance charges as a percentage of the
 average Owned Portfolio.
(2) Represents net interest income as a percentage of the average Owned
 Portfolio. For 1994 and 1995, interest expense was allocated to the
 Owned Portfolio based on the ratio of the average Owned Portfolio to
 the average total finance receivables (consisting of both the Owned
 Portfolio and timeshare receivables).

 As reflected in the preceding table, the Company's yield has decreased
during the period from 1994 through December 31, 1996. This is due primarily
to increased penetration into states which have laws which limit the maximum
amount of finance charges, fees, premiums and other charges that can be
charged. Additionally, the decrease is due to (i) force placed collateral
protection insurance ("CPI") for which the Company does not charge interest,
accounting for a larger percentage of the Owned Portfolio, and (ii) the
reduction of accretion income stemming from the unamortized contract
acquisition discount. The Company's cost of borrowed funds increased from 1994
to 1995, but decreased in 1996. The increase in 1995 was due primarily to the
replacement of subordinated debt, the issuance of new subordinated debt and a
higher average cost of borrowed funds under the Credit Facility in 1995. In
December 1994, the Company replaced 4 million in subordinated debt bearing
interest at 6 , with a 4 million subordinated note bearing interest at 13.5 .
Additionally, in September 1995, the Company issued a new subordinated note for
 4.5 million bearing interest at 13 , the proceeds of which were used to pay
down borrowings under the Credit Facility. The average cost of borrowed funds
on the Credit Facility increased from 9.1 in 1994 to 10.5 in 1995. The
average cost of borrowed funds decreased from 1995 to 1996 due primarily to the
retirement of all subordinated debt, a lower average cost of funds on the
Credit Facility, and the securitization of certain finance receivables. In
July 1996, the Company completed its initial public offering of 1,886,640
shares of common stock at a price of 7 per share and in August 1996, the
Underwriters exercised their 30-day overallotment option to purchase an
additional 282,996 shares, also at 7 per share. The proceeds to the Company
were used to retire all subordinated debt and reduce the balance on the Credit
Facility by approximately 3 million. Further, effective October 1, 1996, the
Company renegotiated its Credit Facility, increasing the commitment to 85
million from 62 million and reducing the interest rate to prime plus 25 basis
points with an option of 250 basis points over LIBOR. The average cost of
borrowed funds on the Credit Facility decreased from 10.5 in 1995 to 9.5 in
1996. Finally, in June 1996, the Company completed a 45.1 million debt
financing transaction consisting of 6.84 fixed rate securitization notes. The
proceeds received by the Company were used to repay indebtedness under the
Credit Facility.

 The Company's profitability is also dependent on its credit loss
experience. See "--Credit Loss Experience."

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,1995

Net Interest Income

 Finance charges and interest increased 8.1 million, or 83.2 , from
 9.6 million in 1995 to 17.7 million in 1996. The growth in finance charges
and interest resulted from an increase in the Owned Portfolio due to an

20
 21

increase in the number of installment contracts purchased. Installment
contracts purchased increased 50.0 million, or 71.2 , from 70.2 million in
1995 to 120.2 million in 1996. The Company opened 10 branch offices in 1996,
increasing to 35 the number of its branch offices.

 The average Owned Portfolio yield decreased from 24.0 in 1995 to
22.3 in 1996. This decrease was primarily attributable to increased
penetration into states which have laws which limit the maximum amount of
finance charges, fees and premiums and other charges that can be charged. The
decrease was also attributable to (i) an increase in CPI insurance, for which
the Company does not charge interest, as a percentage of the Owned Portfolio in
1996 as compared to 1995, and (ii) accretion of the unamortized contract
acquisition discount of approximately 128,000 in 1995 compared to no accretion
income for 1996. Receivables relating to CPI insurance premiums as a
percentage of the Owned Portfolio increased from 5.2 at December 31, 1995 to
6.4 at December 31, 1996.

 Interest expense increased 2.3 million from 4.0 million in 1995 to
 6.3 million in 1996. The increase in interest expense resulted from an
increase in borrowings under the Credit Facility and the securitization of
finance receivables. Average total indebtedness increased 31.9 million, or
91.3 , from 34.9 million for 1995 to 66.8 million for 1996. The average cost
of borrowed funds decreased from 11.6 for 1995 to 9.4 for 1996. The decrease
in the average cost of borrowed funds was due to the following factors, (i)
the extinguishment of 8.5 million of subordinated debt bearing interest at a
weighted average rate of 13.3 in July 1996 from the proceeds of the Initial
Public Offering, (ii) a reduction of the interest rate on the Credit Facility
from an average rate of 10.5 for 1995 to 9.5 for 1996, and (iii) the
securitization in June 1996, of installment contracts as a fixed rate debt
transaction bearing interest at a rate of 6.8 , the proceeds of which were used
to pay down borrowings under the Credit Facility. In addition to the weighted
average interest rates on the subordinated debt, the Company amortized both the
fees associated with the debt and the discount related to the detachable
warrants attached to the debt. Further, in addition to the stated rate of 6.8 
on the fixed rate securitized notes, the Company is amortizing fees associated
with the securitization, which totaled approximately 966,000.

 Net interest income increased 5.8 million, or 103.1 , from 5.6
million in 1995 to 11.4 million in 1996. The net interest margin on the Owned
Portfolio increased from 14.0 in 1995 to 14.3 in 1996, due to the lower cost
of funds, offset by the reduction in the average portfolio yield as discussed
above.

Provision for Credit Losses

 For 1996, the Company made provisions for credit losses of 4 million.
There were no provisions for credit losses in 1995. The provisions for credit
losses were necessary to increase the allowance for credit losses to the level
required from management's static pool loss analyses performed on the
portfolio. As a result, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of the
Owned Portfolio increased from 8.4 at December 31, 1995 to 9.6 at December
31, 1996. See "--Credit Loss Experience."

Other Income

 Other income increased 5.3 million, or 106.7 , from 5.0 million in
1995 to 10.3 million in 1996. The increase in other income was due primarily
to the increase in servicing income, the sale of ancillary products, the
collection of certain fees, and the recognition of a gain on the sale of
installment contracts.

 Servicing income increased 1.9 million, or 62.7 , from 3.1 million
in 1995 to 5.0 million in 1996. The increase in servicing income was due to
the sale of 35.2 million in installment contracts during 1996 as compared to
the sale of 27.5 million in 1995. Further, the average balance of sold
contracts increased 18.5 million, or 96.4 , from 19.2 million in 1995 to
 37.7 million in 1996.

 Income from insurance commissions increased 1.9 million, or 138.3 ,
from 1.3 million in 1995 to 3.2 million in 1996. The increase was
attributable to the increased sales of insurance products in connection with
the

21
 22

increase in the volume of installment contracts purchased and the introduction
of certain new insurance products in late 1995.

 Fee and other income increased 1.0 million from 606,000 in 1995 to
 1.6 million in 1996. The increase was attributable to increased fees
collected in connection with the growth of the Total Portfolio due to an
increase in the number of installment contracts purchased.

 In 1996, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of 35.2 million of
installment contracts in the amount of 524,000. The gain on the sale of
installment contracts was determined by the difference between sales proceeds
and the cost of the installment contracts adjusted for the present value of the
excess servicing rights. The excess servicing rights were capitalized and are
being amortized over the expected life of the installment contracts in direct
proportion to the reduction in the related pool of installment contracts sold.

Operating Expenses

 Operating expenses increased 4.6 million, or 56.5 , from 8.2 million
in 1995 to 12.8 million in 1996. The increase in operating expenses was due
to increases in salaries and employee benefits, rent and other expenses
relating to the opening of new branch offices as well as the addition of
administrative personnel at the Evanston, Illinois and Enterprise, Alabama
offices. Salaries and employee benefits increased 2.7 million, or 52.5 , from
 5.1 million in 1995 to 7.8 million in 1996. Although total operating
expenses increased in 1996 as compared to 1995, the Total Portfolio increased
at a faster rate than the rate of increase in operating expenses. As a result,
operating expenses as a percentage of the average Total Portfolio decreased
from 13.8 in 1995 to 10.9 in 1996.

Income Taxes

 Income taxes increased 1.9 million from 60,000 in 1995 to 2.0
million in 1996. The increase is due to the Company terminating its status as
an S Corporation effective on January 1, 1996. As a result, the Company is now
subject to federal and certain state and local income taxes.

 Upon termination of its S Corporation status, and in compliance with
SFAS No. 109, the Company recognized a deferred tax benefit of 267,000 for
1996 representing the cumulative temporary differences between the financial
reporting and tax basis in its assets and liabilities.

Extraordinary Item

 In 1996, the Company incurred an extraordinary charge against earnings
of 150,000, net of taxes of 96,000, related to the early extinguishment of
 8.5 million in subordinated debt. The subordinated debt was extinguished in
July 1996, from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering of the Company's
common stock. The extraordinary charge was comprised of previously unamortized
fees associated with the debt and unamortized discounts related to the
detachable warrants attached to the subordinated debt.

Net Income

 Net income increased 710,000, or 29.9 , from 2.4 million in 1995 to
 3.1 million in 1996. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to
the growth in the Total Portfolio and related factors as discussed above, as
well as the income tax benefit resulting from the termination of the S
Corporation status.

22
 23

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,1994

Net Interest Income

 Finance charges and interest increased 4.4 million, or 85.3 , from
 5.2 million in 1994 to 9.6 million in 1995. The growth in finance charges
and interest resulted from an increase in the Owned Portfolio due to an
increase in the number of installment contracts purchased in 1995.

 The Company opened eight branch offices in 1995, increasing to 25 the
number of its branch offices. In 1995, the Company purchased 10,021
installment contracts representing 70.2 million, an increase of 103.1 and
99.7 , respectively, from the 4,935 installment contracts representing 35.1
million purchased in 1994.

 The average Owned Portfolio increased 20.2 million, or 100.8 , from
 20.0 million in 1994 to 40.2 million in 1995. The average portfolio yield
decreased from 25.4 in 1994 to 24.0 in 1995. This decrease was primarily
attributable to increased penetration in 1995 in states which have laws which
limit the maximum amount of finance charges, fees, premiums and other charges
that can be charged.

 Interest expense increased 2.4 million from 1.6 million in 1994 to
 4.0 million in 1995. The increase in interest expense resulted from an
increase in borrowings under the Credit Facility and an increase in the average
interest rate paid on borrowed funds. Average indebtedness in 1995 increased
 16.4 million, or 88.9 , from 18.5 million in 1994 to 34.9 million in 1995.
The average cost of borrowed funds was 8.5 and 11.6 in 1994 and 1995,
respectively. The increase in the average cost of borrowed funds was due
primarily to the replacement of subordinated debt at a higher interest rate and
the issuance of new subordinated debt. In December 1994, the Company replaced
 4 million in subordinated debt bearing interest at 6 with a 4 million
subordinated note bearing interest at 13.5 . Additionally, in September 1995,
the Company issued a new subordinated note for 4.5 million bearing interest at
13 , the proceeds of which were used to pay down borrowings under the Credit
Facility. See"---Liquidity and Capital Resources." In addition to the
increase in the interest rate on the subordinated debt, the Company is
amortizing both the fees associated with the debt and the discount related to
the detachable warrants attached to the debt. Net interest income increased
 2.0 million, or 54.5 , from 3.6 million in 1994 to 5.6 million in 1995.

 The net interest margin on the Owned Portfolio decreased from 18.1 in
1994 to 14.0 in 1995, primarily due to the higher cost of borrowed funds and
lower average portfolio yield as discussed above.

Other Income

 Other income increased 2.9 million, or 134.8 , from 2.1 million in
1994 to 5.0 million in 1995. The increase in other income was primarily due
to increases in servicing income and income from the sale of ancillary
products.

 Servicing income increased 1.8 million, or 130.8 , from 1.3 million
in 1994 to 3.1 million in 1995. The increase in servicing income was due to
the sale of 27.5 million in installment contracts in 1995.

 Income from insurance commissions increased 792,000, or 144.2 , from
 550,000 in 1994 to 3.1 million in 1995. The increase was attributable to the
increased sales of insurance products in connection with the increase in the
volume of installment contracts purchased.

Operating Expenses

 Operating expenses increased 3.1 million, or 60.4 , from 5.1 million
in 1994 to 8.2 million in 1995. The increase in operating expenses was due to
increases in salaries and employee benefits, rent and other expenses relating
to the opening of new branch offices in 1995, as well as the addition of
administrative personnel at the Evanston, Illinois and Enterprise, Alabama
offices. Salaries and employee benefits increased 1.9 million, or 59.5 , from
 3.2 million in 1994 to 5.1 million in 1995. Although operating expenses
increased in 1995, as

23
 24

compared to 1994, the Total Portfolio grew at a faster rate than the rate of
increase in operating expenses. As a result, operating expense as a percentage
of the average Total Portfolio decreased from 17.8 in 1994 to 13.8 in 1995.

Net Income

 Net income increased 1.7 million, or 259.1 , from 661,000 in 1994 to
 2.4 million in 1995. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to
the growth in the Total Portfolio and related factors as discussed above.

CREDIT LOSS EXPERIENCE

 The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level
management believes adequate to absorb potential losses in the Owned Portfolio.
The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is evaluated by management on
an ongoing basis through historical credit loss experience, delinquencies, the
value of the underlying collateral, the level of the finance contract portfolio
and general economic conditions and trends. An account is charged off against
the allowance for credit losses at the earliest of the time the account's
collateral is repossessed, the account is 150 days or more past due or the
account is otherwise deemed to be uncollectible.

 The Total Portfolio is grouped into pools on a chronological basis
(quarterly beginning in 1995) for purposes of evaluating trends and loss
experience on a more detailed basis ("static pools"). If management determines
that the allowance for credit losses is not adequate to provide for potential
losses of an individual pool, amounts will be transferred, to the extent
available, from the unamortized contract acquisition discounts for that pool to
the allowance for credit losses. Any remaining shortfall in the allowance for
credit losses for an individual pool would be provided through a charge against
income. If management determines that the allowance for credit losses is in
excess of amounts required to provide for losses of an individual pool, the
allowance for credit losses charged to income, if any, will be reduced or the
contract acquisition discounts will be amortized over the remaining life of the
contracts in the pool.

 Based upon historical analysis and expected future trends, management
changed the allocation of the non-refundable contract acquisition discount to
the allowance for credit losses, such that all non-refundable contract
acquisition discount was allocated entirely to the allowance for credit losses
after 1994. Additionally, after reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for
credit losses, the remaining balance of the unamortized contract acquisition
discount was transferred to the allowance for credit losses on August 1, 1995.
For the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company increased its allowance for
credit losses by 4.0 million through a charge against income based upon
continued historical analysis, particularly evaluation of the earliest static
pools. Management will continue to monitor this allocation and may, if
appropriate, in the future allocate portions of the non-refundable acquisition
discount to unamortized contract acquisition discount.

 The following table sets forth the cumulative net charge offs as a
percentage of the original pool balance based on the quarter of origination and

REPOSSESSED COLLATERAL

 The Company commences repossession procedures against the underlying
collateral when it determines that collection efforts are likely to be
unsuccessful. Repossession generally occurs after a customer has missed two
consecutive monthly payments. In such cases, the net amount due under the
installment contract is reduced to the estimated fair value of the collateral,
less estimated costs of disposition, through a charge to the allowance for
credit losses. Repossessed collateral is valued at the lower of cost or
market, which on average was approximately 60 of the net balance of the
contract at the time of repossession for repossessions made through December
31, 1996. Repossessed inventory was valued at 543,000 and 930,000 at
December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 The Company has funded its operations, branch office openings and the
growth of the Total Portfolio through six principal sources of funds: (i)
payments received under installment contracts, (ii) borrowings under the
Credit Facility, (iii) proceeds from the issuance of subordinated notes, (iv)
proceeds from the sale of installment contracts, (v) proceeds from the
issuance of common stock in connection with the initial public offering, (vi)
proceeds from an asset securitization transaction and (vii) proceeds from the
liquidation of timeshares receivables.

 Net cash flows provided by operating activities were 1.1 million,
 3.9 million and 1.1 million in 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.

 The Company's cash flows used in investing activities since inception
have been used primarily for the purchase of installment contracts. Cash used
for the purchase of installment contracts was 35.1 million, 70.2 million and
 120.2 million for 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively. Capital expenditures
were 543,000, 521,000 and 739,000 for 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.
Cash used in investing activities was offset by (i) the collection of principal
on installment contracts of 11.4 million, 22.0 million and 31.6 million in
1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively; (ii) net proceeds of 24.8 million and
 31.7 million from the sales of installment contracts in 1995 and 1996,
respectively; and (iii) proceeds from the liquidation of timeshare receivables
of 4.1 million and 266,000 in 1994 and 1995, respectively.

 Cash was provided by financing activities, primarily from net
borrowings under the Credit Facility, the securitization of installment
contracts, an initial public offering of the Company's common stock and the
issuance of subordinated debt. Net borrowings under the Credit Facility were
 19.7 million, 17.6 million and 17.9 million in 1994, 1995 and 1996,
respectively. In addition, cash was provided through the securitization of
installment contracts in the amount of 45.1 million in 1996, the proceeds of
which were used to reduce the borrowings under the Credit Facility. Further,
 11.2 million in cash was raised in 1996 through the initial public offering of
the Company's common stock, the net proceeds of which were used to repay 8.5
million of subordinated debt, with the balance reducing amounts outstanding on
the Credit Facility. In addition, cash was provided in 1995 through borrowings
on a subordinated basis in the amount of 4.5 million. Offsetting cash
provided from financing activities were dividends paid of 474,000, 1.5
million and 2.1 million in 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.

 28

As of the date hereof, the Company has a 85 million Credit Facility
with a group of seven banks, for which LaSalle National Bank acts as agent, and
which expires June 1, 1998. The Credit Facility is collateralized by a lien on
all the Company assets not subjected to the securitized pool. Interest is
payable at the agent bank's reference rate plus .25 (8.50 at December 31,
1996) and the Company has a option of 2.50 over the LIBOR rate. Borrowings
outstanding under the Credit Facility were 61.2 million at December 31, 1996.
The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain minimum capital funds (as
defined) of 11.5 million. The Credit Facility also requires that total loss
reserves be maintained at not less than 8 of net installment contracts
receivable and no more than 3 of net installment contracts receivable may be
more than 60 days past due. The Credit Facility also requires that earnings
before interest and taxes to cash interest expense may not be less than 125 
and the ratio of unsubordinated debt to tangible net worth plus subordinated
debt cannot exceed 5 to 1. At December 31, 1996, the Company was in compliance
with all of these covenants.

 The Company issued a senior and a junior subordinated note in 1990.
Each note had a face value of 5.0 million, carried an interest rate of 6 and
was unsecured. The Company granted warrants to the junior subordinated note
holder allowing for the purchase of 51 of the Common Stock of the Company. The
senior subordinated note was paid off in 1993. In December 1994, the junior
subordinated note was paid off and the remaining warrants were surrendered to
the Company.

 In December 1994, in order to refinance the junior subordinated note,
the Company issued a subordinated note in the amount of 4.0 million to Michael
P. Harrington, its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Under the
terms of such note, interest was payable at the end of each quarter at a fixed
rate of 13.5 and was due on September 30, 1996. The proceeds were used to
retire the remaining principal balance on the junior subordinated note.
Simultaneously, Mr. Harrington issued a 4.0 million note to LaSalle secured by
capital stock in the Company owned by Mr. Harrington. Under the terms of the
note issued to LaSalle, interest was payable at the end of each quarter at a
fixed rate of 13.5 and was due on September 30, 1996. In connection with this
note issuance, the Company issued to LaSalle a detachable warrant to purchase
193,320 shares of Common Stock. The warrant was exercised by LaSalle at a
price of 1.13 per share in connection with the initial public offering of the
Company's common stock in July 1996.

 On September 21, 1995, the Company issued a subordinated note in the
amount of 4.5 million to Banc One Capital Partners V, Ltd. ("Banc One").
Under the terms of the agreement, interest was payable monthly at a fixed rate
of 13 . The note was due on August 31, 1998. In connection with the issuance of
the Banc One note, a detachable warrant to purchase 193,320 shares of Common
Stock was issued to Banc One. The warrant was exercised at a price of 1.56 per
share in connection with the initial public offering of the Company's common
stock in July 1996.

 The company sold a total of 74.8 million of installment contracts -
 12.1 million in 1993, 27.5 million in 1995 and 35.2 million under various
asset purchase agreements and servicing agreements. Pursuant to these
servicing agreements, the Company retains the servicing rights on the
installment contracts sold and receives servicing fees. At December 31, 1996
the outstanding balance of installment contracts sold and serviced by the
Company was 30.9 million, and such installment contracts were sold to yield
the purchasers, including GECC, a range of 8.9 to 11.0 per annum. See Notes
to Financial Statements.

 In order to meet its 1997 funding needs, the Company will require
additional financing to supplement its expected cash flows from operations and,
the anticipated borrowings under its Credit Facility. The Company has entered
into a securitization facility with a placement agent for the issuance of up to
 200 million of securitized notes through one or more wholly-owned special
purpose subsidiaries. Initially, on June 18, 1996, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company sold approximately 45.1 million of 6.84 fixed rate Securitized
Notes in an asset securitization transaction (the "Securitization"). The
Securitized Notes were secured by installment contracts and the payments under
the Securitized Notes are guaranteed pursuant to a financial guaranty insurance
policy issued by Financial Security Assurance Inc. The net proceeds of the
Securitization to the Company were used to reduce the outstanding balance
under the Credit Facility. The debt incurred in the Securitization is
reflected on the balance sheet of the Company and did not result in a gain on
sale. The Company has not entered into any agreements with

28
 29

the purchasers of the Securitized Notes in excess of the 45.1 million of the
Securitized Notes sold and there can be no assurance that any such additional
sales will occur. The Company presently intends to finance additional 1997
funding needs through borrowings under the Credit Facility and securitization
transactions.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

 Although the Company does not believe that inflation directly has a
material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations,
increases in the inflation rate generally are associated with increased
interest rates. Because the Company borrows funds on a floating rate basis and
purchases installment contracts bearing fixed rates, increased costs of
borrowed funds could have a material adverse impact on the Company's
profitability. Inflation also can affect the Company's operating expenses.

IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

 The Company believes that the provisions of certain Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") which have not been implemented by the
Company either do not apply to the Company or would not affect the Company's
financial position, results of operations, or disclosures relating thereto.
These statements include SFAS No. 106 "Employer's Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other than Pensions" and SFAS No. 121 "Accounting for the Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of."

 The Company intends to continue to apply the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" in
accounting for stock-based compensation. The Company will provide pro forma
net income and net income per share disclosures as if the fair value based
accounting method in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" had been used to account for
stock-based compensation.

 The Company will adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
125 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishment of Liabilities" effective January 1, 1997. As a result, for all
securitization transactions completed after this date and meeting the specific
criteria of SFAS 125, the company will remove the securitized assets and
related liabilities from its balance sheet and recognize applicable servicing
assets.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1995 AND 1994

NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF THE BUSINESS

First Enterprise Financial Group, Inc., which operates under the name First
Enterprise Acceptance Company, including its wholly-owned special purpose
subsidiary, First Enterprise Securitization Corp. (collectively, the
"Company"), is a specialty finance company engaged primarily in purchasing and
servicing installment sales contracts originated by automobile dealers for
financing the sale of used automobiles, vans and light trucks.

The accounting policies of the Company conform to generally accepted accounting
principles and to the general practice within the automobile finance company
industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include accounts of First Enterprise
Financial Group, Inc. and its wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, First
Enterprise Securitization Corp. All significant intercompany accounts have
been eliminated in consolidation.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

In connection with the initial public offering ("IPO") of common stock, the
Company performed a comprehensive evaluation of its accounting policies. As a
result of this review and in accordance with the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 20, "Accounting Changes," the Company has
retroactively adopted an accounting change which the Company believes is more
consistent with prevailing industry practices regarding non-refundable contract
acquisition discounts. Non-refundable contract acquisition discounts arise
from the purchase of installment contracts from dealers at amounts less than
the principal amounts of such contracts. These discounts are allocated to the
allowance for credit losses in an amount necessary to absorb estimated credit
losses with the remaining amount, if any, allocated to unamortized contract
acquisition discounts and accreted into finance charge income over the
estimated average life of the installment contracts.

NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company's installment contract receivables are primarily with individuals
located in the southeastern United States. As of December 31, 1996,
approximately 26.8 and 21.2 of automobile finance receivables were purchased
from dealers located in Florida and Alabama, respectively.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Finance charges on automobile installment contracts are credited to unearned
finance charges at the time the contracts are acquired. The finance charges
are recognized over the life of the installment contracts using the interest
(actuarial) method to produce constant rates of interest (yields).

If an installment contract becomes 90 or more days contractually delinquent and
no full contractual payment is received in the month the account reaches such
delinquency status, the accrual of income is suspended until one or more full
contractual monthly payments are received. Late charges, deferment fees and
extension fees are recognized as income when collected.

The Company, as agent for unaffiliated insurers, offers credit life and
accident and health insurance to borrowers under financing contracts purchased
from automobile dealers. Commissions earned on these insurance products are
recognized as income over the average terms of the related policies using the
sum-of-the-months'-digits method, which approximates the results under the
interest method.

SERVICING INCOME

Contractual servicing income on sold receivables is recognized over the life of
the related receivables as a percentage of receivables outstanding. Bonus
servicing fees are recognized when earned and are based on the difference
between the yield received by the Company and the sum of the Company's 3 
contractual servicing fee, the yield due to the purchaser and the addition or
reduction necessary to maintain the purchaser's reserve at the required level.
Gain or loss on sale of finance receivables is determined by the difference
between sales proceeds and the cost of the finance receivables and adjusted for
the present value of the difference, if any, between the estimated future
servicing revenues (net of a fixed rate to the purchaser) and normal servicing
costs ("excess servicing rights"). The excess servicing rights, if any, are
capitalized and amortized over the expected repayment life of the sold finance
receivables. All servicing fees earned by the Company are recognized in the
Company's financial statements as servicing income.

NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED

NON-REFUNDABLE CONTRACT ACQUISITION DISCOUNTS

Installment contracts are generally purchased from dealers at a discount from
the principal amounts financed by the consumer and are non-refundable to the
dealers ("non-refundable contract acquisition discount"). This discount, which
represents both a credit allowance and a yield enhancement, is negotiated by
the Company and the dealers. The portfolio of owned and sold installment
contracts is grouped into pools on a chronological basis (quarterly beginning
in 1995) for purposes of evaluating the non-refundable contract acquisition
discount. The portion of the non-refundable contract acquisition discount
necessary to absorb estimated credit losses for each pool is allocated to the
allowance for credit losses. The remaining portion of the contract acquisition
discount ("unamortized contract acquisition discount") for each pool, if any,
is reflected as a reduction of the net principal balance and accreted into
finance charge income over the estimated average life of the installment
contracts using the sum-of-the-months'-digits method, which approximates the
results under the interest method. Beginning in 1995, the full discount has
been allocated to the allowance for credit losses and the discount is no longer
being amortized to interest income.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The allowance for credit losses is established through an allocation of the
non-refundable contract acquisition discount based upon amounts necessary to
absorb credit losses in the installment contract portfolio, as previously
discussed. The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is evaluated by
management on an ongoing basis through historical credit loss experience,
delinquencies, the value of the underlying collateral, the level of the
installment contract portfolio and general economic conditions and trends. The
Company has found that borrowers under its installment contract receivables are
payment sensitive rather than interest rate sensitive. Consequently, the
Company does not consider interest rates a predominant risk characteristic for
purposes of evaluating credit losses. The portfolio of owned and sold loans is
grouped into pools on a chronological basis (quarterly beginning in 1995) for
purposes of evaluating trends and loss experience. If management determines
that the allowance for credit losses is not adequate to provide for potential
losses of an individual pool, amounts will be transferred, to the extent
available, from the unamortized contract acquisition discounts for that pool to
the allowance for credit losses. Any remaining shortfall in the allowance for
credit losses would be provided through a charge against income. If management
determines that the allowance for credit losses is in excess of amounts
required to provide for losses of an individual pool, the allowance for credit
losses charged to income, if any, will be reduced or the contract acquisition
discounts will be amortized over the remaining life of the installment
contracts in the pool.

An account is charged off against the allowance for credit losses at the
earliest of the time the account's collateral is repossessed, the account is
150 days or more past due or the account is otherwise deemed to be
uncollectible.

RESTRICTED CASH

The Company is required to establish and maintain cash reserves and collection
accounts with a trustee with respect to the securitized pool of funding
receivables. These balances are reported as restricted cash on the Company's
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

REPOSSESSED ASSETS

Repossessed collateral is valued at the lower of cost or market value.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of
depreciable assets to operations over their estimated lives, generally ranging
from five to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives
of the respective leases or the service lives of the improvements, whichever is
shorter. The straight-line method of depreciation and amortization is followed
for all assets for financial reporting purposes, and accelerated methods are
used for income tax purposes.

INCOME TAXES

Since its inception, the Company was an S Corporation under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a result, the income of the Company has
been taxed, for federal and certain state and local income tax purposes,
directly to the Company's stockholders, rather than the Company. The Company
terminated its status as an S Corporation effective January 1, 1996 and, as
result, the Company is subject to federal and state corporate income taxation.

Effective January 1, 1996, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes."
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected
to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and
liabilities is recognized in the period in which the enactment in effective.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company's financial instruments include cash, finance receivables and debt.
The estimated fair value of finance receivables approximates their carrying
value due to the duration of the receivables as well as the interest rates
negotiated. Estimated fair value of finance receivables is based upon the
average contractual lives of the receivables less expected prepayments and
estimated interest rates on similar receivables. The estimated fair value of
the senior debt with floating interest rates approximates its carrying value.
The fair value of the subordinated debt and the notes payable - securitized
pools obligations approximates their carrying value based upon current quoted
market prices.

NET INCOME PER SHARE

Net income per share amounts are calculated based on pro forma net income
divided by the pro forma weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period after consideration of the dilutive effect of
common stock equivalents.

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND REORGANIZATION

On July 22, 1996, the Company completed a public offering of 1,500,000 shares
of its common stock at a price of 7.00 per share pursuant to a Form S-1
Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as originally filed on
February 1, 1996 and subsequently amended. The underwriters exercised their
over-allotment option and purchased an additional 282,996 shares of common
stock at a price of 7.00 per share on August 20, 1996. The Company received
 10,665,167 from the Common Stock Offering, after deducting the underwriting
discount and offering expenses. The proceeds were used to fund purchases of
finance contracts and, prior to such use, the proceeds were used to reduce
borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility.

In connection with its IPO, the Company increased its authorized capital stock
to 20,000,000 shares of common stock, par value .01 per share through a
reincorporation. Existing Class A common stock and Class B common stock were
exchanged for 1,288.8 shares of common stock and Class B common stock,
respectively, and all options and warrants were converted at the same exchange
rate. The Company's stock, Class B common stock was also exchanged for common
stock on a share for share basis. The outstanding warrants were exercised and
sold in the IPO. The Company sold 1,500,000 shares of the common stock and the
underwriters exercised a 30-day option to purchase an additional 282,996 shares
to cover over-allotments.

IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Effective January 1, 1997, the Company will adopt SFAS No. 125 "Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities."
As a result, for all securitization transactions completed after this date and
meeting the specific criteria of SFAS No. 125, the Company will remove the
securitized assets and related liabilities from its balance sheet and recognize
applicable servicing assets.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1995 and 1994 financial
statements to conform to the 1996 presentation. These reclassifications did
not affect the results of operations.

Automobile finance receivables are accounted for on a discount basis and
generally have terms of 24 to 36 months, with a maximum term of 54 months.
Contractual maturities on the finance receivables by year are not readily
available as of December 31, 1996, but the Company's experience has shown that
such information is not significant in that receivables may be paid in full
prior to contractual maturity. Principal collections on finance receivables
were 31,595,756 and 21,970,934 for the years ended December 31, 1996 and
1995, respectively. The principal cash collections as a percentage of the
average receivable balance, net of unearned finance charges, were 39.8 and
54.7 for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

The Company sold 12.1 million, 10.8 million, 2.6 million, 9.1 million,
 15.7 million and 9.7 million of automobile finance receivables under a 40
million Asset Purchase Agreement and Servicing Agreement on December 10, 1993,
February 24, 1995, June 7, 1995, June 29, 1995, January 30, 1996, and March 8,
1996, respectively. The purchaser is entitled to earn a fixed rate (9.5 ,
11.0 , 9.8 , 9.8 , 8.9 and 9.0 , respectively). In addition, on May 22, 1995
and April 22, 1996, the Company sold 5 million and 9.8 million of receivables
under another Asset Purchase Agreement and Servicing Agreement, entitling the
purchaser to earn a fixed rate of 10.3 and 9.8 , respectively. Ten percent of
the purchase price of each sale is being retained by the purchaser as a reserve
for potential losses. Gains of 524,000 were recorded on the sales
transactions occurring in 1996. The gains were determined by the difference
between the sales proceeds and the cost of the finance receivables and adjusted
for the present value of the difference between the estimated future servicing
revenues (net of a fixed rate to the purchaser) and normal servicing costs
("excess servicing rights"). The excess servicing rights have been capitalized
and are being amortized over the expected repayment
life of the sold finance receivables. The unamortized balance of excess
servicing rights at December 31, 1996 was 323,276.

Under the terms of all the above agreements, the Company retains the servicing
rights for the sold receivables and receives a contractual annualized servicing
fee equal to 3 of the net outstanding receivables from the purchaser. The
outstanding balance of all receivables sold and serviced by the Company totaled
 30,918,651 and 20,765,687 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Contractual servicing income amounted to 956,026, 573,812 and 269,998 for
the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The Company is
eligible to receive additional bonus servicing fees based upon portfolio
performance. The bonus servicing fees represent the difference between the
yield received by the Company and the sum of the Company's 3 contractual
servicing fee, the yield retained by the purchaser and the addition or
reduction necessary to maintain the purchaser's reserve at the required level.
Bonus servicing fees amounted to approximately 4,008,000, 2,478,000 and
 1,053,000 for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

NOTE D - SENIOR DEBT AND SUBORDINATED DEBT - CONTINUED

SENIOR DEBT

The Company has established a Credit Facility. This facility is renewable
annually and expires June 1, 1998. To fund this facility, the Company has
entered into an agreement that permits the Company to borrow up to 85,000,000.
The agreement requires the Company to execute a collateral and security
agreement to secure payment in full of the principal and interest on all
indebtedness owed to the participants.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility are collateralized by all finance
receivables not subject to the securitized pool and certain other assets. The
agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants which
include, among others, ratio of debt to net worth and ratio of reserves to the
finance receivable portfolio. The Company was in compliance with all financial
covenants at December 31, 1996 and 1995.

SUBORDINATED DEBT

In December 1994, the Company issued a subordinated note in the amount of
 4,000,000 to its principal shareholder. Under the terms of the agreement,
interest was payable at the end of each quarter at a fixed rate of 13.5 . The
note was unsecured and was due on September 30, 1996. The proceeds were used
to retire a junior subordinated note. Simultaneously, the Company's principal
shareholder issued a 4,000,000 secured note to a financial institution. Under
the terms of the agreement, interest was payable at the end of each quarter at
a fixed rate of 13.5 and was due on September 30, 1996. The Company issued to
the financial institution a detachable warrant to purchase 193,320 shares of
non-voting Class B common stock. The warrant was exercisable in whole or in
part at a price of 1.13 per share and expires on September 1, 1999, or earlier
as defined in the warrant. The warrant contained a put option such that after
the payment of the secured note but before the occurrence of other events
defined in the warrant, the financial institution may require the Company to
purchase the warrant from the financial institution at fair value. The put
option was terminated, under the terms of the warrant, upon the issuance of the
Company's stock in the IPO. Additionally, the warrant contained a call option
such that the Company, after September 30, 1997 but before the expiration date
or the occurrence of other events as defined in the warrant, may require the
financial institution to sell the warrant to the Company. Upon issuance, the
 150,000 fair value of the warrant was recorded as a discount against the
Company's subordinated note, which was amortized as interest expense. The
warrant was adjusted on a quarterly basis to the estimated repurchase value
through an adjustment to retained earnings.

NOTE D - SENIOR DEBT AND SUBORDINATED DEBT - CONTINUED

On September 21, 1995, the Company issued a subordinated note in the amount of
 4,500,000 to an investment partnership. Under the terms of the agreement,
interest was payable monthly at a fixed rate of 13 . The note was unsecured
and was due on August 31, 1998. The note contained a detachable warrant to
purchase 193,320 shares of non-voting Class B common stock. The warrant was
exercisable in whole or in part at a price of 1.56 per share and the warrant
expires on September 1, 2000, or earlier as defined in the warrant. The
warrant contained a put option such that after the earlier of August 31, 1998
or the payment of the subordinated debt, but before the occurrence of other
events defined in the warrant, the investment partnership may require the
Company to purchase the warrant from the investment partnership at fair value.
The put option was terminated, under the terms of the warrant, upon the
issuance of the Company's stock in the IPO. Additionally, the warrant
contained a call option such that the Company, after September 1, 1998 but
before the expiration date or the occurrence of other as defined in the
warrant, may require the investment partnership to sell the warrant to the
Company. Upon issuance, the 92,063 fair value of the warrant was recorded as
a discount against the subordinated note, which was amortized as interest
expense as an adjustment to yield over the term of the note. The warrant was
adjusted on a quarterly basis to the estimated repurchase value through an
adjustment to retained earnings.

On July 22, 1996, the Company completed its initial public offering of common
stock. The proceeds from the offering were used to retire the subordinated
notes. As a result of the early retirement of the subordinated notes, the
Company recognized an extraordinary charge against earnings of 149,789 arising
from the accelerated recognition of certain fees and the recognition of the
remaining unamortized discount on the notes.

NOTE E - NOTES PAYABLE - SECURITIZED POOL

The Company has entered into a securitized facility with a placement agent for
the issuance of up to 200 million of securitized notes through a wholly-owned
special purpose subsidiary. On June 18, 1996, the Company completed a
 45,087,652 million debt financing consisting of 6.84 fixed rate, unregistered,
automobile securitized notes issued by the Company's wholly-owned special
purpose subsidiary. The proceeds received by the Company were used to repay
indebtedness under the Credit Facility. Principal and interest on the notes are
payable monthly from collections and recoveries on the pool of finance
receivables. Financial Security Assurance Inc. ("FSA") issued a financial
guaranty insurance policy for the benefit of the noteholders. Interest expense,
including the amortization of debt issuance costs, was 1,702,380 for 1996.

NOTE E - NOTES PAYABLE - SECURITIZED POOL - CONTINUED

The Company is required to establish and maintain cash reserve and collection
accounts with a trustee with respect to the securitized pool of finance
receivables ("restricted cash"). The amounts set aside would be used to
supplement certain shortfalls in payments, if any, to investors. These
balances are subject to an increase up to a maximum amount as specified in the
securitization indenture and are invested in certain instruments as permitted
by the trust agreement. To the extent balances on deposit exceed specified
levels, distributions are made to the Company and, at the termination of the
transaction, any remaining amounts on deposit are distributed to the Company.
The indenture requires the Company to maintain specified delinquency and credit
loss ratios. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at December
31, 1996.

NOTE F- INCOME TAXES

The Company terminated its status as an S Corporation effective January 1, 1996
and is subject to federal and state income taxes at the approximate tax rates.
As of the date of the termination, the Company has recognized, under the
provisions of SFAS No. 109, a deferred tax asset of 267,000 representing the
cumulative temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis
of its assets and liabilities.

The components of the income tax provisions for the year ended December 31,
1996 was as follows:

Current:
 Federal ........................ 3,263,000
 State .......................... 673,000

NOTE F - INCOME TAXES - CONTINUED

The provision for income taxes for the years ended 1994 and 1995 reflect the
Company's state tax expense as an S Corporation. There is no federal tax
expense for 1994 and 1995 when the Company filed as an S Corporation for
federal tax purposes.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following at December 31,
1996:

Deferred tax assets:
 Income accreted for tax not book .. 4,837,000
 Provision for credit losses ....... 1,540,000
 ----------

 Total deferred tax assets ......... 6,377,000

 ----------

 Total deferred tax liabilities .... 4,136,000
 ----------

 Net deferred tax assets ........ 2,241,000
 ==========

There was no valuation allowance for deferred taxes as of December 31, 1996 due
to the Company's ability to recover previously paid taxes through carrybacks
and future taxable income.

The income taxes provided differed from the federal statutory income tax rate
(34 for the year ended December 31, 1996 as follows:

Statutory federal income tax .................... 1,675,600 34.0 
 State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit .. 256,400 5.2
 Non-deductible expenses ......................... 30,000 .6
 ---------- -----

 Total ...................................... 1,962,000 39.8 
 ========== =====

In connection with certain subordinated debt financing arrangements, the
Company granted lenders warrants to acquire stock of the Company at certain
prices. These warrants were exercised by the lenders in 1996. The exercise of
these warrants results in a current tax benefit for the Company, equivalent to
the applicable tax rate multiplied by the difference between the market price
at the date of exercise and the warrant price. The current tax benefit was not
recognized as a reduction of income tax expense, but was credited directly to
additional paid-in capital. Tax benefits of 750,000 associated with the
exercise of the warrants were credited to additional paid-in capital in 1996.

NOTE F - INCOME TAXES - CONTINUED

In connection with the termination of its S Corporation status, the Company
distributed 2,069,812 to the S Corporation shareholders ("S Shareholders").
The distribution represents the
S Corporation earnings that have been included in the taxable income of the S
Shareholders. The Company and the S Shareholders have entered into an
indemnification agreement, relating to federal and certain state and local
income tax liabilities of the Company and the S Shareholders, for the tax years
during which the Company had elected to be treated as an S Corporation. This
agreement generally provides that the Company will indemnify the S
Shareholders, and the S Shareholders will indemnify the Company, against any
increase in the indemnified party's income tax benefits or liabilities
(including interest and penalties and all expenses, attorneys' fees and
accountants' fees incurred in connection therewith) as a result of any
adjustment associated with a return filed with respect to a period during which
the Company was an S Corporation. Payments under the agreement in favor of the
S Shareholders must be approved by a majority of the Company's independent
Directors as being consistent with the terms of the agreement.

NOTE G - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

OFFICE LEASES

The Company leases various office facilities under operating leases with
initial terms ranging from three to five years. These leases generally require
the Company to reimburse the landlord for certain common area expenses, such as
real estate taxes and maintenance; such expenses are included in rent expense.
Total minimum rentals under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31,
1996 are as follows:

Years ending December 31,
1997 .................... 645,388
1998 .................... 513,864
1999 .................... 302,180
2000 .................... 126,095
2001 .................... 86,074
Thereafter .............. 64,800

In the normal course of business, it is expected that office leases will expire
and be renewed or replaced with leases for other locations. Rent expense for
the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 was 530,088, 355,420 and
 212,310, respectively.

DATA PROCESSING AGREEMENT

The Company entered into a five year contract for data processing services in
December 1994. The contract, which expires December 1999, is payable monthly.
The fees are based upon servicing volume.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

The Company has entered into employment contracts with six of its officers.
Two of the agreements expire on August 31, 1997, and three of the agreements
expire December 31, 1999. The agreements are automatically renewable for
successive one year periods and are subject to termination by the Company or
the officers.

The agreements provide for minimum annual salaries and annual incentive
compensation awards. The agreements allow the Company to apply for, and take
out, in its own name and as beneficiary, and at its own expense, life, health,
accident or other insurance or annuity contracts on the officers. In the event
of illness or incapacity of an officer, they are entitled to continue to
receive their regular compensation for a period of 180 days. The Company has
obtained long-term disability insurance which compensates them for the period
of such illness or incapacity in excess of 180 days.

GUARANTEED LOANS TO STOCKHOLDERS

The Company guaranteed loans made by a financial institution to certain
stockholders, the proceeds of which were used to exercise stock options. Upon
completion of the Company's initial public offering on July 22, 1996, the
Company was released from the guarantee and accordingly the loans are not
reflected on the Company's balance sheet at December 31, 1996. The guaranteed
loans are included in Other Liabilities and are treated as a reduction of
Stockholders' Equity on the balance sheet at December 31, 1995.

NOTE H - STOCK OPTION PLANS

The Company has established an Incentive Stock Option Plan and a Non-Qualified
Stock Option Plan. As amended, these plans reserve 2,062,080 shares of common
stock for issuance to key employees. Options may be granted at a price no less
than the fair market value of such shares on the date on which such options are
granted, and expire ten years from the date of grant. The options generally
vest over a three year period.

NOTE H - STOCK OPTION PLANS - CONTINUED

The Company has also established a Non-Qualified Director Stock Option Plan
(the "Director Plan") which grants options to purchase shares of common stock
to non-employee directors of the Company. The Director Plan allows for the
grant of options to acquire up to 100,000 shares of common stock. Under this
plan, 6,000 options are granted upon the date of their first election to the
Board of Directors and 2,000 options are granted annually thereafter, upon each
re-election, at a price per share equal to the fair market value of such stock.
Generally, the options expire ten years from the date granted; however, under
certain circumstances, the options may expire earlier. The options vest
ratably over a three year period.

The Company has adopted only the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." It applies APB Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in
accounting for its plans and does not recognize compensation expense for its
stock-based compensation plans. If the Company had elected to recognize
compensation expense based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards
issued after January 1, 1995, under this plan consistent with the methodology
prescribed by SFAS No. 123, the Company's net income and net income per share
would be reduced to the amounts indicated below:

1996 1995
 ---------- ----------
 
 Net income (in thousands)
 As reported .................................... 3,083,559 2,373,752
 Fair value method under SFAS No. 123 ........... 3,047,147 2,366,778

 Net income per common and common equivalent share
 As reported .................................... .63 .42
 Fair value method under SFAS No. 123 ........... .62 .42

The fair value amounts may not be representative of future disclosures because
they do not take into effect fair value compensation expense related to grants
made before 1995. The fair value of options granted in 1996 and 1995 was
estimated at the date of grant using an option-pricing model at 3.85 and .75
per option, respectively, with the following weighted-average assumptions:

1996 1995

NOTE I - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has a 401(k) plan covering substantially all employees who have
worked over 90 calendar days during which they were credited with 250 hours of
service. Employees may elect to make a salary reduction contribution in any
percentage permitted by the plan administrator up to a maximum of 15 of their
compensation or up to the maximum amount permitted by tax law per calendar
year. The Company makes matching contributions in an amount equal to 50 of
employee pretax contributions but subject to a maximum of 6 of eligible
compensation contributed to the plan.

Participants are 100 vested in employee contributions. Participants are
partially vested in their employer contributions until their sixth year of
employment when they become 100 vested. Total contributions to the plan for
the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 were 164,917 and 47,062,
respectively.

The Company has also established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Stock
Purchase Plan") which gives eligible employees the opportunity to purchase
common stock at 85 of the fair market value at the beginning of the option
period. (The option period began July 22, 1996 and ends on December 31, 1997
and each calendar year thereafter.) This plan is intended to qualify as an
"Employee Stock Purchase Plan" under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended. A maximum of 100,000 shares of common stock are reserved
for sale under the Stock Purchase Plan. Eligible employees may elect to
contribute on an after-tax payroll deduction basis up to 10 of their base
salary. These contributions are used to purchase the common stock at the end
of the option period. Eligible employees may purchase a maximum of 500 shares
for each calendar year in which the option to purchase such shares is
outstanding.

NOTE J - LITIGATION

The Company is involved from time to time in ordinary routine litigation
incidental to its business. The litigation is generally based upon claims that
certain of the Company's business practices such as acquiring installment
contracts at a discount, force placing insurance and offering other insurance
products violate laws, including the Alabama Consumer Credit Act, the Alabama
Deceptive Practices Act and the Federal Truth in Lending Act. Management
believes that the ultimate outcome of all pending litigation will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of
operations. The Company intends to vigorously defend any such actions.

Agreement, to make loans to the Borrowers (collectively called the "Revolving
Loans" and individually each a "Revolving Loan") on any Banking Day, which
Revolving Loans the Borrowers may repay and re-borrow during the period from
the date hereof, to, but not including, the Maturity Date, in such amounts as
FEFG may from time to time request, subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 2.2 hereof; provided, however, that the

-13-
 14

aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans made under this Section 2.1
shall not exceed, at any one time, the lowest of (i) the Revolving Loan
Borrowing Base, (ii) 85,000,000 or (iii) such fixed dollar amount as is (in
the aggregate) committed by the Banks executing this Agreement from time to
time if such amount is less than 85,000,000 (such lowest sum being the
"Revolving Loan Commitment"); notwithstanding the forgoing, if no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing on each anniversary of the date
hereof, the Banks shall be under no commitment to extend such Maturity Date,
but each Bank agrees to inform the Borrowers on such anniversary date whether
it intends to extend the Maturity Date for an additional one-year period. If,
at any time the outstanding Revolving Loans exceed the Revolving Loan
Commitment, the Borrowers will immediately notify the Agent of such excess and
pay the Banks the amount thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no Bank shall be obligated to advance any funds under this
Section 2.1 which funds exceed the amount determined by multiplying such Bank's
Percentage Interest by the Revolving Loan Commitment.

 2.2 Borrowing Procedure. FEFG shall give telephonic
notice (promptly confirmed in writing) to the Agent of each proposed borrowing;
provided, however, the borrowing procedure set forth in this Section 2.2 may be
modified by any other method as reasonably agreed on by Agent and Borrowers.
Such notice shall designate the amount of the requested Revolving Loan to be
made by the Banks, the date on which the Revolving Loan is to be made available
to the Borrowers, whether the requested Revolving Loan shall bear interest at
the Floating Rate or the LIBOR-Based Rate, and if the Revolving Loan is to bear
interest at the LIBOR-Based Rate, the applicable LIBOR Rate Borrowing Period
for such Revolving Loan; provided, however, that such notice is received by the
Agent not later than 12:30 p.m., Chicago time on the Banking Day on which the
Borrower is requesting the Revolving Loan be made available by the Bank in the
case of a Revolving Loan to bear interest at the Floating Rate and not later
than two (2) Banking Days prior to the Banking Day on which the Borrower is
requesting the Revolving Loan be made available by the Bank in the case of a
Revolving Loan to bear interest at the LIBOR-Based Rate. Agent shall promptly
advise Banks of such proposed borrowing, and Banks shall provide the Agent at
its principal office in Chicago with immediately available funds covering the
amount of the requested Loans. Agent shall pay over such immediately available
funds to the Borrowers upon the Agent's receipt of the certificate required
under Section 8.3 hereof. Each Revolving Loan or payment of principal prior to
the Maturity Date shall be in an aggregate amount of at least 10,000 or an
integral multiple thereof (except for Revolving Loans bearing interest at the
LIBOR-Based Rate, each of which shall be in a minimum amount of 1,000,000 and
integral multiples of 500,000 thereafter).

-14-
 15

2.3 Revolving Notes. The Revolving Loans shall be
evidenced by the Revolving Notes, each of which shall be dated the date of the
initial Revolving Loan, made payable to the order of the Bank making the
Revolving Loans and each of which shall mature on the Maturity Date. All
Revolving Loans made by the Banks to the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement
and all payments of principal shall be evidenced by each Bank in its records,
or, at such Bank's option, on the schedule attached to its respective Revolving
Note, which records or schedule shall be rebuttable presumptive evidence of the
subject matter thereof.

 2.4 Procedure For Admission of Additional Banks -
Increase In Percentage Interests. In the event that any bank or other financial
institution shall desire to become a Bank under this Agreement (each a "New
Bank") or any existing Bank shall desire to increase its Percentage Interest
hereunder (each an "Increasing Bank") such New Bank or Increasing Bank, as
applicable, shall submit to the Agent on behalf of the Banks such information
as the Banks shall request in respect of such New Bank's or Increasing Bank's
commitment to the Credit. Upon the approval of the Majority Banks, such New
Bank or Increasing Bank, as applicable, shall be admitted as a Bank and shall
execute a counterpart signature page to this Agreement and all other
appropriate Loan Documents. After such execution such Bank shall be entitled
to all of the rights and shall undertake all of the obligations of a Bank
hereunder.

 3. INTEREST AND FEES.

 3.1 The Revolving Loans; Rate. Each Revolving Loan
shall bear interest at the Borrowers' option at either of the following rates:
(i) the Prime Rate plus one-quarter of one percent (1/4 ), computed on the
basis of actual days elapsed over a 360-day year (the "Floating Rate"); or (ii)
a fixed interest rate per annum (computed for the actual number of days elapsed
on the basis of a 360-day year) which shall be equal to the LIBOR-Based Rate in
effect on the date the Agent quotes such rate to the Borrower (the "LIBOR-Based
Rate"). The Borrowers' acceptance of any LIBOR-Based Rate shall be final and
conclusive as to all matters with respect to the determination thereof.
Interest on Loans bearing interest at the Floating Rate shall be payable
monthly in arrears beginning on October 31, 1996, and continuing on the last
day of each calendar month thereafter. The Floating Rate shall fluctuate
concurrently with and in an amount equal to any increase or decrease in the
Prime Rate. Interest on Loans bearing interest at the LIBOR-Based Rate shall be
payable in arrears on the last day of the applicable LIBOR Rate Borrowing
Period.

 3.2 Interest Rate Election. Borrowers shall make an
election in writing pursuant to Section 2.2 as to whether

-15-
 16

such Revolving Loan shall bear interest at the Floating Rate or the LIBOR-Based
Rate. If Borrowers elect to have a Revolving Loan bear interest at the
LIBOR-Based Rate, Borrowers shall also specify the applicable LIBOR Rate
Borrowing Period for such Revolving Loan; provided, however, no more than five
(5) Revolving Loans may bear interest at the LIBOR-Based Rate at any time and
each Revolving Loan bearing interest at the LIBOR-Based Rate shall be in a
minimum amount of 1,000,000.

 3.3 Borrowing Periods. At any time when the Borrowers
shall select or renew the LIBOR-Based Rate to apply to any Revolving Loan, they
shall fix a period for each such Revolving Loan during which such LIBOR-Based
Rate shall apply, such periods to be for periods (the "LIBOR Rate Borrowing
Periods") of 30, 60 or 90 days; provided that (i) in no event shall any LIBOR
Rate Borrowing Period so selected expire later than the Maturity Date; and (ii)
if any LIBOR Rate Borrowing Period expires on a day which is not a Banking Day,
such LIBOR Rate Borrowing Period shall expire on the next Banking Day.

 3.4 Conversion to LIBOR-Based Rate. Upon two (2)
Banking Days prior written or telephonic notice to Agent, Borrowers may elect
to convert any Revolving Loan bearing interest at the Floating Rate into a
Revolving Loan bearing interest at the LIBOR-Based Rate in effect on the date
of the election. Borrower shall, in such notice, specify the LIBOR Borrowing
Rate Period for such Revolving Loan. Upon such election, Agent shall make a
notation on its books and records evidencing such conversion.

 3.5 Renewal of Interest Rate Option. Upon the
expiration of any LIBOR Rate Borrowing Period, the Borrowers may renew the
LIBOR-Based Rate for one or more additional LIBOR Rate Borrowing Periods;
provided that Borrowers shall give to the Banks notice of the renewal date in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2 hereof. In the absence of the
receipt of a notice from the Borrowers of renewal in accordance with this
Section 3.5 or of conversion in accordance with Section 3.4, the interest rate
with respect to any such Revolving Loan as to which such notice is not properly
received shall automatically be converted to the Floating Rate on the last day
of the expiring LIBOR Rate Borrowing Period.

 3.6 LIBOR Rate Unascertainable; Impracticability. The
Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower in the event that:

 (i) on any date on which a LIBOR-Based Rate selected
 by the Borrowers by notice to the Agent would
 otherwise be set (including any conversion to or
 renewal thereof), the Agent shall have determined
 in good faith (which determination shall be final
 and conclusive)

-16-
 17

 that adequate and reasonable means do not exist
 for determining the LIBOR Rate; or

 (ii) at any time the Agent shall have determined in
 good faith (which determination shall be final and
 conclusive) that the selection of a LIBOR-Based
 Rate or the continuation of or the conversion or
 renewal of a LIBOR-Based Rate has been made
 impossible or impracticable or unlawful by
 compliance by any Bank with any applicable law or
 governmental regulation, guideline or order or
 interpretation thereof by any governmental
 authority charged with the interpretation or
 administration thereof or with any request or
 directive of any such governmental authority
 (whether or not having the force of law).

 3.7 Effect of Unascertainability or Impractibility.
Once the Agent has given notice of its determination under (i) or (ii) above,
the obligation of the Banks to allow conversion to or selection or renewal of
the LIBOR-Based Rate by the Borrowers with respect to any Revolving Loan shall
be suspended until the Agent gives further notice to the Borrowers that the
circumstances specified in such original notice no longer apply. If the Banks
have determined in accordance with (ii) above that they may no longer continue
any LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans, then upon the date specified in any notice of
determination under (ii) above (which shall not be earlier than the date such
notice is given), (x) the LIBOR-Based Rate shall cease to apply and any
Revolving Loans bearing interest at the LIBOR-Based Rate shall automatically be
converted to the Floating Rate and (y) the Borrowers shall pay to Agent for the
account of the Banks, the accrued and unpaid interest on any Revolving Loans
bearing interest at the LIBOR-Based Rate to (but not including) such specified
date. If, at the time notice of a determination is given pursuant to this
Section 3.7, the Borrowers have previously been offered the LIBOR-Based Rate by
the Banks and have previously notified the Agent that they wish to convert to
or select or renew the LIBOR-Based Rate, but such rate has not yet been set,
such notification shall be of no force and effect, and the Borrowers shall,
with respect to any Revolving Loan subject to such notice, either (i) convert
such Revolving Loan to the Floating Rate or (ii) if such Revolving Loan is
bearing interest at the Floating Rate, retain the Floating Rate as to such
Revolving Loan.

 3.8 Indemnity. Without prejudice to any other provision of this
Agreement, the Borrowers shall compensate the Banks upon written request by the
Agent for all losses (including, but not limited to, lost profits) and expenses
in respect of any interest paid by the Banks to lenders of funds borrowed by
the

-17-
 18

Banks or deposited with the Banks to make or maintain any of the Revolving
Loans which accrue interest at the LIBOR-Based Rate, which the Banks may
sustain (i) if for any reason a borrowing to which the LIBOR-Based Rate is to
apply does not occur on a date specified therefor hereof; (ii) if any
prepayment or repayment of any of the Revolving Loans occurs on a date which is
not the last date of the relevant LIBOR Rate Borrowing Period; (iii) as a
consequence of any Event of Default by the Borrowers under this Loan Agreement
or any acceleration or mandatory prepayment or principal reduction. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrowers shall indemnify the
Banks against any loss or expense which the Banks may sustain or incur as a
consequence of the default by the Borrowers in payment of principal of or
interest on any Revolving Loan bearing interest at the LIBOR-Based Rate,
including, but not limited to, any premium or penalty incurred by the Banks in
respect of funds borrowed by it or deposited with it for the purpose of making
or maintaining any of the Revolving Loans, as determined by the Banks in the
exercise of their sole discretion. A certificate submitted by the Agent on
behalf of the Banks to the Borrowers shall, in the absence of manifest error,
be conclusive and binding as to the amount thereof.

 3.9 Unused Line Fee. The Borrowers agree to pay to
the Banks, ratably in accordance with their Percentage Interest, an unused line
fee (the "Unused Line Fee") of one-quarter of one percent (.25 per annum on
the daily average of the unused amount of the Credit (which daily average shall
be calculated by the Agent in accordance with the formula set forth on SCHEDULE
3.9 hereof) during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and
ending on the Maturity Date or, if earlier, the termination of the Credit. The
Unused Line Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last Banking Day
of each calendar quarter commencing on December 31, 1996 with a final payment
of such Unused Line Fee on the Maturity Date.

 3.10 Fees and Expenses. (a) The Borrowers shall pay
and/or reimburse the Agent, on request, for all its expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, documentation, or enforcement of
this Agreement, the Revolving Notes, or any other Loan Documents, including,
without limitation, all reasonable attorney, paralegal and other professional
fees and expenses. All such reimbursements shall be made by the Borrowers
within five (5) days after the Agent's or applicable Bank's written demand
therefor.

 (b) The Borrowers shall pay and/or reimburse Agent, on
request, for all its expenses incurred in connection with the amendment or
modification of this Agreement, the Revolving Notes, or any other Loan
Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrowers shall have no
obligation to reimburse

-18-
 19

and/or pay the Agent for any expenses incurred for the first three amendments
or modifications of this Agreement, the Revolving Notes, or any other Loan
Documents in any year, except in connection with the amendment prepared in
connection with the annual renewal of this Agreement. The expenses in
connection with each amendment or modification for which Borrowers are
responsible shall not exceed 1,500 for each such amendment for each Bank.
However, at no time shall Borrowers be responsible for the fees of the Agent if
the purpose of any amendment or modification is to: (a) permit the incurrence
by Borrowers of any Subordinated Debt, as long as the terms of such
Subordinated Debt comply with the requirements set forth herein; (b) provide
the consent of the Banks to a Permitted Securitization; (c) add a New Bank; or
(d) increase or decrease the Percentage Interest of any Bank.

 3.11 Method of Calculating Interest and Fees. Interest
and any fee shall be computed on the basis of a year consisting of 360 days and
paid for actual days elapsed.

 4. PAYMENTS, PREPAYMENTS, OFFSETS AND REDUCTION OR TERMINATION OF
 THE CREDIT.

 4.1 Place of Payment. All payments hereunder
(including payments with respect to the Revolving Notes) shall be made without
set-off or counterclaim and shall be made in immediately available funds by the
Borrowers to the Agent for the account of the Banks, ratably in accordance with
each Bank's Percentage Interest. All such payments shall be made to the Agent,
prior to 12:30 p.m., Chicago time, at its offices at 135 South LaSalle Street,
Chicago, Illinois 60603, or at such other place as may be designated by the
Agent to the Borrowers in writing. Any payment received after 12:30 p.m.,
Chicago time, shall be deemed received on the next Banking Day. Whenever any
payment to be made hereunder or under any Revolving Note shall be stated to be
due on a date other than a Banking Day, such payment may be made on the next
succeeding Banking Day, and such extension of time shall be included in the
computation of payment of interest or any fees.

 4.2 Reduction of Credit. The Borrowers may from time
to time, upon at least 2 Banking Days' prior notice to the Agent (which shall
promptly advise each Bank thereof) permanently reduce the amount of the Credit
(such reduction to be made among the Banks according to their respective pro
rata share of the Credit) but only upon payment of the principal of the
Revolving Notes in excess of the then reduced amount of the Credit. Any such
reduction shall be in an amount of 100,000 or an integral multiple thereof and
shall include accrued interest to the date of reduction on the principal amount
being repaid. The Borrowers may at any time on like notice terminate

-19-
 20

the Credit upon payment in full of the Revolving Notes and other liabilities of
the Borrowers hereunder.

 4.3 Offset. In addition to and not in limitation of
all rights of offset that any Bank or other holder of any Revolving Note may
have under applicable law, each Bank or other holder of any Revolving Note
shall, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in Section 10.1 or
any Unmatured Event of Default described in Section 10.1(c), have the right to
appropriate and apply to the payment of each Revolving Note any and all
balances, credits, deposits, accounts or moneys of the Borrowers then or
thereafter with such Bank or other holder.

 4.4 Proration of Payments. If any Bank or other
holder of a Revolving Note shall obtain any payment or other recovery (whether
voluntary, involuntary, by application of offset or otherwise) on account of
principal of or interest on any Revolving Note in excess of its Percentage
Interest of payments and other recoveries obtained by all Banks or other
holders on account of principal of and interest in Revolving Notes then held by
them, such Bank or other holder shall purchase from the other Banks or holders
such participation in the Revolving Notes held by them as shall be necessary to
cause such purchasing Bank or other holder to share the excess payment or other
recovery ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any
portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from
such purchasing holder, the purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Borrowers
agree that the Bank so purchasing a participation from the other Banks under
this Section 4.4 may exercise all its rights of payment, including the right of
set-off, with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were the
direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such participation.

 4.5 Borrower's Loan Account. The Agent will maintain
on its books one or more loan accounts on behalf of the Banks (each a "Loan
Account") in which shall be recorded (i) all Revolving Loans made by the Banks
to the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) all payments made by the
Borrowers on all such Revolving Loans, and (iii) all other appropriate debits
and credits as provided in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents,
including, without limitation, all fees, charges, expenses and interest
provided for hereunder or thereunder. Each of the Banks may also maintain loan
accounts in the ordinary course of business. The Agent may send the Borrowers
statements of all accounts due hereunder as reflected in any Loan Account,
which statements shall be deemed accurate in the absence of manifest error.

 4.6 Prepayment. The principal, accrued interest and
all other amounts of the Obligations bearing interest at the

-20-
 21

Floating Rate may be prepaid by the Borrowers in whole or in part without
premium or penalty; provided, however, that all such prepayments shall be in
the minimum amount of 50,000 (or less if less is due). The Borrowers may from
time to time prepay Revolving Loans bearing interest at the LIBOR-Based Rate;
however, the Borrowers shall pay to the Agent on behalf of the Banks an amount
equal to the amount of interest which the Banks would have earned for the
balance of such LIBOR Rate Borrowing Period in respect of the Revolving Loan so
prepaid if such Revolving Loan had not been prepaid prior to the end of such
LIBOR Rate Borrowing Period, plus any reasonable expense or penalty incurred by
any Bank on so relending or reinvesting such Revolving Loan, reduced, if any
Bank is able to relend or reinvest the principal amount of the Revolving Loan
so prepaid for the balance of such LIBOR Rate Borrowing Period, by the amount
of interest to such Bank on so relending or reinvesting the Revolving Loan.
Such additional payment shall not exceed the difference between the amount of
interest the Banks would have earned for the balance of such LIBOR Rate
Borrowing Period in respect of the Revolving Loan so prepaid if such Revolving
Loan had originally been made at the Floating Rate in effect as of the date of
the prepayment, plus any reasonable expenses incurred by Banks on so relending
or reinvesting such Revolving Loan.

 4.7 Application of Payments and Prepayments. Any
payment or prepayment made by the Borrowers under this Agreement, or any of the
other Loan Documents shall be applied to Obligations owing as of the date of
payment in the following order: (i) to any amounts owing to the Banks pursuant
to Sections 3.9 and 3.10 of this Agreement; (ii) to interest accrued and owing
pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Notes (allocated pro rata among each of
the Banks in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests); and (iii)
to the principal balance of the Revolving Notes (allocated pro rata among each
of the Banks in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests).

4.8 Settlement. Agent shall provide to each Bank on
any date on which FEFG requests a Revolving Loan or makes a payment on the
Obligations (the "Settlement Date") a Request and Settlement Statement in the
form of EXHIBIT G hereto showing the change in the outstanding principal
balance of the Revolving Loans since the prior Settlement Date as well as each
Bank's share in the outstanding Revolving Loans. If any Bank's share in the
outstanding Revolving Loans on such Settlement Date exceeds such Bank's share
in the outstanding Revolving Loans on the prior Settlement Date, such Bank
shall, by wire transfer, remit to Agent on each Settlement Date its
contribution to the extent of such Bank's Percentage Interest in the
outstanding Revolving Loans on such Settlement Date. Similarly, if any Bank's
share in the Revolving Loans on the prior Settlement Date

-21-
 22

exceeded its share in the Revolving Loans on any Settlement Date, Agent shall,
by wire transfer, remit to such Bank on the Settlement Date the amount of such
excess. At any time, Agent may request an interim settlement on a date other
than a Settlement Date by providing to each Bank a Request and Settlement
Statement, and each Bank shall be required to remit its contribution to Agent
as provided in this Section 4.8. Each Bank's obligation to make any
contribution on a Settlement Date shall not be affected by the occurrence of a
default or Event of Default under this Agreement between any Settlement Date
and the next succeeding Settlement Date.

 4.9 Default Interest. After maturity,
whether by acceleration or otherwise, the unpaid principal of each Revolving
Note shall bear interest until paid at the Prime Rate in effect from time to
time plus 3 per annum, but never less than 3 above the Prime Rate in effect
at maturity. Interest after maturity shall be payable on demand.

 5. SECURITY. The Obligations shall be secured by a first
security interest in all of the Borrowers' assets, including, without
limitation, all of the Automobile Finance Receivables and Automobile Finance
Agreements as set forth in more detail in the Collateral Agreement and the
Assignment of Life Insurance Policy (the "Collateral").

 6. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. As further inducement to the
Banks and the Agent to enter into this Agreement and make the Revolving Loans
hereunder, the Borrowers hereby represent and warrant, as of the date hereof
and as of the date of each disbursement of each of the Revolving Loans, the

 described in Section 10.1(c) above, the Banks' commitments to make the
 Revolving Loans, if such commitments have not yet terminated, shall
 immediately terminate, and upon the happening or occurrence of any

-42-
 43

 other Event of Default, such Event of Default not having been
 previously cured or waived in writing by the Majority Banks, the Agent
 shall, if directed by Banks holding Percentage Interests in the
 aggregate of more than sixty-seven (67 of the Revolving Loan
 Commitment, terminate the commitment to make the Revolving Loans.
 Thereupon, the Revolving Notes, including, without limitation, all
 principal and interest thereon and all other amounts due under this
 Agreement or any other Loan Document, shall be and become forthwith,
 due and payable without any presentment, demand, protest, notice of
 any of the foregoing or other notice of any kind, all of which are
 hereby expressly waived notwithstanding anything contained herein or
 in the Revolving Notes to the contrary, and the Banks shall have all
 rights and remedies now or hereafter provided by applicable Laws and
 without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may, at their
 option, also appropriate and apply toward the payment of the Revolving
 Notes, or any Indebtedness of the Banks to the Borrowers, howsoever,
 created or arising, and may also exercise any and all rights and
 remedies hereunder, under the Loan Documents or in and to the
 collateral security referred to in Section 5 hereof, including,
 without limitation, the collateral defined in the Collateral Agreement
 (the "Collateral").

 (b) Rights of Secured Creditor. Upon the
 occurrence of an Event of Default the Banks shall have, in addition to
 the rights and remedies given to them under this Agreement, the
 Revolving Notes and the Loan Documents all of the rights and remedies
 of secured parties under the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in any
 jurisdiction in which any Collateral may be located, and all rights
 and remedies allowed by all applicable Laws, all of which rights and
 remedies shall be cumulative and non-exclusive, to the extent
 permitted by said Laws. All risk of loss, damage or diminution of
 value with respect to the Collateral shall be borne by the Borrowers
 at all times and the Banks shall have no responsibility, liability or
 obligation to the Borrowers therefor.

 (c) Sale of Collateral. Upon the termination
 of the Banks' commitment to make the Revolving Loans under Section
 10.2(a), the Agent may immediately, with only such demand or notice to
 the Borrowers as may be required by the Illinois UCC, all of such
 other or further demand or notice hereby expressly waived by the
 Borrowers to the extent permitted by law, and without advertisement
 except as may be required by the Illinois UCC, lease, sell or
 otherwise dispose of or realize upon, at public or private auction or
 sale in Chicago, Illinois or elsewhere, the whole or, from time to
 time, any part of the Collateral or

-43-
 44

 any interest which the Borrowers may have therein. The Borrowers
 agree to assemble, or cause to be assembled, at their own expense, the
 Collateral at such place or places as the Agent shall reasonably
 designate and the Agent may, in its sole and complete discretion,
 cause the Collateral of the Borrowers to remain on the Borrowers'
 premises at the Borrowers' expense, pending sale, lease or other
 disposition of said Collateral. The Agent shall have the right to
 conduct such sales on the Borrowers' premises at the Borrowers'
 expense or elsewhere. Any sale, lease or other disposition of the
 Collateral of the Borrowers may be for cash, credit or any combination
 thereof and the Banks (or any of them) may purchase all or any part of
 the Collateral and in lieu of actual payment of such purchase price,
 may set off the amount of such purchase price against the Obligations
 of the Borrowers, free from any right of redemption on the part of the
 Borrowers, which right is hereby waived and released. After deducting
 from the proceeds of the sale, lease or other disposition of said
 Collateral all expenses incurred by the Banks in connection therewith
 (including attorneys fees), the Agent shall apply such proceeds
 towards the satisfaction of the Obligations of the Borrowers, and
 shall account to the Borrowers for any surplus of such proceeds. The
 Borrowers shall remain liable for any deficiencies. Any notice
 required to be given by the Agent of a sale, lease or other
 disposition or other intended action by Banks with respect to any of
 the Collateral of the Borrowers shall be mailed by the Agent, ten (10)
 days prior to such sale, lease or other disposition or other intended
 action by depositing such notice in the United States mail, postage
 prepaid and duly addressed to the Borrowers at the address specified
 in Section 12.2 hereof and such notice shall constitute, and the
 Borrowers agree that such notice constitutes reasonable and seasonable
 notice of such sale, lease or other disposition or other intended
 action. 

 (d) Entry on Premises. Upon the occurrence of
 an Event of Default, the Agent shall have the right to enter upon the
 premises of the Borrowers where the Collateral is located or believed
 to be located, without any obligation to pay rent to the Borrowers or
 any responsibility or liability to the Borrowers for safeguarding said
 Collateral from loss or damage or diminution in value, and render said
 Collateral unusable or remove said Collateral therefrom to the
 premises of the Agent or any agent of the Agent, for such time as the
 Agent may desire in order to effectively collect or liquidate said
 Collateral.

any holder of any Revolving Note shall be conclusive and binding on any
subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such Revolving Note.

 11.8 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time
by giving 30 days' written notice thereof to the Banks. Upon any such
resignation, the Majority Banks shall have the right to appoint a successor
Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been appointed by the Majority Banks
and accepted such appointment in connection herewith or therewith within 30
days after the retiring Agent's giving notice of resignation, then the retiring
Agent may, but shall not be required to, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a
successor Agent. Upon the appointment of a successor Agent under the terms of
this Section 11.8, the term "Agent" shall, for all purposes of this Agreement,
thereafter mean such successor. Upon acceptance of the agency, a successor
Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,

 12.1 Delay;Waiver. Any Bank's failure, at any time or
times hereafter, either to require strict performance by the Borrowers of any
provisions of this Agreement, the Notes or any Loan Documents, or to enforce
the Bank's rights under such terms or provisions, shall not waive, effect or
diminish or modify such terms or provisions, notwithstanding any conduct or
custom, actual or implied, of the Banks to the contrary or in refraining from
so doing at any time or times. Any suspension or waiver by the Banks of an
Event of Default hereunder or under any Loan Documents or right or remedy
hereunder or under any Loan Document shall not suspend, waive, release or
affect any other Event of Default or right or remedy hereunder or under any
Loan Documents. No delay on the part of any Bank or the holder of any
Revolving Note in the exercise of any power or right shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right
preclude other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other power
or right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any
remedies provided by law.

 12.2 Notice. Any notice between the parties hereto or
notices provided herein to be given shall be in writing (unless otherwise
provided herein) and, if mailed, shall be deemed to be given when sent by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to the Borrowers,
the Agent or the Banks at the respective address set forth on the signature
pages hereof.

 12.3 Expenses. The Borrowers agree whether or not any
Revolving Loan is made hereunder, to pay the Agent and the Banks upon demand
for all reasonable expenses, including reasonable fees of attorneys for the

by (i) the Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation and execution
of this Agreement, the Revolving Notes, the Loan Documents and any document
required to be furnished therewith, (ii) the Agent in connection with the
preparation of any and all amendments to this Agreement, the Revolving Notes,
or the Loan Documents and all other instruments or documents provided for
herein or delivered or to be delivered hereunder or in connection herewith,
(iii) the Agent and the Banks in connection with the enforcement of the
Borrowers' obligations hereunder or under any Revolving Note, including,
without limitation, the cost of field audits under Section 7.4 hereof (iv) in
connection with the insurance to be maintained under Section 7.5) hereof; (v)

proceeding (whether instituted by the Bank, the Borrowers or where payment

-48-
 49

of the Obligations or the Collateral might be materially adversely affected, by
any other Person) in any way relating to the Collateral, this Agreement and the
Loan Documents, except where it is determined that Banks' action or failure to
act constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Borrowers also
agree (i) to indemnify and hold the Agent harmless from any loss or expense
which may arise or be created by the acceptance of telephonic or other
instructions for making Revolving Loans and (ii) to pay, and save the Agent and
the Banks harmless from all liability for, any stamp or other taxes which may
be payable with respect to the execution or delivery of this Agreement or the
issuance of the Revolving Notes or of any other instruments or documents
provided for herein or to delivered hereunder or in connection herewith. The
Borrowers' foregoing obligations shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

 12.4 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement
which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

 12.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
as many counterparts as may be deemed necessary or convenient, and by the
different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which, when so
executed, shall be deemed an original but all such counterparts shall
constitute but one and the same instrument.

 12.6 Merger Clause. This Agreement, the Notes and the
Loan Documents constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto and
thereto with respect to the Loans and may be amended only by a writing signed
on behalf of each such party. If any provision contained in this Agreement is
in conflict with, or inconsistent with, any provision in the Notes or the Loan
Documents, the provision contained in this Agreement shall govern and control.

 12.7 Investment. Each Bank represents and warrants
that: (i) it is acquiring any Revolving Note to be issued to it hereunder for
its own account as a result of making a loan in the ordinary course of its
commercial banking business and not with a view to the public distribution or
sale thereof, nor with any present intention of selling or distributing such
Revolving Note, but subject, nevertheless, to any legal or administrative
requirement that the disposition of such Bank's property at all times be within
its control, and (ii) in good faith it has not and will not rely upon any
margin stock (as such term is defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors

-49-

the Revolving Loans.

be contracts made under and governed by the laws of the State of Illinois.

the Borrowers, the Banks and the Agent and their respective successors and
assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the Borrowers, the Banks and the
Agent and the successors and assigns of the Banks and the Agent. The Borrowers
shall not assign their rights or duties hereunder without the consent of the
Majority Banks.

 12.10 Amendments. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or the Revolving Notes, nor consent to any
departure therefrom by the Borrowers shall be effective unless the same shall
be in writing and signed by the Borrowers and the Majority Banks (except as
provided in Section 7.10 with respect to the provision of landlord waivers),
and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that
no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the
Banks, do any of the following: (a) waive any of the conditions specified in
Sections 8 and 9, (b) increase the amounts or extend the terms of the Banks'
commitments or subject the Banks to any additional obligations, (c) reduce the
principal of, or interest on, the Revolving Notes or any fees hereunder, (d)
postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the
Revolving Notes or any fees hereunder, (e) change the definitions of "Eligible
Automobile Finance Receivable", "Majority Banks", or "Revolving Loan Borrowing
Base" (or any of the defined terms used therein), (f) release any of the
Collateral except in the ordinary course of business and in strict compliance
with the terms of the Loan Documents, (g) waive, modify or amend any of the

submit and consent to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court located
within Cook County, Illinois in any action, suit or proceeding commenced
therein in connection with or with respect to the Obligations, this Agreement,
the Notes or any Loan Documents and waive any right to jury trial and objection
to venue in connection therewith. The Borrowers hereby waive

-50-
 51

personal service of any and all process or papers issued or served in
connection with the foregoing and agree that service of such process or papers
may be made by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, directed to the Borrowers as set forth in Section 12.2 above.

 12.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE BORROWERS AND THE BANKS
WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR
DEFEND ANY RIGHTS (I) UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR UNDER ANY AMENDMENT, INSTRUMENT,
DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT DELIVERED OR WHICH MAY IN THE FUTURE BE DELIVERED IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH OR (II) ARISING FROM ANY BANKING RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, AND AGREE THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING
SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY.

 12.13 Amendment and Restatement. This Agreement shall
constitute an amendment and restatement of the Third Amendment and Restatement
and shall supersede and replace the Amendment and Restatement in its entirety.

 12.14 Joint and Several Liability. The obligations and
liabilities of Borrowers hereunder, under the Revolving Notes and the other
Loan Documents shall be joint and several.

 EXHIBIT 10.6.2

 FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE FOURTH AMENDED
 AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT

 This FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING
CREDIT AGREEMENT (this "Amendment") is made as of January 31, 1997 by and among
FIRST ENTERPRISE FINANCIAL GROUP, INC., formerly known as Centre Capital
Funding Corp., an Illinois corporation ("FEFG"), FIRST ENTERPRISE ACCEPTANCE
COMPANY, an Illinois corporation ("FEAC") (each,individually, a "Borrower" and
collectively, "Borrowers"), FIRST MIDWEST BANK, N.A. ("First Midwest"), BANK
ONE, CHICAGO, NA ("Bank One"), THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF CHICAGO, as successor
to NBD Bank ("FNBC"), HARRIS BANK PALATINE, N.A. ("Harris"), FLEET BANK
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION ("Fleet"), CORESTATES BANK, N.A. ("CoreStates") and
LASALLE NATIONAL BANK, a national banking association ("LaSalle") (LaSalle,
First Midwest, Bank One, FNBC, Harris, Fleet and CoreStates are sometimes
collectively referred to herein as the "Banks" and each individually as a
"Bank") and LaSalle as Agent (the "Agent").

 BACKGROUND

 A. Borrowers, Banks (other than CoreStates) and the Agent entered
into a certain Fourth Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement dated as
of October 16, 1996, which amended and restated in its entirety that certain
Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of September 1,
1995, as amended (as the same may be hereafter amended, modified or
supplemented from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"), pursuant to which the
LaSalle and the other Banks have made revolving loans and advances to
Borrowers.

 B. Borrowers have requested that Banks amend the Loan Agreement by
(a) increasing the amount available to Borrowers by 5,000,000 by adding
CoreStates as a New Bank with a commitment of 5,000,000; and (b) making
certain changes in connection with the admission of a New Bank.

 C. The Banks and the Agent are willing to make such changes and to
amend the Loan Agreement provided that Borrowers, Banks and Agent enter into
this Amendment and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, and that
CoreStates, by its execution of this Amendment, become a signatory to the Loan
Agreement.

 D. Terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the
meanings assigned to them in the Loan Agreement.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
promises herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

2

SECTION 1 AMENDMENTS TO LOAN AGREEMENT

 1.1 Section 2.1 of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended and
restated in its entirety as follows:

 "2.1 Revolving Loans. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, to
 make loans to the Borrowers (collectively called the "Revolving
 Loans" and individually, each a "Revolving Loan") on any Banking Day,
 which Revolving Loans the Borrowers may repay and re-borrow during the
 period from the date hereof, to, but not including, the Maturity Date,
 in such amounts as FEFG may from time to time request; provided,
 however that the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans made
 under this Section 2.1 shall not exceed, at any one time, the lowest of
 (i) the Revolving Loan Borrowing Base, (ii) 85,000,000, or (iii) such
 fixed dollar amount as is (in the aggregate) committed by the Banks
 executing this Agreement from time to time if such amount is less than
 85,000,000 (such lowest sum being the "Revolving Loan Commitment");
 notwithstanding the foregoing, if no Event of Default shall have
 occurred and be continuing on each anniversary of the date hereof, the
 Banks shall be under no commitment to extend the Maturity Date, but
 each Bank agrees to inform the Borrowers on such anniversary
 date whether it intends to extend the Maturity Date for an additional
 one-year period. If, at any time the outstanding Revolving Loans
 exceed the Revolving Loan Commitment, the Borrowers will immediately
 notify the Agent of such excess and pay the Banks the amount thereof. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Bank
 shall be obligated to advance any funds under this Section 2.1 which
 funds exceed the amount determined by multiplying such Bank's
 Percentage Interest by the Revolving Loan Commitment."
 
 1.2 The Maximum Amounts of Commitment and Percentage Interest shown
on the signature pages of the Loan and Security Agreement shall be amended as
set forth on Exhibit A to this Amendment.

 1.3 Exhibit E to the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by adding a
new Revolving Note payable to the order of CoreStates at the end thereof in the
form of Exhibit B hereto.

lapse of time, or both, constitute such an Event of Default, has occurred.

 2.2 Representations and Warranties. On the date hereof, the
representations and warranties and covenants set forth in Sections 6 and 7 of
the Loan Agreement (as modified by this Amendment) are true and correct with
the same effect as though such representations and warranties and covenants had
been made on the date hereof, except to the extent that such representations
and warranties and covenants expressly relate to an earlier date.

and authority to enter into this Amendment, to borrow additional funds and to
incur and perform the obligations provided for under this Amendment and the

valid and legally binding obligation of Borrowers, fully enforceable against
Borrowers, in accordance with its terms.

Borrowers of this Amendment will not (i) violate any provision of law, any
order of any court or other agency of government, any provision of the Articles
