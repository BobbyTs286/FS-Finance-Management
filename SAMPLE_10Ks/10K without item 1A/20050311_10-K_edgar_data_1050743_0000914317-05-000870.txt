 PART I

Item 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

 The Corporation

Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation (the "Corporation") is a bank holding
company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
("Holding Company Act"). The Corporation was organized under the laws of New
Jersey in August, 1997, by the Board of Directors of Peapack-Gladstone Bank (the
"Bank"), its principal subsidiary, to become a holding company for the Bank. The
Bank is a state chartered commercial bank founded in 1921 under the laws of the
State of New Jersey. Deposits of the Bank are insured for up to 100,000 per
depositor by the Bank Insurance Fund administered by the FDIC. The Bank is a
member of the Federal Reserve System. The Bank offers financial services through
18 full-service banking offices, and one mini-branch. The Bank maintains eight
branches and one auxiliary office in Somerset County, three in Hunterdon County
and seven in Morris County.

The Bank is primarily dedicated to providing quality, personalized financial,
trust and investment services to individuals and small businesses.

Commercial loan customers of the Bank are business people, including merchants,
architects, doctors, dentists, attorneys and building contractors as well as
various service firms and other local retailers. Most forms of commercial
lending are offered, including working capital lines of credit, term loans for
fixed asset acquisitions, commercial mortgages and other forms of asset-based
financing.

In addition to commercial lending activities, the Bank offers a wide range of
consumer banking services, including: checking and savings accounts, money
market and interest-bearing checking accounts, certificates of deposit, and
individual retirement accounts held in certificates of deposit. The Bank also
offers residential and construction mortgages, home equity lines of credit and
other second mortgage loans. For children, the Bank offers a special pony club
savings account. New Jersey Consumer Checking Accounts are offered to low income
customers. In addition, the Bank provides foreign and domestic travelers'
checks, personal money orders, cashier's checks and wire transfers. Automated
teller machines are available at eighteen (18) locations. Via the automatic
teller machine access card issued by the Bank, customers may pay for commodities
at point-of-sale merchant locations. Internet banking is available to customers
including an on-line bill payment option. The Corporation has no foreign
operations.

The Bank has a Trust and Investment Department, PGB Trust and Investments, which
offers personal investment management services, personal trust administration
services, estate settlement, income tax services, custodial services and other
financial planning services. Since its inception in 1972, trust assets (book
value) have increased to 1.19 billion.

The Corporation makes its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to such reports, available
on its website at www.pgbank.com.
 --------------

 Employees

As of December 31, 2004, the Corporation employed 219 full-time equivalent
persons. Management considers relations with employees to be satisfactory.

Principal Market Areas

The Bank's principal market for its deposit gathering activities includes
Somerset, Morris and Hunterdon Counties. The area is composed of upper-income
single family homes, moderate income properties, some low-income housing and
several large corporate campuses. There are numerous small retail businesses in
each of the towns as well as offices for various professionals, i.e. attorneys,
architects, interior decorators, physicians, etc. A portion of the market area
is bisected by Interstate Highways 287 and 78 where numerous corporate offices
have relocated over the past 25 years.

The Bank has expanded its service areas from one office in 1968 to the present
18 full-service banking locations and one mini-branch location by steadily
opening new branches. All of the communities that the Bank serves are
demographically similar and contiguous to the main office.

 Competition

The market for banking and bank-related services is highly competitive. The Bank
competes with other providers of financial services such as other bank holding
companies, commercial and savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit
unions, money market and mutual funds, mortgage companies, and a growing list of
other local, regional and national institutions which offer financial services.
Mergers between financial institutions within New Jersey and in neighboring
states have added competitive pressure. The Bank competes by offering quality
products and convenient services at competitive prices. In order to maintain and
enhance its competitive position, the Bank regularly reviews its products,
locations and new branching prospects.

 Governmental Policies and Legislation

The banking industry is highly regulated. Statutory and regulatory controls
increase a bank holding company's cost of doing business and limit the options
of its management to deploy assets and maximize income. Proposals to change the
laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks, bank
holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in
Congress, in state legislatures and before various bank regulatory agencies. The
likelihood of any major changes and the impact such changes might have on the
Corporation or the Bank is impossible to predict. The following discussion is
not intended to be a complete list of all the activities regulated by the
banking laws or of the impact of such laws and regulations on the Bank. It is
intended only to briefly summarize some material provisions.

 Capital Requirements

The Federal Reserve Board has adopted risk-based capital guidelines for banks
and bank holding companies. The minimum guideline for the ratio of total capital
to risk-weighted assets is 8 . At least half of the total capital is to be
comprised of common stock, retained earnings, minority interests in the equity
accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock
and a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less
goodwill and certain other intangibles ("Tier 1 Capital"). The remainder may
consist of other preferred stock, certain other instruments and a portion of the
loan loss allowance. At December 31, 2004, the Corporation's Tier 1 Capital and
Total Capital ratios were 19.02 and 20.25 , respectively.

In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum leverage ratio
guidelines for banks and bank holding companies. These guidelines provide for a
minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to average total assets of 3 for banks that
meet certain specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating.
All other banks and bank holding companies generally are required to maintain a
leverage ratio of at least 3 plus an additional cushion of 100 to 200 basis
points. The Corporation's leverage ratio at December 31, 2004 was 9.18 .

4

FDICIA

Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
("FDICIA"), each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations, specifying
the levels at which a financial institution would be considered "well
capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly
undercapitalized," and "critically undercapitalized," and to take certain
mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of
the institution. The regulations implementing these provisions of FDICIA provide
that a bank is defined to be "well capitalized" if it maintains a leverage ratio
of at least 5 , a risk-adjusted Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 and a
risk-adjusted total capital ratio of at least 10 and is not otherwise in a
"troubled condition" as specified by its appropriate federal regulatory agency.
A bank is defined to be "adequately capitalized" if it meets other minimum
capital requirements. In addition, a depository institution will be considered
"undercapitalized" if it fails to meet any minimum required measure,
"significantly undercapitalized" if it is significantly below such measure and
"critically undercapitalized" if it fails to maintain a level of tangible equity
equal to not less than 2 of total assets. A depository institution may be
deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its
actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating.

 Insurance Funds Legislation

The Corporation's wholly-owned subsidiary, the Peapack-Gladstone Bank, is a
member of the Bank Insurance Fund ("BIF") of the FDIC. The FDIC also maintains
another insurance fund, the Savings Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF"), which
primarily covers savings and loan association deposits but also covers deposits
that are acquired by a BIF-insured institution from a savings and loan
association.

 Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends

The holders of the Corporation's common stock are entitled to receive dividends,
when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Corporation out of
funds legally available. The only statutory limitation is that such dividends
may not be paid when the Corporation is insolvent. Since the principal source of
income for the Corporation will be dividends on Bank common stock paid to the
Corporation by the Bank, the Corporation's ability to pay dividends to its
shareholders will depend on whether the Bank pays dividends to it. As a
practical matter, restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends act
as restrictions on the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends by
the Corporation. As a New Jersey chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject
to the restrictions on the payment of dividends contained in the New Jersey
Banking Act of 1948, as amended (the "Banking Act"). Under the Banking Act, the
Bank may pay dividends only out of retained earnings, and out of surplus to the
extent that surplus exceeds 50 of stated capital. Under the Financial
Institutions Supervisory Act, the FDIC has the authority to prohibit a
state-chartered bank from engaging in conduct that, in the FDIC's opinion,
constitutes an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Under certain circumstances,
the FDIC could claim that the payment of a dividend or other distribution by the
Bank to the Corporation constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice. The
Corporation is also subject to FRB policies, which may, in certain
circumstances, limit its ability to pay dividends. The FRB policies require,
among other things, that a bank holding company maintain a minimum capital base.
The FRB would most likely seek to prohibit any dividend payment that would
reduce a holding company's capital below these minimum amounts.

 Holding Company Supervision

The Corporation is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Holding
Company Act. As a bank holding company, the Corporation is supervised by the FRB
and is required to file reports with the FRB and provide such additional
information as the FRB may require.

The Holding Company Act prohibits the Corporation, with certain exceptions, from
acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of
the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any
business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or
furnishing services to subsidiary banks, except that it may, upon application,
engage in, and may own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found
by the FRB to be so closely related to banking "as to be a proper incident
thereto." The Holding Company Act requires prior approval by the FRB of the
acquisition by the Corporation of more than five percent of the voting stock of
any additional bank. Satisfactory capital ratios, Community Reinvestment Act
ratings and anti-money laundering policies are generally prerequisites to
obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions. The policy of the
FRB provides that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of
financial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support the
subsidiary bank in circumstances in which it might not do so absent that policy.
Acquisitions through the Bank require the approval of the FDIC and the New
Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance ("NJDOBI").

 Recent Legislation

5

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), which became law on July
30, 2002, added new legal requirements for public companies affecting corporate
governance, accounting and corporate reporting.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act provides for, among other things:

o a prohibition on personal loans made or arranged by the issuer to its
 directors and executive officers (except for loans made by a bank subject
 to Regulation O);

o independence requirements for audit committee members;

o independence requirements for company auditors;

o certification of financial statements and Forms 10-K and 10-Q reports by
 the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer;

o a report of management on the issuer's internal control over financial
 reporting;

o auditor attestation report on management's assessment of internal control
 over financial reporting;

o the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and
 profits from the sale of an issuer's securities by directors and senior
 officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any
 financial statements that later require restatement due to corporate
 misconduct;

o disclosure of off-balance sheet transactions;

o two-business day filing requirements for insiders filing Form 4s;

o disclosure of a code of ethics for financial officers and filing a Form
 8-K for a change or waiver of such code;

o "real time" filing of periodic reports;

o posting of certain SEC filings and other information on the company
 website;

o the reporting of securities violations "up the ladder" by both in-house
 and outside attorneys;

o restrictions on the use of non-GAAP financial measures;

o the formation of a public accounting oversight board; and

o various increased criminal penalties for violations of securities laws.

Each of the national stock exchanges, including the American Stock Exchange
(AMEX) where the Corporation's securities are listed, have implemented new
corporate governance listing standards, including rules strengthening director
independence requirements for boards, and requiring the adoption of charters for
the nominating and audit committees.

As part of the USA Patriot Act, signed into law on October 26, 2001, Congress
adopted the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial
Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 (the "Act"). The Act authorizes the Secretary of the
Treasury, in consultation with the heads of other government agencies, to adopt
special measures applicable to financial institutions such as banks, bank
holding companies, broker-dealers and insurance companies. Among its other
provisions, the Act requires each financial institution: (i) to establish an
anti-money laundering program; (ii) to establish due diligence policies,
procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report
instances of money laundering in United States private banking accounts and
correspondent accounts maintained for non-United States persons or their
representatives; and (iii) to avoid establishing, maintaining, administering, or
managing correspondent accounts in the United States for, or on behalf of, a
foreign shell bank that does not have a physical presence in any country. In
addition, the Act expands the circumstances under which funds in a bank account
may be forfeited and requires covered financial institutions to respond under
certain circumstances to requests for information from federal banking agencies
within 120 hours.

The Department of Treasury has issued regulations implementing the due diligence
requirements. These regulations require minimum standards to verify customer
identity and maintain accurate records, encourages cooperation among financial
institutions, federal banking agencies, and law enforcement authorities
regarding possible money laundering or terrorist activities, prohibits the
anonymous use of "concentration accounts," and requires all covered financial
institutions to have in place an anti-money laundering compliance program.

The Act also amends the Bank Holding Company Act and the Bank Merger Act to
require the federal banking agencies to consider the effectiveness of a
financial institution's anti-money laundering activities when reviewing an
application under these acts.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (the "Modernization
Act") became effective in early 2000. The Modernization Act:

6

o allows bank holding companies meeting management, capital and Community
 Reinvestment Act Standards to engage in a substantially broader range of
 nonbanking activities than previously permissible, including insurance
 underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and
 financial companies; if a bank holding company elects to become a
 financial holding company, it files a certification, effective in 30 days,
 and thereafter may engage in certain financial activities without further
 approvals;

o allows insurers and other financial service companies to acquire banks;

o removes various restrictions previously applied to bank holding company
 ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies; and

o establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to bank holding
 companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations.

The Modernization Act also modified other financial laws, including laws related
to financial privacy and community reinvestment.

Additional proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking
and financial services industry are frequently introduced in Congress, in the
state legislatures and before the various bank regulatory agencies. The
likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes might have
on the Corporation cannot be determined at this time.

Item 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY

The Corporation owns seven branches and leases 12 branches. The Corporation also
owns two properties adjacent to the Main Office in Peapack-Gladstone. The
Corporation leases an administrative and operations office building in
Peapack-Gladstone and a data center in Bedminster Township.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the normal course of its business, lawsuits and claims may be brought against
the Corporation and its subsidiaries. There is no currently pending or
threatened litigation or proceedings against the Corporation or its
subsidiaries, which assert claims that if adversely decided, would have a
material adverse effect on the Corporation.

Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
 FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

The Corporation's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the
assistance of other members of the Corporation's management, have evaluated the
effectiveness of the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such
evaluation, the Corporation's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures
are effective.

The Corporation's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have also
concluded that there have not been any changes in the Corporation's internal
control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Corporation's internal control over financial
reporting during the fourth quarter of 2004.

The Corporation's management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that
our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all
error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, provides reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the control system are met. The design of a control system reflects resource
constraints; the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because there are inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Corporation have been or will be
detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns occur because of simple error
or mistake. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons,
by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.
The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events. There can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all future conditions; over
time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or
deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

the 2004 Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference.

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS AND FRIENDS

[LOGO]

It is hard to comprehend how quickly we move through one year into the next.
There are many explanations for this phenomenon, but we think in our case it is
because we are always excited about moving on to the next project and
opportunity. One door always leads to others and our energy levels are charged
by the possibilities.

 We are pleased to report to our shareholders the 8th straight year of
record earnings. Net income increased 809,000 to 13,109,000. Our banking
environment continues to change with consolidation. Big banks have rediscovered
retail banking and have committed huge marketing budgets to try to grow that
side of their business. We feel confident that our business model of outstanding
customer service backed by first-rate products and the most committed employees
in our market translates well in the modern world of financial services.

 Growth is an important component of our future success. During 2004 we
surpassed one billion in assets in the Bank. At the time, one enlightened
reporter wrote that mile markers like that are unimportant; it was only the
addition of one more account. Of course he was right. However, we celebrated
because it reaffirmed that our type of banking is still in demand. Total assets
grew 10.2 during 2004, ending the year at 1,067,000,000.

 Loan growth was particularly strong during the year. Energized officers
and programs resulted in 34 growth in total loans. At the end of the year, the
Bank had more than 572,000,000 in loans outstanding.

 At the same time, asset quality continues at outstanding levels.
Non-performing loans totaled 351,000 or 0.06 of total loans at December 31,
2004, while net charge-offs for all of 2004 were 63,000.

CASH AND STOCK DIVIDEND

 In November your Board of Directors paid a 10 stock dividend and
increased the quarterly cash dividend to 11(cent) per share. Combined, the
effective increase in the quarterly cash dividend was 21 . This is on top of the
22 increase in 2003, 20 in 2002 and 18 in 2001. Shareholder value is always a
priority of the Board and Management.

CAPITAL INVESTMENT

 We made several important investments for the future during 2004. On the
technology side, we opened our new Operations Center in February. To say it was
desperately needed is probably an understatement. The additional space and
updated equipment will give our staff the platform to provide our customers with
all the quality banking products that they require. A good example is the new
check image system just brought on line. The added convenience for our customers
represents an important advance.

2

Our long awaited Oldwick, Tewksbury Township Branch opened in June. Our
beautiful new building has become something of a landmark as travelers approach
this special community. Tonya Flowers is our Manager and we have all banking
services available there including drive-up ATM and safe deposit boxes. We
exceeded our new business targets for the year.

 Our Morristown Branch opened with great excitement in November. This is a
major commitment for us to a very important community. There are a tremendous
number of businesses and households in that market and we look forward to
earning their business. Kathy Becker is our Manager. She and her staff are off
to a great start.

 Because of the opportunities in the Morristown market we also have on site
Commercial Lenders and New Business Officers. Nancy Wynant and John Scerbo are
actively seeking new business opportunities.

 The second floor of the Morristown building houses our first regional
office of PGB Trust & Investments. All services provided by PGB Trust &
Investments are available there. Robert Figurelli, John Lee and Mike Tormey
would be pleased to meet with you at your convenience.

NEW SERVICES

 Even though it will not be effective until February 2005, we want to
announce two important new services for our customers. Beginning in February our
customers will be able to use any ATM in the world without any charges for their
first four transactions each month. Our customers know that we do not charge a
fee when they use our ATM card. However, other banks have charged our customers
when they use their machines. We will now reimburse our customers when those
charges occur. We believe this is an important enhancement for our customers. We
are now able to give access to their accounts from any of the approximately
850,000 ATMs in the world without a fee.

 Along the same line, we will no longer charge for our on-line NetAccess
bill pay service. As long as our customer is actively using the service we will
absorb the fee. These are very important services for our active and mobile
clientele and we have opened two more feeless access points to their money. We
hope you all take advantage of it.

PGB TRUST & INVESTMENTS

 PGB Trust & Investments generated strong results during 2004. Market value
of assets held grew 21 from 1,400,000,000 to 1,700,000,000. Fees generated
rose 961,000 to 6,700,000. These strong patterns have continued for many years
as clients find that our expertise in asset management, trust and estate
administration and tax planning is important. Clients must have a plan to reach
their financial goals. We are here to advise, implement a plan and ultimately
move assets from generation to generation. We encourage you to take the time to
meet with Craig Spengeman, John Bonk or Mike Tormey. Big financial decisions can
be intimidating. Having the right team to help you is invaluable.

3

SARBANES-OXLEY ACT

 It is important to report to shareholders that we are in compliance with
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our approach to compliance was to learn from the process
and hopefully have even stronger corporate governance in place at the end. We
believe that mission was accomplished, but our shareholders should know we
estimate our costs of compliance to exceed 500,000. We know exactly the hard
cost of compliance, i.e. professional fees, hardware, software, etc. However,
the largest part of the total expense has been soft cost, i.e. time and effort
of staff not spent on banking business. As the full weight of Sarbanes-Oxley
becomes known, I hope other companies will make similar reports to their
shareholders. While the goals of Sarbanes-Oxley were laudable, some shareholders
may be appalled by the true expense to Corporate America.

 We look forward to 2005. We believe we should begin to see opportunities
to redeploy assets into a rising interest rate environment. It will take time
for that process to occur. In the end, we believe more normal interest rate
margins will return to the banking industry.

 We want to thank our employees and Directors for all their good work this
year and our shareholders and customers for their continuing trust and support.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OVERVIEW: The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide
information about the financial condition and results of operations of
Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated Financial
Statements and the related notes and supplemental financial information
appearing elsewhere in this report. All share and per share amounts have been
restated to reflect the 10 percent stock dividend issued in 2004 and all prior
stock dividends and splits.

 Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation (the "Corporation"), formed in
1997, is the parent holding company for Peapack-Gladstone Bank, formed in 1921,
a commercial bank operating eighteen branches and one mini branch in Somerset,
Hunterdon, and Morris counties.

 During 2004, the cash dividend rate was increased to 0.11 per share. This
new rate, coupled with the 10 percent stock dividend paid on November 1, 2004,
effectively raised the cash dividend rate by 21 percent over the previous rate
of 0.10 per share.

 The year ended December 31, 2004 represented a year of moderate earnings
growth for the Corporation. Net interest income increased during the year and
the Corporation experienced strong loan and deposit growth. As discussed in this
Management's Discussion and Analysis section some of the highlights are as
follows:

 o Total assets of the Corporation exceeded 1 billion this year,
 ending the year at 1.07 billion, over a 10 percent increase.

 o The loan portfolio experienced growth of 34 percent.

 o PGB Trust and Investments assets exceeded 1.7 billion in market
 value for the first time, growing more than 20 percent.

 o Deposits surpassed the 935 million level, with greater than 10
 percent growth.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES: Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operation is based upon the Corporation's
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The
preparation of these financial statements requires the Corporation to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses. Note 1 to the Corporation's Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, contains a summary of
the Corporation's significant accounting policies. Management believes the
Corporation's policy with respect to the methodology for the determination of
the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of complexity and
requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments, which often
require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Changes in
these judgments, assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of
operations. This critical policy and its application are periodically reviewed
with the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.

 The provision for loan losses is based upon management's evaluation of the
adequacy of the allowance, including an assessment of known and inherent risks
in the portfolio, giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan
portfolio, actual loan loss experience, level of delinquencies, detailed
analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured,
the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral
and guarantees securing the loans, and current economic and market conditions.
Although management uses the best information available, the level of the
allowance for loan losses remains an estimate, which is subject to significant
judgment and short-term change. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part
of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation's provision
for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Corporation to make additional
provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time
of their examination. Furthermore, the majority of the Corporation's loans are
secured by real estate in the State of New Jersey. Accordingly, the
collectibility of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the
Corporation's loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market
conditions and may be adversely affected should real estate values decline or
New Jersey experience an adverse economic shock. Future adjustments to the
provision for loan losses may be necessary due to economic, operating,
regulatory and other conditions beyond the Corporation's control.

EARNINGS SUMMARY: The Corporation's net income increased 7 percent to 13.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 12.3 million earned in
2003. Earnings per diluted share were 1.56 as compared to 1.47 in 2003, an
increase of 6 percent.

 These results produced a return on average assets of 1.30 percent as
compared to 1.34 percent in 2003 and a return on average shareholders' equity of
14.72 percent as compared to 15.14 percent in 2003. While these performance
ratios are marginally lower, the results for 2004 include substantial
investments in two new branch locations and a new data center. These investments
and the higher expenses related to their operations will increase our capacity
for future growth and profitability.

The increase in net income for 2004 was primarily due to higher net
interest income and Trust fees, offset in part by higher salaries and benefits
and premises and equipment expenses. In 2004, the Corporation experienced strong
growth in loans and deposits, which was accompanied by historically low cost of
funds resulting in strong growth in net interest income.

NET INTEREST INCOME: The primary source of the Corporation's operating income is
net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividends
earned on earning assets and fees earned on loans, and interest paid on
interest-bearing liabilities. Earning assets include loans to individuals and
businesses, investment securities, interest-earning deposits and federal funds
sold. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing checking, savings
and time deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other borrowings. Net
interest income is determined by the difference between the yields earned on
earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities ("Net Interest
Spread") and the relative amounts of earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities. The Corporation's net interest spread is affected by regulatory,
economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates, loan demand and
deposit flows and general levels of non-performing assets.

 Net interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, increased from 31.8
million in 2003 to 35.9 million in 2004. Average earning assets increased 89.3
million or 10 percent from the average balances in 2003 and the interest earned
on these assets increased despite slightly lower yields. Rates earned on earning
assets declined 7 basis points in 2004. Interest expense declined 402 thousand
or 4 percent over the levels recorded in 2003 on average balances of
interest-bearing liabilities that increased 65.7 million or 10 percent. Lower
rates were paid on interest-bearing liabilities, declining 19 basis points from
1.49 percent to 1.30 percent. In 2004, the net interest margin rose to 3.78
percent from 3.69 percent in 2003.

 On a fully tax-equivalent basis, interest income on earning assets rose
 3.7 million or 9 percent to 45.8 million. This increase was primarily due to
the higher average loans and investment securities, which rose 76.1 million and
 13.4 million, respectively, while rates earned on investment securities rose 17
basis points. This growth was offset in part by lower rates earned on loans,
which declined 48 basis points.

 Interest expense declined during the year due to lower rates paid on
interest-bearing deposits. The overall rate paid on interest-bearing deposits
declined 22 basis points to 1.21 percent in 2004 as compared to 1.43 percent in
2003. Rates paid on borrowings rose 17 basis points to 2.68 percent. The decline
in deposit interest rates paid in 2004 reflects the market interest rates during
most of the year; however, rates began to rise later in 2004 as the Federal
Reserve Bank increased the Federal funds rate five times.

 Partially offsetting lower rates paid was growth in most deposit
categories. On average, interest-bearing checking and tiered money market
accounts grew 29.8 million and 20.1 million, respectively. Savings accounts
grew 6.1 million, on average and money market accounts, 5.8 million, while
certificates of deposit declined 11.4 million, on average. Average
noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased 18.7 million or 13 percent during
2004 as compared to 2003. Average borrowings increased 15.2 million to 50.4
million during 2004.

LOANS: The loan portfolio represents a significant portion of the Corporation's
earning assets and is an important source of interest and fee income. Loan
originations are primarily originated in the Bank's market or surrounding areas.

 At December 31, 2004, total loans were 572.2 million, an increase of
 145.2 million, or 34 percent from 2003 levels. The growth in our portfolios is
primarily the result of new business initiatives and our entry into new market
areas. Residential loans secured by first liens on 1-4 family homes rose 101.1
million or 45 percent in 2004, while commercial mortgage loans rose 31.2
million or 24 percent from 2003 levels. The majority of residential real estate
loan origination was primarily due to the purchase of adjustable rate loans from
a third-party mortgage origination entity. All of the loans purchased are
secured by properties located within the Bank's market areas. Construction loans
and commercial loans also grew by 7.9 million and 4.2 million, respectively.

 The yield on total loans averaged 5.70 percent for 2004, a 48 basis point
decline from the 6.18 percent average yield earned in 2003. The average yield on
the mortgage portfolio declined in 2004 to 5.77 percent from 6.26 percent in
2003. The average yield on the commercial loan portfolio declined 38 basis
points to 5.36 percent. The decline in yields earned in 2004 reflects asset
repricing at historically low levels. Although interest rates began to rise in
the latter part of the year, it did not have a significant impact on loan yields
in 2004.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES: Investment securities are those securities that the
Corporation has both the ability and intent to hold to maturity. These
securities are carried at amortized cost. The portfolio consists primarily of
U.S. government agencies, mortgage-backed securities and municipal obligations.
The Corporation's investment securities at amortized cost amounted to 87.1
million at December 31, 2004, compared with 97.7 million at December 31, 2003.

SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: Securities available for sale are used as a part
of the Corporation's interest rate risk management strategy, and they may be
sold in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs, and other
factors. These securities are carried at estimated fair value, and unrealized
changes in fair value are recognized as a separate component of shareholders'
equity, net of income taxes. Realized gains and losses are recognized in income
at the time the securities are sold.

 At December 31, 2004, the Corporation had securities available for sale
with a market value of 354.2 million, compared with 356.0 million at December
31, 2003. A 1.4 million and 2.7 million net unrealized gain (net of income

 Federal funds sold and interest-earning deposits are an integral part of
the Corporation's investment and liquidity strategies. The combined average
balance of these vehicles during 2004 was 6.8 million as compared to 7.0
million in 2003.

DEPOSITS: Total deposits at December 31, 2004 were 935.7 million, an increase
of 89.9 million or 11 percent from 845.8 million at December 31, 2003. Our
strategy is to fund earning asset growth with core deposits, which is an
important factor in the generation of net interest income. Marketing, sales
efforts, and two new branch locations all contributed to the strong growth in
deposits. Total average deposits increased 69.2 million or 9 percent over 2003
levels.

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK ADVANCES: At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Federal Home
Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances totaled 33.4 million and 30.0 million,
respectively. The Corporation considers FHLB advances an added source of
funding, and accordingly, executes transactions from time to time to meet its
funding requirements. The FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2004 have
varying terms and interest rates.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND RELATED PROVISION: The allowance for loan losses
was 6.0 million at December 31, 2004 as compared to 5.5 million at December
31, 2003. At December 31, 2004, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of
total loans outstanding was 1.05 percent compared to 1.28 percent at December
31, 2003 and 1.17 percent at December 31, 2002. The provision for loan losses
remained constant at 600 thousand for 2004 and 2003. The allowance as a
percentage of total loans decreased in 2004 as compared to 2003 and the
provision remained consistent with the prior year as loan growth and increases
in commercial-related loans was offset by relatively low levels of
delinquencies, non-performing loans and historical charge-off experience. In
addition, the composition of the Bank's loan portfolio was comprised of a higher
percentage of lower risk 1-4 family mortgages.

 The provision was based upon management's review and evaluation of the
size and composition of the loan portfolio, actual loan loss experience, level
of delinquencies, general market and economic conditions, detailed analysis of
individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured, and the
existence and net realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the
loans. Although management used the best information available, the level of the
allowance for loan losses remains an estimate, which is subject to significant
judgment and short-term change. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part
of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation's allowance
for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Corporation to make additional
provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time
of their examination. Furthermore, the majority of the Corporation's loans are
secured by real estate in the State of New Jersey. Accordingly, the
collectibility of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the
Corporation's loan portfolio is

13

susceptible to changes in local market conditions and may be adversely affected
should real estate values decline or New Jersey experiences an adverse economic
downturn. Future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic,
operating, regulatory and other conditions beyond the Corporation's control.

(1) THE CORPORATION DOES NOT HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF THE ACTUAL PENSION
 CONTRIBUTION FOR 2006 AND BEYOND; HOWEVER IT IS ANTICIPATED TO BE AT LEAST
 THE SAME ANNUAL AMOUNT AS 2005 OF 1.3 MILLION.

 Long-term debt obligations include borrowings from the Federal Home Loan
Bank with defined terms. The chart is based on scheduled repayments of
principal.

 Operating leases represent obligations entered into by the Corporation for
the use of land and premises. The leases generally have escalation terms based
upon certain defined indexes. Common area maintenance charges may also apply and
are adjusted annually based on the terms of the lease agreements.

15

Purchase obligations represent legally binding and enforceable agreements
to purchase goods and services from third parties and consist of contractual
obligations under data processing service agreements. The Corporation also
enters into various routine rental and maintenance contracts for facilities and
equipment. These contracts are generally for one year and are not significant to
the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS: The following table shows the amounts and
expected maturities of significant commitments, as of December 31, 2004. Further
discussion of these commitments is included in Note 13 to the Consolidated

Commitments under standby letters of credit, both financial and
performance do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, in that these
commitments often expire without being drawn upon.

OTHER INCOME: Other income was 9.9 million in 2004, a decline of 1 percent over
2003 levels. This decline was primarily due to lower net gains on sales of
securities, which totaled 150 thousand as compared to 1.3 million recorded in
2003. This decline was due, in part, to a 560 thousand other-than-temporary
non-cash impairment charge on adjustable rate investment-grade preferred stock.
These securities were subsequently sold in 2005 with no additional losses
recognized. Trust fees rose 961 thousand or 17 percent over the levels recorded
in 2003. This increase is attributable to increased volume of business as the
book value of assets under management increased 101.7 million or 9 percent over
last year's levels. In 2004, other income of 793 thousand was realized on
increased cash surrender value on Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) policies, as
compared to 880 thousand in 2003. BOLI assists in offsetting the rising costs
of employee benefits.

OTHER EXPENSES: In 2004, other expenses totaled 25.2 million, an increase of
 2.6 million or 12 percent compared to 22.5 million in 2003. This increase is
commensurate with the growth in the overall level of bank and trust business
activity.

16

Salaries and benefits expense, which accounts for the largest portion of
other expenses, increased 1.3 million or 10 percent in 2004 as compared to
2003. This increase was directly related to increased officer and staff levels,
normal merit increases, promotional raises and higher benefit costs. The full
time equivalent number of employees rose to 219 at December 31, 2004 from 209 a
year ago.

 Premises and equipment expense increased to 5.7 million from 4.8 million
in 2003, an increase of 832 thousand or 17 percent. In the past year, occupancy
expenses have grown due to the investment in two new branches and a new data
center. The Oldwick and Morristown Branches opened during 2004. New branches are
our primary source of future growth and profitability. Costs also rose this year
due to the Corporation's investment in its technological capacity for future
growth and the expectation of increased levels of business activity. This year,
the Corporation invested in the equipment necessary to image customer checks and
create image statements of customer accounts. Customers now receive images of
their checks with their statements and are able to access these images through
internet banking. The Corporation is also positioned to comply with the Check 21
legislation.

 Advertising expenses increased 229 thousand as compared to 2003 due to
additional advertising for two branch grand openings and advertising of deposit
products. Stationery and supplies expense increased 84 thousand or 16 percent
due to costs associated with two new branches and imaging documents. Telephone
expense also increased due to the addition of branches, growing 65 thousand or
17 percent. Professional and legal fees remained relatively constant from year
to year despite additional costs related to the implementation of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 The Corporation strives to operate in an efficient manner and control
costs as a means of producing increased earnings and enhancing shareholder
value.

INCOME TAXES: Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003
was 6.1 million and 5.8 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the
year ended December 31, 2004 was 31.70 percent compared to 32.00 percent for the
year ended December 31, 2003. While taxable income rose from 18.1 million to
 19.2 million, the effective tax rate in 2004 declined due to increased
tax-exempt income.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2003 COMPARED TO 2002: Net income for the year ended
December 31, 2003 increased 3 percent to 12.3 million compared to 11.9 million
earned in 2002. Diluted earnings per share increased 2 percent to 1.47 per
share from 1.45 per share earned in 2002. The increase in net income for 2003
was primarily due to higher Trust fees, other income and net security gains,
offset in part by lower net interest income, higher salaries and benefits, and
premises and equipment expense. These results produced a return on average
assets of 1.34 percent as compared to 1.53 percent in 2002 and a return on
average shareholders' equity of 15.14 percent as compared to 17.06 percent in
2002.

17

Net interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, declined from 32.4
million in 2002 to 31.8 million in 2003. While average earning assets increased
 126.3 million or 17 percent from the average balances in 2002, the interest
earned on these assets declined. Interest expense declined 1.8 million or 15
percent over the levels recorded in 2002 on average balances of interest-bearing
liabilities that increased 103.2 million or 18 percent. Lower rates were earned
on earning assets in 2003, declining to 4.88 percent from 6.04 percent earned in
2002, Lower rates were paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which declined from
2.05 percent to 1.49 percent. In 2003, the net interest margin declined to 3.69
percent from 4.40 percent in 2002.

 Other income before gains and losses on securities was 8.8 million in
2003, an increase of 15 percent over 2002 levels. This increase was primarily
due to higher trust fees and additions to cash surrender value of Bank Owned
Life Insurance (BOLI). Trust fees rose 1.1 million or 23 percent over the
levels recorded in 2002. This increase is attributable to increased volume of
business as the book value of assets under management increased 89.2 million or
9 percent over 2002 levels. In 2003, other income of 880 thousand was realized
on increased cash surrender value of BOLI to assist in offsetting the rising
costs of employee benefits as compared to 791 thousand in 2002. For the year
ended December 31, 2003, net securities gains were 1.3 million as compared to
 52 thousand recorded in 2002.

 Other expense totaled 22.5 million in 2003, an increase of 1.5 million
or 7 percent compared to 21.1 million in 2002. This increase is commensurate
with the level of growth in the Bank and PGB Trust and Investments business
activity.

 Salaries and benefits expense increased 1.1 million, or 9 percent, to
 12.6 million from 11.6 million in 2002. This increase was related to increased
officer and staff levels, normal merit increases, promotional raises and higher
benefit costs. The full-time equivalent number of employees rose to 209 at
December 31, 2003 from 205 at December 31, 2002.

 Premises and equipment expense increased to 4.8 million from 4.2 million
in 2002. This increase was primarily due to the Corporation's continued
investment in technology, as the Bank converted to a new core processing system
in 2003. Higher occupancy expenses were attributable to costs associated with a
new branch location and a new operations center, which opened in 2004.

 Professional fees declined 155 thousand as compared to 2002. In 2002, the
Corporation had higher legal and consulting fees to support the expansion in
business activity, as well as costs associated with internal training programs
and services to enhance audit and financial controls.

CAPITAL RESOURCES: The solid capital base of the Corporation provides the
ability for future growth and financial strength. Maintaining a strong capital
position supports the Corporation's goal of providing shareholders an attractive
and stable long-term return on investment. Total shareholders' equity grew 9.6
million or 11 percent to 94.7 million as compared with 85.1 million at
December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004, net unrealized gains on securities, net
of taxes, were 1.4 million as compared to net unrealized gains on securities,
net of taxes, of 2.7 million at December 31, 2003. Federal regulations require
banks to meet target Tier 1 and total capital ratios of 4 percent and 8 percent,
respectively. The Corporation's Tier 1 and total capital ratios are well in
excess of regulatory minimums at 19.02 percent and 20.25 percent, respectively.
The Corporation's capital leverage ratio was 9.18 percent at December 31, 2004.

18

LIQUIDITY: Liquidity refers to an institution's ability to meet short-term
requirements in the form of loan requests, deposit withdrawals and maturing
obligations. Principal sources of liquidity include cash, temporary investments
and securities available for sale.

 Management feels the Corporation's liquidity position is sufficient to
meet future needs. Cash and cash equivalents, including federal funds sold and
interest bearing deposits, averaged 26.6 million in 2004. In addition, the
Corporation has 354.2 million in securities designated as available for sale.
These securities can be sold in response to liquidity concerns. As of December
31, 2004, investment securities and securities available for sale maturing
within one year amounted to 31.0 million and cash and cash equivalents totaled
 15.7 million.

 Another source of liquidity is borrowing capacity. The Corporation has a
variety of sources of short-term liquidity available, including short and
long-term borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, short-term
borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window, federal funds
purchased from correspondent banks and loan participation or sales of loans. The
Corporation also generates liquidity from the regular principal payments made on
its loan portfolio and on its mortgage-backed security portfolio.

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY: Interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the
relationship between interest-earning assets and supporting funds, which are
susceptible to changes in interest rates during comparable time periods.
Interest rate movements on deposits have made managing the Corporation's
interest rate sensitivity increasingly more important as a means of managing net
interest income. The Corporation's Asset/Liability Committee is responsible for
managing the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The "sensitivity" gap
quantifies the repricing mismatch between assets and supporting funds over
various time intervals. The cumulative gap position as a percentage of total
rate-sensitive assets provides one relative measure of the Corporation's
interest rate exposure.

 The Corporation's ratio of rate-sensitive assets to rate-sensitive
liabilities was approximately 0.62 on December 31, 2004 for the next twelve
months subject to certain assumptions explained in the following paragraph.
Since this ratio is less than 1.00, the Corporation has a "negative gap"
position, which may cause its assets to reprice more slowly than its deposit
liabilities. In a declining interest rate environment, interest costs may be
expected to fall faster than the interest received on earning assets, thus
increasing the net interest spread. If interest rates increase, a negative gap
means that the interest received on earning assets may be expected to increase
more slowly than the interest paid on the Corporation's liabilities, therefore
decreasing the net interest spread. Management does not view this amount as
presenting an unusually high risk potential, although no assurances can be given
that the Corporation is not at risk from interest rate increases or decreases.

 Expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for all projected
payments of principal. For investment securities, loans and long-term debt,
expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity or call dates, projected
repayments and prepayments of principal. The prepayment experience reflected
herein is based on historical experience combined with market consensus
expectations derived from independent external sources. The actual maturities of
these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from
historical experience. For non-maturity deposit liabilities, in accordance with
standard industry practice and the Corporation's own historical experience,
"decay factors" were used to estimate deposit runoff.

(1) LOAN BALANCES DO NOT INCLUDE NONACCRUAL LOANS.

MARKET RISK SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS: A derivative financial instrument includes
futures, forwards, interest rate swaps, option contracts and other financial
instruments with similar characteristics. The Corporation currently does not
enter into futures, forwards, swaps or options. However, the Corporation is
party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course
of business to meet the financing needs of the customers of the Corporation.
These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby
letters of credit. These instruments involve to varying degrees, elements of
credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the
consolidated statements of condition. Commitments to extend credit are
agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any
condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed
expiration dates and may require collateral from the borrower if deemed
necessary by the Corporation. Standby letters of credit are conditional
commitments issued by the Corporation to guarantee the performance of a customer
to a third party up to a stipulated amount and with specified terms and
conditions.

 Commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are not
recorded as an asset or liability by the Corporation until the instrument is
exercised.

 The Corporation's exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis
by the Asset/Liability Committee. Interest rate risk is the potential of
economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can
be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current
fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest
income and to adjust the statement of condition to minimize the inherent risk
while at the same time maximize income. Management realizes certain risks are
inherent and that the goal is to identify and minimize the risks. Tools used by
management include the standard GAP report and interest rate shock simulation
report. The Corporation has no market risk sensitive instruments held for
trading purposes. Management believes the Corporation's market risk is
reasonable at this time.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES: The financial statements and related
financial data presented herein have been prepared in terms of historical
dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money
over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of
the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As
a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial
institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do
not necessarily move in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services.

 The Corporation believes residential real estate values have stabilized,
however, if real estate prices in the Corporation's trade area decrease, the
values of real estate collateralizing the Corporation's loans and real estate
held by the Corporation as other real estate owned could also be adversely
affected.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS: Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, addresses the accounting
for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee
services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b)
liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise's equity
instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments.
Statement 123(R) requires an entity to recognize the grant-date fair-value of
stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees in the
income statement. The revised Statement generally requires that an entity
account for those transactions using the fair-value-based method, and eliminates
an entity's ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using
the intrinsic value method of accounting in APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, which was permitted under Statement 123, as
originally issued. The revised Statement requires entities to disclose
information about the nature of the share-based payment transactions and the
effects of those transactions on the financial statements. Statement 123(R) is
effective for the Corporation beginning July 1, 2005. The Corporation must use
either the modified prospective or the modified retrospective transition method.
Early adoption of this Statement for interim or annual periods for which
financial statements or interim reports have not been issued is permitted. The
Corporation is currently evaluating the transition provisions of Statement
123(R), the adoption of which will lower reported net income and earnings per
share. The Corporation does not know the full impact on the consolidated
financial statements at this time.

21

The guidance in EITF 03-1, the Meaning of Other-than-Temporary Impairment
and its Application to Certain Investments, was effective for
other-than-temporary impairment evaluations made in reporting periods beginning
after June 15, 2004. However, the guidance contained in paragraphs 10-20 of the
Issue has been delayed by FSP EITF Issue 03-1-1, The Effective Date of
Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, posted on September 30,
2004. The disclosure requirements continue to be effective in annual financial
statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. The Corporation will
evaluate the impact on its consolidated financial statements, if any, when the
recognition and measurement requirements for other-than-temporary impairment are
finalized.

PGB TRUST AND INVESTMENTS: PGB Trust and Investments, a division of the Bank,
since its inception in 1972 has served in the roles of executor and trustee
while providing investment management, custodial, tax, retirement, and financial
services to its growing client base. Officers from PGB Trust and Investments are
now available to provide investment services at the Bank's Morristown Branch,
which opened in November 2004.

 The book value of assets under management in PGB Trust and Investments
increased from 1.1 billion at December 31, 2003, to 1.2 billion at December
31, 2004, an increase of 9 percent. The corresponding market value at December
31, 2004 was in excess of 1.7 billion. Fee income generated by PGB Trust and
Investments was 6.7 million, 5.8 million and 4.7 million in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

MANAGEMENT REPORT

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

 Management of the Corporation is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The
Corporation's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable
assurance to the Corporation's management and board of directors regarding the
preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All
internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation.

 Management assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this
assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. Based upon our assessment we believe that, as of December 31, 2004,
the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting is effective based
upon those criteria. The Corporation's independent auditors have issued an audit
report on our assessment of, and the effective operation of, the Corporation's
internal control over financial reporting. This report begins on the next page.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS PEAPACK-GLADSTONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION:

 We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that
Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation and subsidiary (the "Corporation")
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Management of the Corporation is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

 A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

27

In our opinion, management's assessment that Peapack-Gladstone Financial
Corporation and subsidiary maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
COSO. Also, in our opinion, Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation and
subsidiary maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements
of condition of Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation and subsidiary as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income,
changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2004, and our report dated March 2, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS PEAPACK-GLADSTONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION:

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition of
Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation and subsidiary (the "Corporation") as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income,
changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2004. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation and subsidiary as of December 31, 2004
and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of
Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation and subsidiary's internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 2,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management's assessment of, and the
effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND ORGANIZATION: The consolidated financial
statements of the Corporation are prepared on the accrual basis and include the
accounts of the Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, Peapack-Gladstone
Bank. The consolidated statements also include the Bank's wholly owned
subsidiaries, Peapack-Gladstone Investment Company and its wholly owned
subsidiary, Peapack-Gladstone Mortgage Group, Inc. While the following footnotes
include the collective results of Peapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation and
Peapack-Gladstone Bank, these footnotes primarily reflect the Bank's and its
subsidiaries' activities. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated from the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

BUSINESS: Peapack-Gladstone Bank, the subsidiary of the Corporation, provides a
full range of banking services to individual and corporate customers through its
branch operations in central New Jersey. The Bank is subject to competition from
other financial institutions, is regulated by certain federal and state agencies
and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities.

BASIS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION: The consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. In preparing the financial statements,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities as of the date of the statement of condition and revenues and
expenses for that period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: For purposes of the statements of cash flows, cash
and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks and federal funds sold.
Generally, federal funds are sold for one-day periods.

SECURITIES: Investment securities are comprised of debt securities that the
Corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Such
securities are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of premium and
accretion of discount on the level-yield method, over the term of the
investments.

 Securities that cannot be categorized as investment securities are
classified as securities available for sale. Such securities include debt
securities to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held
to maturity, as well as marketable equity securities. Securities held for
indefinite periods of time include securities that management intends to use as
part of its asset/liability management strategy and that may be sold in response
to changes in interest rates, resultant prepayment risk and other factors
related to interest rate and resultant prepayment risk changes. Securities
available for sale are carried at estimated market value and unrealized holding
gains and losses (net of related tax effects) on such securities are excluded
from earnings, but are included in Shareholders' Equity as Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income. Upon realization, such gains or losses are included in
earnings on a trade-date basis using the specific identification method.

 A decline in the estimated market value of any security below cost that is
deemed other-than-temporary results in a reduction in the carrying amount to
estimated market value. The impairment loss is charged to earnings and a new
cost basis of the security is established. In determining whether an impairment
is other-than-temporary, the Corporation considers, among other things, the
duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year end, forecasted
performance of the issuer and the Corporation's intent and ability to hold the
security until a market price recovery.

35

LOANS: Loans are stated at the principal amount outstanding. Loan origination
fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and recognized over
the life of the loan as an adjustment (on a level-yield method) to the loan's
yield. The accrual of income on loans, including impaired loans, is discontinued
if certain factors indicate reasonable doubt as to the timely collectibility of
such interest, generally when the loan becomes over 90 days delinquent. A
non-accrual loan is not returned to an accrual status until factors indicating
doubtful collection no longer exist. The majority of the loans are secured by
real estate located within the Corporation's market area in New Jersey.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES: The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a
level considered adequate to provide for probable loan losses inherent in the
portfolio. The allowance is based on management's evaluation of the loan
portfolio considering economic conditions, the volume and nature of the loan
portfolio, historical loan loss experience, and individual credit situations.
The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and reduced by net
charge-offs.

 Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate. While
management uses available information to recognize loan losses, future additions
to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions. In
addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination
process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may
require the Corporation to recognize additions to the allowance based on their
judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations.

 Management, considering current information and events regarding the
borrowers' ability to repay their obligations, considers a loan to be impaired
when it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts
due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is
considered to be impaired, the amount of impairment is measured based on the
fair value of the collateral. Impairment losses are included in the allowance
for loan losses through provisions charged to operations.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT: Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation charges are computed using the
straight-line method. Premises and equipment are depreciated over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are
expensed as incurred. The cost of major renewals and improvements are
capitalized. Gains or losses realized on routine dispositions are recorded as
other income or other expense.

OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED: Other real estate owned is carried at fair value minus
estimated costs to sell, based on an independent appraisal. When a property is
acquired, the excess of the loan balance over the estimated fair value is
charged to the allowance for loan losses. Any subsequent write-downs that may be
required to the carrying value of the properties or losses on the sale of
properties are charged to the valuation allowance on other real estate owned or
to other expense.

INCOME TAXES: The Corporation files a consolidated Federal income tax return.
Separate State income tax returns are filed for each subsidiary based on current
laws and regulations.

 The Corporation recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in its
financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of deferred tax assets and
liabilities is based on the enacted tax rates applicable to taxable income for
the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. Such tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effect of a change
in tax rates in the period of enactment.

STOCK OPTION PLANS: At December 31, 2004, the Corporation had stock-based
employee and non-employee director compensation plans, which are described more
fully in Note 12. The Corporation accounts for those plans under the recognition
and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related Interpretations.

36

No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income as
all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market
value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant.

 The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per
share if the Corporation had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based
employee compensation:

EARNINGS PER SHARE: The numerator of both the Basic and Diluted EPS is
equivalent to net income. The weighted average number of shares outstanding used
in the denominator for Diluted EPS is increased over the denominator used for
Basic EPS by the effect of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents
utilizing the treasury stock method. Common stock equivalents are common stock
options outstanding.

 All share and per share amounts included in this report have been restated
to reflect the 10 percent stock dividend in 2004.

 The following table shows the calculation of both Basic and Diluted
earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:

Management has determined that these unrealized losses are temporary and
due to interest rate fluctuations rather than the credit ratings of the issuers.
The Corporation has a policy to purchase only from issuers with an investment
grade credit rating and monitors credit ratings periodically.

 The unrealized losses on investments in mortgage-backed securities were
caused by interest rate increases. The contractual cash flows of these
securities are guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies. It is expected
that the securities would not be settled at a price substantially less than the
amortized cost of the investment. Because the decline in fair value is
attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because
the Corporation has the intent to hold these investments until maturity, these
investments are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired.

 Most of the securities issued by state and political subdivisions in the
table above are issued by municipalities located in New Jersey and have had
unrealized losses for six months or less. These investments represent purchases
in municipal bonds, which generally have lower coupons; however many are not
taxable by the Federal government and their effective yield is higher. Because
the Corporation intends to hold these securities to mature at par, no loss is
anticipated.

Management has determined that these unrealized losses are temporary and
due to interest rate fluctuations and volatility rather than the credit ratings
of the issuers. The Corporation has a policy to purchase only from issuers with
an investment grade credit rating and monitors credit ratings periodically.

 The unrealized losses on investments in U.S. government-sponsored agency
bonds were caused by interest rate increases. The contractual terms of these
investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less
than the amortized cost of the investment. Because the Corporation has the
ability and intent to hold these investments until a market price recovery or
maturity, these investments are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired.

 The other securities with unrealized losses caused by interest rate
increases are adjustable and will price to par at the time of the rate reset.
The Corporation has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a
market price recovery or maturity; therefore these investments are not
considered other-than-temporarily impaired.

================================================================================

 Non-accrual loans totaled 351 thousand and 159 thousand at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. At December 31, 2004, there were no loans past due
90 days or more and still accruing; however, at December 31, 2003 there were 56
thousand. There are no commitments to lend additional amounts on non-accrual
loans. The amount of interest income recognized on year-end non-accrual loans
totaled 14 thousand, 3 thousand and 5 thousand in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Interest income of 11 thousand, 11 thousand and 12 thousand
would have been recognized during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, under
contractual terms for such non-accrual loans.

 The Corporation defines an impaired loan as an investment in a loan that
is on non-accrual status with a principal outstanding balance in excess of 100
thousand. Residential mortgage loans, a group of homogeneous loans that are
collectively evaluated for impairment, and consumer loans are excluded. There
were no impaired loans during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

amount outstanding at any month end during 2004 and 2003 was 48.3 million and
 33.6 million, respectively.

9. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

 The Corporation discloses estimated fair values for its significant
financial instruments. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the
Corporation's financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments
regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk
characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These
estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of
significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes
in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

43

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of significant financial instruments:

CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS - The carrying amount of cash and short-term
investments is considered to be fair value.

SECURITIES - The fair value of securities is based upon quoted market prices.

LOANS - The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash
flows using the buildup approach consisting of four components: the risk-free
rate, credit quality, operating expense and prepayment option price.

DEPOSITS - The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as demand
deposits, checking accounts, savings and money market accounts, is equal to the
carrying amount. The fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the
discounted value of contractual cash flows.

LONG-TERM DEBT - The fair value of FHLB advances is based on the discounted
value of estimated cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates
currently offered for similar remaining advance terms.

 The following table summarizes carrying amounts and fair values for
financial instruments at December 31:

11. BENEFIT PLANS

PENSION PLAN:

 The Corporation has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially
all of its salaried employees. The benefits are based on an employee's
compensation during the five years before retirement, age at retirement and
years of service. The Corporation makes annual contributions to the plan equal
to the maximum amount that can be deducted for income tax purposes.

 The Plan's Trustees are granted full discretion to buy, sell, invest and
reinvest in accordance with the pension plan's investment policy. The Trustees
establish target asset allocations for equity and debt securities at their
regular committee meetings. Cash equivalents are invested in money market funds
or in other high quality investments approved by the Trustees of the Plan.

 The Corporation expects to contribute 1.3 million to its pension plan in
2005.

SAVINGS AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS

 In addition to the retirement plan, the Corporation sponsors a profit
sharing plan and a savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue
Code, covering substantially all salaried employees over the age of 21 with at
least 12 months service. Under the savings portion of the plan, employee
contributions are partially matched by the Corporation. Expense for the savings
plan was approximately 37 thousand, 36 thousand and 33 thousand in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. Contributions to the profit sharing portion are made at
the discretion of the Board of Directors and all funds are invested solely in
Peapack-Gladstone Corporation common stock. The contribution to the profit
sharing plan was 425 thousand in 2004, 375 thousand in 2003 and 350 thousand
in 2002.

13. COMMITMENTS

 The Corporation, in the ordinary course of business, is a party to
litigation arising from the conduct of its business. Management does not
consider that these actions depart from routine legal proceedings and believes
that such actions will not affect its financial position or results of its
operations in any material manner. There are various outstanding commitments and
contingencies, such as guarantees and credit extensions, including loan
commitments of 71.7 million and 69.4 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, which are not included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.

 The Corporation issues financial standby letters of credit that are within
the scope of FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others." These are irrevocable undertakings by the Corporation to guarantee
payment of a specified financial obligation. Most of the Corporation's financial
standby letters of credit arise in connection with lending relationships and
have terms of one year or less. The maximum potential future payments the
Corporation could be required to make equals the contract amount of the standby
letters of credit and amounted to 3.1 million and 5.5 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The Corporation's recognized liability for
financial standby letters of credit was insignificant at December 31, 2004.

 For commitments to originate loans, the Corporation's maximum exposure to
credit risk is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Those
commitments represent ultimate exposure to credit risk only to the extent that
they are subsequently drawn upon by customers. The Corporation uses the same
credit policies and underwriting standards in making loan commitments as it does
for on-balance-sheet instruments. For loan commitments, the Corporation would
generally be exposed to interest rate risk from the time a commitment is issued
with a defined contractual interest rate.

 At December 31, 2004, the Corporation was obligated under non-cancelable
operating leases for certain premises. Rental expense aggregated 2.0 million,
 1.5 million and 1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively, which is included in premises and equipment expense in the
consolidated statements of income.

 The minimum annual lease payments under the terms of the lease agreements,
as of December 31, 2004, were as follows:

14. REGULATORY CAPITAL

 The Corporation and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital
requirements administered by the Federal banking agencies. Failure to meet
minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly
additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a
direct material effect on the Corporation and the Bank's consolidated financial
statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for
prompt corrective action, the Corporation and the Bank must meet specific
capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Corporation's and
the Bank's assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated
under regulatory accounting practices. The Corporation's and the Bank's capital
amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the
regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors.

 Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
require the Corporation and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of
total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets
(as defined), and of Tier I capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined).
Management believes, as of December 31, 2004, that the Corporation and the Bank
meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.

 As of December 31, 2004, the Corporation and the Bank met all requirements
to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt
corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Corporation and
the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based and Tier I
leverage ratios as set forth in the table.

 The Corporation's actual capital amounts and ratios are presented in the
table.
