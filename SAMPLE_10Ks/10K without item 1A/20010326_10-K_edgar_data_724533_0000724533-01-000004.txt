Development and Description of Business
- ---------------------------------------

 Information concerning the business of American Insured Mortgage Investors
(the "Partnership") is contained in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Notes 1, 5, 6
and 7 of the Notes to Financial Statements of the Partnership (filed in response
to Item 8 hereof), all of which are incorporated by reference herein. See also
Schedule IV-Mortgage Loans on Real Estate for the table of the Insured Mortgages
(as defined below) invested in by the Partnership as of December 31, 2000, which
is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

Employees
- ---------

 The Partnership has no employees. The business of the Partnership is
managed by CRIIMI, Inc. (the "General Partner"), while its portfolio of
mortgages is managed by AIM Acquisition Partners, L.P. (the "Advisor") pursuant
to an advisory agreement (the "Advisory Agreement'). The General Partner is a
wholly owned subsidiary of CRIIMI MAE Inc. ("CRIIMI MAE").

 The general partner of the Advisor is AIM Acquisition Corporation ("AIM
Acquisition") and the limited partners include, but are not limited to, AIM
Acquisition, The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P., Sun America Investments, Inc.
(successor to Broad, Inc.) and CRI/AIM Investment, L.P., an affiliate of CRIIMI
MAE. AIM Acquisition is a Delaware corporation that is primarily owned by Sun
America Investments, Inc. and The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P.

 Under the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor will render services to the
Partnership, including but not limited to, the management of the Partnership's
portfolio of mortgages and the disposition of the Partnership's mortgages. Such
services will be subject to the review and ultimate authority of the General
Partner. However, the General Partner is required to receive the consent of the
Advisor prior to taking certain significant actions, including but not limited
to the disposition of mortgages, any transaction or agreement with the General
Partner, or its affiliates, or any material change as to policies regarding
distributions or reserves of the Partnership. The Advisor is permitted to
delegate the performance of services pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement (the
"Sub-Advisory Agreement"). The delegation of such services will not relieve the
Advisor of its obligation to perform such services. CRIIMI MAE Services Limited
Partnership ("CMSLP"), an affiliate of CRIIMI MAE, manages the Partnership's
portfolio, pursuant to the Sub-Advisory Agreement. The general partner of CMSLP
is CRIIMI MAE Services, Inc., an affiliate of CRIIMI MAE.

Competition
- -----------

 In disposing of mortgage investments, the Partnership competes with private
investors, mortgage banking companies, mortgage brokers, state and local
government agencies, lending institutions, trust funds, pension funds, and other
entities, some with similar objectives to those of the Partnership and some of
which are or may be affiliates of the Partnership, its General Partner, the
Advisor, CMSLP or their respective affiliates. Some of these entities may have
substantially greater capital resources and experience in disposing of Federal
Housing Administration ("FHA") insured mortgages than the Partnership.

 CRIIMI MAE and its affiliates also may serve as general partners, sponsors
or managers of real estate limited partnerships, REITS or other entities in the
future. The Partnership may attempt to dispose of mortgage investments at or
about the same time that CRIIMI MAE, one or more of the "AIM Funds" (defined as
the Partnership, American Insured Mortgage Investors - Series 85, L.P. ("AIM
85"), American Insured Mortgage Investors L.P. - Series 86 ("AIM 86") and
American Insured Mortgage Investors L.P. - Series 88 ("AIM 88")), and/or other
entities sponsored or managed by CRIIMI MAE or its affiliates, are attempting to
dispose of mortgages. As a result of market conditions that could limit
dispositions, CMSLP and its affiliates could be faced with conflicts of interest
in determining which mortgages would be disposed of. Both CMSLP and the General
Partner, however, are subject to their fiduciary duties in evaluating the
appropriate action to be taken when faced with such conflicts.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

 Although the Partnership does not own the underlying real estate, the
mortgages underlying the Partnership's mortgage investments are non-recourse
first liens on the respective multifamily residential developments.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 There are no material legal proceedings to which the Partnership is a
party.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

 No matters were submitted to the security holders to be voted on during the
fourth quarter of 2000.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General
- -------

 The following discussion and analysis contains statements that may be
considered forward looking. These statements contain a number of risks and
uncertainties as discussed herein and in Item 1 of this Form 10-K that could
cause actual results to differ materially.

 The American Insured Mortgage Investors (the "Partnership") was formed
under the Uniform Limited Partnership Act in the State of California on July 12,
1983. During the period from March 1, 1984 (the initial closing date of the
Partnership's public offering) through December 31, 1984, the Partnership,
pursuant to its public offering of 10,000,000 depositary units of limited
partnership interest ("Units"), raised a total of 200,000,000 in gross
proceeds. In addition, the initial limited partner contributed 2,500 to the
capital of the Partnership and received 125 Units of limited partnership
interest in exchange therefor.

 CRIIMI, Inc. (the "General Partner") holds a partnership interest of 2.9 
and is a wholly owned subsidiary of CRIIMI MAE Inc. ("CRIIMI MAE"). AIM
Acquisition Partners, L.P. (the "Advisor") serves as the advisor to the
Partnership pursuant to an advisory agreement (the "Advisory Agreement").

 The general partner of the Advisor is AIM Acquisition Corporation ("AIM
Acquisition") and the limited partners include, but are not limited to, AIM
Acquisition, The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P., Sun America Investments, Inc.
(successor to Broad, Inc.) and CRI/AIM Investment, L.P., an affiliate of CRIIMI
MAE. AIM Acquisition is a Delaware corporation that is primarily owned by Sun
America Investments, Inc. and The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P.

 Under the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor will render services to the
Partnership, including but not limited to, the management of the Partnership's
portfolio of mortgages and the disposition of the Partnership's mortgages. Such
services will be subject to the review and ultimate authority of the General
Partner. However, the General Partner is required to receive the consent of the
Advisor prior to taking certain significant actions, including but not limited
to the disposition of mortgages, any transaction or agreement with the General
Partner, or its affiliates, or any material change as to policies regarding
distributions or reserves of the Partnership. The Advisor is permitted to
delegate the performance of services pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement (the
"Sub-Advisory Agreement"). The delegation of such services will not relieve the
Advisor of its obligation to perform such services. CRIIMI MAE Services Limited
Partnership ("CMSLP"), an affiliate of CRIIMI MAE, manages the Partnership's
portfolio, pursuant to the Sub-Advisory Agreement. The general partner of CMSLP
is CRIIMI MAE Services, Inc., an affiliate of CRIIMI MAE.

Mortgage Investments
- --------------------

 Prior to the expiration of the Partnership's reinvestment period in
November 1988, the Partnership was engaged in the business of originating
mortgage loans ("Originated Insured Mortgages") and acquiring mortgage loans
("Acquired Insured Mortgages" and, together with Originated Insured Mortgages,
referred to herein as "Insured Mortgages"). In accordance with the terms of the
partnership agreement, the Partnership is no longer authorized to originate or
acquire Insured Mortgages and, consequently, its primary objective is to manage
its portfolio of mortgage investments, all of which are insured (as discussed
below) under Section 221(d)(4) or Section 231 of the National Housing Act of
1937, as amended (the "National Housing Act"). The Partnership is a liquidating
partnership and as it continues to liquidate its mortgage investments and
investors receive distributions of return of capital and taxable gains,
investors should expect a reduction in earnings and distributions due to the
decreasing mortgage base. The partnership agreement states that the Partnership
will terminate on December 31, 2008, unless previously terminated under the
provisions of the partnership agreement.

 As of December 31, 2000, the Partnership had invested in 11 Insured
Mortgages, with an aggregate amortized cost of approximately 22 million, a face
value of approximately 26 million and a fair value of approximately 25
million, as discussed below.

Investment in Insured Mortgages
- -------------------------------

 The Partnership's investment in Insured Mortgages consists of FHA-insured
mortgage loans ("FHA-Insured Loans") and participation certificates evidencing a
100 undivided beneficial interest in government insured multifamily mortgages
issued or sold pursuant to Federal Housing Administration ("FHA") programs
("FHA-Insured Certificates"). The mortgages underlying the FHA-Insured
Certificates and FHA-Insured Loans are non-recourse first liens on multifamily
residential developments.

 The following is a discussion of the types of the Partnership's mortgage
investments, along with the risks related to each type of investment:

Investment in FHA-Insured Loans
- -------------------------------

 Listed below is the Partnership's aggregate investment in FHA-Insured Loans
as of December 31, 2000 and 1999:

December 31,
 2000 1999
 ---- ----
 
Number of
 Acquired Insured Mortgages 3 3
 Originated Insured Mortgage 1 1
Amortized Cost 12,597,098 12,751,028
Face Value 14,694,371 14,941,299
Fair Value 14,222,808 14,215,731

All of the FHA-Insured Loans were current with respect to the payment of
principal and interest as of February 16, 2001.

 In addition to base interest payments received from Originated Insured
Mortgages, the Partnership is entitled to additional interest based on a
percentage of the net cash flow from the underlying development and of the net
proceeds from the refinancing, sale or other disposition of the underlying
development (referred to as "Participations"). During the years ended December
31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Partnership received 0, 0 and 52,526,
respectively, from the Participations. These amounts, if any, are included in
mortgage investment income on the accompanying statements of income and
comprehensive income.

Investment in FHA-Insured Certificates
- --------------------------------------

 Listed below is the Partnership's aggregate investment in FHA-Insured
Certificates as of December 31, 2000 and 1999:

Fair Value 11,258,675 12,468,348

(1) In December 2000, HUD issued assignment proceeds in the form of a 7.125 
 debenture for the mortgage on Fox Run Apartments. This mortgage was owned
 50 by AIM 84 and 50 by an affiliate of the Partnership, American Insured
 Investors - Series 85, L.P. (AIM 85). The debenture, with a face value of
 2,385,233 and a fair value of 2,361,381, was issued to AIM 85 and will
 earn interest semi-annually on January 1 and July 1. The Partnership
 expects to receive net proceeds of approximately 1.2 million and has
 recognized a gain of approximately 188,000 for the year ended December 31,
 2000. The net proceeds and accrued interest are included on the Balance
 Sheet in Due from affiliate. In general, AIM 85 will hold the debenture
 until its maturity date of June 1, 2010 or when called, whichever comes
 first. A distribution will be declared at that time. The servicer of this
 mortgage filed an application for insurance benefits under the Section 221
 program of the National Housing Act of 1937 in May 2000.

 All of the FHA-Insured Certificates were current with respect to the
payment of principal and interest as of February 16, 2001.

Results of Operations
- ---------------------
2000 versus 1999
- ----------------

 Net earnings increased for 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily due to an
increase in gains on mortgage dispositions. In 2000, a gain of approximately
 188,000 was realized on the assignment of the mortgage on Fox Run Apartments,
as discussed above. In 1999, a gain of approximately 67,000 was recognized from
the prepayment of the mortgage on Lakeside Apartments.

 Mortgage investment income decreased slightly for 2000 as compared to 1999
primarily due to the normal amortization of the mortgage base. In addition, the
mortgage base decreased due to one mortgage disposition in November 1999 with a
principal balance of approximately 382,000. This represents an approximate 1.4 
decrease in the aggregate principal balance of the total mortgage portfolio
since October 1999.

 Interest and other income decreased for 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily
due to the timing of temporary investment of mortgage disposition proceeds prior
to distribution.

 General and administrative expenses decreased for 2000 as compared to 1999
primarily due to a decrease in temporary employment costs.

1999 versus 1998
- ----------------

 Net earnings decreased for 1999 as compared to 1998 primarily due to a
reduction in mortgage investment income and a decrease in gains on mortgage
dispositions, as discussed below.

 Mortgage investment income decreased for 1999 as compared 1998, primarily
due to the disposition of the mortgages on Portervillage I Apartments in March
1998, Waters Edge Apartments in September 1998 and Lakeside Apartments in
November 1999.

 Interest and other income decreased for 1999 as compared to 1998, primarily
due to the timing of temporary investment of mortgage disposition proceeds prior
to distributions.

 Asset management fees to related parties decreased for 1999 as compared
1998, due to the reduction in the mortgage base.

 General and administrative expenses increased for 1999 as compared 1998,
primarily due to increased temporary employment costs and an increase in the
cost structure of certain expenses.

 Gains on mortgage dispositions decreased for 1999 as compared 1998. In
1999, a gain of approximately 67,000 was recognized from the prepayment of the
mortgage on Lakeside Apartments. In 1998, a gain of approximately 1.1 million
was recognized from the prepayment of the mortgage on Waters Edge Apartments.
Also in 1998, a gain of approximately 200,000 was recognized from the
assignment of the mortgage on Portervillage I Apartments. The assignment
proceeds were issued in the form of a 9.5 debenture. This mortgage was owned
50 by the Partnership and 50 by an affiliate of the Partnership, American
Insured Mortgage Investors - Series 85, L.P. ("AIM 85"). The debenture, with a
face value of 2,296,098, was issued to AIM 85 and earned interest semi-annually
on January 1 and July 1. In January 1999, the debenture was redeemed and the net
proceeds of approximately 1.1 million were received and distributed by the
Partnership.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
- -------------------------------

 On October 5, 1998, CRIIMI MAE, the parent of the General Partner, and
CRIIMI MAE Management, Inc., an affiliate of CRIIMI MAE and provider of
personnel and administrative services to the Partnership, filed voluntary
petitions for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the
"Bankruptcy Code"). Such bankruptcy filings could result in certain adverse
effects to the Partnership. For example, as a debtor-in-possession, CRIIMI MAE
will not be permitted to provide any available capital to the General Partner or
to the general partner of CMSLP, the Partnership's sub-advisor, without approval
from the Bankruptcy Court. Even though this restriction or potential loss of the
availability of a potential capital resource could adversely affect the General
Partner and the Partnership, CRIIMI MAE has not historically represented a
significant source of capital for the General Partner or the Partnership. Such
bankruptcy filings could also result in the potential need to replace CRIIMI MAE
Management, Inc. as a provider of personnel and administrative services to the
Partnership.

 On November 22, 2000, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District
of Maryland, in Greenbelt, Maryland (the "Bankruptcy Court") confirmed CRIIMI
MAE's and CRIIMI MAE Management, Inc.'s Third Amended Joint Plan of
Reorganization (as amended and supplemented by praecipes filed with the
Bankruptcy Court on July 13, 14 and 21, and November 22, 2000, the "Plan").
CRIIMI MAE is working to complete the debt documentation, evidencing the secured
financings to be provided by (1) the unsecured creditors, and (2) Merrill Lynch
Mortgage Capital, Inc. and German American Capital Corporation (collectively the
"New Debt Documents"). On March 9, 2001, the Bankruptcy Court approved an
extension of the date by which the Plan must be effective to April 13, 2001. The
Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors had previously filed its own plan of
reorganization and proposed disclosure statement, but has asked the Bankruptcy
Court, subject to completion of mutually acceptable debt documentation, to defer
consideration of its plan and proposed disclosure statement. There can be no
assurance at this time that CRIIMI MAE will be able to complete the New Debt
Documents and effectuate the Plan by April 13, 2001.

The Partnership's operating cash receipts, derived from payments of
principal and interest on Insured Mortgages plus cash receipts from interest on
short-term investments, are the Partnership's principal sources of cash flows,
and were sufficient for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 to meet
operating requirements. The Partnership anticipates its cash flows to be
sufficient to meet operating expense requirements for 2001.

 The basis for paying distributions to Unitholders is net proceeds from
mortgage dispositions, if any, and cash flow from operations, which includes
regular interest income and principal from Insured Mortgages after paying all
expenses of the Partnership. Although Insured Mortgages yield a fixed monthly
mortgage payment once purchased, the cash distributions paid to the Unitholders
will vary during each period due to (1) the fluctuating yields in the short-term
money market where the monthly mortgage payment receipts are temporarily
invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions, (2) the reduction in
the asset base resulting from monthly mortgage payments received or mortgage
dispositions, (3) variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or
default of Insured Mortgages and professional fees and foreclosure costs
incurred in connection with those Insured Mortgages and (4) variations in the
Partnership's operating expenses.

 Since the Partnership is obligated to distribute the Proceeds of Mortgage
Prepayments, Sales and Insurance of Insured Mortgages (as defined in the
partnership agreement) to its Unitholders, the size of the Partnership's
portfolio will continue to decrease. The magnitude of the decrease will depend
upon the size of the Insured Mortgages, which are prepaid, sold or assigned for
insurance proceeds.

Cash Flow - 2000 versus 1999
- ----------------------------

 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased for 2000 as compared to
1999, primarily due to an increase in the change in due from affiliate,
receivables and other assets. This change is primarily due to the timing of the
receipt of interest on debentures received from affiliate.

 Net cash provided by investing activities decreased for 2000 as compared to
1999, due to the decrease in proceeds from mortgage dispositions and a decrease
in debenture proceeds received from affiliate.

 Net cash used in financing activities decreased for 2000 as compared to
1999 due to a decrease in distributions paid to partners as a result of
decreases discussed above.

Cash Flow - 1999 versus 1998
- ----------------------------

 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased for 1999 as compared to
1998 primarily due to a reduction in mortgage investment income.

 Net cash provided by investing activities decreased for 1999 as compared to
1998, due to the decrease in proceeds from mortgage dispositions.

 Net cash used in financing activities decreased for 1999 as compared to
1998 due to a decrease in distributions paid to partners as a result of
decreases discussed above.

ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

 The Partnership's principal market risk is exposure to changes in interest
rates in the U.S. Treasury market, which coupled with the related spread to
treasury investors required for the Partnership's Insured Mortgages, will cause
fluctuations in the market value of the Partnership's assets.

 The table below provides information about the Partnership's Insured
Mortgages, all of which were entered into for purposes other than trading. The
table presents anticipated principal and interest cash flows based upon the
assumptions used in determining the fair value of these securities and the
related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity.

 and for the Years Ended

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Partners of American Insured Mortgage Investors:

 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of American Insured
Mortgage Investors (the "Partnership") as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
related statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in partners'
equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.
These financial statements and the schedule referred to below are the
responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and the schedule based on our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

 Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. Schedule IV-Mortgage Loans on Real Estate
as of December 31, 2000 is presented for purposes of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and regulations and is not a required
part of the basic financial statements. The information in this schedule has
been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audits of the basic
financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material
respects in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

AMERICAN INSURED MORTGAGE INVESTORS

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION

 American Insured Mortgage Investors (the "Partnership") was formed under
the Uniform Limited Partnership Act in the state of California on July 12, 1983.

 CRIIMI, Inc. (the "General Partner") holds a partnership interest of 2.9 
and is a wholly owned subsidiary of CRIIMI MAE Inc. ("CRIIMI MAE"). AIM
Acquisition Partners L.P. (the "Advisor") serves as the advisor to the
Partnership. The general partner of the Advisor is AIM Acquisition Corporation
("AIM Acquisition") and the limited partners include, but are not limited to,
AIM Acquisition, The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P., Sun America Investments,
Inc.(successor to Broad, Inc.) and CRI/AIM Investment, L.P., an affiliate of
CRIIMI MAE. AIM Acquisition is a Delaware corporation that is primarily owned by
Sun America Investments, Inc. and The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P.

 Under the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor will render services to the
Partnership, including but not limited to, the management of the Partnership's
portfolio of mortgages and the disposition of the Partnership's mortgages. Such
services will be subject to the review and ultimate authority of the General
Partner. However, the General Partner is required to receive the consent of the
Advisor prior to taking certain significant actions, including but not limited
to the disposition of mortgages, any transaction or agreement with the General
Partner, or its affiliates, or any material change as to policies regarding
distributions or reserves of the Partnership. The Advisor is permitted to
delegate the performance of services pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement (the
"Sub-Advisory Agreement"). The delegation of such services will not relieve the
Advisor of its obligation to perform such services. CRIIMI MAE Services Limited
Partnership ("CMSLP"), an affiliate of CRIIMI MAE, manages the Partnership's
portfolio, pursuant to the Sub-Advisory Agreement. The general partner of CMSLP
is CRIIMI MAE Services, Inc., an affiliate of CRIIMI MAE.

 Prior to the expiration of the Partnership's reinvestment period in
November 1988, the Partnership was engaged in the business of originating
mortgage loans ("Originated Insured Mortgages") and acquiring mortgage loans
("Acquired Insured Mortgages" and, together with Originated Insured Mortgages,
referred to herein as "Insured Mortgages"). In accordance with the terms of the
partnership agreement, the Partnership is no longer authorized to originate or
acquire Insured Mortgages and, consequently, its primary objective is to manage
its portfolio of mortgage investments, all of which are insured under Section
221(d)(4) or Section 231 of the National Housing Act. The partnership agreement
states that the Partnership will terminate on December 31, 2008, unless
previously terminated under the provisions of the partnership agreement.

 On October 5, 1998, CRIIMI MAE, the parent of the General Partner, and
CRIIMI MAE Management, Inc., an affiliate of CRIIMI MAE and provider of
personnel and administrative services to the Partnership, filed voluntary
petitions for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the
"Bankruptcy Code"). Such bankruptcy filings could result in certain adverse
effects to the Partnership. For example, as a debtor-in-possession, CRIIMI MAE
will not be permitted to provide any available capital to the General Partner or
to the general partner of CMSLP, the Partnership's sub-advisor, without approval
from the Bankruptcy Court. Even though this restriction or potential loss of the
availability of a potential capital resource could adversely affect the General
Partner and the Partnership, CRIIMI MAE has not historically represented a
significant source of capital for the General Partner or the Partnership. Such
bankruptcy filings could also result in the potential need to replace CRIIMI MAE
Management, Inc. as a provider of personnel and administrative services to the
Partnership.

 On November 22, 2000, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District
of Maryland, in Greenbelt, Maryland (the "Bankruptcy Court") confirmed CRIIMI
MAE's and CRIIMI MAE Management, Inc.'s Third Amended Joint Plan of
Reorganization (as amended and supplemented by praecipes filed with the
Bankruptcy Court on July 13, 14 and 21, and November 22, 2000, the "Plan").
CRIIMI MAE is working to complete the debt documentation, evidencing the secured
financings to be provided by (1) the unsecured creditors, and (2) Merrill Lynch
Mortgage Capital, Inc. and German American Capital Corporation (collectively the
"New Debt Documents"). On March 9, 2001, the Bankruptcy Court approved an
extension of the date by which the Plan must be effective to April 13, 2001. The
Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors had previously filed its own plan of
reorganization and proposed disclosure statement, but has asked the Bankruptcy
Court, subject to completion of mutually acceptable debt documentation, to defer
consideration of its plan and proposed disclosure statement. There can be no
assurance at this time that CRIIMI MAE will be able to complete the New Debt
Documents and effectuate the Plan by April 13, 2001.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Method of Accounting
- --------------------

 The Partnership's financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of
accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Investment in Insured Mortgages
- -------------------------------

 The Partnership's investment in Insured Mortgages is comprised of
FHA-insured mortgage loans ("FHA-Insured Loans") and participation certificates
evidencing a 100 undivided beneficial interest in government insured
multifamily mortgages issued or sold pursuant to programs of the Federal Housing
Administration ("FHA") ("FHA-Insured Certificates"). The mortgages underlying
the FHA-Insured Certificates and FHA-Insured Loans are non-recourse first liens
on multifamily residential developments.

 Payment of principal and interest on FHA-Insured Certificates and
FHA-Insured Loans is insured by the United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development ("HUD") pursuant to Title 2 of the National Housing Act.

 As of December 31, 2000, the weighted average remaining term of the
Partnership's investments in FHA-Insured Certificates is approximately 21 years.
However, the partnership agreement states that the Partnership will terminate in
approximately 8 years, on December 31, 2008, unless previously terminated under
the provisions of the partnership agreement. As the Partnership is anticipated
to terminate prior to the weighted average remaining term of its FHA-Insured
Certificates, the Partnership does not have the ability or intent, at this time,
to hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, the General Partner
believes that the Partnership's FHA-Insured Certificates should be included in
the available for sale category. Although the Partnership's FHA-Insured
Certificates are classified as available for sale for financial statement
purposes, the General Partner does not intend to voluntarily sell these assets
other than those which may be sold as a result of a default or those which are
eligible to be put to FHA at the expiration of 20 years from the date of the
final endorsement under section 221 program of the National Housing Act of 1937,
as discussed below.

 In connection with this classification, as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
all of the Partnership's investments in FHA-Insured Certificates are recorded at
fair value, with the net unrealized gains and losses on these investments
reported as other comprehensive income and as a separate component of partners'
equity. Subsequent increases or decreases in the fair value of FHA-Insured
Certificates classified as available for sale will be included as a separate
component of partners' equity. Realized gains and losses on FHA-Insured
Certificates classified as available for sale will continue to be reported in
earnings. The amortized cost of the investments in this category is adjusted for
amortization of discounts to maturity. Such amortization is included in mortgage
investment income.

 Most of the Insured Mortgages held by the Partnership apply to the Section
221 program of the National Housing Act of 1937, as amended, (the "Section 221
program"). Under the Section 221 program a mortgagee has the right to assign a
mortgage ("put") to FHA at the expiration of 20 years from the date of final
endorsement if the mortgage is not in default at such time. Any mortgagee
electing to assign an FHA-insured mortgage to FHA will receive, in exchange
therefor, HUD debentures having a total face value equal to the then outstanding
principal balance of the FHA-insured mortgage plus accrued interest to the date
of assignment. These HUD debentures will mature 10 years from the date of
assignment and will bear interest at the "going Federal rate" at such date. This
assignment procedure is applicable to an insured mortgage which had a firm or
conditional FHA commitment for insurance on or before November 30, 1983. The
Partnership anticipates that each eligible insured mortgage, for which a
prepayment has not occurred and which has not been sold, will be assigned to FHA
at the expiration of 20 years from the date of final endorsement. The
Partnership, therefore, does not anticipate holding any eligible insured
mortgage beyond the expiration of 20 years from final endorsement of that
insured mortgage. The Partnership has initiated its request to put these
mortgages to FHA as they become due.

 As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, Investment in FHA-Insured Loans is
recorded at amortized cost.

 Gains from dispositions of mortgage investments are recognized upon the
receipt of cash or debentures.

 Losses on dispositions of mortgage investments are recognized when it
becomes probable that a mortgage will be disposed of and that the disposition
will result in a loss. In the case of Originated Insured Mortgages fully insured
by HUD, the Partnership's maximum exposure for purposes of determining the loan
losses would generally be an assignment fee charged by HUD representing
approximately 1 of the unpaid principal balance of the Originated Insured
Mortgage at the date of default, plus the unamortized balance of acquisition
fees and closing costs paid in connection with the acquisition of the Originated
Insured Mortgage and the loss of 30 days accrued interest.

 Since Acquired Insured Mortgages were purchased at a discount from the
unpaid principal balance of the mortgage, the Partnership's investment in the
Acquired Insured Mortgages is less than the amount that would be recovered from
HUD in the event of a default. Therefore, the Partnership would experience no
loan losses on discounted Acquired Insured Mortgages in the case of a default.

Due from Affiliate
- ------------------

 From time to time, the Partnership assigns defaulted loans to HUD in order
to collect the amount of delinquent principal and interest. In addition,
mortgages are assigned to HUD under the Section 221 program, as discussed above.
HUD determines if the claim will be settled in cash or by the issuance of
debentures. Debentures are obligations of the mortgage insurance funds and are
unconditionally guaranteed by the United States. The term of the debentures are
usually more than 9 years and the rate is set based upon the rate in effect at
the commitment date to provide insurance or at the final endorsement date,
whichever is greater. AIM 84 classifies its portion of investment in FHA
debenture as available for sale debt securities with changes in fair value
recorded as an adjustment to equity and other comprehensive income. The
Partnership's investment in FHA debenture is included on the balance sheet in
Due from affiliate, as discussed in Note 5.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
- -------------------------

 Cash and cash equivalents consist of time and demand deposits with original
maturities of three months or less.

Income Taxes
- ------------

 No provision has been made for Federal, state or local income taxes in the
accompanying statements of income and comprehensive income since they are the
responsibility of the Unitholders.

Statements of Cash Flows
- ------------------------

 No cash payments were made for interest expense during the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998. Since the statements of cash flows are
intended to reflect only cash receipt and cash payment activity, the statements
of cash flows do not reflect operating activities that affect recognized assets
and liabilities while not resulting in cash receipts or cash payments.

3. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

 The following estimated fair values of the Partnership's financial
instruments are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles which define fair value as the amount at which a financial instrument
could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than
in a forced or liquidation sale. These estimated fair values, however, do not
represent the liquidation value or the market value of the Partnership.

As of December 31, 2000 As of December 31, 1999

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instrument:

Investment in FHA-Insured Certificates,
FHA-Insured Loans and FHA debenture due from affiliate
- ------------------------------------------------------

 The fair value of the FHA-Insured Certificates, GNMA Mortgage-Backed
Securities and FHA-Insured Loans is priced internally. The Partnership used a
discounted cash flow methodology to estimate the fair value; the cash flows were
discounted using a discount rate that, in the Partnership's view, was
commensurate with the market's perception of risk and value. The Partnership
used a variety of sources to determine its discount rate including: (i)
institutionally-available research reports, (ii) a relative comparison of dealer
provided quotes from the previous year to those disclosed in recent research
reports and incorporating adjustments to reflect changes in the market, and
(iii) communications with dealers and active insured mortgage security investors
regarding the valuation of comparable securities. The fair value of the FHA
Debenture is based upon the prices of other comparable securities that trade in
the market.

Cash and cash equivalents and accrued interest receivable
- ---------------------------------------------------------

 The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity
of these instruments.

4. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

 Comprehensive Income includes net earnings as currently reported by the
Partnership adjusted for other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income
for the Partnership consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses related
to the Partnership's mortgages and debenture accounted for as available for
sale. The table below breaks out other comprehensive income for the periods
presented into the following two categories: (1) the change to unrealized gains
and losses that relate to mortgages which were disposed of during the period
with the resulting realized gain or loss reflected in net earnings
(reclassification adjustments) and (2) the change in the unrealized gain or loss
related to those investments that were not disposed of during the period.

All of the FHA-Insured Loans were current with respect to the payment of
principal and interest as of February 16, 2001.

 In addition to base interest payments received from Originated Insured
Mortgages, the Partnership is entitled to additional interest based on a
percentage of the net cash flow from the underlying development and of the net
proceeds from the refinancing, sale or other disposition of the underlying
development (referred to as "Participations"). During the years ended December
31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Partnership received 0, 0 and 52,526,
respectively, from the Participations. These amounts, if any, are included in
mortgage investment income on the accompanying statements of income and
comprehensive income.

(1) In December 2000, HUD issued assignment proceeds in the form of a 7.125 
 debenture for the mortgage on Fox Run Apartments. This mortgage was owned
 50 by AIM 84 and 50 by an affiliate of the Partnership, American Insured
 Investors - Series 85, L.P. (AIM 85). The debenture, with a face value of
 2,385,233 and a fair value of 2,361,381, was issued to AIM 85 and will
 earn interest semi-annually on January 1 and July 1. The Partnership
 expects to receive net proceeds of approximately 1.2 million and has
 recognized a gain of approximately 188,000 for the year ended December 31,
 2000. The net proceeds and accrued interest are included on the Balance
 Sheet in Due from affiliate. In general, AIM 85 will hold the debenture
 until its maturity date of June 1, 2010 or when called, whichever comes
 first. A distribution will be declared at that time. The servicer of this
 mortgage filed an application for insurance benefits under the Section 221
 program in May 2000.

 All of the FHA-Insured Certificates were current with respect to the
payment of principal and interest as of February 16, 2001.

7. TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

 The principal officers of the General Partner for the years ended December
31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 did not receive fees for serving as officers of the
General Partner, nor are any fees expected to be paid to the officers in the
future.

 The General Partner, CMSLP and certain affiliated entities have, during the
years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, earned or received compensation or
payments for services from the Partnership as follows:

 from prepayment of the mortgage on Lakeside Apartments.

(3) This amount includes approximately 0.99 per Unit representing net proceeds
 from the prepayment of the mortgage on Water's Edge Apartments.

 The basis for paying distributions to Unitholders is net proceeds from
mortgage dispositions, if any, and cash flow from operations, which includes
regular interest income and principal from Insured Mortgages. Although Insured
Mortgages yield a fixed monthly mortgage payment once purchased, the cash
distributions paid to the Unitholders will vary during each year due to (1) the
fluctuating yields in the short-term money market where the monthly mortgage
payment receipts are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly
distributions, (2) the reduction in the asset base resulting from monthly
mortgage payments received or mortgage dispositions, (3) variations in the cash
flow attributable to the delinquency or default of Insured Mortgages and
professional fees and foreclosure costs incurred in connection with those
Insured Mortgages and (4) variations in the Partnership's operating expenses.

9. PARTNERS' EQUITY

 Depositary Units representing economic rights in limited partnership
interests ("Units") were issued at a stated value of 20. A total of 10,000,000
Units were issued for an aggregate capital contribution of 200,000,000. In
addition, the initial limited partner contributed 2,500 to the capital of the
Partnership and received 125 Units in exchange therefor.

 NOTES TO SCHEDULE IV - MORTGAGE LOANS ON REAL ESTATE

 DECEMBER 31, 2000

(1) Under the Section 221 program of the National Housing Act of 1937, as
 amended, a mortgagee has the right to assign a mortgage ("put") to FHA at
 the expiration of 20 years from the date of final endorsement if the
 mortgage is not in default at such time. Any mortgagee electing to assign
 an FHA-insured mortgage to FHA will receive, in exchange therefor, HUD
 debentures having a total face value equal to the then outstanding
 principal balance of the FHA-insured mortgage plus accrued interest to the
 date of assignment. These HUD debentures will mature 10 years from the date
 of assignment and will bear interest at the "going Federal rate" at such
 date. This assignment procedure is applicable to an insured mortgage which
 had a firm or conditional FHA commitment for insurance on or before
 November 30, 1983. The Partnership anticipates that each eligible insured
 mortgage, for which a prepayment has not occurred and which has not been
 sold, will be assigned to FHA at the expiration of 20 years from the date
 of final endorsement. The Partnership, therefore, does not anticipate
 holding any eligible insured mortgage beyond the expiration of 20 years
 from final endorsement of that insured mortgage. The Partnership has
 initiated its request to put these mortgages to FHA as they become due.

(2) Inclusive of closing costs and acquisition fees.

(3) Prepayment of these insured mortgages would be based upon the unpaid
 principal balance at the time of prepayment.

(4) These amounts represent the Partnership's 50 interest in these insured
 mortgages. The remaining 50 interest was acquired by American Insured
 Mortgage Investors - Series 85, L.P. ("AIM 85").

(5) In addition, the servicer of the insured mortgages (primarily unaffiliated
 third parties) is entitled to receive compensation for certain services
 rendered in an amount up to ten basis points (0.10 of the unpaid
 principal balance of the insured mortgages.

(6) The mortgages underlying the Partnership's investment in FHA-Insured
 Certificates and FHA-Insured Loans are non-recourse first liens on
 multifamily residential developments.

(7) Principal and interest are payable at level amounts over the life of the
 Insured Mortgages.

(8) A reconciliation of the carrying value of Insured Mortgages, for the years
 ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, is as follows:

2000 1999
 ----------- -----------
 
Beginning balance 25,219,376 26,349,115

 Gain on mortgage dispositions 188,455 67,150
 Proceeds from disposition of mortgages (1,181,623)(a) (383,582)
 Principal receipts on Insured Mortgages (280,200) (267,690)
 Adjustment to unrealized gains on
 investment in Insured Mortgages (90,235) (545,617)
 ----------- -----------

Ending balance 23,855,773 25,219,376
 =========== ===========

(a) This amount represents non-cash proceeds of 1,192,617 (as reflected
 on the Statements of Cash Flows) less 10,994 of accrued interest
 income.

(9) The tax basis of the Insured Mortgages was approximately 20.9 million and
 22.2 million as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
