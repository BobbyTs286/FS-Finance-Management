Part I

Item 1. Business

General
Southwest Royalties, Inc. Income Fund VI (the "Partnership" or
"Registrant") was organized as a Tennessee limited partnership on December
4, 1986. The offering of limited partnership interests began August 25,
1986, reached minimum capital requirements on October 3, 1986 and concluded
January 29, 1987. The Partnership has no subsidiaries. The Managing
General Partner of the Partnership is Southwest Royalties, Inc. (the
"Managing General Partner"), a Delaware corporation.

The Partnership has expended its capital and acquired interests in
producing oil and gas properties. After such acquisitions, the Partnership
has produced and marketed the crude oil and natural gas produced from such
properties. In most cases, the Partnership purchased royalty or overriding
royalty interests and working interests in oil and gas properties that were
converted into net profits interests or other nonoperating interests. The
Partnership purchased either all or part of the rights and obligations
under various oil and gas leases.

During 2004, the Managing General Partner was acquired by Clayton Williams
Energy, Inc. ("CWEI"), a Delaware corporation, and is now a wholly owned
subsidiary of CWEI. CWEI is an oil and gas company based in Midland,
Texas, and its common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market's National
Market under the symbol "CWEI". All of the directors and executive
officers of the Managing General Partner are employees of CWEI. CWEI
maintains an internet website at www.claytonwilliams.com from which public
information about CWEI may be obtained.

The principal executive offices of the Partnership are located at 6 Desta
Drive, Suite 6500, Midland, Texas, 79705. The Managing General Partner and
its staff, together with certain independent consultants used on an "as
needed" basis, perform various services on behalf of the Partnership,
including the selection of oil and gas properties and the marketing of
production from such properties. The Partnership has no employees.

Operations

The business objective of the Partnership is to maximize the production and
related net cash flow from the properties it currently owns without
engaging in the drilling of any development or exploratory wells except
through farm-out arrangements. If additional drilling is necessary to
fully develop a Partnership property, the Partnership will enter into a
farmout agreement with the Managing General Partner to assign a portion of
the Partnership's interest in the property to the Managing General Partner
in exchange for retaining an interest in the one or more new wells at no
cost to the Partnership. The Managing General Partner obtains a fairness
opinion from an unaffiliated petroleum engineer with respect to the terms
of each farmout agreement with the Partnership.

During 2005, the Partnership entered into farmout agreements with the
Managing General Partner through which the Managing General Partner drilled
seven wells and performed workovers on three wells. The partnership paid
none of the cost to drill and complete or workover these wells. The wells
involved and interest retained are as follows:

Drill Barnett 10 
 Amacker #4
Drill JS Lane #6 10 
Drill Middleton 124 12.5

Principal Products and Markets
The Partnership has acquired and holds royalty interests and net profit
interests in oil and gas properties located in Texas and Oklahoma. All
activities of the Partnership are confined to the continental United
States. During 2005, 38 of the Partnership's revenues were derived from
the sale of oil production and 62 were derived from gas production. All
oil and gas produced from these properties is sold to unrelated third
parties in the oil and gas business. The Partnership believes that the
loss of any of its purchasers would not have a material adverse affect on
its results of operations due to the availability of other purchasers.

The revenues generated from the Partnership's oil and gas activities are
dependent upon the current market for oil and gas. The prices received by
the Partnership for its oil and gas production depend upon numerous factors
beyond the Partnership's control, including competition, economic,
political and regulatory developments and competitive energy sources. The
Partnership is unable to accurately predict future prices of oil and
natural gas.

Competition
Because the Partnership has utilized all of its funds available for the
acquisition of net profits or royalty interests in producing oil and gas
properties, it is not subject to competition from other oil and gas
property purchasers. See Item 2, Properties.

Factors that may adversely affect the Partnership include delays in
completing arrangements for the sale of production, availability of a
market for production, rising operating costs of producing oil and gas and
complying with applicable water and air pollution control statutes,
increasing costs and difficulties of transportation, and marketing of
competitive fuels. Moreover, domestic oil and gas must compete with
imported oil and gas and with coal, atomic energy, hydroelectric power and
other forms of energy.

Regulation

The Partnership's oil and gas production and related operations are subject
to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local
agencies. Failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in
substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry
increases the Partnership's cost of doing business and affects the
Partnership's profitability. Because such rules and regulations are
frequently amended or reinterpreted, the Partnership is unable to predict
the future cost or impact of complying with such laws.

All of the states in which the Partnership conducts business generally
require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports
concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the
exploration and production of oil and gas. Such states also have statutes
or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for
the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of
maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the spacing,
plugging and abandonment of such wells. The statutes and regulations of
certain states also limit the rate at which oil and gas can be produced
from the Partnership's properties.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") regulates interstate
natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affect the
marketing of gas produced by the Partnership, as well as the revenues the
Partnership receives for sales of such production. Since the mid-1980s,
the FERC has issued various orders that have significantly altered the
marketing and transportation of gas. These orders resulted in a
fundamental restructuring of interstate pipeline sales and transportation
services, including the unbundling by interstate pipelines of the sales,
transportation, storage and other components of the city-gate sales
services such pipelines previously performed. These FERC actions were
designed to increase competition within all phases of the gas industry.
The interstate regulatory framework may enhance the Partnership's ability
to market and transport its gas, although this framework may also subject
the Partnership to competition and to the more restrictive pipeline
imbalance tolerances and greater associated penalties for violation of such
tolerances.

The Partnership's sales of oil production are not presently regulated and
are made at market prices. The price the Partnership receives from the
sale of those products is affected by the cost of transporting the products
to market. The FERC has implemented regulations establishing an indexing
system for transportation rates for oil pipelines, which, generally, would
index such rates to inflation, subject to certain conditions and
limitations. The Partnership is not able to predict with any certainty
what effect, if any, these regulations will have on the Partnership, but,
other factors being equal, the regulations may, over time, tend to increase
transportation costs which may have the effect of reducing wellhead prices
for oil and natural gas liquids.

Environmental Matters

The Partnership's operations pertaining to oil and gas production and
related activities are subject to numerous and constantly changing federal,
state and local laws governing the discharge of materials into the
environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws
and regulations may require the acquisition of certain permits prior to or
in connection with drilling activities, restrict or prohibit the types,
quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the
environment in connection with drilling and production, restrict or
prohibit drilling activities that could impact wetlands, endangered or
threatened species or other protected areas or natural resources, require
some degree of remedial action to mitigate pollution from former
operations, such as pit cleanups and plugging abandoned wells, and impose
substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from the Partnership's
operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the cost
of developing, producing or processing oil and gas and may prevent or delay
the commencement or continuation of a given project and thus generally
could have a material adverse effect upon the Partnership's cash flow and
earnings. The Partnership believes that it is in substantial compliance
with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, and the cost of
compliance with such laws and regulations has not been material and is not
expected to be material during 2006. Nevertheless, changes in existing
environmental laws and regulations or in the interpretations thereof could
have a significant impact on the Partnership's operations, as well as the
oil and gas industry in general. For instance, legislation has been
proposed in Congress from time to time that would reclassify certain oil
and gas production wastes as "hazardous wastes," which reclassification
would make exploration and production wastes subject to much more stringent
handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. State initiatives to further
regulate the disposal of oil and gas wastes and naturally occurring
radioactive materials, if adopted, could have a similar impact on the
Partnership.

The United States Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA `90"), and similar
legislation enacted in Texas, Louisiana and other coastal states, addresses
oil spill prevention and control and significantly expands liability
exposure across all segments of the oil and gas industry. OPA `90 and such
similar legislation and related regulations impose on us a variety of
obligations related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for
damages resulting from such spills. OPA `90 imposes strict and, with
limited exceptions, joint and several liabilities upon each responsible
party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages.

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
("CERCLA"), also known as the "Superfund" law, imposes liability, without
regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes
of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a
"hazardous substance" into the environment. These persons include the
owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release
occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the
hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred. Under CERCLA,
such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of
cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the
environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon
for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for
personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous
substances released into the environment. The failure of an operator of a
property owned by the Partnership to comply with applicable environmental
regulations may, in certain circumstances, be attributed to the
Partnership. The Partnership does not believe that it will be required to
incur any material expenditures to comply with existing environmental
requirements.

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), and analogous state
laws govern the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes. Wastes
that are classified as hazardous under RCRA are subject to stringent
handling, recordkeeping, disposal and reporting requirements. RCRA
specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste "drilling
fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration,
development, or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy."
However, these wastes may be regulated by the EPA or state agencies as
solid waste. Moreover, many ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint
wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils, are
regulated as hazardous wastes. Although the costs of managing hazardous
waste may be significant, the Partnership does not expect to experience
more burdensome costs than similarly situated companies

State water discharge regulations and federal waste discharge permitting
requirements adopted pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
prohibit or are expected in the future to prohibit the discharge of
produced water and sand and some other substances related to the oil and
gas industry, into coastal waters. Although the costs to comply with such
mandates under state or federal law may be significant, the entire industry
will experience similar costs, and the Partnership does not believe that
these costs will have a material adverse impact on its financial condition
and operations.

The Partnership maintains insurance against "sudden and accidental"
occurrences, which may cover some, but not all, of the environmental risks
described above. Most significantly, the insurance we maintain will not
cover the risks described above which occur over a sustained period of
time. Further, there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue
to be available to cover all such costs or that such insurance will be
available at premium levels that justify its purchase. The occurrence of a
significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.

Limited partners should be aware that the assessment of liability
associated with environmental liabilities is not always correlated to the
value of a particular project. Accordingly, liability associated with the
environment under local, state, or federal regulations, particularly clean
ups under CERCLA, can exceed the value of the Partnership's investment in
the associated site.
Partnership Employees
The Partnership has no employees; however the Managing General Partner and
CWEI have a staff of geologists, engineers, accountants, landmen and
clerical staff who engage in Partnership activities and operations and
perform additional services for the Partnership as needed. In addition,
the Partnership engages independent consultants such as petroleum engineers
and geologists as needed.

The estimates of proved reserves at December 31, 2005 and the standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows were derived from a report
prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P., petroleum consultants. These
calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering
methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with
SEC financial accounting and reporting standards.

In accordance with applicable financial accounting and reporting standards
of the SEC, the estimates of the Partnership's proved reserves and the
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows set forth herein
are made using oil and gas sales prices estimated to be in effect as of the
date of such reserve estimates and are held constant throughout the life of
the properties. Estimated quantities of proved reserves and their present
value are affected by changes in oil and gas prices. The average prices
utilized for the purposes of estimating the Partnership's proved reserves
and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of
December 31, 2005 were 59.69 per Bbl of oil and natural gas liquids and
 10.43 per Mcf of gas, as compared to 42.02 per Bbl of oil and 5.36 per
Mcf of gas as of December 31, 2004.

The reserve information shown is estimated. The accuracy of any reserve
estimate is a function of the quality of available geological, geophysical,
engineering and economic data, the precision of the engineering and
geological interpretation and judgment. The estimates of reserves, future
cash flows and standardized measure are based on various assumptions,
including those prescribed by the SEC, and are inherently imprecise.
Although the Partnership believes these estimates are reasonable, actual
future production, cash flows, taxes, development expenditures, operating
expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may
vary substantially from these estimates. Also, the use of a 10 discount
factor for reporting purposes may not necessarily represent the most
appropriate discount factor, given actual interest rates and risks to which
our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general are subject.

Unanticipated depletion, if it occurs, will result in lower reserves than
previously estimated; thus an ultimately lower return for the Partnership.
Basic changes in past reserve estimates occur annually. As new data is
gathered during the subsequent year, the engineer must revise his earlier
estimates. A year of new information, which is pertinent to the estimation
of future recoverable volumes, is available during the subsequent year
evaluation. In applying industry standards and procedures, the new data
may cause the previous estimates to be revised. This revision may increase
or decrease the earlier estimated volumes. Pertinent information gathered
during the year may include actual production and decline rates, production
from offset wells drilled to the same geologic formation, increased or
decreased water production, workovers, and changes in lifting costs, among
others. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the
quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered.

Market Information
Limited partnership interests, or units, in the Partnership were initially
offered and sold for a price of 500. Limited partner units are not traded
on any exchange and there is no public or organized trading market for
them.

Number of Limited Partner Interest Holders
As of December 31, 2005 there were 559 holders of limited partner units in
the Partnership.

Distributions
Pursuant to Article IV, Section 4.01 of the Partnership's Certificate and
Agreement of Limited Partnership "Net Cash Flow" is distributed to the
partners on a quarterly basis. "Net Cash Flow" is defined as "the cash
generated by the Partnership's investments in producing oil and gas
properties, less (i) General and Administrative Costs, (ii) Operating
Costs, and (iii) any reserves necessary to meet current and anticipated
needs of the Partnership, as determined at the sole discretion of the
Managing General Partner." During 2005, distributions were made totaling
 2,000,000, with 1,800,000 90.00 per unit) distributed to the limited
partners and 200,000 to the general partner.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
After completion of the Partnership's first full fiscal year of operations
and each year thereafter, the Managing General Partner has offered and will
continue to offer to purchase each limited partner's interest in the
Partnership in accordance with the obligations set forth in the partnership
agreement. The pricing mechanism used to calculate the repurchase is based
on tangible assets of the Partnership, plus the present value of the future
net revenues of proved oil and gas properties, minus liabilities with a
risk factor discount of up to one-third which may be implemented at the
sole discretion of the Managing General Partner. However, the Managing
General Partner's obligation to purchase limited partner units under the
partnership agreement is limited to an annual expenditure of an amount not
in excess of 10 of the total limited partner units initially subscribed
for by limited partners. The following table sets forth certain
information regarding purchases of limited partnership units by the
Managing General Partner during the year of 2005.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
 Results of Operations

General
The Partnership was formed to acquire non-operating interests in producing
oil and gas properties, to produce and market crude oil and natural gas
produced from such properties and to distribute any net proceeds from
operations to the general and limited partners. Net revenues from
producing oil and gas properties are not reinvested in other revenue
producing assets except to the extent that producing facilities and wells
are reworked or where methods are employed to improve or enable more
efficient recovery of oil and gas reserves. The economic life of the
Partnership thus depends on the period over which the Partnership's oil and
gas reserves are economically recoverable.

Increases or decreases in Partnership revenues and, therefore,
distributions to partners will depend primarily on changes in the prices
received for production, changes in volumes of production sold, lease
operating expenses, enhanced recovery projects, offset drilling activities
pursuant to farm-out arrangements and on the depletion of wells. Since
wells deplete over time, production can generally be expected to decline
from year to year.

Well operating costs and general and administrative costs usually decrease
with production declines; however, these costs may not decrease
proportionately. Net income available for distribution to the limited
partners has fluctuated over the past few years and is expected to decline
in later years based on these factors.

Critical Accounting Policies
The Partnership follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and
gas properties. The full cost method subjects companies to quarterly
calculations of a "ceiling", or limitation on the amount of properties that
can be capitalized on the balance sheet. If the Partnership's capitalized
costs are in excess of the calculated ceiling, the excess must be written
off as an expense.

The Partnership's discounted present value of its proved oil and natural
gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation, and
represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments.
Estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data, projected
future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures. The
process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial
judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly for new
discoveries. Different reserve engineers may make different estimates of
reserve quantities based on the same data. The Partnership's reserve
estimates are prepared by outside consultants.

The passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding
estimates of reserves, and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect
updated information. However, there can be no assurance that more
significant revisions will not be necessary in the future. If future
significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated
reserve quantities, it could result in a full cost property writedown. In
addition to the impact of these estimates of proved reserves on calculation
of the ceiling, estimates of proved reserves are also a significant
component of the calculation of depletion, depreciation, and amortization
("DD&A").

While the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment, the
associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the
discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment. The
ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last
day of the period are generally held constant indefinitely. Because the
ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of
the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely, the resulting value
is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves. Oil and natural
gas prices have historically been cyclical and, on any particular day at
the end of a quarter, can be either substantially higher or lower than the
Partnership's long-term price forecast that is a barometer for true fair
value.

Operating Results
The following discussion compares our results for the year ended December
31, 2005 to the two previous years. All references to 2005, 2004 and 2003
within this section refer to the respective annual periods.

Income from net profits
Oil and gas prices continued to climb to record levels compared to the
previous two years. Comparing 2005 to 2004, oil and gas sales increased
 981,100, of which price variances accounted for a 814,900 increase and
production variances accounted for a 166,200 increase. Comparing 2004 to
2003, oil and gas sales increased 256,200, of which price variances
accounted for a 453,100 increase and production variances accounted for a
 196,900 decrease.

Production in 2005 (on a BOE basis) was 7 higher than 2004 and 3 lower
than 2003. We increased our oil and gas production in 2005 due primarily
to production from new wells.

In 2005, our realized oil price was 42 higher than 2004 and 89 higher
than 2003, while our realized gas price was 29 higher than 2004 and 57 
higher than 2003. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been
volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. We have very
little control over the prices we receive for our production at the
wellhead since most of our physical marketing arrangements are market-
sensitive.

Oil and gas production costs on a BOE basis decreased from 14.18 per BOE
in 2004 and increased from 11.12 per BOE in 2003 to 13.95 per BOE in
2005. Oil and gas production costs per BOE decreased primarily due to
increased production from new wells. Oil and gas production costs
increased in 2005 over 2004 primarily due to an increase in production tax
costs due to higher product prices. It is likely that these factors will
continue to contribute to higher production costs in future periods.

Expenses
Depletion on a BOE basis decreased 13 from 2004 and 25 from 2003.
Comparing 2005 to 2004, depletion expense decreased 7,200, of which rate
variances accounted for a 14,700 decrease and production variances
accounted for a 7,500 increase. Comparing 2004 to 2003, depletion expense
decreased 28,300, of which rate variances accounted for a 15,400 decrease
and production variances accounted for a 12,900 decrease. Depletion rates
are a function of net capitalized costs and estimated reserve quantities.
The rates for 2006 are expected to be similar to the 2005 rates.

General and administrative ("G&A") expenses were 6 lower than 2004 and 5 
lower than 2003 due primarily to lower engineering fees and lower annual
report printing costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Partnership distributions during the year ended December 31, 2005 were
 2,000,000, of which 1,800,000 was distributed to the limited partners and
 200,000 to the general partners. Cumulative cash distributions of
 21,328,986 have been made to the general and limited partners as of
December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, 19,211,791 or 960.59 per
limited partner unit has been distributed to the limited partners,
representing 192 of contributed capital.

Our primary source of cash from operating activities is our oil and gas
sales, net of production costs. Cash flow provided by operating activities
for 2005 was 110 higher than 2004 due to the combined effects of several
drivers. The positive benefits of a 44 increase in oil and gas sales,
driven primarily by higher oil and gas prices, were offset in part by
increases in production costs. Our only use in financing activities is the
distribution to partners which was 78 higher than 2004.

As of December 31, 2005, the Partnership had approximately 624,400 in
working capital. The Managing General Partner knows of no unusual
contractual commitments. Although the Partnership held many long-lived
properties at inception, because of the restrictions on property
development imposed by the partnership agreement, the Partnership cannot
develop its non-producing properties, if any. Without continued
development, the producing reserves continue to deplete. Accordingly, as
the Partnership's properties have matured and depleted, the net cash flows
from operations for the Partnership has steadily declined, except in
periods of substantially increased commodity pricing. Maintenance of
properties and administrative expenses for the Partnership are increasing
relative to production. As the properties continue to deplete, maintenance
of properties and administrative costs as a percentage of production are
expected to continue to increase.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 153 "Exchanges of
Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29" ("SFAS 153").
SFAS 153 specifies the criteria required to record a nonmonetary asset
exchange using carryover basis. SFAS 153 is effective for nonmonetary
asset exchanges occurring after July 1, 2005. The Partnership adopted this
statement in the third quarter of 2005, and it did not have an effect on
the financial statements.

In September 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 106 ("SAB 106"). SAB 106 expresses the SEC staff's
views regarding SFAS No. 143 and its impact on both the full-cost ceiling
test and the calculation of depletion expense. In accordance with SAB 106,
beginning in the first quarter of 2005, undiscounted abandonment costs for
wells to be drilled in the future to develop proved reserves are included
in the unamortized cost of oil and gas properties, net of related salvage
value, for purposes of computing depreciation, depletion and amortization
("DD&A"). The implementation of SAB 106 did not have a material impact on
our financial statements.

 (a Tennessee limited partnership)

 Notes to Financial Statements

1. Organization
 Southwest Royalties, Inc. Income Fund VI was organized under the
 laws of the state of Tennessee on December 4, 1986, for the purpose of
 acquiring producing oil and gas properties and to produce and market
 crude oil and natural gas produced from such properties for a term of
 50 years, unless terminated at an earlier date as provided for in the
 Partnership Agreement. The Partnership sells its oil and gas
 production to a variety of purchasers with the prices it receives being
 dependent upon the oil and gas economy. Southwest Royalties, Inc., a
 wholly owned subsidiary of Clayton Williams Energy, Inc., serves as the
 Managing General Partner.

 Revenues, costs and expenses are allocated as follows:

 (1)All organization costs in excess of 3 of initial capital
 contributions will be paid by the Managing General Partner and
 will be treated as a capital contribution. The Partnership paid
 the Managing General Partner an amount equal to 3 of initial
 capital contributions for such organization costs.

 (2)Administrative costs in any year, which exceed 2 of capital
 contributions shall be paid by the Managing General Partner and
 will be treated as a capital contribution.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 Oil and Gas Properties
 Oil and gas properties are accounted for at cost under the full-cost
 method. Under this method, all productive and nonproductive costs
 incurred in connection with the acquisition, exploration and
 development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized. Gain or loss on
 the sale of oil and gas properties is not recognized unless significant
 oil and gas reserves are involved.

 Should the net capitalized costs exceed the estimated present value of
 oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 , such excess costs would be
 charged to current expense. As of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
 the net capitalized costs did not exceed the estimated present value of
 oil and gas reserves.

 The Partnership's interest in oil and gas properties consists of net
 profits interests in proved properties located within the continental
 United States. A net profits interest is created when the owner of a
 working interest in a property enters into an arrangement providing
 that the net profits interest owner will receive a stated percentage of
 the net profit from the property. The net profits interest owner will
 not otherwise participate in additional costs and expenses of the
 property.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued

 Oil and Gas Properties - continued
 The Partnership recognizes income from its net profits interest in oil
 and gas property on an accrual basis, while the quarterly cash
 distributions of the net profits interest are based on a calculation of
 actual cash received from oil and gas sales, net of expenses incurred
 during that quarterly period. If the net profits interest calculation
 results in expenses incurred exceeding the oil and gas income received
 during a quarter, no cash distribution is due to the Partnership's net
 profits interest until the deficit is recovered from future net
 profits. The Partnership accrues a quarterly loss on its net profits
 interest provided there is a cumulative net amount due for accrued
 revenue as of the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2005, there
 were no timing differences which resulted in a deficit net profit
 interest.

 Estimates and Uncertainties
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
 accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
 and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
 liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
 date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
 and expenses during the reporting period. The Partnership's depletion
 calculation and full cost ceiling test for oil and gas properties uses
 oil and gas reserve estimates, which are inherently imprecise. Actual
 results could differ from those estimates.

 Syndication Costs
 Syndication costs are accounted for as a reduction of partnership
 equity.

 Environmental Costs
 The Partnership is subject to extensive federal, state and local
 environmental laws and regulations. These laws, which are constantly
 changing, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and
 may require the Partnership to remove or mitigate the environmental
 effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances
 at various sites. Environmental expenditures are expensed or
 capitalized depending on their future economic benefit. Costs, which
 improve a property as compared with the condition of the property when
 originally constructed or acquired and costs, which prevent future
 environmental contamination are capitalized. Expenditures that relate
 to an existing condition caused by past operations and that have no
 future economic benefits are expensed. Liabilities for expenditures of
 a non-capital nature are recorded when environmental assessment and/or
 remediation is probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated.

 Revenue Recognition
 The Partnership recognizes oil and gas sales when delivery to the
 purchaser has occurred and title has transferred. This occurs when
 production has been delivered to a pipeline or transport vehicle.

 Gas Balancing
 The Partnership utilizes the sales method of accounting for gas-
 balancing arrangements. Under this method the Partnership recognizes
 sales revenue on all gas sold. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
 Partnership was under produced by 5,312 and 5,306 mcf of gas,
 respectively.

 Income Taxes
 No provision for income taxes is reflected in these financial
 statements, since the tax effects of the Partnership's income or loss
 are passed through to the individual partners.

 In accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial
 Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" the
 Partnership's tax basis in its net oil and gas properties at December
 31, 2005 and 2004 is 1,880,677 and 1,932,696, respectively, less than
 that shown on the accompanying Balance Sheets in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued

 Cash and Cash Equivalents
 For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Partnership considers
 all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three
 months or less to be cash equivalents. The Partnership maintains its
 cash at one financial institution.

 Number of Limited Partner Units
 As of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, there were 20,000 limited
 partner units outstanding held by 559, 602 and 667 partners.

 Concentrations of Credit Risk
 The Partnership is subject to credit risk through trade receivables.
 Although a substantial portion of its debtors' ability to pay is
 dependent upon the oil and gas industry, credit risk is minimized due
 to a large customer base. All partnership revenues are received by the
 Managing General Partner and subsequently remitted to the partnership
 and all expenses are paid by the Managing General Partner and
 subsequently reimbursed by the Partnership.

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 The carrying amount of cash and accounts receivable approximates fair
 value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

 Net Income per limited partnership unit
 The net income per limited partnership unit is calculated by using the
 number of outstanding limited partnership units.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
 issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 153 "Exchanges
 of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29"
 ("SFAS 153"). SFAS 153 specifies the criteria required to record a
 nonmonetary asset exchange using carryover basis. SFAS 153 is
 effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring after July 1, 2005.
 The Partnership adopted this statement in the third quarter of 2005,
 and it did not have an effect on the financial statements.

 In September 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
 Accounting Bulletin No. 106 ("SAB 106"). SAB 106 expresses the SEC
 staff's views regarding SFAS No. 143 and its impact on both the full-
 cost ceiling test and the calculation of depletion expense. In
 accordance with SAB 106, beginning in the first quarter of 2005,
 undiscounted abandonment costs for wells to be drilled in the future to
 develop proved reserves are included in the unamortized cost of oil and
 gas properties, net of related salvage value, for purposes of computing
 depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A"). The implementation
 of SAB 106 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

3. Asset Retirement Obligations
 On January 1, 2003, the Partnership adopted Statement of Financial
 Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
 Obligations ("SFAS No. 143"). The standard requires the Partnership to
 recognize a liability for the present value of all legal obligations
 associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and to
 capitalize an equal amount as a cost of the asset and depreciate the
 additional cost over the estimated useful life of the asset. On
 January 1, 2003, the Partnership recorded additional costs, net of
 accumulated depreciation, of 616,464, a long term liability of
 499,827 and a gain of 116,637 for the cumulative effect on
 depreciation of the additional costs and accretion expense on the
 liability related to expected abandonment costs of its oil and natural
 gas producing properties.

4. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
 After completion of the Partnership's first full fiscal year of
 operations and each year thereafter, the Managing General Partner has
 offered and will continue to offer to purchase each limited partner's
 interest in the Partnership. The pricing mechanism used to calculate
 the repurchase is based on tangible assets of the Partnership, plus the
 present value of the future net revenues of proved oil and gas
 properties, minus liabilities with a risk factor discount of up to one-
 third which may be implemented at the sole discretion of the Managing
 General Partner. However, the Managing General Partner's obligation to
 purchase limited partner units is limited to an annual expenditure of
 an amount not in excess of 10 of the total limited partner units
 initially subscribed for by limited partners.

 The Partnership is subject to various federal, state and local
 environmental laws and regulations, which establish standards and
 requirements for protection of the environment. The Partnership cannot
 predict the future impact of such standards and requirements, which are
 subject to change and can have retroactive effectiveness. The
 Partnership continues to monitor the status of these laws and
 regulations.

 As of December 31, 2005, the Partnership has not been fined, cited or
 notified of any environmental violations and management is not aware of
 any unasserted violations, which would have a material adverse effect
 upon capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position in the
 oil and gas industry. However, the Managing General Partner does
 recognize by the very nature of its business, material costs could be
 incurred in the near term to bring the Partnership into total
 compliance. The amount of such future expenditures is not determinable
 due to several factors, including the unknown magnitude of possible
 contaminations, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions
 which may be required, the determination of the Partnership's liability
 in proportion to other responsible parties and the extent to which such
 expenditures are recoverable from insurance or indemnifications from
 prior owners of the Partnership's properties.

5. Related Party Transactions
 A significant portion of the oil and gas properties in which the
 Partnership has an interest are purchased from and operated by the
 Managing General Partner. As provided for in the operating agreement
 for each respective oil and gas property in which the Partnership has
 an interest, the operator is paid an amount for administrative overhead
 attributable to operating such properties, with such amounts to
 Southwest Royalties, Inc. as operator approximating 92,700, 85,700
 and 83,000, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
 respectively. The amounts for administrative overhead attributable to
 operating the partnerships properties has been deducted from gross oil
 and gas revenues in the determination of net profit interest. In
 addition, the Managing General Partner and certain officers and
 employees may have an interest in some of the properties in which the
 Partnership also participates.

 Southwest Royalties, Inc., the Managing General Partner, was paid
 144,000 during 2005, 2004 and 2003, as an administrative fee for
 indirect general and administrative overhead expenses. The
 administrative fees are included in general and administrative expense
 on the statement of operations.

5. Related Party Transactions - continued
 Receivables from Southwest Royalties, Inc., the Managing General
 Partner, of approximately 352,600 and 342,300 are from oil and gas
 production, net of lease operating costs and production taxes, as of
 December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

6. Oil and Gas Reserves Information (unaudited)
 The estimates of proved oil and gas reserves utilized in the
 preparation of the financial statements were prepared by independent
 petroleum engineers. Such estimates are in accordance with guidelines
 established by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial
 Accounting Standards Board, which require that reserve reports be
 prepared under economic and operating conditions existing at the
 registrant's year end with no provision for price and cost escalations
 except by contractual arrangements. Future cash inflows were computed
 by applying year-end prices to the year-end quantities of proved
 reserves. Future development, abandonment and production costs were
 computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing,
 producing, and abandoning proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the
 year, based on year-end costs. All of the Partnership's reserves are
 located in the United States. For information about the Partnership's
 results of operations from oil and gas producing activities, see the
 accompanying statements of operations.

 The Partnership's interest in proved oil and gas reserves is as

 Net revisions of 70,000 BOE in 2005 consisted of approximately 44,000
 BOE of upward revisions attributable to the effects of higher product
 prices on the estimated quantities of proved reserves, net of downward
 revisions of approximately 114,000 BOE attributable to well performance
 primarily from properties in the Amacker/Wilshire field of West Texas.

6. Oil and Gas Reserves Information (unaudited) - continued
 Oil price adjustments were made in the individual evaluations to
 reflect oil quality, gathering and transportation costs. The
 standardized measure as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 reflects an
 average oil price of 59.69, 42.02 and 31.26 per barrel.

 Gas price adjustments were made in the individual evaluations to
 reflect BTU content, gathering and transportation costs and gas
 processing and shrinkage. The standardized measure as of December 31,
 2005, 2004 and 2003 reflects an average natural gas price of 10.43,
 5.36 and 5.31 per Mcf.

 The evaluation of oil and gas properties is not an exact science and
 inevitably involves a significant degree of uncertainty, particularly
 with respect to the quantity of oil or gas that any given property is
 capable of producing. Estimates of oil and gas reserves are based on
 available geological and engineering data, the extent and quality of
 which may vary in each case and, in certain instances, may prove to be
 inaccurate. Consequently, properties may be depleted more rapidly than
 the geological and engineering data have indicated.

 Unanticipated depletion, if it occurs, will result in lower reserves
 than previously estimated; thus an ultimately lower return for the
 Partnership. Basic changes in past reserve estimates occur annually.
 As new data is gathered during the subsequent year, the engineer must
 revise his earlier estimates. A year of new information, which is
 pertinent to the estimation of future recoverable volumes, is available
 during the subsequent year evaluation. In applying industry standards
 and procedures, the new data may cause the previous estimates to be
 revised. This revision may increase or decrease the earlier estimated
 volumes.

 The Partnership has reserves, which are classified as proved developed
 and proved undeveloped. All of the proved reserves are included in the
 engineering reports, which evaluate the Partnership's present reserves.

 Because the Partnership does not engage in drilling activities, the
 development of proved undeveloped reserves is conducted pursuant to
 farm-out arrangements with the Managing General Partner or unrelated
 third parties. Generally, the Partnership retains a carried interest
 such as an overriding royalty interest under the terms of a farm-out.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

The Managing General Partner has established disclosure controls and
procedures that are adequate to provide reasonable assurance that
management will be able to collect, process and disclose both financial and
non-financial information, on a timely basis, in the Partnership's reports
to the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include all processes
necessary to ensure that material information is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's
rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our chief executive and chief financial officers, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures.

 With respect to these disclosure controls and procedures:

 management has evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure
 controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
 this report;

 this evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the
 participation of management, including the chief executive and
 chief financial officers of the Managing General Partner; and

 it is the conclusion of chief executive and chief financial
 officers of the Managing General Partner that these disclosure
 controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that
 information that is required to be disclosed by the Partnership
 in reports filed or submitted with the SEC is recorded,
 processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
 specified in the rules and forms established by the SEC.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

General Partner.

Through repurchase offers to the limited partners, the Managing General
Partner owns 9,118.4 limited partner units, a 41.0 limited partner
interest. The Managing General Partner's total percentage interest
ownership in the Partnership is 51.0 .

No officer or director of the Managing General Partner directly owns units
in the Partnership. CWEI is considered to be a beneficial owner of the
limited partner units acquired by the Managing General Partner by virtue of
its ownership of the Managing General Partner. Beneficial ownership is
determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and includes voting or investment power with respect to the
limited partner units.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

In 2005, the Managing General Partner received 144,000 as an
administrative fee. This amount is part of the general and administrative
expenses incurred by the Partnership.

In some instances, the Managing General Partner and its affiliates may be
working interest owners in an oil and gas property in which the Partnership
also has a net profits interest. Certain properties in which the
Partnership has an interest are operated by the Managing General Partner,
who was paid approximately 92,700 for administrative overhead attributable
to operating such properties during 2005.

The terms of the above transactions are similar to ones, which would have
been obtained through arm's length negotiations with unaffiliated third
parties.

The following table presents fees for professional audit services rendered
by KPMG LLP for the audit of the Partnership's annual financial statements
