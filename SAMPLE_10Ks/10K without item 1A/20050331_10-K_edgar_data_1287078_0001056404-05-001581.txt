Report on Management's Assertion on Compliance
with Minimum Servicing Standards Set Forth in the
Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers

Report of Independent Accountants

Board of Directors
ARCap Servicing, Inc.

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying report
titled Report of Management, that ARCap Servicing, Inc. (the Company) complied
with the minimum servicing standards as stated in Attachment A, which were
derived from the Mortgage Bankers Association of America's Uniform Single
Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers (USAP) except, for commercial loan and
multifamily loan servicing, minimum servicing standards V.4. and VI.1., which
the Mortgage Bankers Association of America has interpreted as inapplicable to
such servicing during the year ended December 31, 2004. Management is
responsible for the Company's compliance with those requirements. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertions about the
Company's compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with attestation standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance
with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal
determination on the Company's compliance with specified requirements.

In our opinion, management's assertion, that the Company complied with the
aforementioned requirements during the year ended December 31, 2004, is fairly
stated, in all material respects.

Independent Accountants' Report

The Board of Directors
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.:

We have examined management's assertion about Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage
Servicing's (a division of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.) compliance with the minimum
servicing standards set forth in the Mortgage Bankers Association of America's
(MBA's) Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers (USAP), except
for minimum servicing standards V.4 and VI.1, which the MBA has interpreted as
being inapplicable to the servicing of commercial and multi-family loans, as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2004 included in the accompanying management
assertion. Management is responsible for Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage
Servicing's compliance with those minimum servicing standards. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about Wells
Fargo Commercial Mortgage Servicing's compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage
Servicing's compliance with the minimum servicing standards and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on Wells Fargo Commercial
Mortgage Servicing's compliance with the minimum servicing standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that, except for minimum servicing
standards V.4 and VI.l, which the MBA has interpreted as being inapplicable to
the servicing of commercial and multi-family loans, Wells Fargo Commercial
Mortgage Servicing has complied in all material respects with the aforementioned
minimum servicing standards as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 is
fairly stated, in all material respects.

Association of America has interpreted as inapplicable to such servicing. We

Company's compliance with the minimum servicing standards as set forth in the
USAP as of December 31, 2004 and for the year then ended. Based on this
