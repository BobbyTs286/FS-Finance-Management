but not collected as a result of a mortgage loan in a non-earning (non 
accruing) status. The line "Net Unscheduled Interest Distributed" represents

Exhibit 99.2

 [Ernst & Young LLP Letterhead]

 Report of Independent Auditors on Agreement With
 U.S. Bank National Association

Audit Committee
PNC Bank Corp.

We have audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
the consolidated balance sheet of PNC Bank Corp. and subsidiaries (including
PNC Mortgage Securities Corp. (PNCMSC)) as of December 31, 1997, and the 
related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity,
and cash flows for the year then ended, and have issued our report thereon 
dated January 23, 1998.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements referred
to above, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that PNCMSC
failed to comply with the terms, covenants, provisions, or conditions of the
sections of the agreements between PNCMSC and U.S. Bank National Association 
(U.S. Bank), as listed for each series of certificates described in the
accompanying schedule, insofar as they relate to accounting matters. However,
our audit of the consolidated financial statements was not directed primarily
toward obtaining knowledge of noncompliance.

This report is intended solely for use by the audit committee, management, and
U.S. Bank, acting as trustee or custodian, as applicable, and should not be used
for any other purpose. However, this report may become a matter of public 
record as a result of being included as an exhibit to certain Form 10-Ks that 
are prepared by PNCMSC and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
on behalf of the trusts that are established in connection with the series of 
certificates listed on the accompanying schedule.
