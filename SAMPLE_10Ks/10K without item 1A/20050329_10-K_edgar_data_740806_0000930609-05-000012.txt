Report Format

The format of this report was changed in 2001 in order to increase information
distributed to shareholders and to reduce expenses related to preparing and
distributing annual financial information. Prior to that time, F & M Bank Corp.
provided an annual report to shareholders along with the annual proxy materials,
and also prepared and filed a separate Annual Report on Form 10-K under the
rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Beginning
in 2001 and for subsequent years, we are distributing the Form 10-K report to
shareholders with the annual proxy materials for the annual meeting. This report
includes the entire Form 10-K, other than exhibits, as filed with the SEC.

Item 7

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

The following discussion provides information about the major components of the
results of operations and financial condition, liquidity and capital resources
of F & M Bank Corp. and its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be
read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Item 8, Financial Statements
and Supplementary Information, of this Form 10-K.

Critical Accounting Policies

General

The Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The financial
information contained within the statements is, to a significant extent,
financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of
transactions and events that have already occurred. The Company's financial
position and results of operations are affected by management's application of
accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to
arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for
revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the
application of these policies could result in material changes in the Company's
consolidated financial position and/or results of operations.

In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to
another method. Although the economics of these transactions would be the same,
the timing of events that would impact these transactions could change.
Following is a summary of the Company's significant accounting policies that are
highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained
in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two basic principles of
accounting: (i) Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 5,
"Accounting for Contingencies", which requires that losses be accrued when they
are probable of occurring and estimable and (ii) SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan", which requires that losses be accrued based
on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash
flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan
balance.

The Company's allowance for loan losses is the accumulation of various
components that are calculated based on independent methodologies. All
components of the allowance represent an estimation performed pursuant to either
SFAS No. 5 or SFAS No. 114. Management's estimate of each SFAS No. 5 component
is based on certain observable data that management believes are most reflective
of the underlying credit losses being estimated. This evaluation includes credit
quality trends; collateral values; loan volumes; geographic, borrower and
industry concentrations; seasoning of the loan portfolio; the findings of
internal credit quality assessments and results from external bank regulatory
examinations. These factors, as well as historical losses and current economic
and business conditions, are used in developing estimated loss factors used in
the calculations.

Allowances for commercial loans are determined by applying estimated loss
factors to the portfolio based on management's evaluation and "risk grading" of
the commercial loan portfolio. Allowances are provided for noncommercial loan
categories using estimated loss factors applied to the total outstanding loan
balance of each loan category. Specific allowances are typically provided on all
impaired commercial loans in excess of a defined threshold that are classified
in the Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful risk grades. The specific
reserves are determined on a loan-by-loan basis based on management's evaluation
the Company's exposure for each credit, given the current payment status of the
loan and the value of any underlying collateral.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Allowance for Loan Losses (Continued)

While management uses the best information available to establish the allowance
for loan and lease losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary
if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making
the valuations or, if required by regulators, based upon information available
to them at the time of their examinations. Such adjustments to original
estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which these factors and other
relevant considerations indicate that loss levels may vary from previous
estimates.

Goodwill and Intangibles

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that the
purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001. Additionally, it further clarifies the criteria for the
initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets separate from goodwill.
SFAS No. 142 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001
and prescribes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to
initial recognition. The provisions of SFAS No. 142 discontinue the amortization
of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Instead, these assets
are subject to an annual impairment review and more frequently if certain
impairment indicators are in evidence. SFAS No. 142 also requires that reporting
units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of
goodwill.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. Goodwill totaled 2,639,000
at January 1, 2002. The goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment
at least annually. Based on this testing, there were no impairment charges for
2004 or 2003. Application of the non-amortization provisions of the Statement
resulted in additional net income of 190,000 for the year ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002.

Core deposit intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over a ten year
life. Core deposits, net of amortization, amounted to 1,702,000 and 1,978,000
at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company adopted SFAS 147 on
January 1, 2002 and determined that the core deposit intangible will continue to
be amortized over its estimated useful life.

Securities Impairment

The Company evaluates each of its investments in securities, debt and equity,
under guidelines contained in SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities. These guidelines require the Company to determine
whether a decline in value below original cost is other than temporary. In
making its determination, management considers current market conditions,
historical trends in the individual securities, and historical trends in the
overall markets. Expectations are developed regarding potential returns from
dividend reinvestment and price appreciation over a reasonable holding period
(five years) and current carrying values are compared to these expected values.
Declines determined to be other than temporary are charged to operations and
included in the gain (loss) on security sales. Such charges were 62,000 for
2004, zero for 2003 and 503,000 for 2002.

Overview

The Company's net income for 2004 totaled 4,350,000 or 1.80 per share, up 8.4 
from 4,012,000 or 1.66 a share in 2003. Return on average equity was virtually
unchanged in 2004 at 13.11 versus 13.13 in 2003, while the return on average
assets increased from 1.29 to 1.31 . The Company's operating earnings, which
are net earnings excluding gains (losses) on the sale of investments, redemption
of insurance contracts, and the non-cash amortization of acquisition
intangibles, were 4,177,000 in 2004 versus 3,930,000 in 2003, an increase of
6.28 . Core profitability improved as a result of an increase in net interest
income of 6.88 .

The largest source of operating revenue for the Company is net interest income,
which is calculated as the difference between the interest earned on earning
assets and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities. The net
interest margin is the net interest income expressed as a percentage of interest
earning assets. Changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and
interest bearing liabilities, along with their yields and rates, have a
significant impact on the level of net interest income.

Net interest income for 2004 was 11,408,000 representing an increase of
 735,000 or 6.88 . A 2.08 increase in 2003 versus 2002 resulted in total net
interest income of 10,673,000. In this discussion and in the tabular analysis
of net interest income performance, entitled "Consolidated Average Balances,
Yields and Rates," (found on page 10), the interest earned on tax exempt loans
and investment securities has been adjusted to reflect the amount that would
have been earned had these investments been subject to normal income taxation.
This is referred to as tax equivalent net interest income.

The analysis on the next page reveals a net interest margin that was flat in
2004 and which followed a decrease in 2003 resulting from the Federal Reserve's
accommodative monetary stance. During 2004, loan volumes generated interest
income that more than offset the decline in volume and rates on other asset
categories. Tax equivalent income on earning assets increased 94,000. Yields on
all loan categories and on taxable and partially taxable investments continued
to fall as assets repriced at lower levels. The yield on earning assets fell
..33 .

Although interest bearing liabilities continued to reprice at lower levels, the
rate of decline moderated during 2004, with the cost of funds dropping .39 
compared to a decline of .76 in 2003. The net interest margin held steady in
2004 at 3.82 primarily due to a shift in balance sheet leverage as the
percentage of, higher yielding assets (loans and securities) increased in 2004
to 96.25 of total earning assets as compared to 91.41 in 2003.

During 2003 the net interest margin decreased in part due to a slow down in the
rate of growth in the loan portfolio, lower rates received on adjustable rate
mortgages that reached a rate adjustment date, securities maturing with proceeds
reinvested at lower rates and an increase in low yielding, short-term federal
funds sold. The percentage of longer-term, higher yielding assets (loans and
securities) declined in 2003 to 91.41 or total earning assets as compared to
93.52 in 2002.

Interest Income

Tax equivalent interest income increased 94,000 or .56 in 2004, after
decreasing 7.09 or 1,287,000 in 2003. Although 2004 earning assets increased
 18,881,000, the distribution of the increase and overall decline in portfolio
rates resulted in only a modest increase in interest income. Overall, the yield
on earning assets declined .33 , from 5.93 to 5.60 . The combined two year
decrease in yields on earning assets now totals 1.20 .

Loan growth accelerated during 2004, with average outstandings increasing
 24,409,000 to 226,904,000. Real estate loans increased 18.56 and accounted
for over 68 of the total increase in year ending loans. This increase in real
estate loans resulted as rates for loans that remain in the Bank's portfolio,
primarily three and five year adjustable loans became more favorable as
secondary market rates rebounded somewhat from their historic lows. This
category includes residentially secured loans, as well as loans secured by
commercial real estate.

Average total securities, yielding 3.73 , decreased 13,532,000 during 2004.
Proceeds from the sale and maturity of investment securities were used to fund
loan growth. Income on loans held for sale increased 685,000. These are
short-term real estate loan participations that have an average life of
approximately fifteen days. The bank originally entered into this participation
arrangement as a higher yielding alternative to federal funds sold, however
throughout much of 2004, based on the volume of these participations and the
availability of excess liquidity, the Bank funded these participations with
overnight borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The spread between the
earnings on these participations and the cost of the overnight borrowings from
the FHLB added approximately 240,000 to pretax earnings and approximately
 158,000 to net income for the year.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased 614,000 or 10.22 during 2004, which followed an
18.68 decrease 1,381,000) in 2003. The average cost of funds of 2.10 
declined .39 compared to 2003. Average interest bearing liabilities increased
 15,322,000 and 13,853,000 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. This increase was
primarily the result of the increase in short-term debt, which was used to fund
short-term real estate loan participations. The Bank also enjoyed growth in
demand and savings accounts as a result of continued consolidation among larger
banks within its markets. Expense of time deposits decreased 705,000 or 17.55 
in 2004. This followed a decline of 17.97 or 880,000 in 2003. These decreases
resulted as customer accounts renewed at rates that were often 3.00 to 3.50 
lower than rates paid as recently as early 2001. Expense of long-term debt
decreased 246,000 and 126,000, respectively in 2004 and 2003. The declines in
both years resulted from a combination of lower levels of debt and lower average
expense as older higher rate debt paid off or paid down. The Company borrowed an
additional 9,000,000 from the FHLB to fund long-term loans during 2004 and did
not obtain any additional long-term debt during 2003.

Noninterest Income

As a result of the current low interest rate environment placing pressure on the
net interest margin, noninterest income continues to be an increasingly
important factor in maintaining and growing profitability. Management is
conscious of the need to constantly review fee income and develop additional
sources of complementary revenue. The Bank continues to enjoy increased revenue
from its subsidiary Farmers & Merchants Financial Services (FMFS). Gross revenue
for FMFS increased 97,000 in 2004. This increase resulted from greater levels
of commissions from its partnerships in Bankers Insurance, LLC and BI
Investments, LLC. This increase followed an increase of 137,000 in 2003.

Exclusive of securities gains and losses, and non-recurring insurance gains
non-interest income increased 5.16 111,000) in 2004 following an increase of
67.30 in 2003. Service charges on deposit accounts were virtually flat compared
to 2003, increasing only .65 6,000). In 2004, the Bank continued to offer
free regular checking accounts and increased the transaction limits on its small
business checking product in an effort to attract stable low cost deposits.
While we did attract an additional 6,278,000 in average balances of
non-interest bearing checking accounts this resulted in a decrease in account
maintenance fees of 32,000.

Overdraft charges moderated to an annualized growth rate of 5.09 in 2004. This
compared to a 41.93 increase in 2003, which was the first year of the Bank's
new bounce protection program. Bank management has reviewed our position within
the market and determined that an increase in the current overdraft fee from 25
to 29 per item is appropriate. This change will become effective April 1, 2005
and should be accretive to overdraft fee income in the current calendar year.

Investments in bank owned life insurance (BOLI) on officers of the Company
resulted in tax-free income of 251,000 in 2004 versus 238,000 in 2003. During
2003, the Bank invested an additional 2,291,000 in BOLI, through a combination
of cash purchases and a tax-free exchange of existing split-dollar life
insurance policies. The conversion of the split-dollar policies resulted in
non-recurring gains of 164,000 in 2003 which is included in other operating
income.

Securities transactions in 2004 resulted in gains of 532,000 after recognizing
impairment write downs of 162,000 on two of its equity holdings. These write
downs included a 100,000 write down on the Bank's investment in BI Investments,
LLC and a 62,000 write down by the Company on one of its equity holdings. This
followed gains of 179,000 in 2003, which included a similar write down on the
investment in BI Investments, LLC. Although this investment is a minority
interest, accounted for at cost, management determined that the losses generated
during 2004 and 2003 were unlikely to be recouped in the near future and
recognized impairment in the investment under SFAS 115.

13

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

In 2002, the Company suffered its first year of net securities losses since
1991. Losses in 2002 totaled 182,000, and were the result of the Company
recognizing impairment on several of its equity holdings. Based on market
conditions, historical trends of the individual securities and trends during
previous market cycles, management determined that several holdings met the
definition of impairment. The impairment recognized was based on management's
expectations of potential total returns from dividend reinvestment and price
appreciation over a reasonable holding period (five years). This analysis
resulted in a total write down in 2002 of 503,000 affecting five equities held
by the Company. The Company has reevaluated the investments that were written
down in 2002 during both 2004 and 2003 and determined that there was no
additional impairment.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expenses increased from 7,255,000 in 2003 to 7,741,000 in 2004, a
6.70 increase. Salary and benefits increased 6.36 to 4,392,000 in 2004 and
14.67 in 2003 compared to 2002. The 2004 increase resulted from normal salary
adjustments, increases in insurance and pension expenses. The increase in
salaries and benefits in 2003 included a full year of salaries and benefits for
the Harrisonburg mortgage and investment office, increased staff in several
branch offices, normal salary adjustments and increases in insurance and pension
expenses.

Occupancy and equipment expense increased 21,000 (2.58 in 2004. This follows
an 18.45 increase in 2003 which resulted from full year of expenses for the
Harrisonburg office, additional depreciation on the remodeled Elkton Office and
depreciation on upgrades to computer hardware and software.

Other operating expense increased 202,000 in 2004, following a 153,000
increase in 2003. Much of the increase was due to increases in data processing
fees paid for computer software, licensing and maintenance of new and existing
programs; advertising, travel and training, ATM expenses, check printing costs
and a non-compete covenant with a retired executive.

Although noninterest expenses have increased substantially in both 2004 and
2003, they continue to be substantially less than peer group averages. Total
noninterest expense as a percentage of average assets totaled 2.33 , 2.34 , and
2.22 , in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Peer group averages are
approximately 3.10 over the same time period.

Provision for Loan Losses

Management evaluates the loan portfolio in light of national and local economic
trends, changes in the nature and value of the portfolio and industry standards.
Specific factors considered by management in determining the adequacy of the
level of the allowance for loan losses include internally generated loan review
reports, past due reports and historical loan loss experience. This review also
considers concentrations of loans in terms of geography, business type and level
of risk. Management evaluates nonperforming loans relative to their collateral
value and makes the appropriate adjustments to the allowance for loan losses
when needed. Based on the factors outlined above, the current year provision for
loan losses increased from 226,000 in 2003 to 240,000 in 2004. Actual loan
charge-offs were 213,000 in 2004 and 219,000 in 2003. Loan losses as a
percentage of period ending loans held for investment totaled .09 and .10 in
both 2004 and 2003, respectively. Losses continue at less than one-half that of
the Bank's peer group average, which have ranged between .17 and .29 over the
last three years.

Balance Sheet

Total assets increased 19.68 during the year to 369,957,000, an increase of
 60,831,000 from 309,126,000 in 2003. Earning assets increased 20.48 or
 58,671,000 to 345,170,000 at December 31, 2003. Much of the increase in
earning assets resulted from the aforementioned real estate loan participation
portfolio which totaled 47,150,000 at year end 2004. Interest bearing
liabilities increased 50,870,000 or 21.31 . Short-term debt increased
 50,973,000 with most of this increase used to fund mortgage loan
participations. If these mortgage participations decrease significantly, which
has occurred in the first quarter of 2005, the balance sheet will contract as
both loans held for sale and short-term debt will decrease proportionately. The
Company continues to utilize its assets well with 93.30 of year-end assets
consisting of earning assets.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Investment Securities

Average balances in investment securities decreased 23.63 in 2004 to
 43,730,000. This decrease was in the investment portfolio segment of fully
taxable investment securities. The decrease resulted from a combination of
securities sales, maturities and pool pay downs. Securities were sold during the
spring and summer of 2004 to fund loan growth and to take advantage of
securities gains that were available within the portfolio. The securities sales
in these periods resulted in gains to the Bank of 99,000.

At year end, the 11 of earning assets of the Company were held as investment
securities to provide liquidity, as security for public deposits and to secure
repurchase agreements. Management strives to match the types and maturities of
securities owned to balance projected liquidity needs, interest rate sensitivity
and to maximize earnings through a portfolio bearing low credit risk.

Portfolio yields averaged 3.73 for 2004, down from 4.08 in 2003. Average
yields have tended to fall below the peer group due to management's decision to
maintain a relatively short duration portfolio. This has been especially true in
recent periods due to the sale of a significant percentage of the Bank's
holdings of corporate bonds. As previously mentioned, these bonds were sold to
fund loan growth, to assist in the management of risk based capital ratios and
were selected for sale due to gains that were available at the time the sale
decision was made.

Analysis of Loan Portfolio

The Company's portfolio of loans held for investment totaled 248,972,000 at
December 31, 2004 compared with 211,231,000 at the beginning of the year. The
Company's policy has been to make conservative loans that are held for future
interest income. Collateral required by the Company is determined on an
individual basis depending on the purpose of the loan and the financial
condition of the borrower. Commercial loans, including agricultural and multi
family loans, increased 22.78 during 2004 to 62,787,000. Real estate mortgages
increased 23,742,000 (19.22 ), while construction loans increased 2,036,000 or
13.28 . Consumer installment loans had a modest increase of 376,000. This
category includes personal loans, auto loans and other loans to individuals. It
appears that this category suffers from strong competition by other providers of
automobile financing, favorable mortgage rates that have led to refinancing of
existing loans and growth in home equity lines of credit. Credit card balances
were increased 15,000 to 1,478,000 but are a minor component of the loan
portfolio.

The following table presents the changes in the loan portfolio over the previous
five years.

Residential real estate loans are generally made for a period not to exceed 25
years and are secured by a first deed of trust which normally does not exceed
90 of the appraised value. If the loan to value ratio exceeds 90 , the Company
requires additional collateral, guarantees or mortgage insurance. On
approximately 80 of the real estate loans, interest is adjustable after each
three or five year period. Fixed rate loans are generally made for a
fifteen-year or a twenty-year period with an interest rate adjustment after ten
years.

Since 1992, fixed rate real estate loans have been funded with fixed rate
borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, which allows the Company to control
its interest rate risk. In addition, the Company makes home equity loans secured
by second deeds of trust with total indebtedness not to exceed 90 of the
appraised value. Home equity loans are made for three, five or seven year
periods at a fixed rate or as a revolving line of credit.

Construction loans may be made to individuals, who have arranged with a
contractor for the construction of a residence, or to contractors that are
involved in building pre-sold, spec-homes or subdivisions. The majority of
commercial loans are made to small retail, manufacturing and service businesses.
Consumer loans are made for a variety of reasons, however, approximately 60 of
the loans are secured by automobiles and trucks.

The Company's market area has a stable economy which tends to be less cyclical
than the national economy. Major industries in the market area include
agricultural production and processing, higher education, retail sales, services
and light manufacturing. The agricultural production and processing industry is
a major contributor to the local economy and its performance and growth tend to
be cyclical in nature, however, this cyclical nature is offset by other stable
industries in the trade area. In addition to direct agricultural loans, a large
percentage of residential real estate loans and consumer installment loans are
made to borrowers whose income is derived from the agricultural sector of the
economy. A large percentage of the agricultural loans are made to poultry
growers.

During recent years, real estate values in the Company's market area for
commercial, agricultural and residential property increased, on the average,
between 5 and 8 annually depending on the location and type of property.
Approximately 80 of the Company's loans are secured by real estate, however,
policies relating to appraisals and loan to value ratios are adequate to control
the related risk. Unemployment rates in the Company's market area continue to be
below both the national and state averages.

The Bank has identified loan concentrations of greater than 25 of capital in
the following categories, poultry related, motel properties, churches and
construction/development. While the Bank has not developed a formal policy
limiting the concentration level to any particular loan type or industry
segment, concentrations are monitored and reported to the board of directors
quarterly. Concentration levels have been used by management to determine how
aggressively they may price or pursue new loan requests. At December 31, 2004,
there are no industry categories of loans that exceed 10 of total loans.

Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans

The following table shows loans placed in a nonaccrual status and loans
contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments.

Commerical loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become ninety days or
more past due, unless there is an expectation that the loan will either be
brought current or paid in full in a reasonable period of time. Interest
accruals are continued on past due, secured residential real estate loans and
consumer purpose loans until the principal and accrued interest equal the value
of the collateral and on unsecured loans until the financial condition of the
borrower deteriorates to the point that any further accrued interest would be
determined to be uncollectible. At December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, there were
no restructured loans on which interest was accruing at a reduced rate or on
which payments had been extended.

Potential Problem Loans

Loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss, doubtful, substandard, or
special mention do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties which
management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results,
liquidity or capital resources. Nor do they represent material credits about
which management is aware of any information which causes it to have serious
doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment
terms. As of December 31, 2004, management is not aware of any potential problem
loans which are not already classified for regulatory purposes or on the watch
list as part of the Bank's internal grading system.

Loan Losses and the Allowance for Loan Losses

In evaluating the portfolio, loans are segregated into loans with identified
potential losses, and pools of loans by type (commercial, residential, consumer,
credit cards). Loans with identified potential losses include examiner and bank
classified loans. Classified relationships in excess of 100,000 are reviewed
individually for impairment under FAS 114. A variety of factors are taken into
account when reviewing these credits, including borrower cash flow, payment
history, fair value of collateral, company management, industry and economic
factors. Loan relationships that are determined to have no impairment are placed
back into the appropriate loan pool and reviewed under SFAS No. 5.

Loan pools are further segmented into watch list, past due over 90 days and all
other. Watch list loans include loans that are 60 days past due and may include
restructured loans, borrowers that are highly leveraged, loans that have been
upgraded from classified or loans that contain policy exceptions (term,
collateral coverage, etc.). Loss estimates on these loans reflect the increased
risk associated with these assets due to any of the above factors. The past due
pools contain loans that are currently 90 days or more past due. Loss rates
assigned to these past due loans reflect the fact that these loans bear a
significant risk of charge-off. Loss rates vary by loan type to reflect the
likelihood that collateral values will offset a portion of the anticipated
losses.

The remainder of the portfolio falls into pools by type of homogenous loans that
do not exhibit any of the above described weaknesses. Loss rates are assigned
based on historical rates over either the prior five year or prior two year
period depending on the type of loan. A multiplier has been applied to these
loss rates to reflect the time for loans to season within the portfolio and the
inherent imprecision of these estimates.

18

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

All potential losses are evaluated within a range of low to high. An unallocated
allowance has been established to reflect other unidentified losses within the
portfolio. The unallocated allowance mitigates the increased risk of loss
associated with fluctuations in past due trends, changes in the local and
national economies, and other unusual events. The Board approves the loan loss
provision for each quarter based on this evaluation. An effort is made to keep
the actual allowance at or above the midpoint of the range established by the
evaluation process.

The allowance for loan losses of 1,511,000 at December 31, 2004 is equal to
..61 of total loans held for investment. This compares to an allowance of
 1,484,000 (.70 at December 31, 2003. The overall level of the allowance
remains well below the peer group averages. Management feels this is appropriate
based on its loan loss history and the composition of its loan portfolio; the
current allowance for loan losses is equal to approximately seven years of
average loan losses. Based on historical losses, delinquency rates, collateral
values of delinquent loans and a thorough review of the loan portfolio,
management is of the opinion that the allowance for loan losses fairly states
the estimated losses in the current portfolio.

Loan losses, net of recoveries, totaled 213,000 in 2004 which is equivalent to
..09 of total loans outstanding. Over the preceding five years, the Company has
had an average loss rate of .08 which is approximately forty percent of the
loss rate of its peer group.

The Company has allocated the allowance according to the amounts deemed to be
reasonably necessary to provide for the possibility of losses occurring within
each of the above categories of loans. The allocation of the allowance as shown
below should not be interpreted as an indication that loan losses in future
years will occur in the same proportions or that the allocation indicates future
loan loss trends.

Furthermore, the portion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount
available for future losses that might occur within such categories since the
total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the entire portfolio.

Deposits and Borrowings

The Bank recognized an increase in year-end deposits in 2004 of 2.41 . The Bank
experienced an increase in all account types with the exception of certificates
of deposit. Rates of interest declined throughout all of 2004. The Bank
advertised free checking throughout the year which resulted in a 22.85 7,570,000) increase in noninterest bearing checking accounts. In the fourth
quarter of 2004, the Bank began advertising a special promotion on a thirteen
month time deposit. This certificate was designed to raise cash to fund loan
growth and also as a defensive measure in some parts of our market due to
competition from other banks. In January 2005, the Bank also began offering a
rate special on a nine month certificate of deposit. Time deposits have
increased approximately 6,000,000 through the end of February 2005 as a result
of these two promotions.

The Bank has traditionally avoided brokered and large deposits believing that
they were unstable and, thus not desirable. This has proven to be a good
strategy as the local deposit base is very stable and small increases in rates
above the competition have usually resulted in deposit gains in past years.
Beginning in 2001 the Bank has, on occasion, accepted certificates of deposit
from other financial institutions at below market rates of interest. Typically
this has been done to meet loan demand or if liquidity was sufficient, the Bank
has reinvested these deposits in certificates of deposit at other institutions
which were offering above market rates. Certificates of deposit over 100,000
totaled 24,660,968 at December 31, 2004. The maturity distribution of these
certificates is as follows:

 (Dollars in thousands) 2004 2003
 ---------------------- ---- ----

 Less than 3 months 3,931 3,206

 ========= ==========

Non-deposit borrowings include repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased,
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) daily rate credit and long-term debt obtained
through the FHLB and SunTrust Bank. Repurchase agreements continue to be an
important source of funding and provide commercial customers the opportunity to
earn market rates of interest on funds that are secured by specific securities
owned by the Bank.

Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank are used to support the Bank's
mortgage lending program and allow the Bank to offer longer-term mortgages. The
Bank borrowed 9,000,000 in 2004 and did not borrow any additional funds from
the FHLB during 2003. Quarterly installment payments on FHLB debt totaled
 6,194,000 for the year. These loans carry an average rate of 4.40 at December
31, 2004.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Stockholder's Equity

Total stockholders' equity increased 1,941,000 or 6.01 in 2004. Earnings
retained from operations were the primary source of the increase. As of December
31, 2004, book value per share was 14.21 compared to 13.35 as of December 31,
2003. Dividends are paid to stockholders on a quarterly basis in uniform amounts
unless unexpected fluctuations in net income indicate a change to this policy is
needed.

Banking regulators have established a uniform system to address the adequacy of
capital for financial institutions. The rules require minimum capital levels
based on risk-adjusted assets. Simply stated, the riskier an entity's
investments, the more capital it is required to maintain. The Bank, as well as
the Company, is required to maintain these minimum capital levels. The two types
of capital guidelines are Tier I capital (referred to as core capital) and Tier
II capital (referred to as supplementary capital). At December 31, 2004, the
Company had Tier I capital of 12.59 of risk weighted assets and combined Tier I
and II capital of 13.22 of risk weighted assets. Regulatory minimums at this
date were 4 and 8 , respectively. The Bank has maintained capital levels far
above the minimum requirements throughout the year. In the unlikely event that
such capital levels are not met, regulatory agencies are empowered to require
the Company to raise additional capital and/or reallocate present capital.

In addition, the regulatory agencies have issued guidelines requiring the
maintenance of a capital leverage ratio. The leverage ratio is computed by
dividing Tier I capital by actual total assets. The regulators have established
a minimum of 3 for this ratio, but can increase the minimum requirement based
upon an institution's overall financial condition. At December 31, 2004, the
Company reported a leverage ratio of 8.38 . The Bank's leverage ratio was also
substantially above the minimum.

Market Risk Management

Most of the Company's net income is dependent on the Bank's net interest income.
As the rapid change in short-term interest rates demonstrated in 2001, net
interest income is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that imbalances
exist between the maturities or repricing of interest bearing liabilities and
interest earning assets. In 2002 for example, interest bearing liabilities
repriced much more quickly than interest earning assets; this resulted in an
increase in the net interest margin compared to 2001. During 2003 this trend
reversed, as longer term assets (principally mortgage loans and securities)
matured or repriced at rates that were substantially lower, while most interest
bearing liabilities had already repriced at lower rates in either 2001 or 2002.
In 2004, the net interest margin was unchanged, both interest earning assets and
interest bearing liabilities continued to reprice at lower levels.

Net interest income is also affected by changes in the mix of funding that
supports earning assets. For example, higher levels of non-interest bearing
demand deposits and leveraging earning assets by funding with stockholder's
equity would result in greater levels of net interest income than if most of the
earning assets were funded with higher cost interest-bearing liabilities, such
as certificates of deposit.

Liquidity as of December 31, 2004 is strong. The Bank historically has had a
stable core deposit base and, therefore, does not have to rely on volatile
funding sources. Because of the stable core deposit base, changes in interest
rates should not have a significant effect on liquidity. During 2004, the Bank
used, investment sales, maturing investments, and deposit growth to meet its
funding needs for loans held for investment. The Bank's membership in the
Federal Home Loan Bank has historically provided liquidity as the Bank borrows
money that is repaid over a five to ten year period and uses the money to make
fixed rate loans. The matching of the long-term receivables and liabilities
helps the Bank reduce its sensitivity to interest rate changes. The Company
reviews its interest rate gap periodically and makes adjustments as needed.
There are no off balance sheet items that will impair future liquidity.

As mentioned previously, the Bank has used short-term daily rate credit from the
FHLB to fund its portfolio of loans held for sale. The rate on the daily rate
credit can reprice daily, while the loans held for sale reprice with changes in
the federal funds rates. Since these assets have an average life of
approximately fifteen days, there is very little interest rate risk associated
with the matching of the asset and corresponding liability.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

The following table depicts the Company's interest rate sensitivity, as measured
by the repricing of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities as of December
31, 2004. As the notes to the table indicate, the data was based in part on
assumptions as to when certain assets or liabilities would mature or reprice.
The analysis indicates a liability sensitive one-year cumulative GAP position of
5.87 of total earning assets. Approximately 37 of rate sensitive assets and
51 of rate sensitive liabilities are subject to repricing within one year. The
one-year cumulative GAP increased during 2004, as the Bank held less short-term
liquid assets. Based on historically low rates on bonds throughout 2004 and
strong loan demand, the Investment Committee and management choose to not
reinvest bond maturities, loan repayments and cash in longer-term investments.
Management believes that remaining liquid and keeping investments short-term in
nature will allow it to achieve greater earnings in the future when rates rise
to higher levels.

The following GAP analysis shows the time frames from December 31, 2004, in

In preparing the above table, no assumptions are made with respect to loan
 prepayments or deposit run off. Loan principal payments are included in the
 earliest period in which the loan matures or can be repriced. Principal
 payments on installment loans scheduled prior to maturity are included in
 the period of maturity or repricing. Proceeds from the redemption of
 investments and deposits are included in the period of maturity. Estimated
 maturities on deposits which have no stated maturity dates were derived
 from guidance contained in FDICIA 305.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46"). This Interpretation provides guidance
with respect to the identification of variable interest entities and when the
assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests, and results of operations of a
variable interest entity need to be included in a company's consolidated
financial statements. The Interpretation requires consolidation by business
enterprises of variable interest entities in cases where (a) the equity
investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties,
which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the
expected losses of the entity, or (b) in cases where the equity investors lack
one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial
interest, which include the ability to make decisions about the entity's
activities through voting rights, the obligations to absorb the expected losses
of the entity if they occur, or the right to receive the expected residual
returns of the entity if they occur. Management has evaluated the Company's
investments in variable interest entities and potential variable interest
entities or transactions, particularly in limited liability partnerships
involved in low-income housing development. The implementation of FIN 46 did not
have a significant impact on either the Company's consolidated financial
position or consolidated results of operations. Interpretive guidance relating
to FIN 46 is continuing to evolve and the Company's management will continue to
assess various aspects of consolidations and variable interest entity accounting
as additional guidance becomes available.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Statement amends and
clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for
hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities. The Statement is effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003, with certain exceptions, and for hedging
relationships designated after June 30, 2003. It is not expected to have an
impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. This Statement
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It
requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope
as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Many of these instruments
were previously classified as equity. This Statement is effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and was effective at
the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003.
Adoption of the Statement did not result in an impact on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

In December 2003, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee ("AcSEC") of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position
("SOP") 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a
Transfer. The SOP is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2004. The scope of the SOP applies to unhealthy "problem"
loans that have been acquired, either individually in a portfolio, or in a
business acquisition. The SOP addresses accounting for differences between
contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an
investor's initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer
if those differences are attributable, at least in part, t credit quality. The
SOP does not apply to loans originated by the Company. The Company adopted the
provisions of SOP 03-3 effective January 1, 2005. There was no effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.

On March 9, 2004, the SEC Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 105,
Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments ("SAB 105"). SAB 105
clarifies existing accounting practices relating to the valuation of issued loan
commitments, including interest rate lock commitments ("IRLC"), subject to SFAS
No. 149 and Derivative Implementation Group Issue C13, Scope Exceptions: When a
Loan Commitment is included in the Scope of Statement 133. Furthermore, SAB 105
disallows the inclusion of the values of a servicing component and other
internally developed intangible assets in the initial and subsequent IRLC
valuation. The provisions of SAB 105 were effective for loan commitments entered
into after March 31, 2004. The Company has adopted the provisions of SAB 105.
There was no impact on either the Company's consolidated financial position or
consolidated results of operations.

Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. (EITF) 03-1 The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments was
issued and is effective March 31, 2004. The EITF 03-1 provides guidance for
determining the meaning of "other-than-temporarily impaired" and its application
to certain debt and equity securities within the scope of SFAS No. 115
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities and investments
accounted for under the cost method. The guidance requires that investments
which have declined in value due to credit concerns or solely due to changes in
interest rates must be recorded as other-than-temporarily impaired unless the
Company can assert and demonstrate its intention to hold the security for a
period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery of fair value up to or beyond
the cost of the investment which might mean maturity. This issue also requires
disclosures assessing the ability and intent to hold investments in instances in
which an investor determines that an investment with a fair value less than cost
is not other-than-temporarily impaired. On September 30, 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") decided to delay the effective date for the
measurement and recognition guidance contained in EITF 03-1. This delay does not
suspend the requirement to recognize other-than-temporary impairments as
required by existing authoritative literature. The disclosure guidance in EITF
03-1 was not delayed. The Company has included the required disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements.

EITF No. 03-16, Accounting for Investments in Limited Liability Companies was
ratified by the Board and is effective for reporting periods beginning after
June 15, 2004. APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock, prescribes the accounting for investments in common
stock of corporations that are not consolidated. AICPA Accounting Interpretation
2, Investments in Partnership Ventures, of Opinion 18 indicates that "many of
the provisions of the Opinion would be appropriate in accounting" for
partnerships. In EITF Abstracts, Topic No. D-46, Accounting for Limited
Partnership Investments, the SEC staff clarified its view that investments of
more than 3 to 5 percent are considered to be more than minor and, therefore,
should be accounted for using the equity method. Limited liability companies
(LLCs) have characteristics of both corporations and partnerships, but are
dissimilar from both in certain respects. Due to those similarities and
differences, diversity in practice exists with respect to accounting for
non-controlling investments in LLCs. The consensus reached was that an LLC
should be viewed as similar to a corporation or similar to a partnership for
purposes of determining whether a non-controlling investment should be accounted
for using the cost method or the equity method of accounting.

On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.123R, Share Based Payment, which
amends SFAS No.123 and SFAS No.95, Statement of Cash Flows, and requires
compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized
in the financial statements. With limited exceptions, the amount of compensation
cost will be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or
liability instruments issued. In addition, liability awards will be remeasured
each reporting period. Compensation cost will be recognized over the period that
an employee provides service in exchange for the reward. SFAS No.123R requires
the expense of all unvested grants, including grants prior to 2003, to be
reported in operating expense (the "modified prospective" method). Options with
graded vesting will be expensed more rapidly. This Statement did not have an
effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1 NATURE OF OPERATIONS:

F & M Bank Corp. (the "Company"), through its subsidiary Farmers & Merchants
Bank (the "Bank"), operates under a charter issued by the Commonwealth of
Virginia and provides commercial banking services. As a state chartered bank,
the Bank is subject to regulation by the Virginia Bureau of Financial
Institutions and the Federal Reserve Bank. The Bank provides services to
customers located mainly in Rockingham and Shenandoah counties in Virginia, and
the adjacent counties of Page, and Augusta. Services are provided at eight
branch offices. In addition, the Company offers insurance and financial services
through its subsidiaries, TEB Life Insurance, Inc. and Farmers & Merchants
Financial Services, Inc.

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries
conform to generally accepted accounting principles and to accepted practice
within the banking industry.

The following is a summary of the more significant policies:

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Farmers and Merchants Bank, the TEB Life Insurance Company and Farmers &
Merchants Financial Services, Inc. Significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in those statements; actual
results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that
are particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near term are the
determination of the allowance for loan losses, which is sensitive to changes in
local and national economic conditions, and the other than temporary impairment
of investments in the investment portfolio.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and deposits at other financial
institutions whose initial maturity is ninety days or less.

Investment Securities

Management reviews the securities portfolio and classifies all securities as
either held to maturity or available for sale at the date of acquisition.
Securities that the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to
maturity (at time of purchase) are classified as held to maturity securities.
All other securities are classified as available for sale. Securities held to
maturity are carried at historical cost and adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, using the effective interest method.
Securities available for sale are carried at fair value with any valuation
adjustments reported, net of deferred taxes, as a part of other accumulated
comprehensive income. Also included in securities available for sale are
marketable equity securities.

Interest, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on securities are
reported as interest income using the effective interest method. Gains (losses)
realized on sales and calls of securities are determined on the specific
identification method.

Accounting for Historic Rehabilitation and Low Income Housing Partnerships

The Company periodically invests in low income housing partnerships whose
primary benefit is the distribution of federal tax credits to partners. The
Company recognizes these benefits and the cost of the investments over the life
of the partnership (usually 15 years). In addition, state and federal historic
rehabilitation credits were generated from an investment in one of the
partnerships. Amortization of this investment is prorated based on the amount of
benefits received in each year to the total estimated benefits over the life of
the project. All benefits have been shown as investment income since income tax
benefits are the only anticipated benefits of ownership.

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):

Loans

Loans are carried on the balance sheet net of any unearned interest and the
allowance for loan losses. Interest income on loans is determined using the
effective interest method on the daily amount of principal outstanding except
where serious doubt exists as to collectibility of the loan, in which case the
accrual of income is discontinued.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to
bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance that management
considers adequate to absorb potential losses in the portfolio. Loans are
charged against the allowance when management believes the collectibility of the
principal is unlikely. Recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are credited
to the allowance. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance is
based on an evaluation of the composition of the loan portfolio, the value and
adequacy of collateral, current economic conditions, historical loan loss
experience, and other risk factors. Management believes that the allowance for
loan losses is adequate. While management uses available information to
recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary
based on changes in economic conditions, particularly those affecting real
estate values. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their
examination process, periodically review the Company's allowance for loan
losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the
allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the
time of their examination.

A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it
is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of
principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan
agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include
payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled
principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant
payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired.
Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls
on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances
surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the
reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of
the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is
measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and construction loans by either
the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's
effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value
of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

Nonaccrual Loans

Commerical loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become ninety days or
more past due, unless there is an expectation that the loan will either be
brought current or paid in full in a reasonable period of time. Interest
accruals are continued on past due, secured residential real estate loans and
consumer purpose loans until the principal and accrued interest equal the value
of the collateral and on unsecured loans until the financial condition of the
borrower deteriorates to the point that any further accrued interest would be
determined to be uncollectible.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):

Bank Premises and Equipment

Bank premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged to income over the estimated useful lives of the assets
on a combination of the straight-line and accelerated methods. The ranges of the
useful lives of the premises and equipment are as follows:

 Buildings and Improvements 10 - 40 years
 Furniture and Fixtures 5 - 20 years

Maintenance, repairs, and minor improvements are charged to operations as
incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions are reflected in other income or
expense.

Intangible Assets

Core deposit intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over ten years.
Core deposit intangibles, net of amortization totaled 1,702,000 and 1,978,000
at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company adopted SFAS 147 on
January 1, 2002 and determined that the core deposit intangible will continue to
be amortized over the estimated useful life.

Goodwill

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that the
purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001. Additionally, it further clarifies the criteria for the
initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets separate from goodwill.
SFAS No. 142 became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001
and prescribes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to
initial recognition. The provisions of SFAS No. 142 discontinue the amortization
of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Instead, these assets
are subject to an impairment review on an annual basis and more frequently if
certain impairment indicators are in evidence. SFAS No. 142 also requires that
reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future
impairments of goodwill.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. Goodwill totaled 2,639,000
at December 31, 2004 and 2003. The goodwill is no longer amortized, but instead
tested for impairment at least annually. Based on the testing, there were no
impairment charges for 2004 or 2003. Application of the nonamortization
provisions of the Statement resulted in additional net income of approximately
 190,000 for each the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Pension Plans

Substantially all employees are covered by a pension plan. The net periodic
pension expense includes a service cost component, estimated normal return on
plan assets, and the effect of deferring and amortizing certain actuarial gains
and losses.

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED):

Advertising Costs

The Company follows the policy of charging the cost of advertising to expense as
incurred. Total advertising costs included in other operating expenses for 2004,
2003, and 2002 were 163,082, 139,749, and 141,461, respectively.

Income Taxes

Amounts provided for income tax expense are based on income reported for
financial statement purposes rather than amounts currently payable under income
tax laws. Deferred taxes, which arise principally from temporary differences
between the period in which certain income and expenses are recognized for
financial accounting purposes and the period in which they affect taxable
income, are included in the amounts provided for income taxes.

Comprehensive Income

Accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains
and losses be included in net income. Certain changes in assets and liabilities,
such as unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and gains
or losses on certain derivative contracts, are reported as a separate component
of the equity section of the balance sheet. Such items, along with operating net
income, are components of comprehensive income.

The components of other comprehensive income and related tax effects are as
follows:

The Bank is required to maintain average reserve balances based on a percentage
of deposits. The average balance of cash, which the Federal Reserve Bank

December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company's gross proceeds from the sale of debt securities for 2004 were
approximately 18,650,000 which resulted in gains of 107,617 and losses of
 9,030. The realized gains and losses and the gross proceeds from the sale of

Based on a review of its equities portfolio, the Company recognized an
impairment of 503,034 in the carrying basis of five of its equity holdings as
of December 31, 2002. In 2004, the Company recognized an impairment of 161,633
in the carrying basis on two of its equity holdings. These write downs were a
result of management's evaluation and determination that these assets met the
definition for impairment under SFAS 115.

The carrying value (which approximates fair value) of securities pledged by the
Bank to secure deposits and for other purposes amounted to 12,381,675 at
December 31, 2004 and 16,550,000 at December 31, 2003. The Company has pledged
 2,986,426 of equity securities to secure the 2,538,462 indebtedness
outstanding with SunTrust Bank (see note 10).

Other investments consist of investments in nine low-income housing and historic
equity partnerships (carrying basis of 3,288,197) and stock in the Federal Home
Loan Bank, and various other investments (carrying basis of 4,646,229). The
interests in the low-income housing and historic equity partnerships have
limited transferability and the interests in the other stocks are restricted as
to sales. The market values of these securities are estimated to approximate
their carrying value as of December 31, 2004. During 2004 and 2003, the Company
recognized a loss in its investment in BI Investments of 100,000. This write
down was the result of losses incurred by BI Investments during its first and
second years of operation. At December 31, 2004, the Company was committed to
invest an additional 2,555,974 in four low-income housing limited partnerships.
These funds will be paid as requested by the general partner to complete the
projects. This additional investment has been reflected in the above carrying
basis and in accrued liabilities on the balance sheet.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 4 INVESTMENT SECURITIES (CONTINUED):

The primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to generate income and meet
liquidity needs of the Company through readily saleable financial instruments.
The portfolio includes fixed rate bonds, whose prices move inversely with rates,
variable rate bonds and equity securities. At the end of any accounting period,
the investment portfolio has unrealized gains and losses. The Company monitors
the portfolio, which is subject to liquidity needs, market rate changes and
credit risk changes, to see if adjustments are needed. The primary concern in a
loss situation is the credit quality of the business behind the instrument. In
2004 and 2002, the Company wrote down several equity investments because of
price deterioration that was not expected to improve in the near term. Bonds
deteriorate in value due to credit quality of the individual issuer and changes
in market conditions. There are approximately 27 holdings in the current
portfolio that have losses. These losses relate to market conditions and the
timing of purchases and are not a material concern since they have moved up and
down with the market.

NOTE 5 LOANS (CONTINUED):

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the recorded investment in loans which have been
identified as impaired loans, in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan"
(SFAS 114), totaled 4,116,000 and 3,407,000, respectively. The valuation
allowance related to impaired loans on December 31, 2004 and 2003 is 505,000
and 395,000, respectively. For the years of 2004, 2003 and 2002, the average
balances of impaired loans were 4,301,000, 3,075,000, and 4,004,000,
respectively. The amount of interest income recorded by the Company during 2004,
2003 and 2002 on impaired loans was 301,000, 215,000, and 305,000,
respectively. There were no nonaccrual loans excluded from impaired loan
disclosure at December 31, 2004 or December 31, 2003

The Company has pledged loans as collateral for borrowings with the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Atlanta totaling 163,524,000 and 25,004,804 as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Prior to 2004, the Company pledged specific
residential real estate loans to secure its borrowings from the FHLB. During
2004, the Company switched to a blanket lien on its entire residential real
estate portfolio and also began pledging commercial and home equity loans.

Loans held for sale as of December 31:

 2004 2003
 -------- -------
 Real Estate 47,149,966

Loans held for sale consists of the Bank's commitment to purchase up to
 55,000,000 in residential mortgage loan participations. These loans are
purchased as a 95 participation in loans that are warehoused by a bank in
California. Loans are originated by a network of mortgage loan originators
throughout the United States. The Bank receives certain loan documents daily for
review, makes its purchase decision and wires funds to the bank in California.
By contract terms, the Bank will hold these loans up to 60 days. The actual
holding period of individual loans has ranged from 1 day to 56 days, with an
average of 15 days during 2004.

The commitment to purchase these loan participations was entered into in 2003,
as a 30,000,000 commitment, but actual purchases were immaterial until March
2004. This program was entered into as an alternative to selling Federal Funds
and other short term investments. As demand within the program increased, the
Bank recognized an opportunity to earn a return based on the spread between the
participation interest received and the cost of borrowing daily rate credit from
the FHLB. The volume of loans purchased fluctuates due to a number of factors
including changes in secondary market rates, which affects demand for mortgage
loans; the number of participating banks involved in the program; the number of
mortgage loan originators selling loans to the lead bank and the funding
capabilities of the lead bank.

Repurchase agreements are secured transactions with customers and generally
mature the day following the date sold. Federal funds purchased are unsecured
overnight borrowings from other financial institutions. FHLB daily rate credit,
which is secured by the loan portfolio is a variable rate loan that acts as a
line of credit to meet financing needs. Margin borrowings which carry a variable
rate are secured by investment securities and are used to finance equity
acquisitions on a short term basis.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had lines of credit with correspondent
banks totaling 18,052,000, which are used in the management of short-term

New borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB) were 9,000,000
in 2004, zero in 2003 and 15,000,000 in 2002. The interest rates on the notes
payable are fixed at the time of the advance and range from 3.92 to 5.33 ; the
weighted average interest rate is 4.40 at December 31, 2004. The balance of
this obligation at December 31, 2004 was 23,923,056. The long-term debt is
secured by qualifying mortgage loans owned by the Company.

The Company borrowed 3,000,000 of long-term debt in September 2002 from
SunTrust Bank. Of this amount, 2,000,000 was used as contributed capital to the
Bank, 900,000 was used to payoff a loan from the Bank for securities purchases
and the balance was used for working capital needs. The outstanding balance at
December 31, 2004 was 2,538,462 with quarterly principal payments of 230,769
over the next eleven quarters. The interest rate is a floating rate of LIBOR
plus 1.10 , adjustable monthly. Repayments of long-term debt are due either
quarterly or semi-annually and interest is due monthly. Interest expense of
 1,005,606, 1,245,531, and 1,371,774 was incurred on these debts in 2004,
2003, and 2002, respectively. The maturities of long-term debt as of December
31, 2004 are as follows:

 2005 9,517,561

NOTE 12 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS:

The Bank participates in the Virginia Bankers' Association Master Defined
Benefit Pension Plan and Trust. Substantially all bank employees are covered by
the plan. Benefits are based upon the participant's length of service and annual
earnings with vesting of benefits after five years of service. Plan assets
consist primarily of investments in stocks and bonds. The following table
provides a reconciliation of the changes in the benefit obligations and fair
value of plan assets for 2004, 2003 and 2002:

 Discount rate 6.50 7.00 7.00 
 Expected return on plan assets 8.50 8.50 9.00 
 Rate of compensation increase 5.00 5.00 5.00 

The plan sponsor selects the expected long-term rate of return on assets
assumption in consultation with their advisors and the plan actuary. This rate
is intended to reflect the average rate of earnings expected to be earned on the
funds invested or to be invested to provide plan benefits. Historical
performance is reviewed, especially with respect to real rates of return (net of
inflation) for the major asset classes held or anticipated to be held by the
trust. Undue weight is not given to recent experience, which may not continue
over the measurement period, with higher significance placed on current
forecasts of future long-term economic conditions.

The following table provides the pension plan's asset allocation as of December
31:

 2004 2003

 Mutual funds - equity 65 60 
 Mutual funds -fixed income 35 40 

The trust fund is sufficiently diversified to maintain a reasonable level of
risk without imprudently sacrificing return, with a targeted asset allocation of
40 fixed income and 60 equity. The Investment Manager selects investment fund
managers with demonstrated experience and expertise, and funds with demonstrated
historical performance, for the implementation of the Plan's investment
strategy. The Investment Manager will consider both actively and passively
managed investment strategies and will allocate funds across the asset classes
to develop an efficient investment structure.

The Company sponsors an employee stock ownership plan which provides stock
ownership to substantially all employees of the Bank. The Plan provides total
vesting upon the attainment of five years of service. Contributions to the plan
are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and are allocated based on
the compensation of each employee relative to total compensation paid by the
Bank. All shares issued and held by the Plan are considered outstanding in the
computation of earnings per share. Dividends on Company stock are allocated and
paid to participants at least annually. Shares of Company stock, when
distributed, have restrictions on transferability. The Company contributed
 220,875 in 2004, 208,000 in 2003, and 190,000 in 2002 to the Plan and charged
this expense to operations.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 12 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED):

The Company sponsors a 401(k) savings plan under which eligible employees may
choose to save up to 20 percent of their salary on a pretax basis, subject to
certain IRS limits. The Company matches fifty percent (up to six percent of the
employee's salary) of employee contributions. Vesting in the contributions made
by the bank is 20 after two years of service and increases by 20 for each of
the next four years of service. Contributions under the plan amounted to
 70,417, 66,957 and 59,162 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for several of its key
employee's and directors. The Company may make annual contributions to the plan,
and the employee or director has the option to defer a portion of their salary
or bonus based on qualifying annual elections. Company contributions to the plan
totaled 57,000, 60,104 and 54,962 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

NOTE 13 CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT:

The Company had cash deposits in other commercial banks totaling 8,895,490 and
 11,758,833 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company grants commercial, residential real estate and consumer loans to
customers located primarily in the northwestern portion of the State of
Virginia. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial
portion of its debtors' ability to honor their contracts is dependent upon the
agribusiness economic sector, specifically the poultry industry for which loans
outstanding total 15,110,000. Collateral required by the Company is determined
on an individual basis depending on the purpose of the loan and the financial
condition of the borrower. Approximately 80 of the loan portfolio is secured by
real estate.

NOTE 14 COMMITMENTS:

The Company makes commitments to extend credit in the normal course of business
and issues standby letters of credit to meet the financing needs of its
customers. The amount of the commitments represents the Company's exposure to
credit loss that is not included in the balance sheet. As of the balance sheet
dates, the Company had the following commitments outstanding:

 2004 2003
 ------------ --------

 Commitments to loan money 63,083,664 41,616,194
 Standby letters of credit 1,654,807 1,901,520

The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments to lend money
and issue standby letters of credit as it does for the loans reflected in the
balance sheet.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may
require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire
without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's
creditworthiness on a case by case basis. Collateral required, if any, upon
extension of credit is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower's
ability to pay. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable,
inventory, property, plant and equipment.

NOTE 15 TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES:

During the year, officers and directors (and companies controlled by them) were
customers of and had transactions with the Company in the normal course of
business. These transactions were made on substantially the same terms as those
prevailing for other customers and did not involve any abnormal risk.

Loan transactions with related parties are shown in the following schedule:

NOTE 16 DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS ON SUBSIDIARY BANK:

The principal source of funds of F & M Bank Corp. is dividends paid by the
Farmers and Merchants Bank. The Federal Reserve Act restricts the amount of
dividends the Bank may pay. Approval by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System is required if the dividends declared by a state member bank, in
any year, exceed the sum of (1) net income of the current year and (2) income
net of dividends for the preceding two years. As of January 1, 2005,
approximately 1,789,000 was available for dividend distribution without
permission of the Board of Governors. Dividends paid by the Bank to the Company
totaled 2,352,000 in 2004, 2,930,000 in 2003 and 1,760,000 in 2002.

NOTE 17 LITIGATION

In the normal course of business, the Company may become involved in litigation
arising from banking, financial, or other activities of the Company. Management
after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that the ultimate
liability, if any, arising out of these matters will have a material effect on
the Company's financial condition, operating results or liquidity.

NOTE 18 DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 (SFAS 107) "Disclosures
about the Fair Value of Financial Statements" defines the fair value of a
financial instrument as the amount at which a financial instrument could be
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a
forced liquidation or sale. As the majority of the Bank's financial instruments
lack an available trading market, significant estimates, assumptions and present
value calculations are required to determine estimated fair value.Estimated fair
value and the carrying value of financial instruments at December 31, 2004 and
2003 are as follows (in thousands):

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, other investments, deposits
with no stated maturities, short-term borrowings, and accrued interest
approximate fair value. The fair value of securities was calculated using the
most recent transaction price or a pricing model, which takes into consideration
maturity, yields and quality. The remaining financial instruments were valued
based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at various
rates in effect for similar instruments entered into during the month of
December of each year.

NOTE 19 REGULATORY MATTERS:

The Company and its subsidiary bank are subject to various regulatory capital
requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet
minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly
additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a
direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. Under capital
adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action,
the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative
measures of the Company's assets, liabilities, and certain off balance-sheet
items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's capital
amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the
regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulation, to ensure capital adequacy,
require the Company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios. These ratios are
defined in the regulations and the amounts are set forth in the table below.
Management believes, as of December 31, 2004, that the Company and its
subsidiary bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are
subject.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 19 REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED):

As of the most recent notification from the Bureau of Financial Institutions
(which was April 3, 2003), the subsidiary bank was categorized as well
capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be
categorized as well capitalized, the Company must maintain minimum total risk
based, Tier I risk-based, and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table.
There are no conditions or events since that notification that management
believes have changed the institution's category.

The Company's actual capital ratios are presented in the following table:

NOTE 20 INTANGIBLES:

Core deposit intangible costs recognized from the acquisition of the Woodstock
and Edinburg branches are being amortized using the straight-line method over a
ten-year period. The core deposit intangibles and goodwill totaled 5,472,153 at
the acquisition date. Amortization expense for the years ending December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002 was 276,000 in each year.

NOTE 21 INVESTMENT IN LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS

The Bank currently offers a variety of benefit plans to all full time employees.
While the costs of these plans are generally tax deductible to the Bank, the
cost has been escalating greatly in recent years. To help offset escalating
benefit costs and to attract and retain qualified employees, the Bank purchased
Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) contracts that will provide benefits to
employees during their lifetime. Dividends received on these policies are
tax-deferred and the death benefits under the policies are tax exempt. Rates of
return on a tax-equivalent basis are very favorable when compared to other
long-term investments which the Bank might make.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
 PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Stockholders and Board of Directors
F & M Bank Corp.
Timberville, Virginia

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of F & M Bank Corp.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the
three years ended December 31, 2004. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the Standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of F & M Bank Corp. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2004, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

BUSINESS

General

 F & M Bank Corp., incorporated in Virginia in 1983, is a one-bank holding
company pursuant to section 3(a)(1) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, and
owns 100 of the outstanding stock of its two affiliates, Farmers & Merchants
Bank (Bank) and TEB Life Insurance Company (TEB). Farmers & Merchants Financial
Services, Inc. (FMFS) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Farmers & Merchants Bank.

 Farmers & Merchants Bank was chartered on April 15, 1908, as a state
chartered bank under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. TEB was
incorporated on January 27, 1988, as a captive life insurance company under the
laws of the State of Arizona. FMFS is a Virginia chartered corporation and was
incorporated on February 25, 1993.

 The Bank offers all services normally offered by a full-service commercial
bank, including commercial and individual demand and time deposit accounts,
repurchase agreements for commercial customers, commercial and individual loans,
and drive-in banking services. TEB was organized to re-insure credit life and
accident and health insurance currently being sold by the Bank in connection
with its lending activities. FMFS was organized to write title insurance but now
provides brokerage other financial services to customers of Farmers & Merchants
Bank.

 The Bank makes various types of commercial and consumer loans and has a
heavy concentration of residential and agricultural real estate loans. The local
economy is relatively diverse with strong employment in the agricultural,
manufacturing, service and governmental sectors.

On December 31, 2004, F & M Bank Corp., the Bank, TEB and FMFS had 104 full-time
and part-time employees. No one employee devotes full-time services to F&M Bank
Corp.

The Company's and the Bank's principal executive office is at 205 South Main
Street, Timberville, VA 22853, and its phone number is (540) 896-8941.

Competition

The Bank's offices compete with approximately sixteen financial institutions.
These other institutions include state and nationally chartered banks,
nationally chartered savings banks and several credit unions. The main office
and the Broadway branch serve the northern portion of Rockingham County,
Virginia and the southwestern portion of Shenandoah County. The Elkton branches
serve the town of Elkton, the eastern portion of Rockingham County, and the
southern portion of Page County. The Bridgewater office serves the town of
Bridgewater, the southern portion of Rockingham County and the northwestern
portion of Augusta County. The offices in Shenandoah County serve the towns of
Edinburg and Woodstock and the surrounding areas. Bank competition in the area
of all offices is very strong.

Other Material Required by Form 10-K

Regulation and Supervision

The operations of F & M Bank Corp. and the Bank are subject to federal and state
statutes, which apply to state member banks of the Federal Reserve System.

The stock of F & M Bank Corp. is subject to the registration requirements of the
Securities Act of 1934. F & M Bank Corp. is subject to the periodic reporting
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These include, but are not
limited to, the filing of annual, quarterly and other current reports with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. As an Exchange Act reporting company, the
Corporation is directly affected by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which is
aimed at improving corporate governance and reporting procedures. The
Corporation is complying with new SEC and other rules and regulations
implemented pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley and intends to comply with any applicable
rules and regulations implemented in the future.

F & M Bank Corp., as a bank holding company, is subject to the provisions of the
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "Act"). It is registered as
such and is supervised by the Federal Reserve Board. The Act requires F & M Bank
Corp. to secure the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before F & M
Bank Corp. acquires ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or
substantially all of the assets of any institution, including another bank.

As a bank holding company, F & M Bank Corp. is required to file with the Federal
Reserve Board an annual report and such additional information as it may require
pursuant to the Act. The Federal Reserve Board may also conduct examinations of
F & M Bank Corp. and any or all of its subsidiaries. Under Section 106 of the
1970 Amendments to the Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, a
bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in
certain tie-in arrangements in connection with an extension of credit, provision
of credit, sale or lease of property or furnishing of services.

Federal Reserve Board regulations permit bank holding companies to engage in
non-banking activities closely related to banking or to managing or controlling
banks. These activities include the making or servicing of loans, performing
certain data processing services, and certain leasing and insurance agency
activities. TEB Life acts as the primary re-insurer for credit life insurance
sold through the Bank. Since 1994, the Company has entered into agreements with
the Virginia Community Development Corporation to purchase equity positions in
the Housing Equity Fund of Virginia II, III, IV, V, VII, VIII, IX and Historic
Equity Fund I. These funds provide housing for low-income individuals throughout
Virginia. Approval of the Federal Reserve Board is necessary to engage in any of
the activities described above or to acquire interests engaging in these
activities.

The Bank as a state member bank is supervised and regularly examined by the
Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve Board. Such
supervision and examination by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions and
the Federal Reserve Board is intended primarily for the protection of depositors
and not for the stockholders of F & M Bank Corp.

The information required by Guide 3 has been included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
