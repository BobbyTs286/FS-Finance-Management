COMPANY OVERVIEW 

We are a power generation company engaged, through our
subsidiaries, in the construction, ownership and operation of
electric power generation facilities and the sale of energy,
capacity and related products in the United States of America.
We are an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Calpine
Corporation Calpine or the Parent ). We
indirectly own 14 power generation facilities (the
 projects or facilities that are
expected to have an aggregate combined estimated peak capacity
of 9,834 MW (nominal 8,425 MW without peaking
capacity), including our Pastoria facility which is currently
under construction. Our combined peak capacity represents
approximately 30.6 of Calpine s 32,149 MW of
aggregate estimated peak capacity in operation and under
construction. Thirteen of our facilities are natural gas-fired
combined cycle facilities and

Thirteen of our facilities are currently operating and have an
aggregate estimated peak capacity of 9,065 MW.

CalGen Finance Corp. CalGen Finance is our
wholly-owned subsidiary and was formed solely for the purpose of
facilitating the offering of our debt securities by acting as a
co-issuer of those securities. CalGen Finance is nominally
capitalized and does not have any operations or revenues.

Calpine Energy Services, L.P. CES is an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Calpine and is primarily engaged in
managing the value of Calpine s electrical generation and
gas production assets. It provides trading and risk management
services to Calpine and its affiliates in connection with the
scheduling of electrical energy and capacity sales and fuel
deliveries to meet delivery requirements and the optimization of
the value of Calpine s electrical generation and gas
assets. CES supplies gas to and purchases power from our
facilities pursuant to the WECC Fixed Price Gas Sale and Power
Purchase Agreement and the Index Based Gas Sale and Power
Purchase Agreement, described in more detail below under
 Principal Agreements. 

Calpine Operating Services Company, Inc. COSCI was
formed in 2002 to consolidate the operational functions of
Calpine and certain of Calpine s affiliates. Each of our
facilities is operated and maintained under a Master Operation
and Maintenance Agreement with COSCI, which has an initial term
of 10 years beginning March 23, 2004. Under the Master
Operation and Maintenance Agreement, COSCI provides all services
necessary to operate and maintain all facilities, including
developing operating plans for each facility. Major maintenance,
which is currently provided pursuant to agreements with Siemens
Westinghouse Power Corporation or General Electric Company, is
expected to be provided by COSCI when those agreements are
terminated. See Principal Agreements. 

Calpine Construction Management Company, Inc. CCMCI ), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Calpine, is managing the construction of the Pastoria facility
under a Master Construction Management Agreement. Under this
agreement, CCMCI is responsible for managing all of the
construction and supply contracts related to the Pastoria
facility and supervising and coordinating all construction
activities. CCMCI is also responsible for the acceptance and
commissioning of this facility, and for running all performance
and acceptance tests. See Principal Agreements. 

PRINCIPAL AGREEMENTS 

On March 23, 2004, we completed an offering of
 2.4 billion in secured term loans and secured notes.
Concurrent with the closing of this offering, we entered into a
series of agreements with certain of our affiliates.

Purchase of Gas and Sale of Power 

Each of our facilities entered into the Index Based Gas Sale and
Power Purchase Agreement (the Index Based Agreement with CES. In addition, the Delta and Los Medanos facilities
entered into the WECC Fixed Price Gas Sale and Power Purchase
Agreement (the Fixed Price Agreement with CES.
Under these agreements, CES purchases substantially all of the
output from each facility (subject to certain exceptions for
direct sales to third parties), and sells or delivers to each
facility substantially all of the gas required for its
operations (subject to certain exceptions for gas purchases from
third parties).

Fixed Price Agreement. Under the Fixed Price Agreement,
CES purchases a total of 500 MW of capacity and associated
energy from the Delta and Los Medanos facilities for a fixed
price. In addition, CES will provide substantially all of the
gas required to generate the energy scheduled pursuant to this
agreement. The agreement is written such that CES makes a net
payment of 3,615,346 (equivalent to 7.231/kW-month) each month
for power purchased and gas sold under this agreement. In
addition, CES makes variable operation and maintenance payments,
which are dependent on the amount of energy delivered and the
amount of operating time during on-peak hours. CES has the right
in its sole discretion to schedule deliveries of energy from
each facility up to its respective contracted capacity. However,
the fixed payment shall be payable in full whether or not
electricity deliveries have been scheduled, except for a
facility s failure to deliver. Calpine

Table of Contents 

guarantees CES s performance under this agreement. The
Fixed Price Agreement is in effect through December 31,
2009, unless terminated earlier as permitted. Upon expiration or
termination of the agreement, all capacity and associated energy
would automatically be subject to the Index Based Agreement.

Index Based Agreement. Under the Index Based Agreement,
CES purchases the available electric output of each facility not
previously sold under another long-term agreement. In addition,
CES sells to each facility substantially all of the gas required
to operate. Calpine guarantees CES s performance under this
agreement, which is in effect through December 31, 2013,
unless terminated earlier as permitted.

Pursuant to the Index Based Agreement, our off-peak, peaking and
power augmentation products will be sold to CES at a fixed price
through December 31, 2013. In addition, all of our
remaining on-peak capacity will be sold to CES at a floating
spot price that reflects the positive (if any, but never
negative) difference between day-ahead power prices and
day-ahead gas prices using indices chosen to approximate the
actual power price that would be received and the actual gas
price that would be paid in the market relevant for each
facility. Each month, CES pays a net contract price for energy
purchased and gas sold under this agreement. The contract price
will equal the sum of:

(1) an aggregate net payment for products provided during
 on-peak periods calculated in accordance with the agreement, plus 

(2) an aggregate fixed monthly payment for all other
 products, including off-peak, peaking and power augmentation
 products, generated by each facility, which will equal
 13,677,843, plus 

(3) a total variable operation and maintenance payment for
 the facilities (which will depend on the actual time the
 facilities are operating and delivering energy subject to the
 Index Based Agreement), plus 

(4) the amount paid under the Amoco Contract with respect
 to the Morgan facility, plus 

(5) certain adjustments with respect to gas transportation
 and electric transmission charges, minimum generation
 requirements and certain power purchase arrangements, minus 

(6) the cost of gas supplied to support certain other power
 purchase agreements, and steam sale agreements (including, as
 applicable, power and/or steam sold to certain facilities 
 industrial hosts) 

The Index Based Agreement also provides for the issuance of
letters of credit under our revolving credit facility which
support certain gas supply agreements between CES, the projects
and third parties. The Index Based Agreement has been amended
since the closing of the offering of the original notes to
provide for the issuance of letters of credit under our
revolving credit facility to support certain gas supply
agreement between CES and third parties under certain
circumstances, to account for Solutia s rejection of
certain agreements with the Decatur facility, and to permit
 buy-sell arrangements under certain circumstances
that will enable us to buy gas directly and have it transported
by CES.

Operation of Facilities 

Master Operation and Maintenance Agreement. Under the
Master Operation and Maintenance Agreement (the O&M
Agreement ), COSCI provides all services necessary to
operate and maintain each facility (other than major
maintenance, which is not currently provided by COSCI under the

4

Table of Contents 

or services that would normally be charged by unrelated third
parties and shall in no event exceed the prices that COSCI
charges to unrelated third parties for such goods or services.
Calpine guarantees COSCI s performance under this agreement
The O&M Agreement has an initial term of 10 years
beginning March 23, 2004 and is automatically extended for
successive one-year periods thereafter until terminated by

Master Maintenance Services Agreement. At
December 31, 2004, major maintenance services were provided
for under agreements with Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation
or General Electric Company. Under the Master Maintenance
Services Agreement (the Maintenance Agreement ),
COSCI will provide major maintenance services when agreements
with third parties are terminated. Until the third-party
agreements are terminated, the Maintenance Agreement provides
that COSCI will act as the administrator of the third-party
maintenance agreements. Calpine guarantees COSCI s
performance under the Maintenance Agreement. In addition,
Calpine indemnifies the facilities for any costs or expenses
incurred in the termination of these third-party maintenance
agreements.

The Maintenance Agreement applies to major maintenance services,
such as turbine overhauls or other major maintenance events as
agreed upon by the parties, and is distinct from the O&M
Agreement (which provides routine operation and maintenance).
Under the Maintenance Agreement, COSCI provides periodic
inspection services relating to the combustion turbines for each
covered facility, including all labor, supervision and technical
assistance (including the services of an experienced maintenance
program engineer) necessary to provide these inspection
services. COSCI also provides new parts and repairs or replaces
old or worn out parts for the combustion turbines, and will
provide technical field assistance, project engineers and
support personnel related to the performance of its services
under this agreement. The services under this agreement are to
be consistent with the annual operating plan for each facility
developed pursuant to the O&M Agreement. The Maintenance
Agreement was executed on March 23, 2004 and has an initial
term of 10 years.

Project Construction 

Master Construction Management Agreement. Under the
Master Construction Management Agreement (the Construction
Agreement ), CCMCI manages the construction of the Pastoria
facility and the coordination of the various construction and
supply contracts. In addition, CCMCI is responsible for the

THE MARKET FOR ELECTRICITY 

The electric power industry represents one of the largest
industries in the United States and impacts nearly every aspect
of our economy, with an estimated end-user market of nearly
 268 billion of electricity sales in 2004 based on
information published by the Energy Information Administration
of the Department of Energy EIA ). Historically, the
power generation industry has been largely characterized by
electric utility monopolies producing electricity from old,
inefficient, polluting, high-cost generating facilities selling
to a

5

Table of Contents 

captive customer base. However, industry trends and regulatory
initiatives have transformed some markets into more competitive
grounds where load-serving entities and end-users may purchase
electricity from a variety of suppliers, including independent
power producers IPPs ), power marketers, regulated
public utilities and others. For the past decade, the power
industry has been deregulated at the wholesale level allowing
generators to sell directly to the load serving entities such as
public utilities, municipalities and electric cooperatives.
Although industry trends and regulatory initiatives aimed at
further deregulation have slowed, the power industry continues
to transform into a more competitive market.

The North American Electric Reliability Council NERC estimates that in the United States, peak
(summer) electric demand in 2004 totaled approximately
729,000 MW, while summer generating capacity in 2004
totaled approximately 872,000 MW, creating a peak summer
reserve margin of 143,000 MW, or 19.6 , which compares to
an estimated peak summer reserve margin of 144,000 MW, or
20.3 in 2003. Historically, utility reserve margins have been
targeted to be at least 15 above peak demand to provide for
load forecasting errors, scheduled and unscheduled plant outages
and local area grid protection. The United States market
consists of regional electric markets not all of which are
effectively interconnected, so reserve margins vary from region
to region.

Even though most new power plants are fueled by natural gas, the
majority of power generated in the U.S. is still produced
by coal and nuclear power plants. The EIA has estimated that
approximately 50 of the electricity generated in the
U.S. is fueled by coal, 20 by nuclear sources, 18 by
natural gas, 7 by hydro, and 5 from fuel oil and other
sources. As regulations continue to evolve, many of the current
coal plants will likely be faced with having to install a
significant amount of costly emission control devices. This
activity could cause some of the oldest and dirtiest coal plants
to be retired, thereby allowing a greater proportion of power to
be produced by cleaner natural gas-fired generation.

Due primarily to the completion of gas-fired combustion turbine
projects, we have seen power supplies increase and higher
reserve margins in the last several years accompanied by a
decrease in liquidity in the energy trading markets.

According to Edison Electric Institute EEI published data, the growth rate of overall consumption of
electricity in 2004 compared to 2003 was estimated to be 1.9 .
The estimated growth rates in our major markets were as follows:
South Central (primarily Texas) 3.9 , Pacific Southwest
(primarily California) 3.3 , and Southeast 2.5 . The growth rate
in supply has been diminishing with many developers canceling or
delaying completion of their projects as a result of current
market conditions. The supply and demand balance in the natural
gas industry continues to be strained with gas prices averaging
 6.13 per million British thermal unit Btu ( MMBtu in 2005 through February, compared to
averages of approximately 5.72 and 6.20 per MMBtu in the
same periods in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition,
capital market participants are slowly making progress in
restructuring their portfolios, thereby stabilizing financial
pressures on the industry. Overall, we expect the market to
continue these trends and work through the current oversupply of
power in several regions within the next few years. As the
supply-demand picture improves, we expect to see spark spreads
(the difference between the cost of fuel and electricity
revenues) improve and capital markets regain their interest in
helping to repower America with clean, highly efficient energy
technologies.

Regional Markets 

West. The West has historically been characterized by
tight supply/demand fundamentals. Some of the challenges include
a lengthy and difficult permitting process, stricter
environmental regulations and difficulties in gaining access to
water. In addition, it is difficult to find new power generating
sites, particularly in California, where most of our Western
facilities are located, given the cost of real estate and the
general public s not in our backyard mentality.
Furthermore, gas system bottlenecks and electric transmission
constraints in this region can limit the supply of fuel and
power to certain submarkets, which increases power prices and
volatility. The West s baseload demand is primarily met
with nuclear, coal, and hydro generation. However, gas-fired
power generation facilities generally set the market clearing
price in the West and CalGen s newer, more efficient
gas-fired facilities are able to compete favorably. In recent
years, a significant

6

Table of Contents 

portion of older and less efficient capacity has been displaced
and retired. Provided that this trend continues, we expect to
see improvements in the relative economics of our Western
facilities.

ERCOT. Located entirely within the State of Texas,
Electric Reliability Council of Texas ERCOT is
isolated from our other regions due to transmission constraints.
In recent years, ERCOT has experienced an increase in the
construction and development of new and efficient natural
gas-fired generation, which sets the market price for power
during almost all hours of the year. We primarily compete with
other combined cycle power generation facilities, combustion
turbine facilities, and older, less efficient oil and gas steam
turbine facilities. An estimated 2,500 MW of older oil and
gas power generation has been retired in recent years. A
continuation of this trend would improve spark spreads and
increase the operating hours of our facilities. According to
NERC, electricity consumption in ERCOT grew by over
5.0 per year during the mid to late 1990 s and by
approximately 3.9 in 2004. We believe that spark spreads could
increase to the extent demand continues to grow. Higher demand
could also increase our run hours.

Southeast. The Southeast can be characterized as having a
high level of baseload coal and nuclear generation. As a result,
natural gas-fired generation does not set the market price for
power as often as it does in the West and ERCOT. Additionally,
increased construction and development of new gas-fired
generation has created an oversupply in the region. However,
strong energy growth in comparison with other regions could ease
the overbuild situation in the next three to five years.

Other. We also have facilities located in Oklahoma and
Illinois. These regions have a significant proportion of
coal-fired power generation and are currently characterized by
low marginal costs relative to natural gas-fired capacity. Coal
commodity prices currently drive regional generation economics,
setting the market price for power for most of the year.
Emissions regulations could have a significant impact on the
coal plants causing retirements or retrofits that could increase
the market price. Approximately 30.0 of our capacity in these
markets is committed for delivery under long-term contracts.

DESCRIPTION OF POWER GENERATION FACILITIES 

We own 14 power generation facilities that are expected to have
an aggregate combined estimated peak capacity of 9,834 MW
(nominal 8,425 MW without peaking capacity), upon
completion of the Pastoria Energy Center which is currently
under construction. Our portfolio of power generation assets
experienced a weighted average combined cycle heat rate of
7,110 btu/kwh in 2004. Substantially all of our power
generation facilities are located on sites which we own or lease
on a long-term basis. See Item 2. Properties. 

Thirteen of our facilities are natural gas-fired combined cycle
facilities while Zion Energy Center is a natural gas-fired
simple cycle facility. The three principal components of a
combined cycle facility are the combustion turbine, the heat
recovery steam generator HRSG and the steam
turbine. In a combined cycle facility, inlet air is introduced
into the combustion turbines before being compressed by the
turbine-driven compressor. Fuel and compressed air then mix and
burn in the turbine combustion system, creating a high-pressure
hot gas, which is expanded through a four-stage power turbine.
The combustion turbine drives the turbine s compressor
section and the electric generator. Heat from the combustion
turbine exhaust is directed to the HRSG to convert water into
steam to generate additional electric energy, thereby increasing
the thermal cycle efficiency. The steam turbine uses the steam
from the HRSG to create mechanical energy that is converted into
electrical energy by a generator. For emissions control, each
combustion turbine s exhaust passes through a catalyst bed
for control and reduction of nitrogen oxides. A selective
catalytic reduction system, including ammonia injection, is used
for nitrogen oxide control. Some of the facilities also provide
an oxidation catalyst for control of carbon monoxide emissions.
A simple cycle facility has the same gas turbine components as a
combined cycle facility, but it does not have a steam generator
or steam turbine and the accompanying water treatment facilities
to support that equipment.

extended. Either party may terminate the lease if the other
party materially defaults on its obligations under the lease or,
Eastman may terminate the lease if certain cross defaults occur
with respect to certain other agreements between Eastman and the
facility. If the facility materially breaches certain of its
lease obligations or cross defaults, Eastman may, at its option,
step-in and operate the facility. This step-in right is not
subject to third-party security interests, including the
interests securing the notes. In the event we decide to dispose
of all or any part of our interest in the facility, Eastman must
first be offered such interest.

CES supplies the facility with natural gas, which is transported
across intrastate pipeline systems owned and operated by South
Carolina Pipeline Corporation and Southern Natural Gas Company,
under both firm and interruptible transportation agreements.

The facility interconnects with the South Carolina Electric and
Gas Co. power transmission system and sells the power it
generates to CES.

Decatur Facility. The Decatur facility is a nominal
793 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle generating
facility, with an estimated peak capacity of 852 MW.
Phase I of the facility, consisting of two combustion
turbines with HRSGs and a steam turbine generator, commenced
commercial operation in June 2002. Phase II of the
facility, consisting of one combustion turbine and an HRSG,
commenced commercial operation in June 2003.

The facility sells the power it generates to CES and to the
Tennessee Valley Authority TVA ). The facility had
an arrangement to sell certain of the power it generated to
Solutia, which filed for protection from creditors pursuant to
Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in December 2003. As a
result, Solutia rejected certain of our contracts as executory
contracts.

The facility is currently a QF. However, Solutia, Inc. Solutia ), the Decatur facility s steam host,
is subject to a bankruptcy proceeding and recently rejected its
steam sales agreement with the Decatur facility.

Table of Contents 

As a result, the facility does not satisfy the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission s FERC operating and
efficiency standards for QFs. The Decatur facility received a
waiver of these operating and efficiency standards for calendar
year 2004 and 2005. Solutia also rejected a facility lease
addendum, which had allowed the Decatur facility to supply power
to Solutia. CES has agreed to purchase the facility s
capacity pursuant to the Index Based Agreement. The Decatur
facility has the right to file for EWG status, which would
maintain Decatur s exemption from Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, as amended PUHCA if it fails
to maintain its QF status for example if it cannot
replace its steam host and is unable to obtain further waivers
from FERC. In addition, if Decatur fails to maintain its QF
status, it would need to apply for and be granted market-based
rate authority from FERC to sell power at wholesale under the
Index Based Agreement.

The facility is located on a 20-acre site near Decatur, Alabama,
which we lease from Solutia. The initial term of the lease
expires in 2024, however, we have the right to extend the lease
for up to three consecutive 15-year terms. Either party may
terminate the lease if the other party materially defaults on
its obligations under the lease, and Solutia may terminate the
lease if certain cross defaults occur with respect to certain
other agreements between Solutia and the facility.

CES supplies the facility with natural gas, which is transported
by means of the intrastate pipeline owned and operated by
Enbridge Pipelines (Bamagas Intrastate) LLC Enbridge ), which interconnects with three
interstate pipelines. Enbridge provides firm transportation
rights to the facility.

Morgan Facility. The Morgan facility is a nominal
722 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle generating
facility, with an estimated peak capacity of 852 MW.
Phase I of the facility, consisting of one combustion
turbine generator and one HRSG, commenced commercial operation
in January 2004. Phase II of the facility, consisting of
two combustion turbine generators, two HRSGs and a steam turbine
generator, commenced commercial operation in June 2003. The
facility did not meet FERC s efficiency requirements for
QFs in the first period (April 2003 to April 2004). FERC granted
a 12-month waiver on April 16, 2004 for the first period.
Morgan has met the requirements to be a QF for the second
period, calendar year 2004, however.

The facility is located on a 17-acre site near Decatur, Alabama,
which we lease from BP Amoco Chemical Company BP
Amoco ). The initial term of the lease expires in 2033;
however, we have the right to extend the lease for an additional
term of up to 35 years.

CES supplies the facility with natural gas, which is delivered
to the facility from the Tennessee Gas and Texas Eastern
Transmission interstate pipelines by means of a lateral pipeline
owned and operated by Enbridge.

The facility interconnects with TVA s power transmission
system and sells the power it generates to CES, BP Amoco and TVA.

Other (Oneta and Zion) 

We own 1,507 MW of estimated peak capacity (nominal
994 MW without peaking capacity) in our other regions,
Oklahoma and Illinois. Of this total, 513 MW of peak
capacity is in operation in Illinois and 994 MW (nominal
994 MW without peaking capacity) is in operation in
Oklahoma.

Oneta Facility. The Oneta facility is a nominal
994 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle generating
facility, with an estimated peak capacity of 994 MW.
Phase I of the facility, consisting of two combustion
turbines, each with its own HRSG, and one steam turbine,
commenced commercial operation in July 2002. Phase II of
the facility, consisting of two more combustion turbines with
HRSGs and another steam turbine, commenced commercial operation
in June 2003. The facility is an EWG and is located on a 58-acre
site that the facility owns near Coweta, Oklahoma.

CES supplies the facility with natural gas, which is delivered
to the facility through pipelines owned by Enogex, Inc. under
agreements between CES and a subsidiary of Enogex. Natural gas
is also delivered to the facility through pipelines owned by
Oneok Gas Transportation, LLC. CES has certain arrangements with
third parties related to the facility s gas interconnection
and transportation. As security for its performance under the
Index Based Agreement, CES has granted the facility a security
interest in these arrangements.

Table of Contents 

The facility is interconnected to Public Service Company of
Oklahoma s power transmission system and sells the power it
generates to CES. The facility has not obtained long-term firm
electric transmission service; therefore all transmission
service is currently short-term, on an hourly or daily basis.

Zion Facility. The Zion facility is a 513 MW
simple-cycle peaking generating facility. Phase I of the
facility, consisting of two combustion turbines, commenced
commercial operation in June 2002. Phase II of the
facility, consisting of a third combustion turbine, commenced
commercial operation in June 2003. The facility is an EWG and is
located on a 114-acre site owned by the facility in Zion,
Illinois.

The facility purchased certain of its equipment from our
wholly-owned subsidiary, CalGen Equipment Finance. CalGen
Equipment Finance s interest in this installment sale
contract was pledged as part of the offering of the original
notes. The facility is designed to permit the installation of
additional generating units.

The facility obtains natural gas and oil from and exclusively
sells power, on demand, to the Wisconsin Electric Power Company WEPCo. ). Natural gas is transported across Natural
Gas Pipeline Company of America s pipeline system. When
needed, oil is transported by tanker truck. The facility is
interconnected to Commonwealth Edison Company s power
transmission system. The electrical and gas interconnection
facilities were designed to support expansion of the facility to
a nominal capacity of 825 MW.

STRATEGY 

As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Calpine, our strategy is closely
linked to Calpine s overall strategy, which includes an
objective to become North America s most efficient, cost
competitive and environmentally friendly power company. Our
natural gas-fired facilities, which have been built from 1999 to
the present, use modern technology for competitive,
fuel-efficient operations to meet the most stringent
environmental and regulatory requirements.

We will continue to focus on maximizing the value of our power
generation facilities through the following actions:

Continuing to operate our facilities with a focus on reliability
 and low operating costs 

Continuing to achieve economic efficiencies by applying a
 system-approach to managing our facilities where possible 

Continuing to mitigate certain risks related to fuel
 procurement, operations and maintenance services, availability
 and commodity price volatility through our relationship with CES 

Pursuing opportunities to increase the percentage of our revenue
 from longer-term power contracts 

We believe that our regional strengths and overall size provides
greater dispatch flexibility and creates certain efficiencies
for procurement, operations and maintenance. In addition,
operating in different power markets limits our exposure to
regulatory, fuel procurement and spark spread risks specific to
certain markets. A substantial portion of our cash flow is based
on revenues generated under the Fixed Price and Index Based
Agreements which mitigates our exposure to natural gas and power
price fluctuations.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

We are subject to complex and stringent energy, environmental
and other governmental laws and regulations at the federal,
state and local levels in connection with the development,
ownership and operation of our energy generation facilities.
Federal laws and regulations govern transactions by electric and
gas utility companies, the types of fuel which may be utilized
by an electricity generating plant, the type of energy which may
be produced by such a plant, the ownership of a plant, and
access to and service on the transmission grid. In most
instances, public utilities that serve retail customers are
subject to rate regulation by the state s related utility
regulatory commission. A state utility regulatory commission is
often primarily responsible for determining whether a public
utility may recover the costs of wholesale electricity purchases
or other supply procurement-related activities through the
retail rates the utility charges its customers. The state utility

16

Table of Contents 

regulatory commission may, from time to time, impose
restrictions or limitations on the manner in which a public
utility may transact with wholesale power sellers, such as
independent power producers. Under certain circumstances where
specific exemptions are otherwise unavailable, state utility
regulatory commissions may have broad jurisdiction over
non-utility electric power plants. Energy producing facilities
also are subject to federal, state and local laws and
administrative regulations which govern the emissions and other
substances produced, discharged or disposed of by a plant and
the geographical location, zoning, land use and operation of a
plant. Applicable federal environmental laws typically have both
state and local enforcement and implementation provisions. These
environmental laws and regulations generally require that a wide
variety of permits and other approvals be obtained before the
commencement of construction or operation of an energy producing
facility and that the facility then operate in compliance with
such permits and approvals.

In light of the circumstances in California, the Pacific Gas and
Electric Company PG bankruptcy and the Enron
Corp. Enron bankruptcy, among other events in
recent years, there are a number of federal legislative and
regulatory initiatives that could result in changes in how the
energy markets are regulated. We do not know whether these
legislative and regulatory initiatives will be adopted or, if
adopted, what form they may take. We cannot provide assurance
that any legislation or regulation ultimately adopted would not
adversely affect our existing projects.

Federal Energy Regulation 

Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act 

PURPA and the regulations adopted thereunder by FERC provide
certain incentives for cogeneration facilities and small power
production facilities, which satisfy FERC s criteria for
qualifying facility QF status. First, FERC s
implementing regulations exempt most QFs from the PUHCA, many
provisions of the Federal Power Act FPA ), and state
laws concerning rate, financial, and organizational regulation.
These exemptions are important to us and our competitors.
Second, FERC s regulations require that electric utilities
purchase electricity generated by QFs at a price based on the
purchasing utility s avoided cost, and that the utility
sell back-up power to the QF on a non-discriminatory basis.
FERC s regulations define avoided costs as the
incremental costs to an electric utility of electric energy or
capacity, or both, which, but for the purchase from QFs, such
utility would generate itself or purchase from another source.

To be a QF, a cogeneration facility must produce electricity and
useful thermal energy for an industrial or commercial process or
heating or cooling applications in certain proportions to the
facility s total energy output, and must meet certain
efficiency standards. No more than 50 of the equity of a QF can
be owned by one or more electric utilities or their affiliates.

We believe that each of our facilities which operates as a QF
meets or will meet the requirements for QF status. Certain
factors necessary to maintain QF status are, however, subject to
the risk of events outside our control. For example, our Decatur
facility has temporarily been rendered incapable of meeting such
requirements due to the loss of their thermal energy customer
and we have obtained limited waivers (for up to two years) of
the applicable QF requirements from FERC. We cannot provide
assurance that such waivers will in every case be granted.
During any such waiver period, we would seek to replace the
thermal energy customer or find another use for the thermal
energy which meets PURPA s requirements, but no assurance
can be given that these remedial actions would be available.

As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Calpine, we are subject to
certain risks of losing our QF status. For example, if one of
Calpine s facilities (including a CalGen facility) should
lose its QF status, the facility would no longer be entitled to
the exemptions from PUHCA and the FPA. Loss of QF status could
also trigger certain rights of termination under the
facility s power sales agreement, could subject the
facility to rate regulation as a public utility under the FPA
and state law, and could result in Calpine inadvertently
becoming an electric utility holding company by owning more than
10 of the voting securities of, or controlling, a public
utility company that would no longer be exempt from PUHCA. If
Calpine loses the PUHCA exemption, it could cause all of
Calpine s remaining QFs to lose their respective QF status,
because no more than 50 of a QF s equity may be owned by
such electric utility holding companies. Loss of QF status may
also trigger defaults under covenants to maintain QF status in
the projects power sales agreements, steam

17

Table of Contents 

sales agreements and financing agreements and may result in
termination, penalties or acceleration of indebtedness under
such agreements.

Under Section 32 of PUHCA, the owner of a facility can
become an Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG if the
owner is engaged directly, or indirectly through one or more
affiliates, and exclusively in the business of owning and/or
operating an eligible electric generating facility and all of
the facility s output is sold at wholesale for resale
rather than directly to end users. As an EWG, the owner of the
eligible generating facility is exempt from PUHCA even if the
generating facility does not qualify as a QF. Therefore, another
possible response to the loss or potential loss of QF status
would be to apply to have the facility s owner qualify as
an EWG. However, assuming this changed status would be
permissible under the terms of the applicable power sales
agreement, rate approval from FERC would be required. In
addition, the facility would be required to cease selling
electricity to any retail electric customers (such as the
thermal energy customer) to retain its EWG status.

Public Utility Holding Company Regulation 

Under PUHCA, any corporation, partnership or other defined
entity which owns or controls 10 or more of the outstanding
voting securities of a public utility company, or a company
which is a holding company for a public utility company, is
subject to registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC and regulation under PUHCA, unless
eligible for an exemption or unless an appropriate application
is filed with, and an order is granted by, the SEC declaring the
applicant not to be a holding company. A holding company of a
public utility company that is subject to registration is
required by PUHCA to limit its utility operations to a single
integrated utility system and to divest any other operations not
functionally related to the operation of that utility system.
Approval by the SEC is required for nearly all important
financial and business transactions to be conducted by a
registered holding company. Under PURPA, most QFs are exempt
from regulation under PUHCA.

The Energy Policy Act of 1992, among other things, amends PUHCA
to allow EWGs, under certain circumstances, to own and operate
non-QF electric generating facilities without subjecting those
producers to registration or regulation under PUHCA. The effect
of such amendments has been to enhance the development of
non-QFs which do not have to meet the fuel, production and
ownership requirements of PURPA. We believe that these
amendments benefit us by expanding our ability to own and
operate facilities that do not qualify for QF status. However,
the creation of an EWG class of generators has also resulted in
increased competition by allowing utilities and their affiliates
to develop such facilities which are not subject to the
constraints of PUHCA.

Federal Natural Gas Transportation Regulation 

We have an ownership interest in 13 gas-fired power plants in
operation and one gas-fired power plant under construction. The
cost of natural gas is ordinarily the largest expense of a
gas-fired project and is critical to the project s
economics. The risks associated with using natural gas can
include the need to arrange gathering, processing, extraction,
blending, and storage, as well as transportation of the gas from
great distances; the possibility of interruption of the gas
supply or transportation (depending on the quality of the gas
reserves purchased or dedicated to the project, the financial
and operating strength of the gas supplier, whether firm or
non-firm transportation is purchased and the operations of the
gas pipeline); and obligations to take a minimum quantity of gas
and pay for it (i.e., take-and-pay obligations).

Pursuant to the Natural Gas Act, FERC has jurisdiction over the
transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate
commerce. With respect to most transactions that do not involve
the construction of pipeline facilities, regulatory
authorization can be obtained on a self-implementing basis.
However, interstate pipeline rates and terms and conditions for
such services are subject to continuing FERC oversight.

Federal Power Act Regulation 

Under the Federal Power Act FPA ), FERC is
authorized to regulate the transmission of electric energy and
the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.
Unless otherwise exempt, any

18

Table of Contents 

person that owns or operates facilities used for such purposes
is a public utility subject to FERC jurisdiction. FERC
regulation under the FPA includes approval of the disposition of
FERC-jurisdictional utility property, authorization of the
issuance of securities by public utilities, regulation of the
rates, terms and conditions for the transmission or sale of
electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce, the
regulation of interlocking directorates, and the imposition of a
uniform system of accounts and reporting requirements for public
utilities.

FERC regulations implementing PURPA provide that a QF is exempt
from regulation under the foregoing provisions of the FPA. An
EWG is not exempt from the FPA and therefore an EWG that makes
sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce is
subject to FERC regulation as a public utility. However, many of
the regulations which customarily apply to traditional public
utilities have been waived or relaxed for EWGs and other
non-traditional public utilities that can demonstrate that they
cannot exercise market power. Upon making the necessary showing,
EWGs meeting FERC s requirements are granted authorization
to charge market-based rates, blanket authority to issue
securities, and waivers of certain FERC requirements pertaining
to accounts, reports and interlocking directorates. The granting
of such authorities and waivers is intended to implement
FERC s policy to foster a more competitive wholesale power
market.

Many of our generating projects are or will be operated as QFs
and therefore are or will be exempt from FERC regulation under
the FPA. However, our Decatur facility will be an EWG, which is
or will be subject to FERC jurisdiction under the FPA. Several
of our facilities have been granted certain waivers of FERC
regulations available to non-traditional public utilities;
however, we cannot assure that such authorities or waivers will
not be revoked for these affiliates or will be granted in the
future to other affiliates.

Federal Open Access Electric Transmission
 Regulation 

In 1996, FERC issued Order Nos. 888 and 889, introducing
competitive reforms and increasing access to the electric power
grid. Order No. 888 required the functional
unbundling of transmission and generation assets by the
transmission-owning utilities subject to its jurisdiction. Under
Order No. 888, the jurisdictional transmission-owning
utilities, and many non-jurisdictional transmission owners
(through reciprocity requirements), were required to adopt
FERC s pro forma open access transmission tariff
establishing terms of non-discriminatory transmission service.
Order No. 889 required transmission-owning utilities to
provide the public with an electronic system for buying and
selling transmission capacity in transactions with the utilities
and abide by specific standards of conduct when using their
transmission systems to make wholesale sales of power. In
addition, these orders established the operational requirements
of Independent System Operators ISO ), which are
entities that have been given authority to operate the
transmission assets of certain jurisdictional and
non-jurisdictional utilities in a particular region. The
interpretation and application of the requirements of Order Nos.
888 and 889 continues to be refined through subsequent FERC
proceedings. These orders have been subject to review, and those
parts of the orders that have been the subject of judicial
appeals have been affirmed, in large part, by the courts.

In addition to its Open Access efforts under Order Nos. 888 and
889, our business can be affected by a variety of other FERC
policies and proposals, including Order No. 2000, issued in
December 1999, which was designed to encourage the voluntary
formation of Regional Transmission Organizations; a proposed
 Standard Market Design, issued in July 2002 under
which the allocation of transmission capacity, the dispatch of
generation in light of transmission constraints, the
coordination of transmission upgrades and allocation of
associated costs, and other issues would be addressed through a
set of standard rules; and Order No. 2003, issued in July
2003, which established uniform procedures for generator
interconnection to the transmission grid. All of these policies
and proposals continue to evolve, and FERC may amend or revise
them, or may introduce new policies or proposals, in the future.
In addition, such policies and proposals, in their final form,
would be subject to potential judicial review. The impact of
such policies and proposals on our business is uncertain and
cannot be predicted at this time.

Western Energy Markets 

There was significant price volatility in both wholesale
electricity and gas markets in the Western United States for
much of calendar year 2000 and extending through the second
quarter of 2001. Due to a number of factors, including drier
than expected weather, which led to lower than normal
hydro-electric capacity in California and the Northwestern
United States, inadequate natural gas pipeline and electric
generation capacity to meet higher than anticipated energy
demand in the region, the inability of the California utilities
to manage their exposure to such price volatility due to
regulatory and financial constraints, and evolving market
structures in California, prices for electricity and natural gas
were much higher than anticipated. A number of federal and state
investigations and proceedings were commenced to address the
crisis.

There are currently a number of proceedings pending at FERC
which were initiated as a direct result of the price levels and
volatility in the energy markets in the Western United States
during this period. Many of these proceedings were initiated by
buyers of wholesale electricity seeking refunds for purchases
made during this period or the reduction of price terms in
contracts entered into at this time. Calpine has been a party to
some of these proceedings. As part of certain proceedings, FERC
has ordered the implementation of certain measures for wholesale
electricity markets in California and the Western United States,
including, the implementation of price caps on the day ahead or
real-time prices for electricity and a continuing obligation of
electricity generators to offer uncommitted generation capacity
to the California Independent System Operator. FERC is
continuing to investigate the causes of the price volatility in
the Western United States during this period. It is uncertain at
this time when these proceedings and investigations at FERC will
conclude or what will be the final resolution thereof.

Other federal and state governmental entities have and continue
to conduct various investigations into the causes of the price
volatility in the energy markets in the Western United States
during 2000-2001. It is uncertain at this time when these
investigations will conclude or what the results may be. The
impact on our business of the results of the investigations
cannot be predicted at this time.

State Regulation 

State public utility commissions PUCs have
historically had broad authority to regulate both the rates
charged by, and the financial activities of, electric utilities
operating in their states and to promulgate regulation for
implementation of PURPA. Since a power sales agreement becomes a
part of a utility s cost structure (generally reflected in
its retail rates), power sales agreements with independent
electricity producers, such as EWGs, are potentially under the
regulatory purview of PUCs and in particular the process by
which the utility has entered into the power sales agreements.
If a PUC has approved the process by which a utility secures its
power supply, a PUC is generally inclined to authorize the
purchasing utility to pass through to the utility s retail
customers the expenses associated with a power purchase
agreement with an independent power producer. However, a
regulatory commission under certain circumstances may not allow
the utility to recover through retail rates its full costs to
purchase power from a QF or an EWG. In addition, retail sales of
electricity or thermal energy by an independent power producer
may be subject to PUC regulation depending on state law.
Independent power producers which are not QFs under PURPA, or
EWGs pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 1992, are considered
to be public utilities in many states and are subject to broad
regulation by a PUC, ranging from requirement of certificate of
public convenience and necessity to regulation of
organizational, accounting, financial and other corporate
matters. Because all of our facilities are either QFs or EWGs,
none are currently subject to such regulation. However, states
may also assert jurisdiction over the sitting and construction
of electricity generating facilities including QFs and EWGs. In
California, for example, the PUC has been required by statute to
adopt and enforce maintenance and operation standards for
generating facilities located in the state, 
including EWGs but excluding QFs, for the purpose of ensuring
their reliable operation. The adopted standards are now in
effect.

State PUCs also have jurisdiction over the transportation of
natural gas by local distribution companies LDCs ).
Each state s regulatory laws are somewhat different;
however, all generally require the LDC to obtain approval from
the PUC for the construction of facilities and transportation
services if the LDCs

20

Table of Contents 

generally applicable tariffs do not cover the proposed
transaction. LDC rates are usually subject to continuing PUC
oversight.

Environmental Regulations 

The construction and operation of power projects are subject to
extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations adopted
for the protection of the environment and to regulate land use.
The laws and regulations applicable to us primarily involve the
discharge of emissions into the water and air and the use of
water, but can also include wetlands preservation, endangered
species, hazardous materials handling and disposal, waste
disposal and noise regulations. These laws and regulations in
many cases require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining
licenses, permits and approvals from federal, state and local
agencies.

Noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations can result
in the imposition of civil or criminal fines or penalties. In
some instances, environmental laws also may impose clean-up or
other remedial obligations in the event of a release of
pollutants or contaminants into the environment. The following
federal laws are among the more significant environmental laws
as they apply to us. In most cases, analogous state laws also
exist that may impose similar, and in some cases more stringent,
requirements on us as those discussed below.

Clean Air Act 

The Federal Clean Air Act of 1970 the Clean Air
Act provides for the regulation, largely through state
implementation of federal requirements, of emissions of air
pollutants from certain facilities and operations. As originally
enacted, the Clean Air Act sets guidelines for emissions
standards for major pollutants (i.e., sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxide) from newly built sources. In late 1990, Congress
passed the Clean Air Act Amendments the 1990
Amendments ). The 1990 Amendments attempt to reduce
emissions from existing sources, particularly previously
exempted older power plants. We believe that all of our
operating plants and relevant oil and gas related facilities are
in compliance with federal performance standards mandated under
the Clean Air Act and the 1990 Amendments.

Clean Water Act 

The Federal Clean Water Act (the Clean Water Act establishes rules regulating the discharge of pollutants into
waters of the United States. We are required to obtain
wastewater and storm water discharge permits for wastewater and
runoff, respectively, from certain of our facilities. We believe
that we are in material compliance with applicable discharge
requirements of the Clean Water Act.

Safe Drinking Water Act 

Part C of the Safe Water Drinking Act SWDA mandates the underground injection control UIC program. The UIC regulates the disposal of wastes by means of
deep well injection. Deep well injection is a common method of
disposing of saltwater, produced water and other oil and gas
wastes. We believe that we are in material compliance with
applicable UIC requirements of the SWDA.

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA regulates the generation, treatment, storage, handling,
transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. We
believe that we are exempt from solid waste requirements under
RCRA.

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
 Liability Act 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended CERCLA or
 Superfund ), requires cleanup of sites from which
there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous
substances and authorizes the United States Environmental
Protection Agency to take any necessary response action at
Superfund sites, including ordering potentially responsible
parties PRPs 

21

SUMMARY OF KEY EVENTS 

Finance 

On March 23, 2004, CalGen, formerly Calpine Construction
Finance Company II, LLC CCFC II ), completed
its offering of secured term loans and secured notes. As
expected, we realized net total proceeds from the offerings
(after payment of transaction fees and expenses, including the
fee payable to Morgan Stanley in connection with an Index Hedge)
of approximately 2.4 billion. The offerings included:

The secured term loans and secured notes described above in each
case are secured, through a combination of pledges of the equity
interests in CalGen and its first tier subsidiary, CalGen
Expansion Company, liens on the assets of CalGen s power
generating facilities (other than its Goldendale facility) and
related assets located throughout the United States. The
lenders recourse is limited to such security and none of
the indebtedness is guaranteed by Calpine. Net proceeds from the
offerings were used to repay amounts outstanding under the
 2.5 billion CCFC II revolving construction credit
facility (the Construction Facility ), which was
scheduled to mature in November 2004, and to pay fees and
transaction costs associated with the refinancing. Concurrently
with this refinancing, we amended and restated the CCFC II
credit facility (as amended and restated, the Revolving
Credit Facility to reduce the commitments under the
facility to 200.0 million and extend its maturity to March
2007. Interest under the Revolving Credit Facility equals LIBOR
plus 350 basis points (or, at our election, the Base Rate
plus 250 basis points). Outstanding indebtedness and
letters of credit under the newly issued notes and term loans at
December 31, 2004 and at the refinancing date totaled
approximately 190.0 and 1.9 million, respectively.
Outstanding indebtedness and letters of credit under the
Construction Facility at December 31, 2003 totaled
approximately 2.3 billion. See Summary
of Key Events for additional information.

Executive Overview 

Calpine Generating Company, LLC CalGen is a
Delaware limited liability company and an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Calpine Corporation Calpine or the
 Parent ). We are engaged, through our subsidiaries,
in the construction, ownership and operation of electric power
generation facilities and the sale of energy, capacity and
related products in the United States of America. We indirectly
own 14 power generation facilities (the projects or
 facilities that are expected to have an aggregate
combined estimated peak capacity of 9,834 MW (nominal
8,425 MW without peaking capacity), including our Pastoria
facility which is currently under construction. Our aggregate
combined estimated peak capacity represents approximately 30.6 
of Calpine s 32,149 MW of aggregate estimated peak
capacity in operation and under construction. Thirteen of our
facilities are natural gas-fired combined cycle facilities, and
our Zion facility is a natural gas-fired simple cycle facility.
Thirteen of our facilities are currently operating and have an
aggregate estimated peak capacity of 9,065 MW.

Our revenues are generated from the sale of electrical capacity
and energy together with a by product, steam, through a series
of agreements with third parties and through the Fixed Price and
Index Based Agreements with CES. In connection with our
refinancing on March 23, 2004, we entered into the Fixed
Price and Index Based Agreements with CES. Previously, CES had
purchased most of the available capacity and energy of our
facilities, including ancillary services and other
generation-based products and services, at negotiated internal
transfer prices agreed upon when the various facilities
commenced operations. In addition, CES supplied substantially
all fuel requirements to the facilities, also at negotiated
internal transfer prices. Under the Fixed Price and Index Based
Agreements, CES purchases a portion of our energy at a fixed
price and all of our remaining energy (after sales pursuant to
our third-party agreements) at floating prices based on
day-ahead energy and gas prices. See Item 1.
 Business Principal Agreements.

Table of Contents 

On March 23, 2004, CalGen issued 2.4 billion in
secured term loans and debt securities (the 2004
Refinancing to replace the 2.5 billion credit
facility we entered into in October 2000 (the Construction
Facility ). The new debt securities were issued in various
traunches and except for the Third Priority Secured Notes Due
2011, carry a floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a
spread. The Third Priority Secured Notes Due 2011 carry a fixed
interest rate of 11.5 .

Concurrently with the 2004 Refinancing, CalGen entered into an
agreement for a 200 million revolving credit facility (the
 Revolving Credit Facility with a group of banks led
by The Bank of Nova Scotia and a 750 million unsecured
subordinated working capital facility (the Working Capital
Facility with CalGen Holdings, Inc., our sole member. The
working capital facility is guaranteed by Calpine and may only
be drawn in limited circumstances. In addition, CalGen had
previously received additional financing from Calpine in the
form of subordinated debt (the Subordinated Parent
Debt ). Effective March 23, 2004, Calpine converted
the Subordinated Parent Debt, totaling approximately
 4.4 billion, to equity in a non-cash capital contribution.

Results of Operations 

Our revenues are generated from the following sources:

the sale of approximately 1,049 MW of electrical capacity
 and energy as well as steam to third parties under several
 long-term agreements and the sale of RMR services to the
 California Independent System Operator Corporation
 CAISO 

the sale of 500 MW of on-peak capacity from our Delta and
 Los Medanos facilities, at a fixed price, to CES through
 December 31, 2009; 

the sale of off-peak, peaking and power augmentation products to
 CES at a fixed price through December 31, 2013; 

the sale of the remaining on-peak portion of our output (net of
 sales to third parties and sales to CES as described above) to
 CES at a floating spot price that reflects the positive (if any,
 but never negative) difference between day-ahead power prices
 and day-ahead gas prices using indices chosen to approximate the
 actual power price that would be received and the actual gas
 price that would be paid in the market relevant for each
 facility, pursuant to the Index Based Agreement; and 

payments to CalGen under a three-year Index Hedge with Morgan
 Stanley Capital Group, Inc. Morgan Stanley Capital
 Group ). The Index Hedge provides for semi-annual payments
 to CalGen by Morgan Stanley Capital Group equal to the amount,
 if any, by which the Aggregate Spark Spread Amount 
 calculated under the Index Hedge (which approximates the
 aggregate Spark Spread Amount calculated under the
 Index Based Agreement) falls below 50.0 million in each
 six-month period during the term of the Index Hedge. The
 Aggregate Spark Spread Amount equals the sum over each such
 six-month period of the individual facilities Daily
 On-Peak Spark Spread Amounts calculated under the Index
 Hedge. 

Prior to the 2004 Refinancing, for those fuel contracts where
the title of fuel did not transfer to CalGen, the related power
sales agreements were accounted for as tolling agreements, and
the associated fuel costs were presented as a reduction of the
related power revenues. The new contracts executed with CES on
March 23, 2004 are not considered to be tolling agreements
since title to the gas transfers, and as such, the projects
record gross revenue and fuel expense.

On May 21, 2004 and September 17, 2004, Columbia
Energy Center and Goldendale Energy Center, respectively,
commenced commercial operations. The Columbia facility is a
455-megawatt combined cycle energy center located in Columbia,
South Carolina. The Goldendale facility is a 271-megawatt
combined-cycle energy center located in Goldendale, Washington.
Assets associated with these two facilities were transferred
from construction in progress to building, machinery and
equipment upon completion and commencement of operations.

The financial results discussed below reflect past performance
of the projects that have commenced commercial operation and are
not expected to be indicative of future results. As discussed
above, in March

2004, we entered into new contractual arrangements that are
expected to materially change our revenues and expenses for
periods after such date. In addition, in the past, our business
had been focused on the development and construction of power
facilities. With the exception of the Pastoria facility, we have
now completed development and construction of the facilities.

Electricity and steam revenue increased as we completed
construction and brought into operation the Goldendale and
Columbia baseload power plants during September 2004 and May
2004, respectively, and brought into operation the expansion of
the Morgan baseload power plant in January 2004. Electricity and
steam revenue also increased as we completed construction and
brought into operation the Morgan and Carville baseload power
plants during July 2003 and June 2003, respectively, and brought
into operation the expansion of the Decatur, Oneta and Zion
baseload power plants all during June 2003. Average megawatts in
operation of our consolidated plants increased by 25.2 to
8,084 MW while generation increased by 8.7 to
28,211 MW. The increase in generation lagged behind the
increase in average MW in operation as our baseload capacity
factor dropped to 39.7 in 2004 from 45.9 in 2003 primarily
because of unattractive margins in the merchant market
reflecting near-term over-supply conditions. Our projects in the
Southeast experienced an average baseload capacity factor of
11.6 in 2004. The overall increase in revenue was due to an
increase in generation combined with the increase in average
pricing, which increased 38.4 as average realized electricity
prices increased to 60.58/ MWh in 2004 from 43.91/ MWh in
2003, primarily because of the new contractual agreements in
2004 which were no longer tolling arrangements as in 2003.

To manage forward exposure to price fluctuations, the Company
entered into a three-year Index Hedge with Morgan Stanley
Capital Group MSCG ). The Index Hedge provides for
semi-annual payments to the Company if the aggregate spark
spread amount calculated under the Index Hedge for any six-month
period during the term of the Index Hedge is less than
 50.0 million. No payments have been made under the Index
Hedge to date. Realized loss on derivative instruments is
accounted for in accordance with EITF 02-03, Issues
Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading
Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk
Management Activities and represents the amortization of
the excess of the amount paid for the Index Hedge over its
internally calculated fair value at the date of purchase.
Unrealized loss represents changes in the value of the Index
Hedge.

Interest expense, related party decreased primarily due to the
refinancing which occurred in March 2004. At the time of this
refinancing, the Subordinated Parent Debt was converted to
equity by the Parent in a non-cash capital contribution.
Partially offsetting the decrease in related party interest
expense was an increase in third-party interest expense. This
increase is primarily due to the CalGen project debt, which
replaced the CCFCII revolving construction credit facility (the
 Construction Facility in March 2004. This debt
accrued interest at a weighted average of approximately 8.6 
during 2004 compared with a weighted average interest rate of
2.6 on the Construction Facility. In addition,
 11.0 million of the increase is due to the new plants
entering commercial operations at which time capitalization of
interest expense ceased and interest expense commenced.

and July 2002, respectively. In addition, we brought into
operation the expansion of the Channel baseload power plant
during April of 2002. Average megawatts in operation of our
consolidated plants increased by 111.7 to 6,459 MW while
generation increased by 58.7 to 25,959 MW. The increase in
generation lagged behind the increase in average MW in operation
as our baseload capacity factor dropped to 45.9 in 2003 from
61.2 in 2002 primarily due to our increased merchant operating
capacity, mostly in the Southeast market where spot market spark
spreads were unattractive, especially during off-peak hours, due
to near-term oversupply. Average realized electricity prices
increased to 43.91/ MWh in 2003 from 32.78/ MWh in 2002.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Prior to the issuance of our secured term loans and secured
notes on March 23, 2004, our primary sources of liquidity
were cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under the
 2.5 billion Construction Facility and subordinated
borrowings from our parent.

The Construction Facility was established in October 2000 with a
consortium of banks and was scheduled to mature in November
2004. As of December 31, 2003, we had 2.2 billion in
borrowings and 53.2 million in letters of credit
outstanding under this facility. The Construction Facility was
repaid and terminated on March 23, 2004 in connection with
the issuance of our secured term loans and secured notes.

The Subordinated Parent Debt was evidenced by a note agreement
dated January 1, 2002 and bore interest at 8.75 per
annum. At December 31, 2003, the outstanding balance was
 4.6 billion. Under the debt subordination agreement,
interest payments to the Parent were not permissible until all
senior debt was repaid. Accordingly, the interest on the
Subordinated Parent Debt has been treated as a non-cash
transaction and has been added back to net income for purposes
of computing cash flows from operations in the accompanying
statements of cash flows. Effective March 23, 2004, and in
connection with the 2004 Refinancing, the Parent transferred the
Subordinated Parent Debt balance, which included accrued
interest, totaling 4.4 billion, to equity as a non-cash
capital contribution.

On March 23, 2004, we completed an offering of secured term
loans and secured notes totaling 2.4 billion. Net proceeds
from the offerings were used to repay amounts outstanding under
the Construction Facility and to pay fees and transaction costs
associated with the refinancing. The new secured term loans and
debt securities were issued in various traunches and, except for
the Third Priority Secured Notes Due 2011, carry a floating
interest rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The Third Priority
Secured Notes Due 2011 carry a fixed interest rate of 11.5 .

Concurrent with the 2004 Refinancing, we entered into an
agreement with a group of banks led by The Bank of Nova Scotia
for a 200.0 million revolving credit facility (the
 Revolving Credit Facility ). This three-year facility
is available for specified working capital purposes, capital
expenditures to complete the Pastoria facility and for letters
of credit. All amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility will bear interest at either (i) the Base Rate
plus 250 basis points, or (ii) at LIBOR plus
350 basis points. At December 31, 2004, there were no
outstanding borrowings under the facility. At December 31,
2004, we had approximately 190.0 million in letters of
credit outstanding under this credit facility to support fuel
purchases and other operational activities.

The Company also entered into a 750.0 million unsecured
subordinated working capital facility (the Working Capital
Facility with CalGen Holdings, Inc., our sole member,
which is guaranteed by Calpine. Under the Working Capital
Facility, the Company may borrow funds only for specific
purposes including claims under its business interruption
insurance with respect to any of the facilities or a delay in
the start up of the Pastoria facility; losses incurred as a
result of uninsured force majeure events; claims for liquidated
damages against third party contractors with respect to the
Goldendale and Pastoria facilities and spark spread diminution
after expiration of the three-year Index Hedge agreement with
Morgan Stanley Capital Group.

30

Table of Contents 

Borrowings under the Working Capital Facility will bear interest
at LIBOR plus 4.0 and interest will be payable annually in
arrears and will mature in 2019. At December 31, 2004,
there were no outstanding borrowings under the Working Capital
Facility.

To manage forward exposure to price fluctuations, we entered
into the Index Hedge. The Index Hedge provides for semi-annual
payments to us equal to the amount, if any, that the aggregate
spark spread amount calculated under the Index Based Agreement,
in each six-month period, falls below 50.0 million. We
paid 45.0 million for the Index Hedge, which is in place
through April 1, 2007. No payments have been made under the
Index Hedge to date.

Historically, our funding requirements related primarily to the
construction of our facilities. With the completion of the
Columbia Energy Center and the Goldendale Energy Center in 2004,
all of our facilities are operational except for Pastoria, which
is expected to commence operations of phase I and
phase II in May 2005 and June 2005, respectively. We expect
to have sufficient cash flow from operations and borrowings
available under our credit facilities to satisfy all obligations
under our outstanding indebtedness, and to fund anticipated
capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the
next twelve months. On December 31, 2004, our liquidity
totaled approximately 75 million. This includes cash and
cash equivalents on hand of approximately 65 million and
 10 million of borrowing capacity under our Revolving
Credit Facility. Additionally, as explained above, we have
 700 million of borrowing capacity under our Working
Capital Facility for specific permitted purposes.

Operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004
provided net cash of 278.6 million, compared with
 161.6 million and 133.4 million for the same periods
in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in operating cash
flow in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily relates to the
completion and commencement of operations of the Columbia and
Goldendale facilities. In addition, the Morgan and Carville
facilities, as well as the expansion of Decatur, Oneta and Zion,
went operational in 2003 and were generating operating cash
flows for the entire year in 2004, opposed to only a partial
year in 2003. These additional generations, in addition to
favorable contracts executed in connection with our 2004
Refinancing, resulted in an increase in operating cash flows
from increased gross profit and positive changes in our working
capital during 2004. This was partially offset by higher
interest cost from third-party debt. The increase in operating
cash flow in 2003 compared with 2002 primarily relates to the
completion and commencement of operations of the Morgan and
Carville facilities, and the expansion of Decatur, Oneta and
Zion during 2003.

Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004,
consumed net cash of 195.6 million, compared with
 584.1 million and 1,570.9 million in the same period
of 2003 and 2002, respectively. In all periods capital
expenditures for new construction of plants represent the
majority of investing cash outflows. The decrease between
periods is due to the completion of construction of several
facilities during 2003 and 2004.

Financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004,
used net cash of 58.1 million, compared with financing
activities providing 436.5 million and 1.4 billion
in the same period in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

31

Table of Contents 

Current year cash outflows are primarily the result of
refinancing transactions, repayments of Subordinated Parent Debt
and financing costs. In the same period of 2003 and 2002,
financing inflows were comprised primarily of borrowings under
the Subordinated Parent Debt.

Letter of Credit Facilities At
December 31, 2004, we had approximately 190.0 million
in letters of credit outstanding under our 200 million
revolving credit facility to support fuel purchases and other
operational activities. At December 31, 2003, we had
approximately 53.2 million in letters of credit
outstanding under our revolving credit facility primarily to
support the development and construction of our facilities.

Working Capital At December 31, 2004, we
had working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of
approximately 1.5 million, compared to a working capital
deficit of approximately 2.0 billion at December 31,
2003. The working capital deficit was primarily due to the
classification as a current liability of the outstanding project
financing balance of 2.2 billion, which was successfully
refinanced in March 2004.

Capital Expenditures and Sources Our
estimated capital expenditures for 2005 include approximately
 74.2 million in construction costs required to complete
the Pastoria facility. We also expect to make capital
expenditures in 2005 with respect to operations and maintenance,
including major maintenance, of approximately
 23.6 million. We expect to fund these expenditures through
cash on hand and operating cash flow, or potentially from
borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

Distributions to Sole Member Under the
indentures governing the notes, we are generally permitted to
make distributions to CalGen Holdings, our sole member, out of
excess cash flow generated by operations, provided that
cumulative cash flow is positive and that no default or event of
default exists and there are no amounts outstanding under our
new working capital facility. We expect that all distributable
collections (after the payment of operating expenses, debt
service and deposits to the reserve accounts) will be
distributed to our sole member, as permitted. No such
distributions were made in 2004.

Capital Availability Under the indentures
governing the notes, our ability to borrow additional
indebtedness is severely limited. If a need for capital does
arise, either because our business changes or because the
sources on which we are depending are not available, we may not
be able to obtain such capital under the indentures governing
the notes or on terms that are attractive to us.

Performance Indicators We believe the
following factors are important in assessing our ability to
continue to fund our growth in the capital markets:
(a) various interest coverage ratios; (b) our credit
and debt ratings by the rating agencies; (c) our
anticipated capital requirements over the coming quarters and
years; (d) the profitability of our operations;
(e) the non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP financial measures and other performance
metrics discussed in Performance Metrics below;
(f) our cash balances and remaining capacity under existing
revolving credit construction and general purpose credit
facilities; (g) compliance with covenants in existing debt
facilities; (h) progress in raising new or replacement
capital; and (i) the stability of future contractual cash
flows.

transactions are third parties that are unrelated to us. See
Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for the future minimum lease payments under our operating leases.

Compliance with Covenants Some of our senior
notes indentures and our credit facilities contain financial and
other restrictive covenants that limit or prohibit our ability
to incur indebtedness, make prepayments on or purchase
indebtedness in whole or in part, pay dividends, make
investments, lease properties, engage in transactions with
affiliates, create liens, consolidate or merge with another
entity or allow one of our subsidiaries to do so, sell assets,
and acquire facilities or other businesses. We are currently in
compliance with all of such financial and other restrictive
covenants. Any failure to comply could give holders

Performance Metrics 

In understanding our business, we believe that certain
operational non-GAAP financial metrics are particularly
important. These are described below:

Total deliveries of power. We generate power which is
sold to CES and third parties, and steam which is primarily sold
to third-party hosts. These sales are recorded as electricity
and steam revenue. The volume in MWh for power is a key
indicator of our level of generation activity.

Average availability and average baseload capacity
factor. Availability represents the percent of total hours
during the period that our plants were available to run after
taking into account the downtime associated with both scheduled
and unscheduled outages. The baseload capacity factor is
calculated by dividing (a) total megawatt hours generated
by our power plants (excluding peakers) by the product of
multiplying (b) the weighted average megawatts in operation
during the period by (c) the total hours in the period. The
capacity factor is thus a measure of total actual generation as
a percent of total potential generation. If we elect not to
generate during periods when electricity pricing is too low or
gas prices too high to operate profitably, the baseload capacity
factor will reflect that decision as well as both scheduled and
unscheduled outages due to maintenance and repair requirements.

Average heat rate for gas-fired fleet of power plants
expressed in Btu s of fuel consumed per KWh generated. 
We calculate the average heat rate for our gas-fired power
plants (excluding peakers) by dividing (a) fuel consumed in
Btu s by (b) KWh generated. The resultant heat rate is
a measure of fuel efficiency, so the lower the heat rate, the
better. We also calculate a steam-adjusted heat
rate, in which we adjust the fuel consumption in Btu s down
by the equivalent heat content in steam or other thermal energy
exported to a third party, such as to steam hosts for our
cogeneration facilities. Our goal is to have the lowest average
heat rate in the industry.

Average all-in realized electric price expressed in dollars
per MWh generated. We calculate the all-in realized electric
price per MWh generated by dividing (a) the sum of adjusted
electricity and steam revenue, which includes capacity revenues,
energy revenues, thermal revenues, plus realized gain or (loss)
on the Index Hedge plus other revenue related to the Index Hedge
by (b) total generated MWh in the period.

Average cost of natural gas expressed in dollars per millions
of Btu s of fuel consumed. The fuel costs for our
gas-fired power plants are a function of the prices we pay for
fuel purchased from CES. Accordingly, we calculate the cost of
natural gas per millions of Btu s of fuel consumed in our
power plants by dividing (a) adjusted fuel expense which
includes the cost of fuel consumed by our plants by (b) the
heat content in millions of Btu s of the fuel we consumed
in our power plants for the period.

Average spark spread expressed in dollars per MWh
generated. We calculate the spark spread per MWh generated
by subtracting (a) adjusted fuel expense from
(b) adjusted E&S revenue and dividing the difference by
(c) total generated MWh in the period.

Average plant operating expense per normalized MWh. To
assess trends in electric power plant operating expense POX per MWh, we normalize the results from period
to period by assuming a constant 70 total company-wide capacity
factor (including both baseload and peaker capacity) in deriving
normalized MWh. By normalizing the cost per MWh with a constant
capacity factor, we can better analyze trends and the results of
our program to realize economies of scale, cost reductions and
efficiencies at our electric generating plants. For comparison
purposes we also include POX per actual MWh.

Financial Market Risks 

Debt Financing Certain debt instruments may
affect us adversely because of changes in market conditions. In
connection with our offering on March 23, 2004, we issued
approximately 2.4 billion in new debt. Interest on
substantially all of these debt securities is based on LIBOR
plus a spread. Significant LIBOR increases could have a negative
impact on our future interest expense. In addition, borrowings
under our Revolving Credit Facility and our Working Capital
Facility carry an interest rate based on LIBOR plus a spread.

The following table summarizes our variable-rate debt, by
repayment year, exposed to interest rate risk as of

Derivatives We are primarily focused on
generation of electricity using gas-fired turbines. As a result,
our natural physical commodity position is short 
fuel (i.e., natural gas consumer) and long power
(i.e.,

36

Table of Contents 

electricity seller). To manage forward exposure to price
fluctuations in these commodities, we entered into the Index
Hedge with MSCG discussed in Note 10 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Index Hedge will provide for semi-annual payments to us
equal to the amount, if any, that the aggregate spark spread
amount calculated under the Index Based Gas Sale and Power
Purchase Agreement, in each six-month period, falls below
 50 million. The Hedge Index is in place until
April 1, 2007.

information is derived from various sources. Prices actively
quoted include validation with prices sourced from commodities
exchanges (e.g., New York Mercantile Exchange). Prices provided
by other external sources include quotes from commodity brokers
and electronic trading platforms. Prices based on models and
other valuation methods are validated using quantitative
methods. See Critical Accounting Policies for a
discussion of valuation estimates used where external prices are
unavailable.

The derivative instrument included in this table is the Index
Hedge discussed in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. Valuation of the Index Hedge depends, to a
large degree, upon assumptions about future gas and power
prices. Accordingly, we have calculated the change in fair value
shown above based upon an assumed ten percent increase in power
prices and an assumed ten percent decrease in gas prices.
Changes in fair value of the Index Hedge economically offset the
price risk exposure of

37

Table of Contents 

our physical assets. We have included none of the offsetting
changes in value of our physical assets in the table above.

The primary factors affecting the fair value of our derivative
at any point in time are (1) the term of open derivative
positions, and (2) changing market prices for electricity
and natural gas. The Index Hedge is valued using the mean
reversion model, and as prices for electricity and natural gas
are among the most volatile of all commodity prices, there may
be material changes in the fair value of our derivative over
time, driven by price volatility and the realized portion of the
derivative asset. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, the
change since the last balance sheet date in the total value of
the derivative is reflected in the statement of operations as an
item (gain or loss) of current earnings.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies 

Our financial statements reflect the selection and application
of accounting policies which require management to make
significant estimates and judgments. See Note 3 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies. We believe that the
following reflect the more critical accounting policies that
currently affect our financial condition and results of
operations.

Fair Value of Our Index Hedge Derivative 

SFAS No. 133 requires us to account for certain
derivative contracts at fair value. Accounting for derivatives
at fair value requires us to make estimates about future prices
during periods for which price quotes are not available from
sources external to us. As a result, we are required to rely on
internally developed price estimates when external price quotes
are unavailable. The Index Hedge is valued using the mean
reversion model, and as prices for electricity and natural gas
are among the most volatile of all commodity prices, there may
be material changes in the fair value of our derivative over
time, driven by price volatility and the realized portion of the
derivative asset. Our estimates regarding future prices involve
a level of uncertainty, and prices actually realized in the
future could differ from our estimates.

Our mark-to-market activity includes both realized and
unrealized gains and losses on our Index Hedge instrument. All
changes in the fair value of the Index Hedge are recognized
currently in earnings.

Accounting for Long-Lived Assets 

Plant Useful Lives Property, plant and
equipment are stated at cost. The cost of renewals and
betterments that extend the useful life of property, plant and
equipment is also capitalized. Depreciation is recorded
utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated original
composite useful life, generally 35 years for baseload
power plants, exclusive of the estimated salvage value,
typically 10 . Zion, which is a peaking facility, is depreciated
over 40 years, less the estimated salvage value of 10 .

Major Maintenance We capitalize costs for
major refurbishments to the hot gas path section and
compressor components of our gas turbines. The compressor
components may include such significant items as combustor parts
(e.g. fuel nozzles, transition pieces and baskets and compressor blades, vanes and diaphragms. We also capitalize
costs for major refurbishments to steam turbines and other
balance of plant equipment. These refurbishments are done either
under long term service agreements by the original equipment
manufacturer or by Calpine s Turbine Maintenance Group. The
capitalized costs are depreciated over their estimated useful
lives ranging from three to twelve years. The average
depreciation period is six years. We expense annual planned
maintenance. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Combined
Financial Statements for more information.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate
long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and
other long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be
recoverable. Factors which could trigger an impairment include
significant underperformance relative to historical or projected
future operating results; significant changes in the manner of
our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall
business; and significant negative industry or economic trends.
Certain of our generating assets are located in regions with
depressed demands and market

38

Table of Contents 

spark spreads. Our forecasts assume that spark spreads will
increase in future years in these regions as the supply and
demand relationships improve.

The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based
on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the
assets, as compared to the carrying value of the assets. The
significant assumptions that we use in our undiscounted future
cash flow estimates include the future supply and demand
relationships for electricity and natural gas, and the expected
pricing for those commodities and the resultant spark spreads in
the various regions where we generate. If an impairment has
occurred, the amount of the impairment loss recognized would be
determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and
recording a loss if the fair value was less than the book value.
For equity method investments and assets identified as held for
sale, the book value is compared to the estimated fair value to
determine if an impairment loss is required. For equity method
investments, we would record a loss when the decline in value is
other than temporary.

Our assessment regarding the existence of impairment factors is
based on market conditions, operational performance and legal
factors of our businesses. Our review of factors present and the
resulting appropriate carrying value of our intangibles, and
other long-lived assets are subject to judgments and estimates
that management is required to make. Future events could cause
us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our
intangibles, and other long-lived assets might be impaired.

Capitalized Interest We capitalize interest
on capital invested in projects during the advanced stages of
development and the construction period in accordance with
SFAS No. 34, Capitalization of Interest
Cost, as amended. For the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, the total amount of interest capitalized
was 55.0 million, 123.6 million and
 236.4 million, respectively. Upon commencement of plant
operation, capitalized interest, as a component of the total
cost of the plant, is amortized over the estimated useful life
of the plant.

Capitalized interest is computed using two methods:
(1) capitalization of interest on funds borrowed for
specific construction projects and (2) capitalization of
interest on general debt. For capitalization of interest on
specific funds, we capitalize the interest cost incurred on debt
entered into for specific projects under construction. The
methodology for capitalizing interest on general debt,
consistent with paragraphs 13 and 14 of
SFAS No. 34 begins with a determination of the
borrowings applicable to our qualifying assets. The basis of
this approach is the assumption that the portion of the interest
costs that are capitalized on expenditures during an
asset s acquisition period could have been avoided if the
expenditures had not been made. This methodology takes the view
that if funds are not required for construction then they would
have been used to pay off other debt. We use our best judgment
in determining which borrowings represent the cost of financing
the acquisition of the assets. Prior to the refinancing on
March 23, 2004, general debt consisted primarily of our
Subordinated Parent Debt. The interest rate is derived by
dividing the total interest cost by the average borrowings. This
weighted average interest rate is applied to our average
qualifying assets in excess of specific debt on which interest
is capitalized. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information about the
capitalization of interest expense.

Revenue Recognition 

Capacity revenue is recognized monthly, based on the
plant s availability. Energy revenue is recognized upon
transmission or delivery to the customer. In addition to various
third-party contracts, CalGen has entered into long-term power
sales agreements with CES, whereby CES purchases virtually all
of the projects available electric energy and capacity
(other than that sold under third-party power and steam
agreements) and provides the facilities substantially all of
their required natural gas needs. Prior to the 2004 Refinancing,
for all fuel contracts where title for fuel did not transfer,
the related power sales agreements were accounted for as tolling
agreements and the associated fuel costs were presented as a
reduction of the related power revenues. In connection with the
2004 Refinancing, new contracts were executed with CES. Under
these new contracts, the title for fuel transfers to CalGen;
therefore, they are not considered to be tolling agreements. As
a result, the projects record gross revenues and fuel expense.
Steam is generated as a by-product at our facilities and is
recognized upon delivery to the customer.

39

Table of Contents 

Under certain circumstances, CalGen is a party to a number of
 buy-sell transactions whereby CalGen purchases gas
from a third-party, sells the gas to CES and then repurchases
the gas from CES, at substantially the same price. For the year
ended December 31, 2004, revenues of approximately
 102 million from these transactions were netted against
 102 million of affiliate fuel expense.

Accounting for Income Taxes 

We are a single member limited liability company that has been
treated as taxable for financial reporting purposes. For all
periods presented, we accounted for income taxes using the
separate return method, pursuant to SFAS No. 109,
 Accounting for Income Taxes. Under
SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between the financial reporting
and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using
enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse. Under
SFAS No. 109, a valuation allowance is recognized if,
based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. Because of significant historical net
losses incurred by the Company, a valuation allowance has been
established for the entire amount of the excess of long-term
deferred tax assets over long-term deferred tax liabilities. As
a result of the valuation allowance, the Company s tax
liability has been reduced to zero and no tax provision or
benefit has been recorded. We will continue to evaluate the
realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.

In the ordinary course of our business, there are many
transactions where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some
of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of the treatment
of capital assets, financing transactions and multi-state
taxation of operations. Although we believe that estimates used
in the preparation of these financial statements are reasonable,
no assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of these tax
matters will not be different than that which is reflected in
our historical income tax provisions and accruals within these
financial statements. The Company believes that it has
adequately provided for the outcome of these tax items within
these financial statements.

Our effective income tax rates were 0 in fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. The effective tax rate in all periods is the
result of applying valuation allowances to tax benefits arising
from net losses we experienced during the respective periods.
Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if
unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations occur or if we
experience future adverse determinations by taxing authorities
after any related litigation.

At December 31, 2004, we had federal and state net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately 1.7 billion,
which will expire between 2015 and 2024. The federal and state
net operating loss carryforwards available are subject to
limitations on their annual usage. The net deferred tax asset
for the federal and state losses has been offset by a valuation
allowance of 140.3 million.

 Controls and Procedures 

The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, based on the evaluation of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) required by
paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15,
as of December 31, 2004, have concluded that the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective to ensure the timely collection, evaluation and
disclosure of information relating to the Company that would
potentially be subject to disclosure under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder because of the deficiency noted below.

In connection with the automation of its billing process, the
Company identified an error made in determining payments due
from CES to the Company for capacity pursuant to the Index Based
Agreement and the Fixed Price Agreement. The error caused the
Company to over-report revenues by approximately
 16.9 million from March 23, 2004, the date of the
2004 Refinancing, until September 30, 2004. This error had
no impact on our Parent s (Calpine s) financial
statements because the revenue transactions between the Company
and CES are eliminated in consolidation on Calpine s books.
However, because the amounts involved are material to the
Company, we have concluded that the error constituted a material
control weakness for the Company, requiring restatement of the
Company s financial statements for prior quarters in 2004.
The cause of the error and remedies underway to prevent a
reoccurrence are described in additional detail below. See also
Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. There
were no other changes in the Company s internal controls
over financial reporting identified in connection with the
evaluation required by paragraph (d) of the
Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
internal controls over financial reporting.

CalGen bills for its power sales and gas purchases under two
agreements between CalGen and CES: the Index Based Agreement and
the Fixed Price Agreement. Billings under these agreements
include payments for fixed capacity fees and variable energy and
O&M fees for all of CalGen s power plants. Capacity
charges billed under the Fixed Price Agreement should have been
deducted from amounts used to calculate the charges under the
Index Based Agreement; however, an error occurred when capacity
for two of our plants was inadvertently billed under both
agreements.

During 2004, much of CalGen s billing process was dependent
upon manual processes. Because of the complexity of the billing
calculations and the increased control risk posed by the manual
nature of the billing process, CalGen began an effort in late
2004 to automate its billing process. While implementing the
automated process, CalGen discovered the unintentional
overstatements of its 2004 billings and related revenues. CalGen
believes that the automation effort now underway will address
the control risks posed by the manual billing process. The
automation of the billing process is expected to be completed
during 2005 and will include system based calculation of
billings as well as established procedures regarding access to
and review and approval of the system-based billing algorithms
themselves. CalGen will also implement procedures requiring
additional analytical review and managerial approval of the
monthly billings now calculated manually and in the future to be
calculated by its billing system.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Member of Calpine Generating Company, LLC:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Calpine Generating Company, LLC and
its subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements
and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

As discussed in Notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial
statements, a significant portion of Calpine Generating Company,
LLC s transactions are with related parties.

Inc.) 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

For the Years Ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 

1. 
 
 Organization and Operations of the Company 

Business 

Calpine Generating Company, LLC (the Company or
 CalGen ), a Delaware limited liability company, is an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Calpine Corporation Calpine or the Parent ). CalGen is
engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the construction,
ownership and operation of electric power generation facilities
and the sale of energy, capacity and related products in the
United States of America. The purpose of these consolidated
financial statements is to present the financial position and
results of operations of the 14 power projects (collectively,
the projects or the facilities listed
below and other legal entities that are indirectly owned by
CalGen.

CalGen is comprised of the following 14 power projects (the
dates represent commercial operation of the project, or expected
commercial operation for the Pastoria Energy Center, which is
under construction): (1) Delta project near Pittsburg,
California, June 2002; (2) Goldendale project near
Goldendale, Washington, September 2004; (3) Los Medanos
project near Pittsburg, California, August 2001;
(4) Pastoria project under construction near Kern County,
California, Phase 1 May 2005, Phase 2 June 2005;
(5) Baytown project near Baytown, Texas, June 2002;
(6) Channel project near Houston, Texas, Phase 1
August 2001, Phase 2 April 2002; (7) Corpus Christi
project located near Corpus Christi, Texas, October 2002;
(8) Freestone project near Fairfield, Texas, Phase 1
June 2002, Phase 2 July 2002; (9) Carville project
near St. Gabriel, Louisiana, June 2003; (10) Columbia
project near Columbia, South Carolina, May 2004;
(11) Decatur project near Decatur, Alabama, Phase 1
June 2002, Phase 2 June 2003; (12) Morgan project near
Morgan County, Alabama, Phase 1 July 2003, Phase 2
January 2004; (13) Oneta project near Coweta, Oklahoma,
Phase 1 July 2002, Phase 2 June 2003; and
(14) Zion project near Zion, Illinois, Phase 1 June
2002, Phase 2 June 2003. These facilities comprise
substantially all of CalGen s assets.

At December 31, 2003, CalGen included an equipment company
business unit which had made progress payments related to
turbine purchases. On March 23, 2004, CalGen issued
 2.4 billion in debt securities (the 2004
Refinancing to replace 2.5 billion in debt
securities issued in October 2000 (the Construction
Facility ). In connection with the 2004 Refinancing, these
turbines and related progress payment balances were transferred
to another Calpine business unit.

Basis of Presentation 

CalGen s financial statements for all periods reflect an
allocation of charges for Calpine s common expenditures.
Such charges have been made in accordance with Staff Accounting
Bulletin SAB No. 55, Allocation of
Expenses and Related Disclosure in Financial Statements of
Subsidiaries, Divisions or Lesser Business Components of Another
Entity. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all
costs of doing business, including those incurred by the Parent
on CalGen s behalf. Costs that are clearly identifiable as
being applicable to CalGen have been allocated to CalGen. The
most significant costs included in this category include costs
incurred during the construction phase of the facilities when
salaries and other costs are charged directly to the related
construction project. Costs of centralized departments that
serve all business segments have been allocated, where such
charges would be material, using relevant allocation measures,
primarily the base labor of CalGen as a percentage of the base
labor of the Parent. The most significant costs in this category
include salary and benefits of certain employees, legal and
other professional fees, information technology costs and
facilities costs, including office rent. Parent corporate costs
that clearly relate to other business segments of Calpine have
not been allocated to CalGen. Charges for Calpine s common
general and administrative expenses that have been allocated to
CalGen and costs associated with the termination of certain
long-term service

agreements related to major maintenance paid by Calpine have
been recorded as contributions from the Parent. These amounts
totaled 5.3 million, 5.1 million and
 3.1 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

For all periods presented, CalGen accounted for income taxes
associated with the projects using the separate return method,
pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. SFAS No. 109 See
Note 7 for additional information.

2. 
 
 Changes in Accounting Principle 

Effective January 1, 2003, CalGen adopted
SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations, SFAS No. 143 which
applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement and
removal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 143 requires
entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation in the period when it is incurred. When
the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the
cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related property,
plant and equipment. Over time, the liability is increased for
the change in its present value each period, and the initial
capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the
related asset. The cumulative effect of the change increased net
loss for the year ended December 31, 2003 by
 0.2 million, net of applicable income taxes.

3. 
 
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Principles of Consolidation The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company adopted
FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB 51 FIN 46 as of December 31, 2003 and
FIN 46 (revised December 31, 2003) FIN 46-R as of March 31, 2004. An
analysis was performed for CalGen subsidiaries with significant
long-term power sales or tolling agreements. Certain of the
CalGen subsidiaries were deemed to be VIEs by virtue of these
long-term agreements. CalGen qualitatively determined that power
sales or tolling agreements with a term for less than one-third
of the facility s remaining useful life or for less than
50 of the entity s capacity would not cause the power
purchaser to be the primary beneficiary, due to the length of
the economic life of the underlying assets. As all of
CalGen s contracts are of this nature, CalGen is deemed to
absorb a majority of the entity s variability and,
accordingly, continues to consolidate the assets and liabilities
of all of the projects. All intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications Certain amounts in the 2003
and 2002 Consolidated Financial Statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation.

Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial
Statements The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The most significant estimates with regard to these
financial statements relate to useful lives and carrying values
of assets, salvage value assumptions, provision for income
taxes, fair value calculations of derivative instruments,
capitalization of interest, outcome of pending litigation, the
allocation of the Parent s shared expenditures and the
ability of CalGen to recover the carrying value of the
facilities.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments The
carrying value of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
marketable securities, accounts and other payables approximate
their respective fair values due to their short maturities.
Amounts outstanding under the project financing debt carry fixed
and floating-interest rates. The

F-9

Table of Contents 

CALPINE GENERATING COMPANY, LLC 

(a wholly-owned subsidiary of Calpine CalGen Holdings,
Inc.) 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued) 

book value of floating rate debt approximates its fair value.
The Third Priority Secured Notes Due 2011 carry a fixed interest
rate. The fair value of this debt at December 31, 2004 was
 140.1 million.

Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Because
of the short term to maturity, and relative price insensitivity
to changes in market interest rates, carrying amount of these
instruments approximates fair value.

Restricted Cash At December 31, 2003 the
Company was required to maintain cash balances that were
restricted by provisions of its construction financing
agreements. All revenues were deposited into restricted accounts
at depository banks in order to comply with the depository
agreement. The majority of the Company s restricted cash at
December 31, 2003, in the amounts of 69.8 million,
 60.5 million and 14.4 million, were the assets of
Delta Energy Center, Carville Energy and Columbia Energy Center,
respectively. The majority of the restricted cash was invested
in accounts earning market rates; therefore, the carrying value
approximated fair value. The new agreements, executed in
connection with the 2004 Refinancing, do not require CalGen to
maintain restricted cash accounts. As a result, the balance in
these accounts was zero at December 31, 2004.

Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable 
Accounts receivable and payable represent amounts due from
customers and owed to vendors. Accounts receivable are recorded
at invoiced amounts, net of reserves and allowances and do not
bear interest. The Company reviews the financial condition of
customers prior to granting credit. Reserve and allowance
accounts represent the Company s best estimate of the
amount of probable credit losses in the Company s existing
accounts receivable. The Company determines the allowance based
on a variety of factors, including the length of time
receivables are past due, economic trends and conditions
affecting its customer base, significant one-time events and
historical write off experience. Also, specific provisions are
recorded for individual receivables when the Company becomes
aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial
obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or
deterioration in the customer s operating results or
financial position. The Company reviews the adequacy of its
reserves and allowances quarterly. Generally, past due balances
over 90 days and over a specified amount are individually
reviewed for collectibility. Account balances are charged
against the allowance after all means of collection have been
exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.

Inventories The Company s inventories
primarily include spare parts and operating supplies.
Inventories and operating supplies are valued at the lower of
cost or market. The cost of spare parts is generally determined
using the weighted average method.

Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets and Other
Assets Prepaid expenses and other current assets
represent amounts consisting primarily of prepaid insurance and
service agreements. The service agreements are long-term
contracts with major equipment suppliers covering the
maintenance, spare parts and technical services required by the
facilities. Payments are classified as prepayments and charged
to expense or capital in the period that the work is performed.
Other assets primarily represent deferred transmission credits
and the long-term component of service agreements.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net See
Note 4 for a discussion of the Company s accounting
policies for its property, plant and equipment.

Project Development Costs The Company
capitalizes project development costs once it is determined that
it is probable that such costs will be realized through the
ultimate construction of a power plant. These costs include
professional services, salaries, permits and other costs
directly related to the development of a new project. Upon the
start-up of plant operations, these costs are amortized as a
component of the total cost of the plant over its estimated
useful life.

Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing
costs are amortized to interest expense over the life of the
related debt instrument, ranging from five to seven years, using
the effective interest rate method. During the development and
construction phases, this amortization is capitalized and
amortized over the life of the plant. CalGen recorded
 20.6 million, 18.2 million and 14.9 million in
such amortization for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. Of these amounts,
 9.1 million, 6.1 million and 9.9 million was
capitalized, respectively. As a result of the 2004 Refinancing,
approximately 60.2 million in new deferred financing costs
were incurred. The balance of deferred financing costs relating
to the previous credit facility of approximately
 12.5 million was written-off to interest expense in the
first quarter of 2004. (see Note 5).

Long-Lived Assets In accordance with
SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed of, SFAS No. 144 the
Company evaluates the impairment of long-lived assets, including
construction and development projects, based on the projection
of undiscounted pre-interest expense and pre-tax expense cash
flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. The
significant assumptions that the Company uses in its
undiscounted future cash flow estimates include the future
supply and demand relationships for electricity and natural gas,
the expected pricing for those commodities and the resultant
spark spreads in the various regions where the Company
generates. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be
sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the
assets are written down to their estimated fair values.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and
accounts receivable. The Company s cash accounts are
generally held in federally insured banks. The Company s
accounts and notes receivable are concentrated within entities
engaged in the energy industry, mainly within the United States
of America. The Company generally does not require collateral
for accounts receivable from end-user customers, but evaluates
the net accounts receivable and accounts payable and may require
security deposits or letters of credit to be posted if exposure
reaches a certain level.

Revenue Recognition Capacity revenue is
recognized monthly, based on the plant s availability.
Energy revenue is recognized upon transmission or delivery to
the customer. In addition to various third-party contracts,
CalGen has entered into long-term power sales agreements with
Calpine Energy Services, L.P. CES ), a subsidiary of
its Parent, whereby CES purchases virtually all of the
projects available electric energy and capacity (other
than that sold under third-party power and steam agreements) and
provides the facilities substantially all of their required
natural gas needs. Prior to the 2004 Refinancing, for all fuel
contracts where title for fuel did not transfer, the related
power sales agreements were accounted for as tolling agreements
and the associated fuel costs were presented as a reduction of
the related power revenues. In connection with the 2004
Refinancing, new contracts were executed with CES. Under these
new contracts, the title for fuel transfers to CalGen;
therefore, they are not considered to be tolling agreements. As
a result, the projects record gross revenues and fuel expense.
Steam is generated as a by-product at our facilities and is
recognized upon delivery to the customer.

Under certain circumstances, CalGen is a party to a number of
 buy-sell transactions whereby CalGen purchases gas
from a third-party, sells the gas to CES and then repurchases
the gas from CES, at substantially the same price. Revenues from
these transactions are netted against the affiliated fuel
expense. For the year ended December 31, 2004, revenues of
approximately 102 million from these transactions were
netted against 102 million of associated fuel expense.

Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is
the total of net income and all other non-owner changes in
equity. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI typically includes unrealized gains and
losses from derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow
hedges and the effects of foreign currency translation
adjustments. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company did
not have any AOCI.

Derivative Instruments 
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS No. 133 as amended and interpreted
by other related accounting literature, establishes accounting
and reporting standards for derivative instruments (including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts).
SFAS No. 133 requires companies to record derivatives
on their balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured
at their fair value unless exempted from derivative treatment as
a normal purchase and sale. All changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recognized currently in earnings unless specific
hedge criteria are met, which requires that a company must
formally document, designate, and assess the effectiveness of
transactions that receive hedge accounting.

Accounting for derivatives at fair value requires the Company to
make estimates about future prices during periods for which
price quotes are not available from sources external to the
Company. As a result, the Company is required to rely on
internally developed price estimates when external price quotes
are unavailable. The Company derives its future price estimates,
during periods where external price quotes are unavailable,
based on an extrapolation of prices from periods where external
price quotes are available. The Company performs this
extrapolation using liquid and observable market prices and
extending those prices to an internally generated long-term
price forecast based on a generalized equilibrium model.

Mark-to-Market Activity, Net This includes
unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on the Company s
Index Hedge (see discussion in Note 10).

STATEMENTS (Continued) 

Other Revenue This primarily relates to
income from an operating lease with a third party.

Plant Operating Expense This primarily
includes employee expenses, repairs and maintenance, insurance,
transmission cost and property taxes.

Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes CalGen
is a single member limited liability company that has been
appropriately treated as a taxable entity for financial
reporting purposes. For all periods presented, the Company
accounted for income taxes using the separate return method,
pursuant to SFAS No. 109. Under
SFAS No. 109, a valuation allowance is recognized if,
based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. Because of significant historical net
losses incurred by the Company, a valuation allowance has been
established for the entire amount of the excess of deferred tax
assets over deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, the
Company s net tax liability has been reduced to zero and no
tax provision or benefit has been recorded. The taxable income
or loss of the Company is included with the consolidated income
tax returns of Calpine Corporation.

New Accounting Pronouncements 

FIN 46 and FIN 46-R 

In January 2003 the FASB issued FIN 46 which requires the
consolidation of an entity by an enterprise that absorbs a
majority of the entity s expected losses, receives a
majority of the entity s expected residual returns, or
both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial
interest in the entity. Historically, entities have generally
been consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling
financial interest through ownership of a majority voting
interest in the entity. The objectives of FIN 46 are to
provide guidance on the identification of a Variable Interest
Entity VIE for which control is achieved through
means other than ownership of a majority of the voting interest
of the entity and how to determine which business enterprise (if
any), as the primary beneficiary, should consolidate the VIE.
This model for consolidation applies to an entity in which
either (1) the at-risk equity is insufficient to absorb
expected losses without additional subordinated financial
support or (2) its at-risk equity holders as a group are
not able to make decisions that have a significant impact on the
success or failure of the entity s ongoing activities. A
variable interest in a VIE, by definition, is an asset,
liability, equity, contractual arrangement or other economic
interest that absorbs the entity s variability.

In December 2003 the FASB modified FIN 46 with
FIN 46-R to make certain technical corrections and to
address certain implementation issues. FIN 46, as
originally issued, was effective immediately for VIEs created or
acquired after January 31, 2003. FIN 46-R delayed the
effective date of the interpretation to no later than
March 31, 2004, (for calendar-year enterprises), except for
Special Purpose Entities for which the effective date was
December 31, 2003.

The determination of whether CalGen or the purchaser of the
power in a long-term power sales or tolling agreement
consolidates a VIE is based on which variable interest holder
absorbs the majority of the risk of the VIE and is, therefore,
the primary beneficiary. An analysis was performed for CalGen
subsidiaries with significant long-term power sales or tolling
agreements. Certain of the CalGen subsidiaries were deemed to be
VIEs by virtue of a long-term power sales or tolling agreements.
CalGen qualitatively determined that power sales or tolling
agreements with a term for less than one-third of the
facility s remaining useful life or for less than 50 of
the entity s capacity would not cause the power purchaser
to be the primary beneficiary, due to the length of the economic
life of the underlying assets. As all of CalGen s contracts
are of this nature, CalGen is deemed to absorb a majority of the
entity s variability and, accordingly, continues to
consolidate the assets and liabilities of all of the projects.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (Continued) 

EITF 04-7 

An integral part of applying FIN 46-R is determining which
economic interests are variable interests. In order for an
economic interest to be considered a variable interest, it must
 absorb variability of changes in the fair value of
the VIE s underlying net assets.

Questions have arisen regarding (a) how to determine
whether an interest absorbs variability and (b) whether the
nature of how a long position is created, either synthetically
through derivative transactions or through cash transactions,
should affect the assessment of whether an interest is a
variable interest. Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 04-7: Determining Whether an Interest Is a
Variable Interest in a Potential Variable Interest Entity 
is still in the discussion phase but will eventually provide a
model to assist in determining whether an economic interest in a
VIE is a variable interest. The Task Force s discussions on
this Issue have centered on if the variability should be based
on whether (a) the interest absorbs fair value variability,
(b) the interest absorbs cash flow variability or
(c) the interest absorbs both fair value and cash flow
variability. While a consensus has not been reached, a majority
of the Task Force members generally support an approach that
would determine predominant variability based on the nature of
the operations of the VIE. Under this view, for financial
 VIEs, a presumption would exist that only interests that
absorb fair value variability would be considered
variable interests. Conversely, for non-financial (or
operating) VIEs, a presumption would exist that only interests
that absorb cash flow variability would be considered
variable interests. The final conclusions reached on this issue
may impact the Company s methodology used in making
quantitative and/or qualitative assessments of the variability
absorbed by the different economic interests holders in the
VIE s in which the Company holds a variable interest.
However, until the EITF reaches a final consensus, the effects
of this issue on the Company s financial statements is
indeterminable.

SFAS No. 151 

In November 2004, FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
 Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4 SFAS No. 151 ). This
Statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43 Inventory
Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of
idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted
material (spoilage). Paragraph 5 of ARB 43, Chapter 4,
previously stated that ... under some circumstances, items
such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double
freight and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require
treatment as current period charges... . This Statement
requires those items to be recognized as a current-period charge
regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so
abnormal. In addition, this Statement requires that
allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of
conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are
applicable to inventory costs incurred during fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2005. Adoption of this statement
is not expected to materially impact the Company s results
of operations or financial position.

SFAS No. 153 

In December 2004, FASB issued SFAS No. 153,
 Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions SFAS No. 153 ). This
standard eliminates the exception in APB No. 29 for
nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces
it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets
that do not have commercial substance. It requires exchanges of
productive assets to be accounted for at fair value, rather than
at carryover basis, unless (1) neither the asset received
nor the asset surrendered has a fair value that is determinable
within reasonable limits or (2) the transaction lacks
commercial substance (as defined). A nonmonetary exchange has
commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are
expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange.

Total depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was 151.7 million,
 121.0 million and 59.9 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2003, the property, plant and equipment
balances included the cost of certain turbines held in an
equipment company business unit that was included in the
consolidated financial statements. The value of the turbines was
approximately 119.6 million. On March 23, 2004, these
turbines were transferred to Calpine in a non-cash transaction
which reduced subordinated parent debt as they are not part of
the collateral in the 2004 Refinancing.

In March 2002, CalGen restructured its turbine agreements
including timing of deliveries and payment schedules. In
addition, a number of orders were cancelled. As a result of
these actions, CalGen recorded a cancellation and restructuring
charge of 115.1 million.

Buildings, Machinery, and Equipment This
component primarily includes electric power plants and related
equipment. Depreciation is recorded utilizing the straight-line
method over the estimated original composite useful life,
generally 35 years for baseload power plants, exclusive of
the estimated salvage value, typically 10 . Zion, which is a
peaking facility, is depreciated over 40 years, less the
estimated salvage value of 10 .

Major Maintenance The Company capitalizes
costs for major turbine generator refurbishments for the
 hot gas path section and compressor components,
which include such significant items as combustor parts (e.g.
fuel nozzles, transition pieces and baskets ),
compressor blades, vanes and diaphragms. These refurbishments
are done either under long term service agreements by the
original equipment manufacturer or by Calpine s Turbine
Maintenance Group. The capitalized costs are depreciated over
their estimated useful lives ranging from three to twelve years.
At December 31, 2004, the weighted average life was
approximately six years. The Company expenses annual planned
maintenance.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Construction in Progress Construction in
progress CIP is primarily attributable to
gas-fired power projects under construction including
prepayments on gas and steam turbine generators. Upon
commencement of plant operation, these costs are transferred to
the applicable property category, generally buildings, machinery
and equipment. The Pastoria Energy Center, which is expected to
commence Phase I operations in May 2005 and phase II
operations in June 2005, was the only facility under
construction at December 31, 2004. Compared to the previous
year, construction in progress decreased by approximately
 940 million as we completed construction and brought into
operation several facilities.

Capitalized Interest The Company capitalizes
interest on capital invested in projects during the advanced
stages of development and the construction period in accordance
with SFAS No. 34, Capitalization of Interest
Cost, SFAS No. 34 as amended by
SFAS No. 58, Capitalization of Interest Cost in
Financial Statements That Include Investments Accounted for by
the Equity Method (an Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 34) SFAS No. 58 ). For the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the total
amount of interest capitalized was 55.0 million,
 123.6 million and 236.4 million, respectively. Upon
commencement of plant operation, capitalized interest, as a
component of the total cost of the plant, is amortized over the
estimated useful life of the plant. The decrease in the amount
of interest capitalized during the year ended December 31,
2004 reflects the completion of construction for several power
plants.

Capitalized interest is computed using two methods:
(1) capitalized interest on funds borrowed for specific
construction projects and (2) capitalized interest on
general debt. For capitalization of interest on specific funds,
the Company capitalizes the interest cost incurred related to
debt entered into for specific projects under construction. The
methodology for capitalizing interest on general debt,
consistent with paragraphs 13 and 14 of
SFAS No. 34, Capitalization of Interest
Cost, begins with a determination of the borrowings
applicable to our qualifying assets. The basis of this approach
is the assumption that the portion of the interest costs that
are capitalized on expenditures during an asset s
acquisition period could have been avoided if the expenditures
had not been made. This methodology takes the view that if funds
are not required for construction then they would have been used
to pay off other debt. The Company uses its best judgment in
determining which borrowings represent the cost of financing the
acquisition of the assets. Prior to the 2004 Refinancing,
general debt consisted primarily of subordinated debt from our
Parent (the Subordinated Parent Debt ). The interest
rate is derived by dividing the total interest cost by the
average borrowings. This weighted average interest rate is
applied to our average qualifying assets in excess of specific
debt on which interest is capitalized.

Impairment Evaluation All long-lived assets,
such as property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for
impairment whenever there is an indication of a potential
reduction in fair value. Factors which could trigger an
impairment include significant underperformance relative to
historical or projected future operating results, significant
changes in how the Company uses the acquired assets or in its
overall business strategy and significant negative industry or
economic trends.

The determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on
an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the
assets, as compared to the carrying value of the assets. The
significant assumptions used in our undiscounted future cash
flow estimates include the future supply and demand
relationships for electricity and natural gas and the expected
pricing for those commodities as well as the resultant spark
spreads in the various regions where the Company generates. If
an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment loss
recognized would be determined by estimating the fair value of
the assets and recording a loss to the extent that the fair
value was less than the book value.

The Company s assessment regarding the existence of
impairment factors is based on market conditions, operational
performance and legal factors related to its projects. The
Company s review of factors present and the resulting
appropriate carrying value of long-lived assets are subject to
judgments and estimates that management is required to make. No
impairment charge has been recorded to date for any projects.
However,

future events could cause us to conclude that impairment
indicators exist and that long-lived assets might be impaired.

This three-year facility will be available for specified working
capital purposes, capital expenditures on Pastoria, and for
letters of credit. All amounts outstanding under the Revolving
Credit Facility will bear interest at either (i) the Base
Rate plus 250 basis points, or (ii) at LIBOR plus
350 basis points. Collateral for the Revolving Credit
Facility includes first priority security interests in the same
collateral securing the notes and term loans. This new facility
will require us to comply with various affirmative and negative
covenants including restrictions on our ability to incur new
debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, and sell our
assets. Certain other covenants require us to maintain a minimum
interest coverage ratio and a consolidated first priority and
second priority secured lien debt to kilowatt ratio. Fees
associated with the placing of the Revolving Credit Facility
amounted to approximately 7.5 million. Other fees,
including legal and professional fees amounted to approximately
 1.0 million. These fees are amortized over the life of the
facility. At December 31, 2004, there were no outstanding
borrowings under the facility and amortization of the fees for
the year ended December 31, 2004 was 1.9 million. In
addition, 190.0 million in letters of credit were issued
and outstanding at December 31, 2004. These letters of
credit were primarily issued to support fuel purchases and other
operational activities.

The Company also entered into a 750.0 million unsecured
subordinated working capital facility (the Working Capital
Facility with CalGen Holdings, Inc., our sole member.
Under the Working Capital Facility, the Company may borrow funds
only for specific purposes including claims under its business
interruption insurance with respect to any of the facilities or
a delay in the start up of the Pastoria facility; losses
incurred as a result of uninsured force major events; claims for
liquidated damages against third party contactors with respect
to the Goldendale and Pastoria facilities and spark spread
diminution after expiration of the three-year Index Hedge
agreement with Morgan Stanley Capital Group MSCG (see Note 10). Borrowings under the Working Capital
Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus 4.0 and interest will
be payable annually in arrears and will mature in 2019. The
Working Capital Facility is not part of the collateral that
secures the notes, the term loans, or the Revolving Credit
Facility and will not be available to the holders of the notes,
the term loans or the new Revolving Credit Facility upon a
foreclosure or available in a bankruptcy of the company. There
were no fees paid in connection with establishing the Working
Capital Facility. At December 31, 2004, there were no
outstanding borrowings under the Working Capital Facility.

Prior to the 2004 Refinancing, the Company s long-term debt
consisted of a revolving construction credit facility and the
Subordinated Parent Debt. The Construction Facility, established
in October 2000, was a four-year, non-recourse credit agreement
for 2,500.0 million with a consortium of banks. As of
December 31, 2003, the Company had 2,200.4 million in
borrowings and 53.2 million in letters of credit
outstanding under the facility. Borrowings under this facility
bore variable interest that was calculated based on a base rate
plus applicable margin ranging between 0.750 and 1.50 or LIBOR
plus an applicable margin ranging between 1.50 and 2.25 . The
interest rate at December 31, 2003 was 2.634 . The interest
rate ranged from 2.59 to 2.92 during 2003. The Construction
Facility was repaid and terminated on March 23, 2004 in
connection with the 2004 Refinancing. The Subordinated Parent
Debt was evidenced by a note agreement dated January 1,
2002. At December 31, 2003, the outstanding balance was
 4.6 billion. Under the debt subordination agreement,
interest payments to the Parent were not permissible until all
senior debt was liquidated. Accordingly, the interest on the
Subordinated Parent Debt has been treated as a non-cash
transaction and has been added back to net income for purposes
of computing cash flows from operations in the accompanying
statements of cash flows. Effective March 23, 2004 and in
connection with the 2004 Refinancing, the Parent converted the
Subordinated Parent Debt balance, which included accrued
interest, totaling 4.4 billion to equity as a non-cash
capital contribution.

In connection with a Raw Water Service Agreement Water
Agreement entered into with Contra Costa Water District
for raw water service through April 2015, Delta and Los Medanos

The above amounts have been estimated as of the respective
year-ends. When the Company files its tax returns, the amounts
may be adjusted.

At December 31, 2004, the net operating loss consists of
federal and state carryforwards of approximately
 1.7 billion which will expire between 2015 and 2024. The
realizability of the net deferred tax asset is evaluated
quarterly in accordance with SFAS No. 109, which
requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is
more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax
asset will not be realized. As a result, the Company has
provided a valuation allowance of 140.3 million and
 117.1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, and has not recognized income tax benefits for any
of the periods presented because it has experienced cumulative
operating losses. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, the valuation allowance increased by 23.2 million
and 84.7 million, respectively.

facilities entered into the WECC Fixed Price Gas Sale and Power
Purchase Agreement (the Fixed Price Agreement with
CES. Under these agreements, CES purchases substantially all of
the output for each facility (subject to certain exceptions for
direct sales to third parties) and sells or delivers to each
facility substantially all of the gas required for its
operations (subject to certain exceptions for gas purchases from
third parties).

Under the Fixed Price Agreement, CES purchases a total of
500 MW of capacity and associated energy from the Delta and
Los Medanos facilities for a fixed price. In addition, CES will
provide substantially all of the gas required to generate the
energy scheduled pursuant to this agreement. CES makes a net
payment of 3,615,346 (equivalent to 7.231/kW-month) each month
for power purchased and gas sold under this agreement. In
addition, CES makes variable operation and maintenance payments,
which are dependent on the amount of energy delivered and the
amount of operating time during on-peak hours. CES has the right
in its sole discretion to schedule deliveries of energy from
each facility up to its respective contracted capacity. However,
the fixed payment shall be payable in full whether or not
electricity deliveries have been scheduled, except for a
facility s failure to deliver. The Fixed Price Agreement is
in effect through December 31, 2009, unless terminated
earlier as permitted. Upon expiration or termination of the
agreement, all capacity and associated energy would
automatically be subject to the Index Based Agreement.

Under the Index Based Agreement, CES purchases the available
electric output of each facility not previously sold under
another long-term agreement. In addition, CES sells to each
facility substantially all of the gas required to operate.
Calpine guarantees CES s performance under this agreement,
which is in effect through December 31, 2013, unless
terminated earlier as permitted. Pursuant to the Index Based
Agreement, the Company s off-peak, peaking and power
augmentation products will be sold to CES at a fixed price
through December 31, 2013. In addition, all of our
remaining on-peak capacity will be sold to CES at a floating
spot price that reflects the positive difference (if any, but
never negative) between day-ahead power prices and day-ahead gas
prices using indices chosen to approximate the actual power
price that would be received and the actual gas price that would
be paid in the market relevant for each facility. Each month,
CES pays a net contract price for energy purchased and gas sold
under this agreement. The contract price will equal the sum of:

(1) an aggregate net payment for products provided during
on-peak periods calculated in accordance with the agreement, plus

(2) an aggregate fixed monthly payment for all other
products, including off-peak, peaking and power augmentation
products, generated by each facility, which will equal
 13,677,843, plus

(3) a total variable operation and maintenance payment for
the facilities (which will depend on the actual time the
facilities are operating and delivering energy from the capacity
subject to the Index Based Agreement), plus

(4) certain adjustments with respect to gas transportation
and electric transmission charges, minimum generation
requirements and certain power purchase arrangements, minus

(5) the amount paid under the Amoco Contract with respect
to the Morgan facility, plus

(6) the cost of gas supplied to support certain other power
purchase agreements and steam sale agreements (including, as
applicable, power and/or steam sold to certain facilities 
industrial hosts). The Index Based Agreement also provides for
the issuance of letters of credit under our revolving credit
facility which support certain gas supply agreements between
CES, the projects and third parties.

Prior to the 2004 Refinancing, certain power purchase and gas
sales agreements were accounted for as tolling agreements. Under
those previous agreements, fuel was provided to the facilities;
however, title to this fuel never transferred. Consistent with
the Company s historical accounting policies, revenues

Consolidated Statement of Operations. The new contracts executed
with CES on March 23, 2004 are not considered to be tolling

Master Operation and Maintenance Agreement 
Under the Master Operation and Maintenance Agreement (the
 O&M Agreement ), Calpine Operating Services
Company, Inc. COSCI provides all services
necessary to operate and maintain each facility (other than
major maintenance, which is not currently provided by COSCI
under the Maintenance Agreement as described under Master
Maintenance Services Agreement below, and general and
administrative services, which are provided as described under
 Administrative Services Agreement below). Covered
services include labor and operating costs and fees, routine
maintenance, materials and supplies, spare parts (except for
combustion turbine hot path spare parts), tools, shop and
warehouse equipment, safety equipment and certain project
consumables and contract services (including facility
maintenance, temporary labor, consultants, waste disposal,
corrosion control, fire protection, engineering and
environmental services), as well as procurement of water supply,
water treatment and disposal, waste disposal, electricity usage
and demand costs, fixed utility access, interconnection and
interconnection maintenance charges, gas and electric
transmission costs and emergency services.

All work and services performed under the O&M Agreement is
provided on a cost reimbursable basis plus reasonable overhead.
Costs payable to COSCI shall not, in the aggregate, exceed costs
for similar goods or services that would normally be charged by
unrelated third parties and shall in no event exceed the prices
that COSCI charges to unrelated third parties for such goods or
services. The O&M Agreement has an initial term of
10 years beginning March 23, 2004 and is automatically
extended for successive one-year periods thereafter until
terminated by either party.

Master Maintenance Services Agreement At
December 31, 2004, major maintenance services were provided
for under agreements with Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation
or General Electric Company. Under the Master Maintenance
Services Agreement (the Maintenance Agreement ),
COSCI will provide major maintenance services when agreements
with third parties are terminated. Until the third-party
agreements are terminated, COSCI will act as the administrator.
In addition, Calpine indemnifies the facilities for any costs or
expenses incurred in the termination of these third-party
maintenance agreements.

The Maintenance Agreement applies to major maintenance services,
such as turbine overhauls or other major maintenance events as
agreed upon by the parties, and is distinct from the O&M
Agreement (which provides routine operation and maintenance).
Under the Maintenance Agreement, COSCI provides periodic
inspection services relating to the combustion turbines for each
covered facility, including all labor, supervision and technical
assistance (including the services of an experienced maintenance
program engineer) necessary to provide these inspection
services. COSCI also provides new parts and repairs or replaces
old or worn out parts for the combustion turbines and will
provide technical field assistance, project engineers and
support personnel related to the performance of its services
under this agreement. The services under this agreement are to
be consistent with the annual operating plan for each facility
developed pursuant to the O&M Agreement. The Maintenance
Agreement was executed on March 23, 2004 and has an initial
term of 10 years. Calpine guarantees COSCI s
performance under the O&M Agreement as well as the
Maintenance Agreement.

Master Construction Management Agreement 
Under the Master Construction Management Agreement (the
 Construction Agreement ), Calpine Construction
Management Company, Inc. CCMCI manages the
construction of the Pastoria facility and the coordination of
the various construction and supply contracts. In addition,
CCMCI is responsible for the acceptance and commissioning of
Pastoria and its various subsystems as they are completed, for
starting up the facility and for running all performance and
acceptance tests. CCMCI is reimbursed for all project personnel
and third party costs incurred in connection with the
construction of the facility. The Construction Agreement is
effective until the final completion of the facility. Calpine
guarantees CCMCI s obligations under this agreement.

Administrative Services Agreement Under the
Administrative Services Agreement (the Administrative
Agreement ), Calpine Administrative Services Company, Inc. CASCI performs the following administrative
services: accounting, financial reporting, budgeting and
forecasting, tax, cash management, review of significant
operating and financial matters, contract administrative
services, invoicing, computer and information services and such
other administrative and regulatory filing services as may be
directed by us. We pay CASCI on a cost reimbursable basis,
including internal Calpine costs and reasonable overhead, for
services provided. The Administrative Agreement was executed on
March 23, 2004 and has an initial term of 10 years.
Calpine guarantees CASCI s obligations under this agreement.

Prior to the execution of these agreements on March 23,
2004, the Company and its subsidiaries were party to various
agreements with Calpine or a Calpine affiliate. Under the power
marketing and gas supply agreements, CES provided power
marketing and fuel management services, which were accounted for
as either a purchase and sale or as a tolling arrangement. In
addition, Calpine or a Calpine affiliate provided operation and
maintenance services, construction services and administrative
services under various agreements.

In addition to the above-discussed contractual relationships,
the Company has received a substantial portion of its
construction financing from the Parent. Effective March 23,
2004 and in connection with the 2004 Refinancing, the Parent
converted the Subordinated Parent Debt balance, which, including
accrued interest totaled 4.4 billion to equity as a
non-cash capital contribution.

 Derivative Instruments 

As an independent power producer primarily focused on generation
of electricity using gas-fired turbines, the Company s
natural physical commodity position is short fuel
(i.e., natural gas consumer) and long power (i.e.,
electricity seller). To manage forward exposure to price
fluctuations, the Company entered into a three-year Index Hedge
with MSCG. The Index Hedge will provide for semi-annual payments
to the Company if the aggregate spark spread amount calculated
under the Index Hedge for any six-month period during the term
of the Index Hedge is less than 50.0 million. The
semi-annual payment dates are March 31 and
September 30, beginning September 30, 2004. Based on
the aggregate spark spread calculation, no payment was made to
the Company under the Index Hedge on September 30, 2004.
The Company paid 45.0 million for the Index Hedge. The
amount paid includes a value of 38.3 million over the
estimated exercise value of the Index Hedge calculated based on
the Company internally developed models. The Company recorded
the valuation difference as a component of derivative assets. In
accordance with EITF 02-03, Issues Involved in
Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes
and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management
Activities the valuation difference is accounted for as a
deferred amount and amortized to income over the term of the
contract. The amount amortized for the year ended
December 31, 2004 was 5.6 million (realized expense).
The Index Hedge qualifies as a derivative under
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities but does not meet hedge
accounting requirements and, therefore, changes in the value are
recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. The
amount of unrealized loss associated with mark-to-market
activities amounted to 3.5 million.

 Commitments and Contingencies 

In addition to notes payable, term loans and other financings,
the Company has long-term service agreements, various operating
leases, operation and maintenance O agreements, and other commitments. The long-term service
agreements provide for parts and services related to the
performance of scheduled maintenance on combustion turbines at
the facilities. The terms of the agreements generally cover the
period from commercial operation of the project through the
twelfth scheduled outage for each combustion turbine. In some
agreements, the term is the earlier of sixteen years or twelve
scheduled outages. Maintenance schedules and payment schedules
are based on estimates of when maintenance will occur on the
various turbines based on the number of hours the turbines
operate. The actual timing of maintenance may vary based on
actual operating hours and starts versus estimated hours and
starts due to operational and performance considerations.
Operating leases primarily consist of land leases for the
facilities sites.

Litigation 

The Company is party to various litigation matters arising out
of the normal course of business. In the case of all known
contingencies, the Company accrues a liability when the loss is
probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. The ultimate
outcome of each of these matters cannot presently be determined,
nor can

the liability that could potentially result from a negative
outcome be reasonably estimated presently for every case. The
liability the Company may ultimately incur with respect to any
one of these matters in the event of a negative outcome may be
in excess of amounts currently accrued with respect to such
matters and, as a result of these matters, may potentially be
material to the Company s Consolidated Financial
Statements. As the Company learns new facts concerning
contingencies, the Company reassesses its position with respect
to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures.

Gary E. Jones, et al v. Calpine
Corporation On June 11, 2003, the Estate of
Darrell Jones and the Estate of Cynthia Jones filed a complaint
against Calpine in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Washington. Calpine purchased Goldendale
Energy, Inc., a Washington corporation, from Darrell Jones of
National Energy Systems Company NESCO ). The
agreement provided, among other things, that upon
 Substantial Completion of the Goldendale facility,
Calpine would pay Mr. Jones (i) the fixed sum of
 6.0 million and (ii) a decreasing sum equal to
 18.0 million less 0.2 million per day for each day
that elapsed between July 1, 2002, and the date of
Substantial Completion. Substantial Completion of the Goldendale
facility occurred in September 2004 and the daily reduction in
the payment amount reduced the 18.0 million payment to
zero. The complaint alleged that by not achieving substantial
completion by July 1, 2002, Calpine breached its contract
with Mr. Jones, violated a duty of good faith and fair
dealing, and caused an inequitable forfeiture. On July 28,
2003, Calpine filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The
court granted Calpine s motion to dismiss the complaint on
March 10, 2004. The Court denied the plaintiff s
subsequent motion for reconsideration and for leave to amend,
granted in part Calpine s motion for an award of
attorney s fees and entered judgment dismissing the action.
The plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the United States Court
of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit, where the matter is pending.
Briefing is complete. Oral argument has not yet been scheduled.
Calpine believes the facility reached Substantial Completion in
the second half of 2004. Calpine thereafter paid to or for the
benefit of the Jones Estate the fixed sum of 6 million,
which Calpine agreed it was obligated to pay upon Substantial
Completion whenever achieved.

Solutia Bankruptcy Solutia, Inc. (Decatur
Energy Center, LLC s Decatur steam host)
filed for bankruptcy on December 17, 2003. Effective
May 27, 2004, Solutia, Inc. rejected certain cogen
agreements relating to the sale of steam and supply of
electricity and entered a term sheet with Decatur confirming the
agreement of the parties with respect to property rights going
forward. By this term sheet, Decatur has secured all necessary
rights to continue operating the plant. The parties are in
active discussions to attempt to reach a negotiated settlement
on the rejection damage claim, but if such discussions are not
successful, Decatur maintains the right to litigate the amount
of the damage claim. The parties entered into an amended and
restated agreement setting forth their respective rights and
obligations going forward pursuant to the term sheet and the
bankruptcy court approved this agreement on June 30, 2004.
On November 19, 2004, Decatur and its affiliates filed
proofs of claim with the bankruptcy court totaling approximately
 383 million. Solutia is expected to contest these claims,
but has taken no action to date.

Panda Energy International, Inc., et al. v. Calpine
Corporation, et al. On November 5, 2003, Panda
Energy International, Inc. and certain related parties,
including PLC II, LLC, (collectively Panda filed suit against Calpine and certain of its affiliates in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas,
alleging, among other things, that the Company breached duties
of care and loyalty allegedly owed to Panda by failing to
correctly construct and operate the Oneta Energy Center Oneta ), which the Company acquired from Panda, in
accordance with Panda s original plans. Panda alleges that
it is entitled to a portion of the profits from Oneta and that
Calpine s actions have reduced the profits from Oneta
thereby undermining Panda s ability to repay monies owed to
Calpine on December 1, 2003, under a promissory note on
which approximately 38.6 million (including interest
through December 1, 2003) is currently outstanding and past
due. The note is collateralized by Panda s carried interest
in the income generated from Oneta, which achieved full
commercial operations in June 2003. Calpine filed a counterclaim
against Panda Energy

International, Inc. (and PLC II, LLC) based on a guaranty
and a motion to dismiss as to the causes of action alleging
federal and state securities laws violations. The court recently
granted Calpine s motion to dismiss, but allowed Panda an
opportunity to replead. The Company considers Panda s
lawsuit to be without merit and intends to vigorously defend it.
Discovery is currently in progress. The Company stopped accruing
interest income on the promissory note due December 1,
2003, as of the due date because of Panda s default in
repayment of the note.

In addition, the Company is involved in various other claims and
legal actions arising out of the normal course of its business.
The Company does not expect that the outcome of these
proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial
position or results of operations.

 For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company had an earnings- to-fixed-charges coverage
deficiency of approximately 99.2 million, primarily as a result of (1) increased interest
costs due to recent debt financings to support our growth, and (2) a decrease in average spark
spreads per megawatt-hour and higher fuel expense in 2004 as compared with the same period in
2003.
