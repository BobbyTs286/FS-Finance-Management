FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT
AMERICAN INDUSTRIES, LTD.

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

	American Industries, Ltd. ("Registrant" or "Company") was incorporated in 
Nevada on December 26, 1919, as Toquima Stores Company engaged in the business 
of operating a general store. The name was changed successfully to American 
Resources, Inc., American Health Service, Inc., G.W.Hume Industries, Inc., 
and on July 18, 1972, to American Industries, Ltd. It was not until 1978 
that Registrant came under the jurisdiction of the federal Securities Act of 
1933 and the Exchange Act of 1934, and registered its shares by filing Form 
10, having by that time acquired the requisite number of shareholders and 
capital assets making compliance mandatory under the regulatory Acts. 
Prior to that time, Registrant was exempt from the federal 
securities regulatory requirements.
 
Using the trading symbol AMII, Registrant traded on the NASDAQ over the 
counter market (OTC) in the seventies. In 1982, unable to comply with NASD 
requirements for continued listing, registrant was delisted from the OTC 
quotation service.
 	
Registrant has been variously engaged in many diverse businesses since 
inception, including the mining and exploration of minerals; leasing equipment; 
operating nursing homes; processing, canning and distributing foods; brokering 
residential and commercial mortgage loans; and selling and servicing products 
related to preserving the ecology. 

Since 1994, Registrant has been essentially dormant, supporting its financial 
needs through the private sale of promissory notes and donations of capital 
from those shareholders holding management positions with Registrant.

On July 25,1997, Zack Monroe, Chairman of the Board of Directors, President, 
Chief Executive Officer and Registrant's principal shareholder passed away. 
Mr. Monroe had been Registrant's Chief Executive Officer since 1970.

George Balis, a Director and Vice President, owning approximately 59 (as of 
this report date) of Registrants issued and outstanding shares of 
Common Stock became the Company's Chief Executive Officer. 

Resident's future plan is to concentrate its efforts to establish and provide
a business consulting service to American and European companies from its Las 
Vegas offices, and to establish and provide a business consulting service in 
conjunction with but subordinate to, its main objective of locating and 
acquiring interests in companies with proprietary products or service companies 
with significant income streams to support the plans of management. These plans
include locating investment opportunities which fully utilize Registrant's 
principal asset, an inventory of uncut gemstones (emeralds, rubies and 
sapphires) acquired by Registrant when it merged with Global Technologies, S.A.
("Global") on May 27, 1993.

There can be no assurances that Registrant's future plans are feasible or that
they can be achieved given the fact that past endevors of management to
establish a pattern of business consistant with its foregoing objectives has 
not met with success, and to date no mergers or acquisitions have been 
successfully consummated, and Registrant remains without any source of revenue.

The Articles of Incorporation for Global Technologies, SA were issued by the 
Grand Duche of Luxembourg, Identification Number 1989-40-00735. At the time
of the merger, all of Global's issued and outstanding shares of common stock 
were exchanged for 11,900,000 shares of Registrant's .10 par value Common 
Stock. At that time Registrant then had issued and outstanding an aggregate of 
20,000,445 shares of Common Stock. The sole shareholder of Global, George
Balis, received approximately 59 of Registrant's outstanding Common Stock. The
merger was intended as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to Section 368 of the
Internal Revenue Code.

By independent appraisal, Global's gemstones at the time of merger were 
deemed to have a fair market value in excess of 60,000,000, as uncut stones in
their natural state. It is not Registrant's intention to cut, polish and market 
its inventory of gemstones, nor to engage in the wholesale or retail jewelry 
business. Instead Registrant intends to hold the entire cache of uncut 
stones as a perennial source of reserve capital, and to utilize the gemstones
as collateral security for foreign and domestic companies requiring a source 
of credit enhancement. The laws of Luxembourg permit holding companies 
such as Global to utilize a 10:1 ratio uponthe issuance of bonds and a 
3:1 ratio upon the issuance on commercial paper (notes) against capital 
reserves. 

Management has seen a constant need in the commercial market for sources 
that can guarantee loans or guarantee banks issuing letters of credit for
companies seeking to borrow capital through regular banking channels or other 
institutional lenders. The business intended to be carried on by Registrant 
is very competitive on both continents. There are myriad private and public 
companies engaged in the same business as Registrant, and most have 
financial resources far greater than that of the Registrant, with a history 
of providing such services. Also, the nature of the type of business 
intended by Registrant requires that the Company be constantly on the alert for
fraudulent schemes as financially troubled borrowers may be desperate to find 
sources of credit enhancement. Accordingly, Registrant must expend significant 
time and money to investigate potential clients.

(/PAGE)
(PAGE)	
Additionally, Registrant plans to act as a "finder" in seeking out European 
sources of capital for private and public companies located in the United 
States utilizing both private and institutional European lenders, as well as 
European stock brokers to buy, sell and trade Registrant's securities in the 
foreign market to foreign nationals, as and when a trading market in the United 
States can be established for Registrant's securities. There can be no 
assurances that management's plans will or can be achieved. 

At the time of the merger with Global, to the present date, neither Registrant ]
nor Global has had sufficient operating revenues to fulfill combined cash flow 
needs of both companies. As a consequence, both companies have required 
direct financial aid from Registrant's controlling stockholders. Presently, 
Registrant has no income.

Registrant has no full time employees receiving a salary.Registrant's offices 
since February, 1998, have been located at Bank of America Center, Suite 1212, 
101 Convention Center Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89109, telephone number 
(702) 944-1388. 

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Registrant's administrative offices are in Las Vegas, Nevada, which also 
contains the United States offices of Global. Neither Registrant nor Global 
owns any real estate here or abroad. Registrant's administrative offices 
contain approximately 500 square feet at an monthly rental of 500, pursuant 
to a month-to-month sub-lease with an affiliated Company owned by one of 
Registrant's directors. Global also maintains small, unattended office in 
Athens, Greece on a month-to-month basis.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Neither Registrant nor it's wholly owned subsidiary, nor the directors or 
officers of either entity, are parties to any pending or threatened 
legal proceedings. 

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

Registrant's regular annual shareholders' meeting was held on September 15, 
1997 in Las Vegas, Nevada, pursuant to written notice required by Registrant's 
By-laws and Nevada Revised Statutes Section 78.010. Proxies to elect 
directors were solicited by management pursuant to Regulation 14A under 
the Securities Exchange Act. All nominees were duly elected. The record date 
for stockholders to vote at the meeting was established as September 5, 1997. 

The matters submitted to the stockholders and voted upon, together with the 
votes cast is as follows:

Directors Nominated and Elected: (1)

	Name			 Votes For		 Votes Against Abstentions
	George Balis		 15,765,638			 0			 0
	Mary E. Kinn		 15,765,638			 0			 0
	Joe Ortiz		 15,765,638			 0 			0 	
	William E. Powell	 342,731		 15,422,907			 0
	Gordon J. Margulis	 342,731 		15,422,907			 0	

Notes: Registrant sought proxies for Zack C. Monroe, George Balis, Mary Kinn, 
William E. Powell, Jr. and Gordon J. Margulis. Mr. Monroe passed away on 
July 25, 1997 and his name was withdrawn. Mr. Ortiz was nominated from the 
floor and elected.

No other matters requiring shareholder approval were submitted at the Annual 
Meeting. 

PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED 
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

There is no established trading market for any class of Registrant's common 
equity stock or that of its wholly owned subsidiary.

(Detailed audited financial statements are reported herein beginning on page 11,
Exhibit F-1.)

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
	
The Company's source of revenue for the years ended March 31, 1997 and 1996 
was the performance of financial and accounting services for small companies.
It also received interest income. During the current year ended March 31,
1998, the Company had no income.

LIQUIDITY

The Company's President, Zack Monroe, passed away on July 25, 1997. Since 
that time, the Company has had very little income or cash receipts. The 
then Vice President, George Balis, was subsequently appointed as President.
The lack of income production has put the Company into a negative 
cash flow position. Currently the overhead bills are paid by the President
and board members.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

As explained above, the Company has no current cash resources. The investments
listed on the balance sheet are not liquid and will provide no immediate 
relief from the negative cash flow.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
	
The statements show very little revenue from services related activities for the
years ended March 31, 997 and 1996, 45,000 for 1997 and 2,689 for 1996.
These amounts reflect the efforts of the then President, Zack Monroe, to 
service the existing client base, approximately 75 clients. Since the death 
of Mr. Monroe, this income stream has dropped off substantially. Not only 
did the President pass away, but also the Company's staff, which supported the 
client services,has left the employment of the Company. During the year just 
ended March 31, 1998 the Company had no revenue. Unless the current client 
base can be serviced adequately and promptly it is expected 
that the Company's clients will seek another provider for their financial
services. The current President has made efforts to hire staff to 
regain some of the service revenue that was generated in previous years. His 
efforts are being hampered by the lack of cash currently in the Company. No
assurances can be made that the President's efforts will prove successful. No
assurances can be made that the Company will ever have operations again.

DISCLOSURE

independent accountant previously engaged by Registrant to audit Registrant's

a reluctance to stand for re-election after completion of the current audit.

stock rights issued. It is not anticipated that Registrant will pay salaries 
or other remuneration to any such persons until and unless Registrant 
derives profits from its operations.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

To the Board of Directors,
American Industries, Ltd.
Las Vegas, Nevada

I have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American 
Industries, Ltd. and its subsidiary as of March 31, 1998 and 1997, and the 
accompanying statements of stockholders' equity, operations and cash flows for 
the three years ended March 31, 1998. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. My responsibility is to express 
an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit.

I conducted my audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. 
Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. I believe that my audit provides a 
reasonable basis for my opinion.

In my opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American 
Industries, Ltd. as of March 31, 1998 and 1997, the results of operations 
and cash flows for the three years ended March 31, 1998 in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

The statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue in
existence. The Company currently has no operations, no income and is dependent 
upon current management to cover administrative expenses with loans to the 
Company. Management is currently attempting to merge with an operational 
company. No assurance can be amde that a merger will happen. No assurances can 
be made that current management will continue to pay for administrative 
expenses. The debts listed on the balance sheet for March 31, 1998 are all 
to current management as explained. No adjustments have been made to the 
financial statements for the liquidation of the assets or debts.

Notes to the Consolidated Statements

Note 1		The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The Company is a holding company organized under the laws of Nevada in 1919. 
The Company`s subsidiary, Global Technologies S.A. was organized as a European 
Company under the laws of the Grand Duche of Luxembourg. The consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles applicable in the United States of America and are 
stated in United States dollars. The Company's former president, Zack Monroe,
died on July 25, 1997. This has caused the services of the Company to be 
halted. Mr. George Balis, the then Vice President, was subsequently elected
as President and has been trying to arrange the continuation of the company.

Principals of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and 
its subsidiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated.
	
Investments in other companies where ownership is less than 20 are carried on 
the balance sheet using the cost method of accounting. 

Earnings Per Share 
Earnings per share is computed on the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the year.

Note 2		Acquisitions

Global Technologies S.A. under acquisition agreement became a subsidiary of the 
company. Initially the authorized capital of the Luxembourg company was 500,000
shares of stock at 1000 Francs (LUF) per share, 120,000 shares are issued and 
outstanding, fully paid and non assessable, with capital reserve in gem 
investments. By decision of a meeting of shareholders held December 29, 1995 
the par value of Global Technologies S.A. has been reduced to 250 LUF per 
share. 120,000 shares are still issued and outstanding, fully paid and non-
assessable. The decision to reduce the authorized capital was made to reduce 
taxes and other expenses in Luxembourg. Global Technologies S.A. operates 
under the status of a holding company under Luxembourg Law with the use 
of financial assets with historical perpetual value operating in 
conformity with the Grand Duche of Luxembourg Decree of December 17, 1938.

		Investment in Stock

on the balance sheet using the cost method of accounting for investments.

		Investments Gems

The Company has listed under Investments investment quality gems, (emeralds and 
rubies). These stones are uncut. Uncut gems do not fluctuate in value like the
cut stones do because of daily market conditions. Their value is more constant.
These gems are owned by the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Global Technol-
ogies.The Company purchased Global Technologies in 1993. The historic basis of
the gemstone on the books of Global was carried over for the basis of the
gemstones once the merger was effected. Purchase accounting was utilized in 
this merger. Notwithstanding that purchase accounting was utilized as directed 
by GAAP, the gemstones were not given a step up in basis. That is because their
historic basis was approximate to their fair market value at the time of the 
merger. The gemstones were also appraised. Periodically the gems are 
reappraised to assure management that the value placed on this investment 
is correct. Most recently, an appraisal was completed by Mr. Marco Vesters.
Certified Gemmologist, member of The Gemmological Association of Great Britain,
license number D-7127.

The gems are physically located in a bank vault in Las Vegas, Nevada. The 
Company's subsidiary Global Technologies plans to utilize these assets to 
establish a relationship with a correspondent bank in Europe. With 
this relationship Global plans to issue letters of credit and other 
services for European companies.

Note 7 Dependency on President

Company for the last several months. He has worked to rid the Company of 
investments and programs that were not profitable. he has infused monies and
sought out loans from other principals to pay the Company's administrative 
expenses. He is also active in pursuing a suitable merger candidate. Without
his abilities the Company would have a difficult time continuing in existence.
