 Overview 

 We are a medical products company engaged in: 

the
design, development, manufacture and marketing of percutaneous vessel introducers, safety needles and related vascular delivery products;
 the
design, development, manufacture and marketing of implantable stimulation leads, lead delivery systems, and lead accessories for cardiac rhythm management,
neuromodulation, and hearing restoration markets; and
 the
manufacture of medical devices and components for other medical product companies on a contract basis. 

We
were incorporated under the laws of the State of Minnesota on August 24, 1981 under the name "MNM Enterprises, Inc." In March 1988, we changed our name to
Medamicus, Inc. and operated under that name until February 1, 2004. On February 2, 2004 we changed our name to Enpath Medical, Inc. Our office is located at 15301 Highway
55 West, Plymouth, Minnesota 55447-1418 and our telephone number is (763) 559-2613. 

 At
the beginning of 2001, we were operating in two distinct operating segments: The Delivery Systems Division and the Gynecology Division. On April 25, 2001, we sold the
Gynecology Division to CooperSurgical, Inc. for approximately 4.7 million, recognizing a gain of approximately 2.9 million on the sale. 

 In
October 2002, we purchased substantially all of the operating assets of BIOMEC Cardiovascular Inc. ("BCI"). The acquired assets of BCI are now held by Enpath Lead
Technologies, Inc. ("ELT", also referred to as our "Lead Technologies Division"), a newly created wholly-owned subsidiary of Enpath Medical, Inc. Our 2003 consolidated financial results
include the financial results of ELT from October 24, 2003 to the end of 2003. ELT develops and manufactures implantable stimulation leads, lead delivery systems, and lead accessories for
cardiac rhythm management, neuromodulation and hearing restoration markets. Its products are also sold through OEM relationships with other medical device companies. The ELT office is located at 7452
West 78 th Street, Minneapolis, MN 55439-2513, and its telephone number is 952-943-1189. 

 Following
the acquisition, Enpath Medical, Inc. is comprised of two operating divisions: The Delivery Systems Division (formerly Medamicus, Inc.) and the Lead Technologies
Division (formerly BCI). The divisions are aggregated into one reportable segment: the manufacture and sale of medical devices. The divisions have similar technology, manufacturing, customers and
regulatory activities and we expect to jointly conduct sales and marketing and research and development activities, where appropriate, to take advantage of similarities in customers and product
development. 

 Products 

 Delivery Systems Division We manufacture and market a family of percutaneous venous vessel introducers with proprietary features, as well as our own
proprietary valved introducer. Vessel
introducers enable physicians to create a conduit through which they can insert infusion catheters, implantable ports and pacemaker leads into a blood vessel. 

 In
order to introduce a catheter or pacemaker lead into a vein, a hypodermic needle is first used to access the vessel. A guide wire is then inserted through the hypodermic needle and
the needle is removed. A vessel introducer, consisting of a hollow sheath and a dilator, is then inserted over the 

 3 

guide
wire to expand the opening. The guide wire and dilator are then removed, leaving only the hollow sheath through which the catheter or pacemaker lead is introduced. Once the catheter or pacemaker
lead is in place, the vessel introducer sheath is usually removed. This process is typically done by "peeling" the introducer in half or slitting it off, in the case of our proprietary introducer. 

 We
manufacture and market both peelable introducers and our own proprietary slitter introducer in a variety of sizes and market them either (1) in a kit that contains the
disposable devices necessary to do catheter or lead implant procedures, or (2) in bulk for packaging by the customer with its own devices. 

 We
also design, manufacture and market guiding and articulating, or "steerable", introducers. These "advanced delivery systems" are used by our customers to deliver therapeutic catheters
to specific sites in the body. We are currently working with twelve companies providing a delivery system for each of their particular therapies as they go through their development cycle. If the
customer is successful in commercializing its therapy, we will be the manufacturer of its delivery system device. We expect to continue to expand this portion of our business. 

 In
August 2000, we entered into an agreement with Med-Design Corporation for the right to manufacture and distribute Med-Design's center-line
retractable Safety Seldinger Introducer Needle (the "Safety Needle") exclusively in the venous access market and, in September 2001, amended the agreement to gain exclusive rights to the
arterial access market. The Safety Needle can be retracted into a protective sheath while still in the patient, greatly reducing the possibility of a needle stick after the needle has been in contact
with a patient's blood. There are estimated to be over 1,000,000 accidental needle sticks in the United States each year. On November 6, 2000, the President signed the Needlestick Safety and
Prevention Act (the "Act"). The Act directed OSHA to revise its Bloodborne Pathogens Standard to set forth in greater detail and make more specific OSHA's requirement for employers to identify,
evaluate and implement safer medical devices. Most procedures conducted by nurses have transitioned to sharps protected needles. Procedures conducted by physicians, such as the ones our needle is
designed for, have been slower to transition to safety devices. We expect these physician procedures will be the next area to be addressed. 

Lead Technologies Division Our primary product line is our permanent, sutureless, epicardial (MyoPore leads, both bipolar and unipolar, which are
used in both post
open-heart surgery patients and in cardiac resynchronization therapy ("CRT") procedures for heart failure. This epicardial lead technology has been on the market since 1989 and has been
used in more than 20,000 implants worldwide. The CRT procedure for congestive heart failure is a relatively new procedure in which one of the lead wires needs to be positioned in a small vein on the
left side of the heart, sometimes a very difficult place to reach. In 10 - 20 of these cases, the lead cannot be effectively placed transvenously, in
which case the patient is taken to a surgical suite where a lead is placed on the outside of the heart. We manufacture one of two leads most often used for this application. 

 We
also provide a (FasTac implant tool in every MyoPore lead package to facilitate surgical placement of the leads onto the surface of the heart. The unique design of the
implant tool allows for a quick, one-handed motion for release of the lead after attachment. The distal end of the tool is designed to provide simple and fast regrasping, reloading, and
repositioning of the lead, if necessary. 

 Adaptors
are necessary when a connector on a pacing lead wire from one generation of pacemaker needs to be connected to a pacemaker from a newer generation. Although pacing lead wires
are intended to stay in the body forever, pacemakers need to be exchanged every five to ten years as batteries expire. Due to the advent of multi-polar lead technology and multi-chamber pacing and
defibrillation, the international standard for connectors has been under review in order to accommodate this new technology. We anticipate the international connector standard, currently
IS-1, 

 4 

to
change at the end of 2004, again creating a long-term mismatch in old and new connectors. We currently produce four models of IS-1 implantable adapters. 

 Markets and Marketing 

 Delivery Systems Division We estimate that there are approximately 4,000,000 central venous and peripheral access procedures performed worldwide each year
that use venous vessel
introducers. Because the majority of vessel introducers are sold in combination with the sale of infusion catheters, implantable ports or pacing leads, we identified an opportunity to market our
vessel introducer with the catheters, implantable ports or pacing leads of other medical device manufacturers. Accordingly, we have entered into agreements with Medtronic, Inc. and with Bard
Access Systems, a subsidiary of C. R. Bard, Inc., for the inclusion of our introducers in kits sold in their respective markets. 

 We
believe Medtronic has the largest worldwide market share of pacing leads. Medtronic is currently purchasing our sterilized introducer kits, which include a syringe, hypodermic needle
and guide wire, as well as the vessel introducer, and are packaged by us in boxes designed by Medtronic. Medtronic markets our vessel introducer with the slitting device worldwide under its own trade
name,
"SOLO-TRAK ". We also manufacture and package a peelable introducer in similar kits for Medtronic. 

 In
October 2002, we entered into a five-year supply agreement with Medtronic that superceded all previous supply agreements between the companies. The agreement named
us as exclusive supplier of all standard right-side pacing procedure kits. There are no minimum purchase obligations associated with the agreement, but Medtronic is obligated to purchase
all of its requirements for certain introducer procedure kits from us. 

 For
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, Medtronic accounted for 44 , 67 and 76 and a second customer accounted for 18 , 13 and 10 of our sales from continuing
operations. Because of the acquisition of BCI and the additional customers that it serves, we anticipate that sales to Medtronic will be 30 or less of our consolidated sales in 2004. 

 There
are approximately four million needles used each year in venous access procedures and another 10-14 million used in arterial access procedures. In the
venous markets, needles are typically included in a kit with the other components necessary to conduct a medical procedure. Under the terms of our supply agreement, Medtronic offers our safety needle
in its procedural kits for United States distribution in the pacing lead market. 

 We
believe our current OEM strategy for introducers is a logical distribution method for the safety needle in the venous market. In the arterial market, needles are typically sold in
individual sterile packages. We have entered into a distributor agreement with Cook Incorporated to distribute the needle in the United States in individual packages. Cook will commence marketing of
the safety needle early in 2004. 

 Lead Technologies Division We estimate that approximately 50,000 CRT procedures were conducted in 2003, and in 10 - 20 of those cases an
epicardial lead placement
was necessary to complete this procedure. We estimate that CRT procedures will grow more than five-fold over the next five years. Two of the three major pacing companies offer our lead and
implant tool when marketing their products for these procedures. 

 Our
primary customers for our leads, delivery systems and adapters include the three major cardiac rhythm management ("CRM") companies: Medtronic, Guidant, Inc. and
St. Jude Medical, Inc. We also package accessory products for St. Jude Medical and perform packaging and contract manufacturing for a number of other companies. We sell adaptors
to all three major pacing companies 

 5 

and
we are poised to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the adoption of the new connector standard. Our products are sold to our OEM customers by our sales people. 

Competition 

 Delivery Systems Division Our vessel introducers compete with other peel-away vessel introducers manufactured by competitors. We believe that the five
major competitors in the
venous introducer market are Cook Incorporated, Bloomington, Indiana; Daig Corporation, Minnetonka, Minnesota (owned by St. Jude Medical, Saint Paul, Minnesota); B. Braun of America
Company, Allentown, Pennsylvania; Pressure Products, Inc., San Pedro, California; and TFX Medical, a subsidiary of Teleflex Incorporated, Jaffrey, New Hampshire. Daig, B. Braun, Pressure
Products and TFX Medical market their vessel introducers primarily by establishing distribution arrangements with existing companies in the medical field, which is the same strategy that we follow.
Cook markets a variety of vessel introducer kits through distributors and with a direct sales force. Many of these competitors are significantly larger and have significantly greater resources than we
have, including financial, technical, research and marketing. 

 While
there are many needle manufacturers in the United States, we believe that Merit Medical Systems and B. Braun are the only companies other than Enpath that have an
FDA-approved device for guidewire introducer applications in the venous and arterial access markets that meet the requirements of the Needlestick Safety and Protection Act. 

Lead Technologies Division Our primary competitors in providing stimulation leads and adapters to OEM customers in the CRM market are Oscor Inc., and
Osypka GMBH. Oscor, with its
facility in Florida, and Osypka GMBH located in Germany, both have lines of pacing leads, adapters and other electrophysiology devices that they sell to major CRM companies, and also to end users
through their own distributors worldwide. 

 Research Development 

Delivery Systems Division Over the past year, we have significantly increased our product development activities in order to broaden and improve our
venous vessel introducer product
offering and to expand our customer base. We believe that the trend towards less invasive surgical procedures will increase demand for vessel introducers and delivery systems. We intend to increase
our research and development spending in 2004 as we continue to work on development of a number of introducer products and enhancements to our existing products. There can be no assurance that our
development efforts will result in additional revenue. Although we have utilized outside specialists on a contract basis and expect to continue to do so, our research and development activities have
been carried out primarily by our employees. For years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we spent 1.76 million, 1.66 million and 1.16 million, respectively, on
research and development activities directly related to introducer, safety needle and delivery system products. 

 Lead Technologies Division We are engaged in several research and development programs related to new CRM leads, adapters, and delivery systems. We are
developing a proprietary articulating
introducer specifically designed for surgical placement of our epicardial leads in heart-failure patients undergoing CRT. This new tool is designed to allow surgeons better control for lead placement
on the left ventricular epicardial surface of the heart. We are also developing a new version of our MyoPore epicardial lead that will incorporate an anti-inflammatory drug, or steroid,
into the lead head. We expect that testing 

 6 

will
demonstrate that the drug improves the performance of the lead by reducing impedance and chronic pacing thresholds. 

 We
are also developing IS-4 adapters that will adapt current style IS-1 leads and IPG/ICD systems (pacemakers and defibrillators) to new IS-4
compatible leads and IPG/ICD systems. The IS-4 standard is still in development and is expected to be adopted by the major CRM manufacturers by late 2004. We have been involved with the
AAMI Pacemaker Connector Standards Committee that has been working on the new IS-4 connector standard over the past four years, and we are current members of that committee. We intend to
supply selected IS-4 adapters to the CRM industry after the connector standard has been finalized. Our research and development expenditures were 223,000 from October 24, 2003 to
December 31, 2003, which is included in our 2003 consolidated results. For all of 2003, our research and development costs totaled 692,000. 

We
anticipate incurring substantial research and development costs in the first half of 2004 related to gaining FDA approval for our lead with the anti-inflammatory steroid.
For all of 2004, we are planning on spending approximately 1.8 million to continue the development of these products. While we believe that these three projects will reach technological
feasibility, because of the risks associated with the commercial viability of these products, there can be no assurance that these projects will actually achieve commercialization. These risks include
the delay or failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or the failure to achieve market acceptance. 

 Contract Manufacturing 

 Delivery Systems Division Since October 1985, we have performed contract manufacturing services for a variety of medical device companies in the
Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan
area, and currently manufacture two medical products for one company and one medical product for another company. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, contract manufacturing
revenues were approximately 5 of sales from continuing operations. We expect contract manufacturing revenues for 2004 to be less than 5 of our overall revenue. 

Lead Technologies Division We also perform contract development and manufacturing for medical device OEM customers, primarily in the fields of CRM and
Neuromodulation. In 2003, over 65 of
our revenue came from contract manufacturing and packaging activities. We anticipate the percent of sales related to contract manufacturing will decline in the years ahead as we focus our sales
efforts on increasing sales of our proprietary products. 

 Suppliers 

Delivery Systems and Lead Technologies Divisions We currently purchase, and will in the future purchase, components and raw materials from outside
vendors. Although we have identified alternative suppliers for
key components and raw materials, at the present time we generally use one source of supply for each component and raw material. Each supplier of raw material for the vessel introducers we sell to
Medtronic is subject to the approval of Medtronic, and future customers may have a right of approval as well. At present, Medtronic has approved all of the applicable suppliers. Should a key supplier
be unwilling or unable to supply any such component or raw material in a timely manner, or should approval of a proposed supplier be delayed, withheld or withdrawn, we could experience delays in
obtaining alternative suppliers, which
may adversely affect our business. 

 7 

Government Regulation 

Delivery Systems and Lead Technologies Divisions The medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by the FDA and, in some instances,
 by state and foreign authorities. Pursuant to the
Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and related regulations, medical devices intended for human use are classified into three categories (Classes I, II
and III), depending upon the degree of regulatory control to which they will be subject. Our introducer products are considered Class II devices. Our lead wires are considered Class III
devices. 

 If
a Class II device is substantially equivalent to an existing device that has been continuously marketed since the effective date of the 1976 Amendments, FDA requirements may be
satisfied through a Premarket Notification Submission (510(k)) under which the applicant provides product information supporting its claim of substantial equivalence. In a 510(k) Submission, the FDA
may also require that it be provided with clinical test results demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the device. Generally, Class III devices are devices that must receive
pre-market approval by the FDA to ensure their safety and effectiveness. They are typically life-sustaining, life supporting, or implantable devices. Pre-market
approval (PMA) is a more rigorous approval process typically requiring human clinical studies. 

 As
a manufacturer of medical devices, we are also subject to certain other FDA regulations, and our manufacturing processes and facilities are subject to continuing review by the FDA to
ensure compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices regulations. We believe that our manufacturing and quality control procedures substantially conform to the requirements of FDA regulations. In
addition, our sales and marketing practices are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to federal anti-kickback laws, and are also
subject to similar state laws. 

 Our
devices may also be subject to regulation in foreign countries in order to conduct business in the European Community. Medtronic, Bard Access, St. Jude Medical, Guidant and
any other entity with whom we would develop a distribution relationship, are responsible for obtaining approval from the foreign countries in which they desire to sell the vessel introducers
manufactured by us. On March 11, 1999, we received our ISO 9001 certification and also received a European Community certificate,
allowing us to place the CE Mark on our products for sale in Europe. Should we elect to use independent distributors in countries outside the European Community, we may be responsible for obtaining
approval to sell in those countries. 

 Intellectual Property 

 Delivery Systems Division We have made and continue to make, when appropriate, efforts to obtain patents on new products and improvements to existing
products. We have nine U.S. patents on
various aspects of introducer and delivery systems and a number of additional applications pending or in process. 

 Due
to the rapid technological changes experienced in the medical device industry, we believe that the improvement of existing products, reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented
proprietary know-how and the development of new products are generally as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. 

 Lead Technologies Division We have nine U.S. patents covering certain aspects of myocardial leads and introducers, steroid eluting myocardial leads, and
other leads and lead features for
CRM applications. We also have eleven registered trademarks, in the U.S. and Europe, related to our MyoPore leads, FasTac introducers and other endocardial leads (Actifix and
Conifix not currently in distribution. We also have several 

 8 

invention
disclosures and one provisional patent related to leads, delivery systems and other lead related technologies. 

 Employees 

 As of March 15, 2004, our Delivery Systems Division employed 133 persons, consisting of 130 full-time employees and 3
part-time employees, while our Lead Technologies Division employed 91 persons, consisting of 90 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee.

(1) Years
prior to 2001 have been restated to reflect only sales and operating income from continuing operations. All sales, gross profit and expenses related to the Gynecology Division
are included in income (loss) from discontinued operations. 
 11 

(2) Years
prior to 2001 reflect no income tax expense due to the utilization of net operating tax loss carry-forwards. 2001 also includes recognition of benefit of unutilized net
operating tax loss carry-forwards of 923,000.
 (3) Results
for 2001 include gain on sale of Gynecology Division of 2,896,610 and income from discontinued segment of 182,012.
 (4) Results
for 2003 include financial results from the BCI acquisition beginning October 24, 2003. Included in these results are the write-off of purchased
in-process research and development costs of 2,650,000.
 (5) Balance
sheets for years prior to 2001 include assets and liabilities of the Gynecology Division.
 (6) The
comparable pro forma net income from continuing operations would have been 819,750 or .20 per diluted share in 1999, 979,442 or .22 per diluted share in 2000 and 2,160,949 or
 .47 per diluted share in 2001. The pro forma amounts ignore the income (loss) from discontinued operations (1999-2001), the 923,000 income tax benefit recognized in 2001 and applies a
38 tax rate on income for those three years.

Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Overview We are a medical products company engaged in: 

the
design, development, manufacture and marketing of percutaneous vessel introducers, safety needles and related vascular delivery products;
 the
design, development, manufacture and marketing of implantable stimulation leads, lead delivery systems, and lead accessories for cardiac rhythm management,
neuromodulation, and hearing restoration markets; and
 the
manufacture of medical devices and components for other medical product companies on a contract basis. 

At
the beginning of 2001, we were operating in two distinct operating segments: the Delivery Systems Division and the Gynecology Division. On April 25, 2001, we sold the
Gynecology Division to CooperSurgical, Inc. for approximately 4.7 million, recognizing a gain of approximately 2.9 million on the sale. We continued to manufacture catheters and
monitors for CooperSurgical until December 2001, when we transferred the manufacturing responsibilities to it. As a result, we have reported the results of the Gynecology Division as
discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 and prior years. We used approximately 1.6 million of the proceeds to pay off our outstanding debt and focused on increasing
the profitability of our existing products, as well as the development and acquisition of new products. 

 On
October 23, 2003, we completed our acquisition of the operating assets of BCI from BIOMEC Inc. and began to operate the BCI business through our wholly-owned subsidiary,
Enpath Lead Technologies, Inc. ("ELT"). We paid 18 million less assumed liabilities of approximately 1.0 million plus a working capital adjustment of 897,495. In addition, we
will make a contingent payment of 3,032,454 on March 31, 2004, based on the final 2003 sales results of the acquired BCI business. There is also a second contingent payment due on
March 31, 2005, which is based on the increase in proprietary sales in 2004 over 2003, that we estimate will be in the range of 6 to 10 million. We have included ELT's results in our
consolidated financial statements from October 24, 2003 to December 31, 2003. 

 Following
the acquisition, Enpath Medical, Inc. is comprised of two operating divisions: The Delivery Systems Division ("DSD", formerly Medamicus, Inc.) and the Lead
Technologies Division ("LTD", ELT, formerly BCI). The divisions are aggregated into one reportable segment: the manufacture and sale of medical devices. The divisions have similar technology,
manufacturing, customers and regulatory activities and we expect to jointly conduct sales and marketing and research and development activities, where appropriate, to take advantage of similarities in
customers and product development. Our revenues are primarily derived from the design, development, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. 

 Our
consolidated 2003 revenue was 19.6 million, consisting of 17.1 million from DSD and 2.5 million from LTD for the period from October 24 through
December 31, 2003. Revenue at DSD was down 824,000 compared to 2002 primarily due to the 3.0 million drop in LVLDS kit and accessory sales to Medtronic, off-set in part by
increased sales of new products to new customers. 

 Our
consolidated 2003 gross profit was 8.0 million, consisting of 7.2 million from DSD and 734,000 from LTD for the period from October 24 through
December 31, 2003. Gross profit at DSD was down 1.1 million compared to 2002 primarily due to the loss of the high gross profit LVLDS kit and accessory sales to Medtronic. 

 Our
consolidated 2003 expenses were 7.7 million, consisting of 4.4 million from DSD and 3.3 million from LTD. DSD increased spending on research and
development and sales and marketing 

 13 

activities
in 2003 as they continued to develop new products and build an internal sales team. DSD general and administrative costs were higher, primarily due to increased investor relations
activities, as well as increased costs associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. The 3.3 million of expenses from LTD included a one-time charge of 2.7 million to
write off the purchased in-process research and development associated with the purchase of BCI. 

As
a result, we had net income of 309,000 or .06 per diluted share in 2003, compared to 2,859,000 or .57 per diluted share in 2002. See the table below for a more complete summary.

consisted only of the Delivery Systems Division 

 Delivery Systems Division We manufacture and market a family of percutaneous venous vessel introducers with proprietary features, as well as our own
proprietary valved introducer. Vessel
introducers enable physicians to create a conduit through which they can insert infusion catheters, implantable ports and pacemaker leads into a blood vessel. 

In
addition to this core traditional introducer product line, we have developed and manufacture "advanced delivery" introducers that have "fixed curve" or articulating distal tip
sections that can be manipulated to enable the health care professional to access parts of the patient's anatomy (such as the left ventricle of the heart) that cannot be reached by traditional
introducers. These sophisticated advanced delivery introducers are designed and manufactured to meet the unique needs of each procedure being performed. 

 14 

We
also manufacture safety products, primarily a safety needle that can be retracted into a protective sheath while still in the patient, greatly reducing the possibility of a needle
stick and infection to the health care professional after the needle has been in contact with a patient's blood. 

 Finally,
we perform contract manufacturing and engineering services under which we design and manufacture products at our facilities to third party customer specifications. 

Lead Technologies Division We develop, and manufacture proprietary and custom designed implantable stimulation leads, adapters and delivery systems for
cardiac resynchronization therapy
("CRT") and neuromodulation. We also
provide laser processing and contract manufacturing services for our medical device customers for implantable and disposable devices. 

 Results of Operations 

 Delivery Systems Division 2003 compared to 2002 Total revenues from operations were 17,055,674 for 2003 compared to 17,879,234 for 2002, representing a
4.6 decrease. 

Sales
of our core introducer products increased 12.2 to 12,432,632 in 2003, compared to 11,077,387 in 2002. This increase was primarily due to continued growth in sales to both new
and existing customers. We had hoped to see a larger increase in our introducer product sales during 2003 with the launch of our FlowGuard valved introducer in the second quarter.
Unfortunately, due to a design issue related to the handle resin, we voluntarily pulled the product off the market in June and spent the remainder of 2003 resolving the issue. The issue has been
resolved and we anticipate re-launching the product in the first half of 2004. We expect sales of our core introducer products to grow rapidly in 2004 as we begin to ship our FlowGuard
product to the marketplace and add additional customers and products. 

Sales
of our advanced delivery products decreased 54.6 to 2,515,372 in 2003, compared to 5,544,203 in 2002. These sales were primarily comprised of Left Ventricle Lead Delivery System
("LVLDS") procedural kits and components sold to Medtronic in support of its launch of the InSync pacing device to treat congestive heart failure. As we previously reported, Medtronic has
transitioned packaging of these procedural kits to its own facility. We provided Medtronic with several components for these kits during 2003, but we have seen a significant decline in orders for
these components throughout the year. We anticipate that our advanced delivery product sales will be flat or slightly lower in 2004 as we continue to experience a decline in Medtronic component sales,
off-set by new advanced delivery product roll-outs. We are currently working on twelve development projects related to advanced delivery products with a variety of companies.
We are conducting the product development work and incorporating some portions of our own intellectual property in each of these projects. Each relationship is typically accompanied by a supply
agreement that would provide us an additional revenue stream if the final product is commercialized. 

 Sales
of safety needles were 601,544 in 2003, compared to 180,459 in 2002, representing an increase of 421,085. Most of these increased sales are the result of the incorporation of
the safety needle into Medtronic kits for U.S. distribution starting in the second quarter of 2003. On April 24, 2003, we announced a supply agreement with Cook Incorporated under which we
appointed Cook the exclusive distributor of our single pack Axia RSN safety needles in the United States. We shipped a small initial order of safety needles to Cook during the third and
fourth quarters and we expect to ramp up sales to Cook during 2004. We also shipped small quantities of needles to a number of potential customers to begin their evaluation of the product. We expect
safety product sales to accelerate in 2004 as we begin to ramp up shipments of safety needles to Cook under the new supply agreement. 

 15 

Other
sales, consisting of contract manufacturing, engineering services and freight charges were 1,506,126 in 2003, compared to 1,077,185 in 2002. This increase was primarily due to
increased engineering service sales, off-set by decreases in contract manufacturing sales during the comparable periods. 

 Gross
profit decreased 13.5 to 7,242,505 in 2003, compared to 8,375,544 in 2002. Gross profit as a percent of sales decreased from 46.9 to 42.5 for the comparable periods. Our gross
profits in 2003 decreased as a percent of sales when compared to 2002 for several reasons. A major reason for the decrease is due to the drastic reduction in our high gross profit Medtronic advanced
delivery product sales. We also made a conscious decision to retain all of our production staff while we resolved the FlowGuard resin issue and we used the time to conduct training and rearrange our
production floor for greater efficiency. As a result, we had higher manufacturing overhead costs than would be typical for the lower level of production we generated. We also have relatively high
fixed costs related to the amortization of our investment in obtaining the rights to the arterial safety needle market, as well as depreciation on the automated safety needle assembly equipment
(beginning in April 2003), as compared to sales of safety needles. We also incurred additional costs in the first quarter of 2003 when we manually assembled safety needles, as well as
additional costs in the second quarter of 2003 when we wrote off inventory associated with the FlowGuard valved introducer. Finally about 5 of our sales were for engineering services that carry a
margin rate substantially lower than our typical proprietary product sales. We expect some improvement in our margins in 2004 but would not expect to get back to our historical margins until the
FlowGuard is fully launched and safety needle sales increase to higher levels than currently attained. 

 Research
and development expenses were 1,763,896 or 10.3 of sales in 2003, compared to 1,661,373 or 9.3 of sales in 2002. These increases were primarily due to increasing our
engineering staff and continuing expenditures on a variety of new product development activities. We plan to spend approximately 11 of our sales dollars in 2004 on research and development activities
in order to continue to generate new products for our customers. 

 Selling
expenses were 834,785 or 4.9 of sales in 2003, compared to 529,224 or 3.0 of sales in 2002. This increase was primarily due to increased spending on salaries, trade shows and
travel, partially off-set by a decrease in commission expense. We have been developing an internal sales and marketing department over the past two years and have added a number of
positions since January of 2002 to help drive the sales and marketing efforts for our new products. With the addition of these positions, we have attended more trade shows to build awareness of our
products and incurred higher travel costs than in past years. Additionally, with these new positions, we have been able to reduce commission expenses related to our two independent sales
representatives. We expect sales and marketing costs to approximate 5 of sales in 2004 as we continue to build our sales efforts. 

 General
and administrative expenses were 1,850,856 or 10.9 of sales in 2003, compared to 1,743,493 or 9.8 of sales in 2002. The increases in dollars were primarily due to increased
spending on salaries, accounting fees associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, legal fees (contract work), investor relations, depreciation, consulting services and insurance. In 2004, general and
administrative expenses of the Delivery Systems Division will be combined with the expenses of the Lead Technologies Division as much of the general and administrative activities will span both
divisions. We expect overall general and administrative expenses to be approximately 10 of consolidated sales in 2004. 

 Interest
income decreased 38,446 and interest expense increased 28,809 in 2003 compared with 2002. Interest income decreased primarily due to lower cash balances resulting from the use
of excess cash to fund the acquisition of BCI, as well as lower interest rates compared to 2002. Interest expense increased primarily due to the interest on the 5 million note payable that was
put in place in October 2003 to help fund the BCI acquisition. 

 16 

Lead Technologies Division (October 24, 2003 to December 31, 2003) Revenues from operations since October 24, 2003, the date BCI was
acquired, were 2,547,767. Total 2003 revenues, which include the revenue of BCI prior to
its acquisition, increased 150 to 10,518,748, compared to 4,208,861 for 2002. 

Sales
of our proprietary products, consisting of implantable stimulation leads, lead delivery systems and adaptors were 722,635 since October 24, 2003. Sales of proprietary
products for all of 2003 increased 109 to 3,391,051, compared to 1,621,793 for 2002. The key drivers in our high sales growth in 2003 were a three-fold growth in our proprietary Myopore
epicardial lead sales and increased demand for our IS-1 adapters. High growth in the Myopore lead sales was driven by the rapid growth of the Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) market
and the demand for sutureless epicardial leads for left ventricular pacing in failed transvenous left ventricular placements. We believe the volume of Myopore leads will continue to increase due to
the continued growth of the CRT procedure, but at a more moderate rate than that experienced in 2003. 

Sales
of our contract manufacturing products, consisting primarily of lead accessories were 1,698,791 since October 24, 2003. Total 2003 sales of our contract manufacturing
products increased 165 to 6,783,278, compared to 2,561,721 for 2002. The growth in pacing accessories was primarily due to one customer's increase in stocking levels and higher demand due to that
customer's sales force expansion. We anticipate that pacing accessory sales will remain flat in 2004. Other contract manufacturing revenue growth was due to increased demand for OEM procedure kits,
laser processing of prosthetic discs, and the successful start-up of a hemostatic powder filling operation. While the 2004 contract manufacturing sales revenue is likely to be less than
2003, the contract manufacturing gross profit percentage will be higher than 2003. In addition, the percentage of total sales revenue coming from contract manufacturing in 2004 is likely to decrease
from over 50 in 2003 to less than 35 in 2004 in favor of higher margin proprietary product sales 

 Other
sales consisting of our contract development work and freight were 126,342 since October 24, 2003. Other sales were 344,419 for all of 2003, compared to 25,347 for 2002.
Contract development work in 2003 was primarily related to development of stimulation leads for a variety of emerging neurostimulation applications. These co-development efforts have been
initiated to fuel longer-term manufacturing growth tied to development and supply arrangements with emerging therapy start-up companies. 

Gross
profit totaled 733,992 or 28.8 of sales since October 24. Gross profit for all of 2003 was 3,465,507 or 32.9 of sales compared to 780,360 or 18.5 of sales in 2002.
Gross profit grew in 2003 primarily because of increased sales of our higher-margin proprietary products. Other changes that helped improve our gross profit in 2003 included the implementation of cost
reduction efforts in strategic supply, manufacturing processing improvements and increased efficiencies in the production work force due to hiring, training, and retention programs. We were also able
to pass on price increases to customers of our proprietary products that had not seen price increases in several years. We expect that our gross profit percentage will continue to improve in 2004 as
proprietary product sales continue to increase as part of our overall sales revenue mix. 

Research
and development expenses were 223,226 since October 24, 2003. For all of 2003, research and development expenses totaled 628,410 compared to 142,163 in 2002. In
addition, in December 2003 we wrote off 2,650,000 of purchased in-process research and development costs as part of the acquisition (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements). Significant investment in internal research and development in 2003 was noteworthy because no internal research and development projects had been conducted since 2000. Beginning in
January 2003, we initiated development projects for a steroid epicardial lead, a deflectable epicardial lead, and a family of IS-4 adapters. Revenue generation from these new
products will commence in the second half of 2004, although the major impact of new product sales will not be realized until 2005. Research and 

 17 

development
spending in 2004 is estimated to be approximately 11-12 of sales, with higher spending in the first half of the year due to the funding of animal studies and a number of US
and European regulatory submissions related to gaining approval to market the steroid epicardial lead which is a Class III device. 

 Sales
and marketing expenses were 190,311 since October 24, 2003. For all of 2003, sales and marketing expenses were 791,583, or approximately 8 of sales due to marketing
activities related to the repositioning of BCI, as well as our exhibitions at three physician conferences. With much of the initial foundation created in 2003, sales and marketing expenses in 2004
will level out and represent approximately 5-6 of sales. 

 General
and administrative expenses were 206,494 since October 24, 2003. For all of 2003, general and administrative expenses were 1,144,191. In 2004, general and administrative
expenses of the Lead Technologies Division will be combined with the activities of the Delivery Systems Division as much of the general and administrative activities will span both divisions. Interest
and other expenses were 471 since October 24, 2003. 

 As
part of the acquisition, 8,605,000 of the purchase price was classified as identifiable intangible assets. We wrote off 2,650,000 of this amount in December as purchased
in-process research and development costs, leaving the remaining 5,955,000 to be written off as amortization expense over the next five to thirty years (see Note 3 to the
consolidated financial statements). We recognized approximately 102,000 of amortization expense in 2003 and will recognize approximately 614,000 of amortization expense in 2004 that will be
reflected in the following categories: cost of goods sold 219,000, general and administrative expenses 117,000, sales and marketing expenses 18,000 and research and development expenses 260,000. 

Delivery Systems Division 2002 compared to 2001 Total revenues from continuing operations increased 31.0 to 17,879,234 for 2002 compared to 13,647,667
for 2001. 

 Sales
of our core introducer products increased 36.9 to 11,077,387 in 2002, compared to 8,092,197 in 2001. The increase was primarily due to increased sales to Bard Access Systems
under the April 2000 supply agreement that was beginning to ramp up in 2001, as well as increased sales to a number of other customers that were added during late 2001. We also benefited from a
one-time shipment of specialty introducers to Medtronic in the third quarter of 2002. 

Sales
of our advanced delivery products increased 22.7 to 5,544,203 in 2002, compared to 4,520,264 in 2001. These sales were primarily comprised of LVLDS procedural kits and
components sold to Medtronic in support of its launch of the InSync pacing device to treat congestive heart failure. In early 2002, Medtronic advised us of its intent to begin to assemble
the LVLDS kits in its own facility beginning in the second quarter of 2002. While we continued to provide LVLDS kits and components to Medtronic subsequent to its anticipated transition date, sales
for the last two quarters of 2002 were each approximately 500,000 less than the comparable periods from a year earlier. 

 In
the fourth quarter of 2001, we began marketing our Guidewire Introducer Safety Needle that incorporates technology licensed from Med-Design Corporation. Sales of safety
needles were 180,459 in 2002, compared to 87,550 in 2001. On June 27, 2002, we announced our first safety needle supply agreement with Bard Endoscopic Technologies and on October 15,
2002 we announced a new supply agreement with Medtronic. 

 Contract
manufacturing sales were 863,102 in 2002, compared to 738,127 in 2001, representing a 16.9 increase. The increase was due to one customer ordering more products in 2002
compared to 2001. Contract manufacturing sales represent sales of products to companies that have brought us a finished product design and asked us to manufacture it for them. 

 18 

Other
sales, which include freight charges to customers and engineering services, totaled 214,083 and 209,529 for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Engineering services represent contract development work that we do on behalf of our customers. 

 Gross
profit increased 26.8 to 8,375,544 in 2002, compared to 6,604,768 in 2001. Gross profit as a percent of sales decreased from 48.4 to 46.9 for the comparable periods. Gross
profit as a percent of sales was lower for two reasons. First, we made significant improvements to our infrastructure over the last year to accommodate the anticipated growth of our business. These
improvements included expansion of our clean room, the purchase of additional manufacturing equipment, the hiring of additional management personnel and the purchase of a new integrated software
system. These infrastructure improvements have added additional overhead costs that are not currently being fully absorbed. Second, we made an investment of 2,047,894 to gain exclusive rights to the
arterial safety needle market with Med-Design Corporation that is being amortized over 98 months. 

 Research
and development expenses were 1,661,373 or 9.3 of sales in 2002, compared to 1,157,623 or 8.5 of sales in 2001. These increases were primarily due to increasing our
engineering staff and continuing expenditures on a variety of new product development activities. 

Selling
expenses were 529,224 or 3.0 of sales in 2002, compared to 351,303 or 2.6 of sales in 2001. These increases were primarily due to increased spending on salaries, commissions,
trade shows and new marketing materials. We hired a new Director of Sales and Marketing in January 2002 to help drive the sales and marketing efforts for the safety needle product. We also
hired a Product Marketing Manager and a Sales Administrator during the third quarter of 2002 to assist with ramping up our safety needle sales, as well as other new product sales. 

 General
and administrative expenses were 1,743,493 or 9.8 of sales in 2002, compared to 1,609,057 or 11.8 of sales in 2001. The increases in dollars were primarily due to increased
spending on accounting fees (primarily tax return preparation), legal fees (contract work), investor relations, depreciation, consulting services and insurance. 

 Interest
income decreased 7,567 and interest expense decreased 55,058 during the comparable periods. Interest income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates while interest
expense decreased because we utilized some of the cash from the sale of the Gynecology Division to fully pay-down our line of credit in April 2001. 

 As
a result, we had net income after taxes of 2,858,634 or .57 per diluted share for 2002, compared to net income of 6,619,763 or 1.43 per diluted share for 2001. The net income for
2001 included the gain on the sale of the Gynecology Division of 2,896,610, recognition of an income tax benefit of 923,000 on unutilized net operating tax loss carryforwards, and after tax income
from operations of discontinued segment of 182,012. 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2003, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 1,067,935, compared to 7,304,362 as of
December 31, 2002. Net cash
provided by operating activities during 2003 was 1,455,111, consisting of net income of 308,757, adjusted for non-cash items consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization of
 1,400,270 and write-off of purchased in-process research and development of 2,650,000. Other material changes that affected operating activities were an increase in deferred
tax assets of 802,000, a net change in operating assets and liabilities of 906,223 and income taxes payable of 1,206,913. 

 Net
cash used in investing activities during 2003 was 12,637,122, consisting primarily of the purchase of equipment totaling 1,173,811, additions to patent rights and trademarks
totaling 251,001 and net cash paid for the BCI acquisition of 11,212,310. 

 19 

Net
cash provided by financing activities during 2003 was 4,945,584. We made principal payments on capital leases of 69,121 and payments on note payable to bank of 166,668. This was
offset by proceeds from option and warrant exercises of 181,373 and proceeds on long-term debt of 5,000,000. 

 On
October 23, 2003, we entered into a financing arrangement with a bank that included a five-year term loan of 5,000,000, which was used to finance a portion of the
BCI acquisition, and a 3,000,000 line of credit, all of which was available at December 31, 2003. We closed
the previous line of credit in conjunction with this refinancing. The borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets and also contain certain financial covenants that must be met on a
quarterly basis. The agreement also prohibits the payment of dividends without the consent of the lender. At December 31, 2003, we were in violation of certain of these covenants, due to the
 2.7 million write-off of purchased in-process research and development related to the BCI acquisition. On March 18, 2004, the bank waived the covenant violation
and amended the agreement which provides, among other things, an extension of the expiration date on the line of credit to April 30, 2005. 

 Payments
on the term loan consist of monthly principal payments of 83,334 plus interest at Libor plus 2.5 . These payments commenced in November 2003. The line of credit bears
interest at Libor plus 2.25 with no minimum interest due and expires on April 30, 2005. The availability under the line is subject to borrowing base requirements, and advances are at the
discretion of the lender. There were no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit at December 31, 2003. 

 As
of December 31, 2003, our working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) was 4,558,369, or a current ratio of 1.9 to 1, compared to working capital of 8,857,648
or a current ratio of 4.1 to 1 as of December 31, 2002. Accounts receivable increased 2,034,904, inventory increased 1,620,182, current maturities of notes payable increased 1,000,000,
accounts payable increased 108,625 and accrued liabilities increased 2,133,180, primarily due to the acquisition of BCI. Accrued liabilities included 2,110,476 due to BIOMEC Inc. related to
the working capital adjustment of 897,495 that was paid in February 2004, and the 1,212,981 cash portion of the first contingent payment that is due on March 31, 2003. Income taxes
payable decreased 1,247,982 due to the payment of our taxes in 2003.

We
had approximately 1.1 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2003. In connection with our acquisition of BCI, we made a working capital adjustment
payment of 897,495 in February 2004 and are required to make the 2003 Contingent Payment of 3,032,454 on March 31, 2004 which will be paid 40 in cash and 60 in stock. Additionally,
we may be required to make an additional payment related to the 2004 Contingent Payment that would be due on March 31, 2005. Our current estimate is that this payment will fall in the
 6-10 million range. In February 2004, we entered into a letter agreement with BIOMEC Inc., under which we agreed to pay the 2004 Contingent 

 20 

Payment
as 80 stock and 20 cash. The value of the stock to be issued in conjunction with the contingent payment will be valued at no less than 11.56 or more than 15.63 per share. 

 While
we believe that we have sufficient resources with our current cash and the credit facility to make payments required under the acquisition and to fund our planned operations for
fiscal 2004, there is no assurance that we will not need additional capital in the future. Sources of additional capital may include additional debt financing or the sale of debt or equity securities.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully obtain additional capital on favorable terms. 

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our annual consolidated
financial statements. Some of our accounting policies
require management to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. These judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.
These judgments are based on our historical experience, known trends in our industry, terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources, as appropriate. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Certain of the most critical policies that require significant judgment are as follows: 

 Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements 
when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable and
collectability is reasonably assured. 

 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We establish estimates of the uncollectability of accounts receivable. Our management analyzes accounts receivable,
historical write-offs as bad
debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount that we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on
receivables. A considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the realizability of receivables, including assessing the probability of collection and the current
credit-worthiness of each customer. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, an additional provision for doubtful
accounts may be required. We have not experienced significant bad debts expense and our reserve for doubtful accounts of 70,000 should be adequate for any exposure to loss in our December 31,
2003 accounts receivable. 

 Allowance for Excess and Slow-Moving Inventory Inventories, which are composed of purchased parts and subassemblies, work in process and finished goods,
are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost
being determined by the first-in, first-out method. On a periodic basis, we analyze the level of inventory on hand, its cost in relation to market value and estimated customer
requirements to determine whether write-downs for excess or slow-moving inventory are required. Actual customer requirements in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may
differ from estimates. If actual or expected requirements were significantly greater or lower than the established reserves, a reduction or increase to the obsolescence allowance would be recorded in
the period in which such a determination was made. We have established reserves for excess and slow-moving inventories and believe the reserve of 155,000 at December 31, 2003 is
adequate. 

 21 

Valuation of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets including Intangible Assets with Finite Lives As a matter of policy, we review our major assets for impairment
at least annually, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. The test for impairment of finite life assets requires us to make estimates of the fair value of our long-lived assets, primarily based on projected future
cash flows using discount rates determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model or another valuation technique. For indefinite life intangibles, we
determine whether the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds its expected future cash flows. If we determine that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, we will
be required to reduce the valuation of these assets on our financial statements. Significant assets include the following: 

Goodwill 
 The estimate of the fair value of the goodwill that resulted from our recent acquisition of BCI is one of the more significant estimates based on the judgment required in projecting
future cash flows as well as considering both the current amount recorded, approximately 9 million, and its possible increase of 6 to 10 million, if a second contingent purchase
payment is required (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). 

 Safety Needle 
 The realization of our investments in the license agreement and manufacturing equipment related to the safety needle (aggregate investment of approximately 3.4 million at
December 31, 2003) is
dependent upon attaining a sustained level of sales of this product. We currently are comfortable projecting a level of future sales that is more than sufficient to allow us to fully realize the
investments we have made in the safety needle product. However, if actual sales fail to reach these levels, our investments made in this product may not be fully realizable in the future. Please refer
to the "Risk Factors" caption below for a discussion of factors that will have an effect on our ability to attain a sustained level of safety needle sales. 

 Other Intangibles with Finite Lives 
 Other intangibles with finite lives consist primarily of purchased technology, trade name, patents, customer relationships and trademarks (aggregate net balance of 7.7 million at
December 31, 2003) are being amortized on a straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 30 years, (see Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements). 

Allocation of Purchase Price Paid for the BCI Acquisition As a result of our acquisition of BCI, as described more fully in Note 4 to the
consolidated financial statements, we were required to allocate the
consideration paid for BCI between tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, including in-process research and development (IPR D), and goodwill. The value assigned to IPR D was
determined by identifying those acquired specific in-process research and development projects that would be continued and for which (a) technological feasibility had not been
established at the acquisition date, (b) there was no alternative future use, and (c) the fair value was estimable with reasonable reliability. We were required to make significant
estimates to determine the portion of the purchase price allocated to IPR D and other intangible assets. We engaged an independent valuation firm to assist in the determination of the fair values of
the intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR D and other intangible assets was determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting
the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rates used in calculating the present value of the various intangibles was in accordance with accepted valuation methods and for IPR D
also included the consideration of the risks of not achieving commercial feasibility. The goodwill that resulted from this acquisition represents the excess of the total purchase price over the fair
value of the total tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired. 

 22 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities. 
This interpretation establishes standards for identifying a variable interest entity and for determining under what circumstances a variable interest entity should be consolidated with its primary
beneficiary. Until now, a company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests. Interpretation No. 46
changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities or is
entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns or both. The application of Interpretation No. 46 did not have any effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

The
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued Statement No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both
Liabilities and Equity. Statement No. 150 requires that certain freestanding financial instruments be reported as liabilities in the balance sheet. Depending on the type
of financial instrument, it will be accounted for at either fair value or the present value of future cash flows determined at each balance sheet date with the change in that value reported as
interest expense in the income statement. Prior to the application of Statement No. 150, either those financial instruments were not required to be recognized, or if recognized were reported in
the balance sheet as equity and changes in the value of those instruments were normally not recognized in net income. The Company was required to apply Statement No. 150 for the quarter
beginning on July 1, 2003. The application of Statement No. 150 did not have any effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

 Forward Looking Statements Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in the letter to shareholders, in our quarterly reports, in
filings by us with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases, and oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer that are not historical or current facts are "forward-looking
statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain important factors could cause results to differ materially from those
anticipated by some of these statements. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. A number of factors that could cause results to differ materially
are those discussed in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled "Risk Factors." Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially are the following:
our ability to successfully integrate the BCI/LTD operation; our dependence upon a limited number of key customers for our revenue; our ability to complete development of our steroid epicardial lead
and delivery tool; our ability to find distribution partners for our steroid lead and delivery tool; our dependence upon licensing agreements with third parties for the technology underlying some of
our products, especially the safety needle; our ability to negotiate and enter into safety needle supply agreements with major medical device companies and our ability and that of our customers to
achieve market acceptance of the safety needle; our ability to effectively manufacture our safety needle using our automated safety needle assembly equipment in anticipated required quantities; our
ability to develop or acquire new products to increase revenues; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; introduction of competitive products; patent and government regulatory matters;
economic conditions; and our ability to raise capital. All our forward-looking statements, whether written or oral are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. In addition, we disclaim any
obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof. 

 23 

Risk Factors The following are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking
statements made by or on
behalf of the Company. 

 We have two major customers and depend on these customers for a significant portion of our revenues. Medtronic accounted for approximately 67 and 44 and
a second customer accounted for approximately 13 and 18 of our total sales from operations in 2002 and
2003, respectively. We anticipate that our expected near-term future growth in sales will be tied in part to these customers sales of their existing products, as well as new products
incorporating our products as components. Because we anticipate that sales of our components and kits to Medtronic for use in Medtronic's Left Ventricle Lead Delivery Systems ("LVLDS") will continue
to decrease, we are attempting to expand our customer base and our product offerings. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in making sales to new customers, increasing sales to existing
customers other than Medtronic or developing and marketing new products. To the extent that we do not expand our customer base and product offerings, sales to Medtronic and the second customer will
continue to account for a major portion of our revenues, making us vulnerable to the risks described below. We anticipate the acquisition of BCI will reduce our concentration of business with
Medtronic to approximately 30 in 2004 and with the second customer to less than 14 . 

 On
October 11, 2002, we entered into a supply agreement with Medtronic that requires Medtronic to purchase exclusively from us all of its requirements for certain delivery systems
and introducer kits manufactured by us for a period of five years. The supply agreement also sets forth the terms under which Medtronic will begin including our Axia RSN retractable
guidewire introducer safety needle as part of Medtronic's introducer kits. 

 There
are no minimum purchase obligations under the supply agreement for our current products or any future products we may develop. If sales of Medtronic's products that incorporate our
products as components decrease or if Medtronic does not develop new products incorporating our products as components, future sales of our products to Medtronic and our results of operations would be
adversely affected. Further, any action by Medtronic to discontinue any of its products that incorporate our products, to redesign or change the technical requirements for its products so that our
products would not meet those requirements, or to otherwise limit or discontinue its purchases from us would have a material adverse impact on sales of our products and, consequently, our financial
results. In addition, although under the terms of the supply agreement, Medtronic agreed to begin including the Axia RSN retractable guidewire introducer safety needles as part of its
introducer kits, if Medtronic's customers determine not to use the safety needle, or request that they not be included in the introducer kits, then our anticipated future revenue for the sale of this
product may not develop. 

 In
addition, under the supply agreement, if we fail to supply certain products, Medtronic may manufacture and sell these products or have these products manufactured by another party.
Our failure to supply these products would result in a loss of sales to Medtronic and would have a material adverse impact on our revenues. Moreover, the supply agreement establishes the pricing
Medtronic receives with respect to each product and provides that if we extend more favorable pricing to any other customer, that same pricing will also be extended to Medtronic. Further, a reduction
in our pricing with Medtronic would likely result in a decline in our overall revenue. 

 We depend upon the safety needle licensing agreement and successful introduction of the safety needle. An important element of our growth strategy is
focused on successfully manufacturing and marketing the safety needle licensed from Med-Design
Corporation. We currently have the exclusive right to make, use and sell Med-Design Corporation's center-line retractable safety needle in the venous market, in the arterial
access market and other related fields. Under the terms of the license agreement, we must sell designated quantities of product each year to retain exclusive rights to the 

 24 

technology
and must pay as much as 20 of our revenues from sales of safety needles to Med-Design as royalties. If we do not sell the designated quantity of product each year, we can
retain our exclusive rights by paying Med-Design the amount of money necessary to cover the royalty shortfall. Through 2003, we have not met our minimum product quantities and have paid
Med-Design the difference necessary to retain our exclusive rights to the technology. There is no assurance that we can manufacture the safety needle at a cost, or sell the safety needle
at a price, that will result in an acceptable rate of return for us. In order to sell enough safety needles to retain our license, we must develop customers in the arterial market, a market in which
we currently have no customers and no marketing experience. There is no assurance that we can successfully penetrate the arterial market. We acquired a 1.75 million automated assembly system
to manufacture safety needles that became fully operable in the second quarter of 2003. If we fail to penetrate and achieve significant sales of safety needles, or if we lose our ability to market and
sell the safety needle, our future prospects would be adversely affected. 

We may need additional capital in the future. We had approximately 1.1 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2003. In
connection with our acquisition of BCI, we made a working
capital adjustment payment of 897,495 in February 2004 and are required to make the 2003 Contingent Payment of 3,032,454 on March 31, 2004 which will be paid 40 in cash and 60 in
stock. Additionally, we may be required to make an additional payment related to the 2004 Contingent Payment that would be due on March 31, 2005. Our current estimate is that this payment will
fall in the 6-10 million range. In February 2004, we entered into a letter agreement with BIOMEC Inc., under which we agreed to pay the 2004 Contingent Payment as 80 
stock and 20 cash. The value of the stock to be issued in conjunction with the contingent payment will be valued at no less than 11.56 or more than 15.63 per share. 

 On
October 23, 2003, we entered into a financing arrangement with a bank that included a five-year term loan of 5,000,000, which was used to finance a portion of the
BCI acquisition, and a 3,000,000 line of credit, all of which was available at December 31, 2003. We closed
the previous line of credit in conjunction with this refinancing. The borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets and also contain certain financial covenants that must be met on a
quarterly basis. The agreement also prohibits the payment of dividends without the consent of the lender. At December 31, 2003, we were in violation of certain of these covenants, due to the
 2.7 million write-off of purchased in-process research and development related to the BCI acquisition. On March 18, 2004, the bank waived the covenant violation
and amended the agreement which provides, among other things, an extension of the expiration date on the line of credit to April 30, 2005. 

 Payments
on the term loan consist of monthly principal payments of 83,334 plus interest at Libor plus 2.5 . These payments commenced in November 2003. The line of credit bears
interest at Libor plus 2.25 with no minimum interest due and expires on April 30, 2005. The availability under the line is subject to borrowing base requirements, and advances are at the
discretion of the lender. There were no outstanding borrowings under the agreement at December 31, 2003. 

While
we believe that we have sufficient resources with our current cash and the new credit facility to make payments required under the acquisition and to fund our planned operations
for fiscal 2004, there is no assurance that we will not need additional capital in the future. Sources of additional capital may include additional debt financing or the sale of debt or equity
securities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully obtain additional capital on favorable terms. 

 We have only attained profitability recently. We became a publicly traded company in 1991 and incurred losses in each of the years from 1991 to 1999. For
the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001, 2002
and 2003, we reported net income of 162,000; 6.6 million; 2.9 million and 309,000. Net income for 2001 included 3.1 million related to 

 25 

the
sale of the gynecology division, as well as recognition of income tax benefit of 923,000 resulting from the elimination of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. In 2003, BCI was
profitable for the first time in many years. However, our 2003 results only included income from BCI from October 24, 2003 to December 31, 2003 and included a one-time
write-off of 2.7 million related to the purchase of in-process research and development costs associated with the acquisition. There is no assurance that we will be
able to effectively integrate the operation of BCI and maintain profitable operations in the future. 

 The government heavily regulates our business. The medical products that we sell and propose to sell are subject to regulation by the FDA and by
comparable agencies in certain states and foreign countries. The
process of complying with requirements of the FDA and other agencies can be costly and time consuming. We have received clearance from the FDA to market our vessel introducer products, safety needle,
epicardial lead and implant tool. There is no assurance that any future additional clearance can be obtained. In addition, once obtained, these clearances are subject to review, and later discovery of
previous unknown problems may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from
the market. We are also subject to certain FDA regulations governing manufacturing practices, packaging and labeling. Non-compliance with these regulations can result in product recalls or
other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

 We depend on patents and proprietary technology. Our success may depend on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes, to
preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing
on the proprietary rights of third parties. We have 18 patents issued related to various aspects of vessel introducers and stimulation leads. There can be no assurance that any future patent
protection will be granted, that the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged. The validity and breadth of
claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and therefore may be highly uncertain. We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets, and no assurance can be
given that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent trade secrets or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology. 

We depend on our key personnel. Failure to attract and retain skilled personnel could hinder our research and development and manufacturing efforts. Our
future success depends to a significant
degree upon the continued services of key technical and senior management personnel. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified
managerial and technical personnel. The inability to retain or attract qualified personnel could have a significant negative effect upon our efforts and thereby materially harm our business and
financial condition. 

We face intense competition and rapid technological change. We are faced with intense competition and rapid technological and industry change and, if our
competitors' existing products or new products are more effective or
superior to our products, the commercial opportunity for our products will be reduced or eliminated. We face intense competition from other device manufacturers, many of whom are significantly larger
and have greater financial, technical, research, marketing, sales, distribution and other resources than we do. We believe there will be intense price competition for products developed in our
markets. Our competitors may develop or market technologies and products that are more effective or commercially attractive than any we are developing or marketing. Our competitors may succeed in
obtaining regulatory approval and introducing or commercializing products before we do. Such developments could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition. Even if we are able to
compete successfully, we may not be 

 26 

able
to do so in a profitable manner. The medical device industry is generally characterized by rapid technological change, changing customer needs, and frequent new product introductions. Our
products may be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations. 

We risk product liability claims and product recalls. The manufacture and sale of medical products entails significant risk of product liability claims or
product recalls. Our existing insurance coverage limits may
not be adequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur in connection with the clinical trials or sales of our products. We may require increased product liability coverage as our products
are commercialized. Insurance is expensive and may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us in excess of our
insurance coverage, or a recall of our products, could have a significant negative effect on our business and financial condition. Even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and
management time and could have a negative impact on our business. 

 We have limited sources of supply for our products. We currently purchase, and will in the future purchase, components and raw materials from outside
vendors. Although we have identified alternative suppliers for
key components and raw materials, at the present time we generally use one source of supply for each component and raw material. Should a key supplier be unwilling or unable to supply any such
component or raw material in a timely manner, or should approval of a proposed supplier be delayed, withheld or withdrawn, we could experience delays in obtaining alternative suppliers, which may
adversely affect our business. 

We have a limited public market for our common stock. As of March 15, 2004, we had 5,738,785 shares of common stock outstanding. The average daily
trading volume approximated 47,000 shares per day in 2001,
26,000 shares per day in 2002, 18,000 shares per day in 2003, and 15,000 through March 15, 2004. There can be no assurance that an active market will exist for our common stock, or that our
common stock could be sold without a significant negative impact on the publicly quoted price per share. In April 2004, BIOMEC Inc. will distribute to its 200 shareholders the 933,333
shares of our common stock that it received in connection with our acquisition of BCI. Any significant re-sales into the market by these shareholders could adversely affect the price of
our common stock. 

 Our future operating results may fluctuate. If our revenue declines in a quarter compared to the revenue in the previous quarter, our earnings will likely
decline as well, due to the fact that many of our
expenses are relatively fixed. In particular, research and development, marketing and general and administrative expenses are not affected directly by variations in revenue. In some future quarter or
quarters, due to a decrease or shortfall in revenue or for some other reason, our operating results likely will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In this event, the market
price of our common stock may fall abruptly and significantly. 

 Our research and development projects may not reach technological feasibility. Our Lead Technologies Division currently has three major product
development projects in process: Steroid Leads, Adapters and an Implant Tool. We are planning on
spending approximately 1.8 million in 2004 to continue the development of these products. While we believe that these three in-process projects will reach technological
feasibility, because of the risks associated with the commercial viability of these products, there can be no assurance that these projects will actually achieve commercialization. Such risks include
the delay or failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or the failure to achieve market acceptance. 

 27 

Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

 We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities used to maintain liquidity. Our earnings have not been
materially affected by changes in interest rates on our floating interest rate debt because we have not maintained an outstanding balance on our line of credit agreement. Based on our current
borrowings, an increase of 100 basis points in prevailing interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by less than 50,000. We have invested our excess funds in a money market fund and
do not believe that a change in interest rates on such money market fund would have a material effect on our earnings.

Audited Financial Statements 

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 

 To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Enpath Medical, Inc. 
Minneapolis, Minnesota 

 We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Enpath Medical, Inc. (formerly Medamicus, Inc.) and Subsidiary, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each year in the three year period ended December 31, 2003. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 

 We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Enpath Medical, Inc. and Subsidiary, as
of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each year in the three year period
ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

 NATURE OF BUSINESS We are a medical products company engaged in: 

the
design, development, manufacture and marketing of percutaneous vessel introducers, safety needles and related vascular delivery products;
 the
design, development, manufacture and marketing of implantable stimulation leads, lead delivery systems, and lead accessories for cardiac rhythm management,
neuromodulation, and hearing restoration markets; and
 the
manufacture of medical devices and components for other medical product companies on a contract basis. 

At
the beginning of 2001, we were operating in two distinct operating segments: The Delivery Systems Division and the Gynecology Division. On April 25, 2001, we sold the
Gynecology Division to CooperSurgical, Inc. for approximately 4.7 million, recognizing a gain of approximately 2.9 million on the sale (see Note 12). We continued to
manufacture catheters and monitors for CooperSurgical until December 2001, when we transferred the manufacturing responsibilities to it. As a result, we have
reported the results of the Gynecology Division as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2001. 

 On
October 23, 2003, we completed the acquisition of the net operating assets of BIOMEC Cardiovascular Inc. ("BCI") from BIOMEC Inc. (See Note 4 for further
details). We have included BCI's results in our consolidated financial statements from October 24, 2003 forward. As a result of this transaction, Enpath Medical, Inc. will operate with
two divisions: The Delivery Systems Division (formerly Medamicus, Inc.) and the Lead Technologies Division (formerly BCI). Both divisions are aggregated into one reportable segment: the
manufacture and sale of medical devices. Each division has similar technology, manufacturing, customers and regulatory activities and we expect to jointly conduct sales and marketing and research and
development activities where appropriate. Net sales by division for the year ended December 31, 2003 is as follows: 

Delivery Systems Division 

17,055,674 

Lead Technologies Divison 

2,547,767 

Total 

19,603,441 

On
February 2, 2004, we changed our name from Medamicus, Inc. to Enpath Medical, Inc. The name Enpath reflects the company's mission "to create pathways that enable the delivery of essential medical therapies'. 

 A
summary of the Company's significant accounting policies follows: 

 PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Enpath Medical, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Enpath
Lead Technologies, Inc.
All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

 REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment of the product to the customer, FOB shipping point. Shipping and handling charges billed
to customers are included in
net sales, and shipping and handling costs incurred by the Company are included in cost of sales. 

 34 

RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued Statement No. 150, Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. Statement No. 150 requires that certain freestanding financial instruments be reported as liabilities in the balance
sheet. Depending on the type of financial instrument, it will be accounted for at either fair value or the present value of future cash flows determined at each balance sheet date with the change in
that value reported as interest expense in the income statement. Prior to the application of Statement No. 150, either those financial instruments were not required to be recognized, or if
recognized were reported in the balance sheet as equity and changes in the value of those instruments were normally not recognized in net income. The Company was required to apply Statement
No. 150 for the quarter beginning on July 1, 2003. The application of Statement No. 150 did not have any effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

 In
January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. This interpretation
establishes standards for identifying a variable interest entity and for determining under what circumstances a variable interest entity should be consolidated with its primary beneficiary. Until now,
a company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests. Interpretation No. 46 changes that by
requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities or is entitled to
receive a majority of the entity's residual returns or both. The application of Interpretation No. 46 did not have any effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

 ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

 DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of certain
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value: 

Cash equivalents: The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short
maturity of these instruments.
 Notes payable: The fair value of the Company's notes payable are estimated based on the
quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities with similar collateral requirements. At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the fair value of the Company's notes payable approximated their carrying value. 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, primarily United States money market securities, with an original
maturity of three months or less. The
Company maintains its cash in bank accounts, which, at times, exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. 

 TRADE RECEIVABLES Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for the doubtful receivables based on a review of all
outstanding amounts on a
monthly basis. Management determines 

 35 

the
allowance for doubtful accounts after reviewing individual customer accounts as well as considering both historical and expected credit loss experience. Trade receivables are written off when
deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received. 

 INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. 

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of three to seven
years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the remaining term of the lease. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred. 

 INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE LIVES Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life or contractual life,
whichever is shorter (see
Note 3). For a description of the intangible assets acquired in the BCI transaction, see Note 4. 

GOODWILL In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 142, goodwill is tested for impairment annually and
additionally if an event
occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss would generally be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets
exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The Company has determined that no impairment exists at December 31, 2003. 

 IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets to determine any potential impairment. The asset carrying values are
compared with the expected
future cash flows resulting from their use. The expected future cash flows include cash flows resulting from the asset's disposition. The Company would recognize an impairment loss if an asset's
carrying value exceeded its expected future cash flow. To date, management has determined that no impairment of long-lived assets exists. 

 INCOME TAXES Deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary
differences and operating
loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. 

 EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION At December 31, 2003, the Company has two stock-based employee compensation plans (See Note 8). The Company
accounts for those plans under the APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , and related interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in
net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. 

 The
Company also grants options and warrants to non-employees for goods and services and in conjunction with certain agreements. These grants are accounted for under FASB
Statement No. 123 based on the grant date fair values. 

 36 

The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation , to stock-based employee compensation.

The
above pro forma effects on net income and net income per share are not likely to be representative of the effects on reported net income for future years because options vest over
several years and additional awards generally are made each year. 

 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES The Company incurred research and development expenses of 1,987,122, 1,661,373 and 1,157,623 in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively, as well as 2,650,000 from
the write-off of purchase price assigned to in-process technology in 2003. The value assigned to purchased in-process technology was determined by identifying those
acquired specific in-process research and development projects that would be continued and for which (a) technological feasibility had not been established at the acquisition date,
(b) there was no alternative future use, and (c) the fair value was estimable with reasonable reliability. The fair value was estimated using the present value of value of future
estimated cash flows of each project. The discount rate used in calculating the present value included the consideration of the risks of not achieving commercial feasibility (see Note 4). 

 PRODUCT WARRANTIES The Company provides a limited warranty for the replacement of defective products. The Company has never incurred any significant costs
associated with this
warranty and therefore have not provided any estimated liability for these warranties. 

 CONCENTRATION OF SUPPLY The Company generally uses one source of supply for key components and raw materials. The Company has identified alternate sources
for these components and raw
materials. 

 BASIC AND DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE Basic per-share amounts are computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted
per-share amounts are computed similar to basic per-share amounts except that the weighted average shares outstanding are increased to include additional shares for the assumed
exercise of stock options and warrants, if dilutive. The number of additional shares is calculated by assuming the outstanding stock options and warrants were exercised and that the proceeds from such
exercises were used to acquire shares of common stock at the average market price during the year. The dilutive effect of these additional shares for the years ended 

 37 

December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 was to increase the weighted average shares outstanding by 251,052, 262,332 and 350,207 shares, respectively.

4. ACQUISITION OF BCI 

 On October 23, 2003, the Company purchased substantially all of the operating assets of BCI, a company that develops and manufactures medical products,
specializing in pacing-lead products and pacing accessories. The primary reasons for the acquisition of BCI include the following: allow the Company to diversify its product base and
increase its customer base; obtain an intellectual property portfolio covering various products; acquire potential products that are currently in the development stage, and certain future synergies
that are anticipated to be realized in the combined Company after the acquisition. 

The
initial aggregate purchase price of approximately 18 million consisted of approximately 10 million in cash and the issuance of 933,333 shares of Company common stock
with a market value of approximately 7 million. Also, short-term liabilities with a fair value of approximately 1 million were assumed. The asset purchase agreement
requires an additional payment to be made in 2004 of 897,495 based on the final working capital of BCI on the date of acquisition. This payment was made in cash in February 2004. In addition,
the Company is required to make a contingent payment of 3,032,454 on March 31, 2004, based on BCI's final 2003 sales results. This payment will be made in the form of 40 cash 1,212,985) and
60 common stock 1,819,469 or 133,588 shares of common stock, valued at 13.62 per share). Both of these additional payments are included in liabilities at December 31, 2003. There is also a
second contingent payment due on March 31, 2005, which is based on the increase in BCI's proprietary sales in 2004 over 2003. This second contingent payment is
currently estimated to be in the range of 6 to 10 million, based on our 2004 budgets. On February 26, 2004, the Company amended its agreement with BIOMEC Inc. to state that 80 
of the second contingent payment due March 31, 2005 will be paid in stock and 20 will be paid in cash. The stock to be issued in conjunction with this payment will be valued at no less than
 11.56 and no more than 15.63. This future contingent purchase price, when determinable, will be recorded as an increase to goodwill. The results of operations of BCI and the estimated fair value of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from October 24, 2003. 

 The
Company accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS 141. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the Company's estimates of fair value at the acquisition date. The Company engaged an independent valuation firm to assist in the
determination of the fair values. The initial purchase price exceeded the amounts allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets by approximately 9 million, and this excess was
classified as goodwill.

A
portion of the purchase price has been allocated to developed and core technology, and in-process research and development. These intangible assets were identified and
valued through the analysis of data concerning the underlying technology of the company and its existing products, development projects, their stage of development, the time and resources to complete
them, if applicable, their expected income generating ability and associated risks. The income approach, which includes an analysis of cash flows and related risks, was the primary method used in
valuing the developed and core technology, and in-process research and development. Developed technology represents projects that had attained technological feasibility and their value has
accordingly been capitalized. Core technology has value through its use or re-use in many products or future generations of products. 

 Development
projects, which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use, were classified as in-process research and development.
Accordingly, the purchase price assigned to those projects was immediately expensed on the acquisition date and has been reflected as an expense in the 2003 consolidated statements of operations. The
in-process research and development projects are as follows: Steroid Leads 1.3 million), Adapters 1 million) and an Implant 

 40 

Tool 350,000). The estimated value of these projects was determined using a discounted cash flow model. The discount rates used considered the stage of completion and the risk surrounding the
successful development and commercialization of each of the purchased in-process technology projects. 

 The
discount rates used in valuing the developed, core and in-process technologies range from 26 to 50 . A higher discount rate was used to value the in-process
research and development, due to the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the in-process projects, FDA approval, and the market acceptance of the products. The
percentage of completion for each of the in-process projects was determined using costs incurred to date on each project as compared to the remaining estimated costs to be incurred to
bring each of the projects to technological feasibility. The percentage of completion varied by each project, ranging from 10 to 25 . 

 The
Company believes that the three in-process projects will reach technological feasibility. However, because of the risks associated with the commercial viability of these
products, there can be no assurance that these projects will actually achieve commercialization. Such risks include the delay or failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or the failure to
achieve market acceptance. 

 The
intangible assets acquired in the acquisition, with the exception of goodwill and the in-process research and development, are being amortized on a straight line basis
over their estimated lives ranging from 5 to 30 years (see Note 3). For tax purposes these assets, including goodwill and in-process research and development, are deductible
over a 15-year period. This difference gives rise to deferred income taxes disclosed in Note 5.

5. INCOME TAXES 

 On December 31, 2000, the Company had a valuation allowance that fully offset its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the future
realization of such assets. During 2001, in connection with the sale of the Gynecology Division (see Note 12), the Company utilized approximately 3.0 million of the NOL carry-forwards.
Immediately after the sale of the Gynecology Division, the Company determined that a high degree of certainty existed that its remaining future income tax benefits would be realized as a result of
both the current and future income of its remaining business segment. Accordingly, the valuation allowance on the remaining deferred income tax asset was eliminated in the second quarter to reflect
the anticipated net deferred tax asset utilization. As a result of eliminating the valuation allowance, the Company recorded an income tax benefit in the second quarter ended June 30, 2001.
This income tax benefit had the effect of reducing 2001 income tax expense by approximately 923,000.

6. FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS 

 On October 23, 2003, we entered into a financing arrangement with a bank that included a five-year term loan of 5,000,000, which was used to
finance a portion of the BCI acquisition, and a 3,000,000 line of credit, all of which was available at December 31, 2003. We closed the previous line of credit in conjunction with this
refinancing. The borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets and also contain certain financial covenants that must be met on a quarterly basis. The agreement also prohibits the payment
of dividends without the consent of the lender. At December 31, 2003, we were in violation of certain of these covenants, due to the 2.7 million write-off of purchased
in-process research and development related to the BCI acquisition. On March 18, 2004, the bank waived the covenant violation and amended the agreement which provides, among other
things, an extension of the expiration date on the line of credit to April 30, 2005. 

 The
current line of credit bears interest at Libor plus 2.25 with no minimum interest due and expires on April 30, 2005. The availability under the line is subject to borrowing
base requirements, and advances are at the discretion of the lender. There were no outstanding borrowings under the agreement at December 31, 2003.

The
Company has separate operating leases related to its two facilities. The Delivery Systems Division facility was under an operating lease that expired May 31, 2005, related to
31,337 square feet with a monthly base rent of 14,187. Beginning February 1, 2004, the Company modified the lease to include an additional 7,000 square feet and extended its lease to expire on
June 30, 2006. The base rent increases to 17,525 per month from February 2004 thru May 2005 and then increases to 19,276 per month to the end of the lease term. This rent
expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Lead Technologies Division facility is under an operating lease that expires December 31, 2008,
related to 27,000 square feet with a monthly base rent of 14,189. The Company

respectively. 

 8. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY 

 Warrants In connection with the acquisition of the operating assets of BCI, the Company issued warrants to an agent to purchase 10,000 shares of common
stock at an
exercise price of 8.36 per share that expire on October 23, 2008. The fair value of those warrants, estimated using the Black-Scholes Model, of approximately 52,000 was treated as a cost
directly related to the acquisition (see Note 4). 

 Stock Options The Company has four stock option plans: the 1989 Stock Option Incentive Plan, the 1992 Non-Qualified Plan, the 1999 Non-Employee Director
and Medical Advisory Board Stock Option Plan and the 1999 Stock Option Incentive Plan. Under the four plans, a maximum of 1,780,000 options were designated for grant at prices not less than 85 of
fair market value at date of grant if a non-qualified option, or 100 if an incentive option as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. Of these options, approximately 390,500 remain
available for future grants. Options vest over periods ranging from two years to five years and the options expire over periods ranging from six to fifteen years after the date of grant. 

 As
discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation under the APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , and related
interpretations. The pro forma fair value of each option grant as presented in Note 1 to
the financial statements is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in 2003, 2002 and 2001:

 We currently have two major customers that account for more than 10 of our sales. One customer accounted for 44 , 67 and 76 of our sales and 24 , 67 and 54 
of our accounts receivable at year-end in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The other customer accounted for 18 , 13 and 10 of our sales and 8 , 6 and 19 of our accounts receivable at
year-end in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 

10. RETIREMENT PLAN 

 The Company has a profit-sharing plan (the "Plan") classified as a defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan
allows employees to defer a portion of their annual compensation through pre-tax contributions to the Plan. The Company changed its matching in 2000 from 10 to 25 of an employee's
contribution, up to a maximum of 5 of the employee's compensation. Matching contributions for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were 52,732, 42,852 and 32,501, respectively.
The Company's Board of Directors may approve discretionary contributions to the Plan. No discretionary contribution has been made since the Plan's inception.

11. LICENSE AGREEMENT 

 On September 7, 2001, the Company amended its Development and Licensing Agreement with Med-Design Corporation which provided exclusive
marketing rights to Med-Design's center-line retractable safety needle technology for the arterial access market in exchange for a payment of 2,000,000. Previously the Company
had exclusive rights only to the venous access market. The 2,000,000 payment to Med-Design consisted of 1,000,000 in cash and 1,000,000 worth of Enpath stock, or 68,027 shares based on
the market value of the stock on the effective date of the Addendum. The cost of the licensing rights is being amortized over the estimated useful life of the exclusive rights acquired. 

 The
agreement, as amended, requires the Company to pay Med-Design royalties on sales of the safety needle product. The royalty fees range from 17 to 20 percent of the
net sales price, depending on the sales volume achieved. In order to maintain exclusive rights, the Company must pay royalties on an increasing number of safety needles each year per the Licensing
Agreement. The Company paid royalty fees of 169,000 and 160,000 for 2003 and 2002, respectively, of which 91,759 and 143,587 was included in current liabilities at December 31, 2003 and
2002. To maintain these exclusive rights for 2004 in the event that the minimum sales targets are not achieved, the minimum royalty fee due would be approximately 200,000. 

 12. SALE OF GYNECOLOGY DIVISION AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 

 On April 25, 2001, the Company sold the assets of its Gynecology Division to CooperSurgical, Inc. ("Cooper") for 4,700,000. The agreement called
for the Company to continue manufacturing monitors and catheters for Cooper until the end of 2001, at which time Cooper would assume responsibility for manufacturing. 

The
Company recognized a gain on the sale summarized as follows: 

Gross sales price 

4,700,000 

Net assets sold 

(1,365,576) 

Transaction costs 

(437,814) 

Gain on sale 

2,896,610 

As
a result of this transaction, the Company now operates in one reportable segment. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the
financial results for the Gynecology segment are reported as "Discontinued Operations." Sales for the Gynecology segment for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2001 were 2,770,872.

that set forth in the Articles of Incorporation or in the most recent amendment of the Articles of Incorporation or statement of the Board of Directors filed with the Secretary of State of Minnesota
changing the registered office in the manner prescribed by law. The corporation may have such other offices, within or without the State of Minnesota, as the Board of Directors will, from time to
time, determine. 

 Section 1.02. Corporate Seal. The corporation will have no corporate seal. 

 ARTICLE II 

 MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS 

 Section 2.01. Time and Place of Meetings. Regular or special meetings of the shareholders, if any, will
be held on the date and at the time and place fixed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or, if a Chairman of the Board of Directors has not been elected, by Board action or, in the absence of
Board action, by the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), except that a regular or special meeting called by, or at the demand of a shareholder or shareholders, will be held in the county where the
principal executive office is located. 

 Section 2.02. Regular Meetings. At any regular meeting of the shareholders there will be an election of
qualified successors for directors who serve for an indefinite term or whose terms have expired or are due to expire within six (6) months after the date of the meeting. Any business
appropriate for action by the shareholders may be transacted at a regular meeting. No meeting will be considered a regular meeting unless specifically designated as such in the notice of meeting or
unless all the shareholders are present in person or by proxy and none of them objects to such designation. 

 Section 2.03. Demand by Shareholders. Regular or special meetings may be demanded by a shareholder or
shareholders, pursuant to the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, Sections 302A.431, Subd. 2, and 302A.433, Subd. 2, respectively. 

Section 2.04. Quorum, Adjourned Meetings. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares
entitled to vote at a meeting constitute a quorum for the transaction of business; said holders may be present at the meeting either in person or by proxy. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting may
be adjourned to a subsequent date, and provided a notice of such adjournment is mailed to each shareholder entitled to vote at least five (5) days before such adjourned meeting. If a quorum is
present, a meeting may be adjourned from time to time without notice other than announcement at such meeting. At adjourned meetings at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which
might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. If a quorum is present when a duly called or held meeting is convened, the shareholders present may continue to transact business until
adjournment, even though withdrawal of shareholders originally present leaves less than the proportion or number otherwise required for a quorum. 

 Section 2.05. Voting. At each meeting of the shareholders, every shareholder having the right to vote
will be entitled to vote either in person or by proxy. Unless otherwise provided by the Articles of 

 1 

Incorporation
or a resolution of the Board of Directors filed with the Secretary of State, each shareholder will have one vote for each share held. Upon demand of any shareholder, the vote upon any
question before the meeting will be by ballot. The Board may fix a date, not more than sixty (60) days before the date of a meeting of shareholders, as the date for determination of the holders
of shares entitled to notice of and entitled to vote at the meeting. When a date is so fixed, only shareholders on that date are entitled to notice of and permitted to vote at that meeting of
shareholders. 

 Section 2.06. Notice of Meetings. Notice of all meetings of shareholders will be given to every holder of
voting shares, except where the meeting is an adjourned meeting at which a quorum was present and the date, time and place of the meeting were announced at the time of adjournment. The notice will be
given at least ten (10), but not more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, except that written notice of a meeting at which there is to be considered either (i) an
agreement of merger or consolidation other than a merger of the nature described in Minnesota Statutes Section 302A.621, (ii) a proposal to dispose of all or substantially all of the
property and assets of the corporation, (iii) a proposal to dissolve the corporation, or (iv) a proposal to amend the Articles of Incorporation, will be mailed to all shareholders,
whether entitled to vote or not, at least fourteen (14) days prior thereto. Every notice of any special meeting will state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting has been called, and the
business transacted at all special meetings will be confined to the purpose stated in the call, unless all of the shareholders are present in person or by proxy and none of them objects to
consideration of a particular item of business. 

 Section 2.07. Waiver of Notice. A shareholder may waive notice of any meeting of shareholders. A waiver
of notice by a shareholder entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at or after the meeting and whether given in writing, orally or by attendance. 

 Section 2.08. Authorization Without a Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting
of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting by written action signed by all of the shareholders entitled to vote on that action.

decreased at any time by action of the Board of Directors. Directors need not be shareholders. Each of the directors will hold office until the regular meeting of the shareholders next held after his
or her election, until his or her successor is elected, or until he or she resigns or has been removed as hereinafter provided. 

Section 3.03. Board Meetings; Place and Notice. Meetings of the Board of Directors may be held from time
to time at any place within or without the State of Minnesota that the Board of Directors may designate. In the absence of designation by the Board of Directors, Board meetings will be held at the
principal executive office of the corporation, except as may be otherwise unanimously agreed orally or in writing or by attendance. The Chairman of the Board, the President, or directors comprising at
least one third of the number of directors then in office may call a Board meeting by giving four (4) days' notice if by mail or two (2) days' notice if by telephone, facsimile
transmission, telegram or in person, to all directors of the day or date and time of the meeting. The notice need not state the purpose of the meeting. If a meeting schedule is adopted by the Board,
or if the date and time of a Board meeting has been announced at a previous meeting, no notice is required. 

 2 

Section 3.04. Action Without Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the
Board of Directors of this corporation not needing approval by the shareholders under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 302A, may be taken by written action signed by the number of directors that
would be required to take such action at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which all directors were present. 

 Section 3.05. Waiver of Notice. Notice of any meeting of the Board of Directors may be waived by a
director either before, at, or after such meeting in a writing signed by such director; provided, however, that a director, by his attendance and participation in any action taken at the meeting of
the Board of Directors, will be deemed to waive notice of such meeting. 

Section 3.06. Quorum. A majority of the directors currently holding office is a quorum for the
transaction of business. If a quorum is present when a duly called or held meeting is convened, the directors present may continue to transact business until adjournment, even though withdrawal of
directors originally present leaves less than the proportion or number otherwise required for a quorum. 

 Section 3.07. Vacancies. Any vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors for any reason, and any newly
created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors, may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office. Any directors so chosen will hold office until the next
election of directors and until their successors will be elected and qualified, subject, however, to prior retirement, resignation, death or removal from office. 

 Section 3.08. Compensation. The Board may fix the compensation, if any, of the directors.

corporation, as ordered by the Board of Directors. The CFO will perform such other duties and have such other powers as the Board of Directors or the CEO may from time to time prescribe. 

 Section 4.09. Removal and Vacancies. Any officer may be removed from office by a majority of the Board of
Directors, with or without cause. Such removal, however, will be without prejudice to the contract
rights of the person so removed. If there is a vacancy among the officers of the corporation by reason of death, resignation or otherwise, such vacancy may be filled by the Board of Directors. 

 Section 4.10. Delegation of Authority. Unless prohibited by the Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws,
or a resolution approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors present, an officer elected or appointed by the Board may delegate some or all of the duties or powers of such office to
other persons, provided that such delegation is in writing. 

 ARTICLE V 

 SHARES AND THEIR TRANSFER 

 Section 5.01. Certificates for Shares. Shares of this corporation's stock may be certificated or
uncertificated, as provided under Minnesota law. Any certificates of stock issued by the corporation will be in such form as prescribed by law and adopted by the Board of Directors, certifying the
number of shares of the corporation owned by such shareholder and be signed by the CEO or President and the Secretary, unless some other persons are specifically authorized by resolution of the Board
of Directors. 

 Section 5.02. Transfer of Shares. Transfer of shares on the books of the corporation may be authorized
only by the record holder of such stock or by attorney lawfully constituted in writing, and, in the case of shares represented by a certificate, upon surrender of the certificate(s) for such shares.
The 

 4 

corporation
may treat, as the absolute owner of the shares of the corporation, the person or persons in whose name or names the shares are registered on the books of the corporation. Unless registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, the legend on the reverse side of all certificates for shares of the corporation will read: 

"The
shares of common stock represented by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or under applicable state laws and may not be sold, transferred, or pledged in the
absence of such registration unless pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and applicable state securities laws. The company reserves the right to
require an opinion of counsel satisfactory to it before effecting any transfer of the shares." 

ARTICLE VI 

 AMENDMENTS 

 Section 6.01. Subject to the power of shareholders to adopt, amend, or repeal these Bylaws as provided
in Minnesota Statutes Section 302A.181, subdivision 3, any Bylaw may be amended or repealed by the Board of Directors at any meeting, provided that, after adoption of the initial Bylaws,
the Board will not adopt, amend, or repeal a Bylaw fixing a quorum for meetings for shareholders, prescribing procedures for removing directors or filling vacancies in the Board, or fixing the number
of directors or their classifications, qualifications, or terms of office but may adopt or amend a Bylaw to increase the number of directors. 

 ARTICLE VII 

 INDEMNIFICATION 

 Section 7.01. Any person who at any time serves or has served as director, officer or employee of the
corporation, or of any other enterprise at the request of the corporation, and the heirs, executors and administrators of such person will be indemnified by the corporation, in accordance with and to
the fullest extent permitted by Minnesota Business Corporation Act, as it may be amended from time to time. 

 Section 7.02. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person in such
person's official capacity against any liability asserted against and incurred by such person in or arising from that capacity, whether or not the corporation would otherwise be required to indemnify
the person against the liability. 

 ARTICLE VIII 

 ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS 

 Section 8.01 A director, committee member or shareholder may participate in a meeting by any means or
communication through which such person, other persons so participating, and all persons physically present at the meeting may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting. Participation in a
meeting by that means constitutes presence in person at the meeting. A conference among directors, committee members or shareholders by any means of communication through which such persons may
simultaneously hear each other during the conference is a meeting of the Board of Directors, Committee or Shareholders, as the case may be, if the same notice is given of the conference as would be
required for a meeting, and if the number of persons participating in the conference would be sufficient to constitute a quorum at a meeting. Participation in a meeting by that means constitutes
presence in person at the meeting.
