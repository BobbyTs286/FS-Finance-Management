PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS
- ----------------

 General Magnaplate Corporation (the "Registrant") is principally
engaged in applying, through various proprietary and other processes, coatings
which cannot chip, peel or rub off and which increase the hardness, corrosion
resistance, wear resistance and/or lubricity of metal parts produced by its
customers.

 The Registrant applies coatings to aluminum, steel, copper
alloys, titanium, magnesium and other special alloys. Depending on the results
sought, these coatings are more resistant to corrosion, more durable and have
lower friction characteristics than the metals to which they are applied. The
Registrant terms its coatings "Synergistic" because they apply several types of
materials or metals to the base metal to form a composite coating which is then
infused to become an integral part of the underlying metal. The composition and
thickness of the coatings are controllable and thus can be varied according to
the characteristics which the Registrant's customers need for the required end
product. Because the coatings change the surface qualities of the base metal,
they can permit the use, in some applications, of underlying metals which are
less expensive, easier to shape or lighter than other metals or alloys with
similar qualities.

 The Registrant's names for its main proprietary processes are:
TUFRAM for aluminum, NEDOX for most metals, MAGNAPLATE HMF for most metals,
MAGNAPLATE HCR for aluminum, CANADIZE for titanium, MAGNADIZE for magnesium,
LECTROFLUOR for all metals, HI-T-LUBE a specialized dry film lubrication
coating, PLASMADIZE, a composite coating for extreme wear application for most
metals, MAGNAGOLD, an enhanced titanium nitride PVD coating for various metals
and ultra-hard alloy steels to increase surface hardness, GOLDENEDGE, an
ultra-hard, ultra-thin TiN PVD coating for blades and all sharp-edged tools,
MAGNAPLATE HTR, for superior high temperature release on all metals, MAGNAGLIDE,
a coating developed for the exclusive use by Black & Decker for its irons, and
Magnaplate CMPT, a robotically controlled toolface production process. Each
proprietary process consists of a number of variations that can be employed to
meet customer requirements. The Registrant has obtained trademark coverage for
fifteen of these proprietary processes in the United States and on most of them
in certain foreign countries. Sales and licensing of coatings using these and
other proprietary processes have represented approximately 95 of the
Registrant's total operating revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999.

 The Registrant handles each job on a "custom" basis, according to
each customer's specifications. Items coated vary greatly in size and shape.
Production runs vary from a few to thousands. Prices for coating services depend
on the length of the production run, the complexity of the work and other
factors associated with custom work. The Registrant's coatings are used in the
machine tool, food processing, packaging, defense, aerospace, pharmaceutical,
pulp and paper, oil service and electronics industries, as well as in other
industries which use metal parts.

 The Registrant is in one line of business, i.e., providing
synergistic coatings and other related services to its customers' products.

 Financial information relating to foreign operations is as
follows:

 The Company has invested net assets of 271,850 in its Ajax,
Ontario operation as of June 30, 1999.
 
 Foreign operations (principally Canada) constitute 7.5 , 8.1 and
10.0 of total sales in the three years ending June 30, 1997, 1998 and 1999,
respectively. Foreign operations constitute 3.5 , and 0 , and 0 of pre-tax
profits for the three years ended June 30, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.

Marketing
- ---------

 The Registrant markets its metal coating services through a staff
of twenty four technical market support personnel, including six independent
representatives operating from its facilities in New Jersey, Texas, Wisconsin,
California and Canada. New customers also come to the Registrant through
advertising, trade shows, seminars, our web site and editorial coverage in
numerous trade journals and referrals from the Registrant's customers.

 The Registrant's marketing, operation, management and engineering
staffs include persons who have training in metallurgy and other technical
fields. The Registrant's objective is to work with customers and prospective
customers in the early stages of the design and specification process, with a
view toward obtaining production contracts for the coating of the items being
designed. Coatings initially developed for one customer are, in some instances,
sold by the Registrant to other customers.

 For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999 , no one customer
accounted for more than 10 of the total revenues of the Registrant.

Research and Development
- ------------------------

 The metal coatings industry is characterized by rapid
technological changes requiring the Registrant to make continuing expenditures
for development of new coatings and the improvement of existing coatings in
order to meet customer needs.

 During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, the Registrant spent
an estimated 75,000 on unreimbursed research and development. Additional costs
incurred were paid by customers requiring special coatings and treatments. All
costs associated with the development of new processes and the maintenance and
enhancement of existing processes are charged against income as incurred or
borne by the customer in the form of contracts.

License Agreements
- ------------------

 The Registrant has licensing agreements with the following
overseas organizations: Ulvac Techno, Ltd. (Japan), YTTEC AB (Sweden), A.T.
Poeton & Sons, Ltd. (United Kingdom), MIFA Aluminum BV (Netherlands), and
Nussbaum (Germany). The Company will continue seeking additional licensees.
Since inception, several of these licensees have increased their processing
capabilities by taking licenses for additional proprietary processes.

 The Registrant receives periodic royalty payments under these
agreements based on sales of products to which Registrant's coating technology
is applied. The agreements also provide for two-way exchange of new and related
technology developed by Registrant and licensees.

 The Registrant has an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement
with Household Products, Inc. (Black & Decker) in connection with irons using
the MAGNAGLIDE process technology and name.
 
 The contributions of the licensees amounted to 3 of the gross
revenue of the Registrant and are expected to continue to rise.

Competition
- -----------

 The metal coatings industry is highly competitive. There are many
companies which provide metal treatments which, to varying extents, are
alternatives to the Registrant's processes. However, the Registrant believes
that none of the Registrant's competitors utilize processes similar to the
Registrant's proprietary processes. The Registrant believes that it competes
primarily on the basis of its manufacturing expertise, its superior proven
processes and coatings, and its reputation for problem solving, and that its
pricing is a less significant competitive consideration than these factors.

Raw Materials
- -------------

 The Registrant's primary raw materials are chemicals, polymers
and powdered or wire metals manufactured by large chemical and metal companies
and are readily available. The Registrant blends these raw materials in its
proprietary processes. The Registrant believes that sources of supply are
adequate for its needs and that it is not substantially dependent upon any one
supplier.

Protection of Proprietary Information
- -------------------------------------

 Many of the Company's processes are no longer covered under
patent protection, however, several new patents have been filed on processes for
surface treatments in the US and in key foreign nations. While management
believes that its existing patents have had competitive merit, it does not
believe that patent protection is essential to the ongoing operations of the
Registrant due to the know-how it has developed over the past years.

 The Registrant has acquired 17 United States trademarks and
servicemarks, and 13 foreign trademarks and servicemarks. These trademarks and
servicemarks cover 15 of the Registrant's processes in the United States and one
or more of the Registrant's processes in Canada and the European Community.
While management believes these trademarks and servicemarks have competitive
merit, it does not believe that trademark and servicemark protection is
essential to the ongoing operations of the Registrant.

 Many processes cannot be patented due to cost and limited market
potential. Also, the patenting process can be expensive and can result in public
disclosure of proprietary information. Therefore, the Registrant's present
approach is to treat its production processes as confidential and rely on
internal non-disclosure safeguards, including written confidentiality
agreements, particularly among its more technically trained personnel, and on
trade secret laws, as well as on restrictions incorporated in its license
agreements for protection of what it regards as proprietary information about
its coatings and processes. Notwithstanding these efforts, it may be possible
for competitors to duplicate or copy the Registrant's processes.

Employees
- ---------

 At June 30, 1999, the Registrant had 133 employees, of whom 14
were employed in marketing and sales operations, 23 in administration and 96 in
production and quality assurance.
 
 None of the Registrant's employees in any of its plants are
represented by labor unions. Management believes that its relations with its
employees are good.

Environmental, Safety and Health Matters
- ----------------------------------------

 The Registrant believes it is currently in material compliance
with all federal, state and local environmental protection laws and federal and
state occupational safety and health standards, non-compliance with which would
have a material adverse effect upon the Registrant's assets or its results of
operation. Capital expenditures made by the Registrant for enhancement and
improvement of environmental, health and safety systems represented
approximately 4 of the Registrant's revenues, and the Registrant anticipates
that such expenditures will not exceed that level for the foreseeable future to
meet existing federal, state and local laws and standards. Changes in current
laws and standards could require additional expenditures and adversely affect
the Registrant's operations and profitability.

Item 2. PROPERTIES
- ------------------

 The Registrant's corporate executive offices and a production
facility are located in a modern, one story, high ceiling, steel and concrete
structure, with an attached two story administrative and office area, located at
1331 U.S. Route 1, Linden, New Jersey. The Registrant owns this structure and
the approximately 4 acres of land on which it is located. Total square footage
within the structure is approximately 100,000 square feet. Approximately 30 of
the premises is leased to an unrelated party. Title is unencumbered.

 In November 1982, the Registrant, through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Candida Realty Texas, purchased a manufacturing facility, including
executive offices, in Arlington, Texas (in the Dallas/Fort Worth area). This
property consists of a modern, one story, cinder block and concrete structure,
containing approximately 37,500 square feet of space located on approximately 2
acres of land. Title is unencumbered.

 In 1989, the Registrant, through its wholly-owned subsidiary
Candida Realty Texas, purchased a modern one story brick and concrete structure
containing 30,401 square feet of office and manufacturing facility on 2.2 acres
in Arlington, Texas, and which property is adjacent to the existing plant of the
Registrant's Arlington operation. Title is unencumbered.

 In 1980, the Registrant, through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Candida Realty California, purchased a production and office facility in
Ventura, California, consisting of 4 modern, 1 story, concrete block and steel
buildings, which contain a total of approximately 32,000 square feet of space
located on approximately 2 acres of land. Title is unencumbered.

 On December 28, 1989, the Registrant acquired certain assets of
Ra-Tech Inc., a Racine, Wisconsin based hard anodizing metal specialist. The
operations were incorporated under the name of General Magnaplate Wisconsin,
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Registrant. During the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1991, the Registrant, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Candida
 
Realty Wisconsin, Inc., acquired 16,000 square feet of production and office
space in a building located on over 2.5 acres, into which General Magnaplate
Wisconsin, Inc. moved in October, 1991. During the fiscal year ended June 30,
1997 the registrant completed a 7,550 square foot expansion and renovation of
this facility. Title is unencumbered.

 On January 2, 1990 the Registrant acquired the operating assets
of Dynasurf International, Inc., an Ontario, Canada based hard metal coatings
specialist. The operations were incorporated under the name General Magnaplate
Canada, Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Registrant. During the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1998, the registrant acquired a modern 19,000 square foot
facility located in Ajax, Ontario. The building's production area is a one
story, high ceiling, steel and cinder block structure with an attached two story
office area situated on approximately 3 acres. During the same fiscal year, the
registrant completed a 2,000 square foot, one story steel and cinder block
addition onto the existing structure. Title to this property is subject to an
existing mortgage.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
- -------------------------

 Although the Company may from time to time be involved in routine
litigation incidental to its business, none of these actions are expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse impact upon the
Company or its results of operations.

Item 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
- -----------------------------------------------------------

 No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Business Environment

 General Magnaplate Corporation is principally engaged in
applying, through various proprietary and other processes, synergistic coatings
for metal parts produced by its customers. Rapid technological advances, typical
of the coatings industry, compel General Magnaplate to improve existing coatings
or develop new processes to meet our customers' changing needs and stay
competitive.

 Management believes that it competes primarily on the basis of
manufacturing expertise, its superior proven proprietary processes and coatings,
and its reputation for problem solving, and that its pricing is a less
significant competitive consideration than these factors. Management believes
that these factors are responsible for the Company's financial stability.

Financial Condition
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Three Years Ended June 30, 1999

 Cash and cash equivalents increased to 706,187 at June 30, 1999 from
 680,570 at June 30, 1996. Of the total cash and cash equivalents, 6,309,233
net cash was provided by the operating activities, 3,270,566 was used in
investing activities and 3,013,050 was used by financing activities. During the
three year period, the Registrant's cash provided by operating activities was
principally comprised of 4,427,852 provided by net income, 1,917,067 for
depreciation and amortization, 453,300 for accrued deferred compensation and a
 372,917 decrease in Marketable Securities, while primarily being reduced by
accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 485,805. During the three year
period, the Registrant's investment activities were primarily comprised of
 2,811,478 for additions to property, plant and equipment, and patents and
trademarks, 123,734 used for additions to deferred compensation contracts and
 339,126 for additions to cash surrender value-life insurance, while 536,672
was provided from the collection of a note receivable from an affiliated party.
The increase in net cash used in financing activities was principally from the
acquisition of treasury stock 1,998,531 and the payment of dividends of 
1,357,927.

 Working capital of 5,952,123 increased 283,182, or 5.0 , during the
three year period ended June 30, 1999 and the working capital ratio increased to
10.86 to 1 from 6.31 to 1 as of June 30, 1996. The working capital increased due
to the net effect of the increase in the mark to market value of the marketable
securities portfolio, the increase in Accounts Receivables-trade, net of
allowance for doubtful accounts and the paydown of Accounts Payable and accrued
liabilities.

 All per share numbers give retroactive effect to the December 16,
1997 two for one forward stock split. Stockholders' equity per share at June 30,
1999 increased .42 to 2.56 per share compared with 2.50, 2.33, and 2.14 at
June 30, 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively. The increase is primarily due to
the excess income earned over dividends paid and the cost of treasury stock
acquired for the three year period. As previously authorized by the Board,
548,748 shares of GMCC stock were purchased in the three year period at the cost
 
of 2,246,860. Of the repurchased shares, 350,800 shares were retired and
canceled while the remaining 197,948 are currently being held in the treasury,
leaving the Company with 4,720,846 shares outstanding at June 30, 1999. Under
the Registrant's current buyback program, the Company is authorized to
repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time up to the total purchase
price of 1,500,000. The Company has purchased 982,825 in shares under the
current program.

 Management believes internal cash flow from operations and/or
incomes from marketable securities to be sufficient to provide the capital
resources necessary to support future operating needs, and does not currently
anticipate material capital expenditures that will have significant impact on
future cash flows.

Results of Operations Fiscal 1999 vs. 1998 vs. 1997
- ---------------------------------------------------

 Total revenue for 1999 of 11,484,476 represented a decrease of
 235,855, or 2.0 , over 1998 revenue, while total revenue for 1998 was
 11,720,331, an increase of 266,673 or 2.3 over 1997.

 The decrease in total revenue for 1999 over 1998 represents
decreases in sales of 410,301 or 3.8 and royalty and licensee income of 6,053
or 1.8 , partially offset by an increase in investment and other income of
 180,499 or 35.2 .

 The increase in total revenue for 1998 over 1997 resulted from
increases in sales of 299,070 or 2.8 and royalty and licensee income of
 47,335 or 10.2 , partially offset by a decrease in investment and other income
of 79,732 or 18.8 .

 Sales for 1999, 1998 and 1997 were 10,453,071, 10,863,372, and
 10,564,302, respectively, representing approximately 91 , 93 and 92 of total
revenue in each respective year. Sales at the Canadian facility increased
 167,856. The New Jersey, Texas, California and Wisconsin facilities had lower
sales this year compared to the same period in 1998. The slight decline in sales
for the New Jersey facility is attributable to a general industrial slowdown.
The reduced sales for the Texas facility reflect continued low levels of oil
exploration due to the low price of crude oil experienced during the quarter.
Although crude oil prices have increased recently, the Company has not yet seen
an increased level of exploration activity in its Southwestern United States
market. Oil drilling and related suppliers represent a significant portion of
the customer base for the Texas facility. Reduced sales for the California
facility reflect slowdowns in the airframe and electronics industries served by
the plant, caused both by the Asian economic crises, which slowed orders of
parts for items such as aircraft, and the continued decrease in military
contracting. The Wisconsin facility's main customer base is in the food, and
pulp and paper industries which currently are not expanding their manufacturing
plants, resulting in no expenditures for our surface enhancement processes used
on new equipment. Sales for the fiscal year ended 1998 compared with 1997 showed
increased sales at New Jersey, Texas, and Canadian facilities of 479,512,
 1,207 and 89,291 respectively. The decreased sales at the California and
Wisconsin facilities for the year ended 1998 as compared to the year ended 1997
reflect the same factors discussed above in the comparison of the years ended
1999 and 1998.
 
 Royalty and license income was 337,528 in 1999, 343,581 in
1998, and 423,313 in 1997. The decrease in current year royalties of 1.8 , or
 6,053 as compared with the year ended 1998, is the result of the Company
receiving the final licensee fee payment of 50,000 in 1998 from Black & Decker
for the exclusive use of the Company's trademark name Magnaglide. There was no
comparable payment from Black & Decker in 1999. In addition, the decrease from
1997 versus 1998 of 18.8 , or 79,732, is directly attributed to the decrease in
royalties from our Japanese licensee and the impact of the turmoil experienced
during 1998 in the Asian market on their business.

 Investment income for 1999, 1998 and 1997 was 693,877, 513,378
and 466,043, respectively. Investment income increased 35.1 , or 180,499 for
the year ended 1999 compared to the same period in 1998, reflecting the
continuing upward movement in investment markets during the twelve months ended
June 30, 1999. Investment income increased 10.2 , or 47,335, in the year ended
1998 as compared to the same period in 1997, reflecting the same factors
discussed for the year ended 1999. The Company maintains an investment portfolio
to enhance earnings and provide liquidity for future cash needs. The portfolio
is composed of equity securities, U.S. Treasury Securities and obligations of
U.S. Government agencies and government sponsored entities, and corporate debt.

 The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities,(SFAS 115). Under SFAS 115, securities are classified as securities
held to maturity based on management's intent and the Company's ability to hold
them to maturity. Such securities are stated at cost, adjusted for unamortized
purchase premiums and discounts. Securities that are bought and held principally
for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading
securities, which are carried at market value. Realized gains and losses and
gains and losses from marking the portfolio to market value are included in
investment income. Securities not classified as securities held to maturity or
trading securities are classified as securities available for sale, and are
stated at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for
sale are excluded from results of operations, and are reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity, net of taxes. Securities classified as
available for sale include securities that may be sold in response to changes in
interest rates, changes in prepayment risks, or other similar circumstances.

 Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at
the time of purchase. At June 30, 1999 all of the Company's investment
securities were classified as trading securities.

 The 180,499 increase in investment income for the year ended
1999 versus the 1998 year is primarily attributable to the mark to market
adjustments to the portfolio. Although the Company's portfolio will continue to
be subject to market changes, management believes the portfolio is well
diversified and is a prudent cash management tool for investing the Company=s
excess cash. The 47,335 increase for the year ended 1998 versus 1997 reflects
the same factors discussed above.

 As a result of the factors discussed above, gross revenue for the
year ended 1999 totaled 11,484,476, a decrease of 2.0 , or 235,855 as compared
to the fiscal year ended 1998. Gross Revenue for the year ended 1998 totaled
 11,720,331, an increase of 2.3 or 266,673 versus the fiscal year ended 1997.
 
 Total costs and expenses were 9,542,521 in the year ended June
30, 1999, an increase of 54,600 or 0.6 as compared to 1998. Primary components
of costs and expenses included costs of sales of 5,015,361, an increase of
 295,464 over cost of sales of 4,719,897 for the same period last year, selling
and administration expense of 3,829,047, a decline of 232,785 from selling and
administrative expenses of 4,061,832 in the same period of last year, and
depreciation and amortization expenses of 667,557, an increase of 19,436 over
depreciation and amortization expenses of 648,121 in the same period of last
year. The increase in the costs of sales reflects increased prices in raw
material costs and higher production wages, and the decline in selling and
administrative expenses reflects the Company's reduced sales. Total costs and
expenses for the fiscal year ended 1998 were 9,487,921, representing an
increase of 567,970 over 1997. Primary components of costs and expenses
included in 1998 included cost of sales of 4,719,897, an increase of 301,649
as compared to total costs of sales of 4,418,248 in 1997, selling and
administration expenses of 4,061,832 , an increase of 161,752 over the same
period in 1997, and depreciation and amortization expense of 648,121 an
increase of 46,732 compared to the same period in 1997. The higher selling and
administrative costs in 1998 are attributable to the increased sales during the
period. Costs of sales increased for higher raw material prices as well as the
increase in sales. As a percentage of total revenue, total costs and expenses
wre 83.1 in 1999, 80.9 in 1998, and 77.9 in 1997. The increase in total costs
and expenses is primarily due to increases in raw material costs, increases in
depreciation from adding Plasmadize processing lines at the Wisconsin plant, and
higher labor costs due to the addition of sales staff and low unemployment
rates.

 Income before corporate income taxes was 1,941,955 in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1999, a decrease of 13.0 , or 290,455 from the 2,232,410
achieved in the same period 1998.

 Income before corporate income taxes for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1998 was 2,232,410, a decrease of 11.9 , or 301,297 from 1997 income.
Corporate income taxes and the effective tax rate for 1999 were 683,750 and
35.2 , respectively, in 1998, 757,450 and 33.9 and 839,020 and 33.1 in 1997.

 Based on the above, net income in the fiscal year ended 1999 of
 1,258,205 decreased 216,755 or 14.7 from the 1,474,960 in the same period of
1998. Net income decreased 219,727 or 13.0 for the fiscal year ended 1998 as
compared to net income of 1,694,687 for fiscal year ended 1997.

 Earnings per share in 1999, 1998 and 1997 were .26, .30 and
 .33, respectively. In the current year, 186,948 shares of GMCC stock were
purchased and are being held in the treasury. During 1998, 15,000 shares of GMCC
stock were purchased and placed in treasury, 4,000 of these shares were
subsequently issued as employee compensation and the remaining 11,000 shares are
still being held in the treasury. During the fiscal year ended 1997, 350,800
shares of treasury stock were canceled and retired, resulting in weighted
average shares outstanding of 4,803,495, 4,913,635 and 5,089,124 in 1999, 1998
and 1997, respectively.

Year 2000
- ---------

 The Company has recognized the need to ensure that its computer
systems will not be adversely affected by the upcoming calendar year 2000. The
Company has assessed how it may be impacted by Year 2000 and has formulated and
commenced implementation of a comprehensive plan to address known issues to its
computer systems. The plan, as it relates to computer systems, involves a
combination of software modification, upgrades and replacement. The accounting
 
software has already been upgraded at this time, at a cost of 12,000. The
Company estimates that any additional costs of Year 2000 compliance will not be
material. However, the Company cannot measure the impact that the Year 2000
issue will have on its vendors, suppliers, customers and other parties with
which it conducts business.

Market Risk
- -----------

 The Company's Canadian operations expose the Company to potential
foreign currency exchange risk on cash flows related to sales, expenses and
financing transactions. The Company believes its exposure to currency rate risk
is not material, and the Company has not used currency exchange contracts to
address this risk.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 ----------------------------

To The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
 General Magnaplate Corporation:

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
General Magnaplate Corporation and Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1999
and June 30, 1998 and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended June 30, 1999. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in the index at Item 14(a). These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statement. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

 In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company and
Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries at June 30, 1999 and June 30, 1998 and the results of
their operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
June 30, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly
in all material respects the information set forth therein.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1--Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
- --------------------------------------------------

Principles of Consolidation

 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
General Magnaplate Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries; accordingly
all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Nature of Business

 The Company provides synergistic coatings and other related
services to commercial customers' products from five plants located in the
United States and Canada. In addition it has licensed its patented and
proprietary processes to foreign licensees.

Marketable Securities
- ---------------------

 All marketable securities are considered trading securities and
are valued at fair market value in accordance with FASB No. 115. Realized and
unrealized gains and losses are reported in current period income. Net
unrealized holding gains (losses) on trading securities of 33,884, 29,183, and
 31,915, were reported for the years 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. Market
value exceeded cost by 94,604 and 60,719 at June 30, 1999 and 1998
respectively.

Inventories
- -----------

 Inventories consist principally of industrial supplies and
coating solutions which are valued at the lower of FIFO cost or market and are
included in Cost of Sales.

Depreciation and Amortization
- -----------------------------

 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciation
is provided principally on a straight line basis using estimated service lives
of 5 years for transportation equipment, 5-10 years for factory machinery and
office equipment, and 10-39 years for buildings and building improvements.
Expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized. Items of identifiable
property which are sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of are removed from the
asset accounts, and any gains or losses thereon are reflected in income.

 Patents and trademarks are amortized on a straight line basis
over periods not exceeding 10 years.

 WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1--Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------

Corporate Income Taxes
- ----------------------

 Taxes are provided based on income reported for financial
statement purposes, including deferred taxes which are principally provided due
to temporary differences between financial and tax reporting of certain revenue
and expense items.

Company Earnings Per Share
- --------------------------

 Earnings per share of common stock have been computed based on
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting periods.

Statement of Cash Flows
- -----------------------

 For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company
considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.

Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment
- ---------------------------------------

 Assets and liabilities of the subsidiary operating in Canada are
translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance
sheet date. Results of operations are translated using the average exchange rate
prevailing throughout the period. The effects of exchange rate fluctuations on
translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are
included as part of the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss component of
shareholders' equity, while gains and losses resulting from foreign currency
transactions are generally included in income.

Use of Estimates
- ----------------

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications
- -----------------

 Certain amounts in the 1998 consolidated financial statements
have been reclassified to conform with the 1999 presentation.

 The Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan which covers all U.S.

representing the unpaid contract liability for the net assets acquired by the
Canadian subsidiary from the sellers, Carrigan Industries, Ltd. and Dynasurf
International, Inc. on January 2, 1990. Further, a shareholder of Dynasurf
International, Inc. also filed a claim for breach of oral contract of employment
for 119,000. The Subsidiary filed a counterclaim for environmental and other
costs incurred which resulted from the seller not resolving certain

on September 9, 1996 wherein the plaintiffs were collectively paid the sum of

- --------------------------------------------------

Concentrations of Credit Risk
- -----------------------------

 The Company's financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash, marketable
securities and trade receivables.

securities placed with a wide array of institutions with high credit and
investment ratings. This investment policy limits the Company's exposure to
concentrations of credit risk.

 The trade receivable balances, reflecting the Company's diversified
sources of revenue, are dispersed across many different geographic areas. As a
consequence, concentrations of credit risk are limited. The Company routinely
assesses the financial strength of its customers and generally does not require
collateral to support its credit sales.

a tenant under an operating lease expiring December 31, 1999. Minimum future
rentals to be received on the lease as of June 30, 1999 are as follows: 1999-00
