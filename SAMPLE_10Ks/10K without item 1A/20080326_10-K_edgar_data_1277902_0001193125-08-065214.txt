PART I ITEM 1.
 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS MVB Financial Corp., or MVB, was formed on January 1, 2004 as a bank holding company. MVB Bank, Inc.,
or the Bank, was formed on October 30, 1997 and chartered under the laws of the state of West Virginia. The Bank commenced operations on January 4, 1999. During the fourth quarter of 2004, MVB formed two second-tier holding companies MVB
Marion, Inc. and MVB Harrison, Inc. to manage the banking operations of MVB, the sole bank subsidiary, in those markets. In August of 2005, MVB opened a full service office in neighboring Harrison County. During October of 2005 MVB purchased a
branch office in Jefferson County, situated in West Virginia s eastern panhandle. In 2006 MVB formed another second-tier holding company, MVB East, Inc. to manage the banking operations of MVB in the Jefferson and Berkeley county markets.
 MVB operates five offices, two of which are located in Marion County, the main office located at 301 Virginia Avenue in Fairmont and a branch office at
2500 Fairmont Avenue inside the Shop N Save Supermarket in White Hall, WV. The remaining offices are located at 1000 Johnson Avenue in Bridgeport, Harrison County, 88 Somerset Boulevard in Charles Town, Jefferson County and 651 Foxcroft Avenue in
Martinsburg, Berkeley County. At December 31, 2007, MVB had total assets of 230.1 million, total loans of 181.5 million, total deposits of 157.4 million and total stockholders equity of 23.5 million. MVB s business activities are currently confined to a single segment which is community banking. As a community banking entity, MVB offers its customers a full
range of products through various delivery channels. Such products and services include checking accounts, NOW accounts, money market and savings accounts, time certificates of deposit, commercial, installment, commercial real estate and residential
real estate mortgage loans, debit cards, and safe deposit rental facilities. MVB also offers travelers checks and official checks. Services are provided through our walk-in offices, automated teller machines ATMs ), drive-in facilities,
and internet and telephone banking. Additionally, MVB offers non-deposit investment products through an association with a broker-dealer. At
December 31, 2007, MVB had 66 full-time and 11 part-time employees. MVB s principal office is located at 301 Virginia Avenue, Fairmont, West Virginia 26554, and its telephone number is (304) 363-4800. MVB s Internet web site is
 www.mvbbanking.com . Since the opening date of January 4, 1999, MVB has experienced significant growth in assets, loans, and deposits due to
overwhelming community and customer support in the Marion and Harrison county markets, and expansion into West Virginia s eastern panhandle. During
2007, MVB continued to focus on growth in the Harrison and Jefferson County areas along with the addition of the Berkeley County market, as the primary method for reaching performance goals. MVB continuously reviews key performance indicators to
measure our success. Recent Additions During the
third quarter of 2007, MVB opened a full service banking facility in the Martinsburg area of Berkeley County West Virginia. Market Area 
 MVB s primary market areas are the Marion, Harrison, Jefferson and Berkeley Counties of West Virginia, which includes a total of 64 banking facilities. Its
extended market is in the adjacent counties. United States Census Bureau data indicates that the Fairmont and Marion County, West Virginia populations
have had somewhat different trends from 1980 to 2000. The population of Fairmont has fluctuated from 23,863 in 1980; 20,210 in 1990 and 19,097 in 2000, or a net decline of 4,766 or 20.0 . Marion County increased its population from 1980 to 1990,
55,789 to 57,249, and decreased to 56,598 in 2000. These changes resulted 
 
 4 

Table of Contents 

in a net increase of 1.45 . The Marion County population includes that of Fairmont. The result is that over the last 20 years, there has not been any
significant change in population. Harrison County s population has decreased from 69,371 in 1990 to 68,652 in 2000, while Bridgeport s population has increased from 7,306 in 2000 to an estimated 7,598 in 2006, indicating that while
population change in Harrison County has been relatively flat, the Bridgeport area is growing. The population in Jefferson County has been on the rise in recent years, increasing from 42,190 in 2000 to 49,206 in 2005. During this period, Charles
Town has seen an increase in population of 16.6 . Berkeley County s population has grown from 75,905 in 2000 to an estimated 101,763 in 2007, making it the second-most populous county in West Virginia. Unemployment in Marion County has improved compared to that of the State of West Virginia from November 1995 through December 2007. As of December 2007, the overall
state rate was 4.4 compared to 3.7 for Marion County. During this same period of time, the Marion County Unemployment Rate has decreased from 8.9 to 3.7 , while the West Virginia rate declined from 7.5 to 4.4 . At December 31, 2007,
Harrison, Jefferson and Berkeley counties showed unemployment rates of 4.1 , 3.0 and 4.2 , respectively. Jefferson County s unemployment rate is much better than the state average, Marion County s rate is better than the state average,
and Harrison and Berkeley County s rates are about that of the state average. The future direction of unemployment will probably be driven by what occurs economically on a national level. MVB originates various types of loans, including commercial and commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans, home equity lines of credit, real estate
construction loans, and consumer loans (loans to individuals). In general, MVB retains most of its originated loans (exclusive of certain long-term, fixed rate residential mortgages that are sold servicing released). However, loans originated in
excess of MVB s legal lending limit are participated to other banking institutions and the servicing of those loans is retained by MVB. MVB has no loans to foreign entities. MVB s lending market area is primarily concentrated in the
Marion, Harrison and Jefferson Counties of West Virginia. Commercial Loans At December 31, 2007, MVB had outstanding approximately 128.5 million in commercial loans, including commercial, commercial real estate, financial and agricultural loans. These loans represented approximately
70.8 of the total aggregate loan portfolio as of that date. Lending Practices . Commercial lending entails significant additional risks as compared
with consumer lending (i.e., single-family residential mortgage lending, and installment lending). In addition, the payment experience on commercial loans typically depends on adequate cash flow of a business and thus may be subject, to a greater
extent, to adverse conditions in the general economy or in a specific industry. Loan terms include amortization schedules commensurate with the purpose of each loan, the source of repayment and the risk involved. The primary analysis technique used
in determining whether to grant a commercial loan is the review of a schedule of estimated cash flows to evaluate whether anticipated future cash flows will be adequate to service both interest and principal due. In addition, MVB reviews collateral
to determine its value in relation to the loan in the event of a foreclosure. MVB evaluates all new commercial loans, and on an annual basis mortgage
loans in excess of 300,000, as well as customers that have total outstanding loans that aggregate more than 500,000. If deterioration in credit worthiness has occurred, MVB takes effective and prompt action designed to assure repayment of the
loan. Upon detection of the reduced ability of a borrower to meet original cash flow obligations, the loan is considered a classified loan and reviewed for possible downgrading or placement on non-accrual status. Consumer Loans At December 31, 2007, MVB had outstanding
consumer loans in an aggregate amount of approximately 11.0 million or approximately 6 of the aggregate total loan portfolio.

 Lending Practices . Consumer loans generally involve more risk as to collectibility than mortgage loans because of
the type and nature of the collateral and, in certain instances, the absence of collateral. As a result, consumer lending collections are dependent upon the borrower s continued financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely
affected by employment loss, personal bankruptcy, or adverse economic conditions. Credit approval for consumer loans requires demonstration of sufficiency of income to repay principal and interest due, stability of employment, a positive credit
record and sufficient collateral for secured loans. It is the policy of MVB to review its consumer loan portfolio monthly and to charge off loans that do not meet its standards and to adhere strictly to all laws and regulations governing consumer
lending. Real Estate Loans At December 31, 2007,
MVB had approximately 42.0 million of residential real estate loans, home equity lines of credit, and construction mortgages outstanding, representing 23.2 of total loans outstanding. Lending Practices . MVB generally requires that the residential real estate loan amount be no more than 80 of the purchase price or the appraised value of the real estate securing the loan, unless the borrower
obtains private mortgage insurance for the percentage exceeding 80 . Occasionally, MVB may lend up to 100 of the appraised value of the real estate. The risk conditions of these loans are considered during underwriting for the purposes of
establishing an interest rate compatible with the risks inherent in mortgage lending and based on the equity of the home. Loans made in this lending category are generally one to five year adjustable rate, fully amortizing to maturity mortgages. MVB
also originates fixed rate real estate loans and generally sells these loans in the secondary market, servicing released. All real estate loans are secured by first mortgages with evidence of title in favor of MVB in the form of an attorney s
opinion of the title or a title insurance policy. MVB also requires proof of hazard insurance with MVB named as the mortgagee and as the loss payee. Generally, full appraisals are obtained from licensed appraisers for all loans secured by real
estate. Home Equity Loans . Home equity lines of credit are generally made as second mortgages by MVB. The maximum amount of a home equity line of
credit is generally limited to 80 of the appraised value of the property less the balance of the first mortgage. MVB will lend up to 100 of the appraised value of the property at higher interest rates which are considered compatible with the
additional risk assumed in these types of loans. The home equity lines of credit are written with 10 year terms, but are subject to review upon request for renewal. Construction Loans . Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan is
dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, MVB may
advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. Competition MVB experiences significant competition in attracting depositors and borrowers. Competition in lending activities comes principally from other commercial banks, savings
associations, insurance companies, governmental agencies, credit unions, brokerage firms and pension funds. The primary factors in competing for loans are interest rate and overall lending services. Competition for deposits comes from other
commercial banks, savings associations, money market funds and credit unions as well as from insurance companies and brokerage firms. The primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates paid on deposits, account liquidity, convenience
of office location, and overall financial condition. MVB believes that its community approach provides flexibility, which enables the bank to offer an array of banking products and services.

 MVB primarily focuses on the Marion, Harrison, Jefferson and Berkeley County markets for its products and services.
Management believes MVB has developed a niche and a level of expertise in serving this area. MVB operates under a needs-based selling approach
that management believes has proven successful in serving the financial needs of most customers. It is not MVB s strategy to compete solely on the basis of interest rates. Management believes that a focus on customer relationships and service
will promote our customers continued use of MVB s financial products and services and will lead to enhanced revenue opportunities. Supervision and Regulation The following is a summary of certain statutes and regulations affecting MVB and its subsidiaries and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations: Bank Holding Company Regulation . MVB is a bank holding company under the
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which restricts the activities of MVB and any acquisition by MVB of voting stock or assets of any bank, savings association or other company. MVB is also subject to the reporting requirements of, and examination and
regulation by, the Federal Reserve Board. MVB s subsidiary bank, MVB Bank, Inc., is subject to restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on transactions with affiliates, including any loans or extensions of credit to MVB or its
subsidiaries, investments in the stock or other securities thereof and the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower; the issuance of guarantees, acceptances or letters of credit on behalf of MVB and its
subsidiaries; purchases or sales of securities or other assets; and the payment of money or furnishing of services to MVB and other subsidiaries. MVB is prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5 of any class of voting
stock or substantially all of the assets of any bank holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. MVB and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with extensions of credit
and/or the provision of other property or services to a customer by MVB or its subsidiaries. On July 30, 2002, the Senate and the House of
Representatives of the United States (Congress) enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a law that addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate
information. The New York Stock Exchange proposed corporate governance rules that were enacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The changes are intended to allow stockholders to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of
companies and directors and should not significantly impact MVB. Effective August 29, 2002, as directed by Section 302(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley,
MVB s chief executive officer and chief financial officer are each required to certify that MVB s Quarterly and Annual Reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules have several requirements, including having
these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of MVB s internal controls; they have made certain disclosures to MVB s auditors and the audit committee of the
Board of Directors about MVB s internal controls; and they have included information in MVB s Quarterly and Annual Reports about their evaluation and whether there have been significant changes in MVB s internal controls or in other
factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the evaluation. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (also known as the Financial Services
Modernization Act of 1999) permits bank holding companies to become financial holding companies. This allows them to affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and to engage in other activities that are financial in nature. A bank
holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized, is well managed and has at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. No regulatory approval will be required for a
financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve Board.

Table of Contents 

 The Financial Services Modernization Act defines financial in nature to include: securities underwriting,
dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related to banking. A bank also
may engage, subject to limitations on investment, in activities that are financial in nature, other than insurance underwriting, insurance company portfolio investment, real estate development and real estate investment, through a financial
subsidiary of the bank, if the bank is well capitalized, well managed and has at least a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating. Banking
Subsidiary Regulation . MVB Bank, Inc. was chartered as a state bank and is regulated by the West Virginia Division of Banking and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank provides FDIC insurance on its deposits and is a member of the
Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001 (USA Patriot Act)
 The International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act was adopted in response to the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The Patriot Act provides law enforcement with greater powers to investigate terrorism and prevent future terrorist acts. Among the broad-reaching provisions contained in the Patriot Act are several designed
to deter terrorists ability to launder money in the United States and provide law enforcement with additional powers to investigate how terrorists and terrorist organizations are financed. The Patriot Act creates additional requirements for
banks, which were already subject to similar regulations. The Patriot Act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to require financial institutions to take certain special measures when the Secretary suspects that certain transactions
or accounts are related to money laundering. These special measures may be ordered when the Secretary suspects that a jurisdiction outside of the United States, a financial institution operating outside of the United States, a class of transactions
involving a jurisdiction outside of the United States or certain types of accounts are of primary money laundering concern. The special measures include the following: (a) require financial institutions to keep records and report on
the transactions or accounts at issue; (b) require financial institutions to obtain and retain information related to the beneficial ownership of any account opened or maintained by foreign persons; (c) require financial institutions to
identify each customer who is permitted to use a payable-through or correspondent account and obtain certain information from each customer permitted to use the account; and (d) prohibit or impose conditions on the opening or maintaining of
correspondent or payable-through accounts. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation The FDIC insures the deposits of the Bank which is subject to the applicable provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC may terminate a bank s deposit insurance upon finding that the institution
has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition enacted or imposed by the bank s regulatory agency. Federal Home Loan Bank The FHLB provides credit to its members in
the form of advances. As a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh, the Bank must maintain an investment in the capital stock of that FHLB in an amount equal to the greater of 1.0 of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of its respective residential
mortgage loans, home purchase contracts and similar obligations at the beginning of each year, or 5 of its advances from the FHLB.

 Capital Requirements Federal Reserve Board . The Federal Reserve Board has adopted risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating
risk-weighted assets by assigning assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. For further discussion regarding the Bank s risk-based capital requirements, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Financial Statements included in
Item 7 of this Form 10-KSB. West Virginia Division of Banking . State banks, such as MVB Bank, Inc. are subject to similar capital requirements
adopted by the West Virginia Division of Banking. Limits on Dividends MVB s ability to obtain funds for the payment of dividends and for other cash requirements largely depends on the amount of dividends the Bank declares. However, the Federal Reserve Board expects MVB to serve as
a source of strength to the Bank. The Federal Reserve Board may require MVB to retain capital for further investment in the Bank, rather than pay dividends to its shareholders. MVB Bank, Inc. may not pay dividends to MVB if, after paying those
dividends, the Bank would fail to meet the required minimum levels under the risk-based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage ratio requirements. The Bank must have the approval from the West Virginia Department of Banking if a dividend in any
year would cause the total dividends for that year to exceed the sum of the current year s net earnings as defined and the retained earnings for the preceding two years as defined, less required transfers to surplus. These provisions could
limit MVB s ability to pay dividends on its outstanding common shares. Federal and State Consumer Laws MVB Bank, Inc. is subject to regulatory oversight under various consumer protection and fair lending laws. These laws govern, among other things, truth-in-lending
disclosure, equal credit opportunity, fair credit reporting and community reinvestment. Failure to abide by federal laws and regulations governing community reinvestment could limit the ability of a bank to open a new branch or engage in a merger
transaction. Community reinvestment regulations evaluate how well and to what extent a bank lends and invests in its designated service area, with particular emphasis on low-to-moderate income communities and borrowers in such areas. Monetary Policy and Economic Conditions The business of financial
institutions is affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the policies of various governmental regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board regulates money and credit conditions and interest
rates to influence general economic conditions primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in the reserve requirements against depository institutions 
deposits. These policies and regulations significantly affect the overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans, as well as the interest rates paid on deposit accounts. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to
continue to have significant effects in the future. In view of the changing conditions in the economy and the money markets and the activities of monetary and fiscal authorities, MVB cannot predict future changes in interest rates, credit
availability or deposit levels. Effect of Environmental Regulation MVB s primary exposure to environmental risk is through its lending activities. In cases when management believes environmental risk potentially exists, MVB mitigates its environmental risk exposures by requiring
environmental site assessments at the time of loan origination to confirm collateral quality as to commercial real estate parcels

Table of Contents 

posing higher than normal potential for environmental impact, as determined by reference to present and past uses of the subject property and adjacent sites.
Environmental assessments are typically required prior to any foreclosure activity involving non-residential real estate collateral. With regard to
residential real estate lending, management reviews those loans with inherent environmental risk on an individual basis and makes decisions based on the dollar amount of the loan and the materiality of the specific credit. MVB anticipates no material effect on anticipated capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position as a result of compliance with federal, state or local
environmental protection laws or regulations. ITEM 2.
 DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY MVB Bank, Inc. owns its main office located at 301 Virginia Avenue in Fairmont, along with its offices

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Forward-looking Statements: The following discussion contains statements that refer to future expectations, contain projections of the results of operations or of financial condition, or state other
information that is forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are easily identified by the use of words such as could, anticipate, estimate, believe, and similar words that
refer to a future outlook. There is always a degree of uncertainty associated with forward-looking statements. MVB s management believes that the expectations reflected in such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and on
the facts and circumstances existing at the time of these disclosures. Actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated. Many factors
could cause MVB s actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Some factors, which could negatively affect the results, include: 

General economic conditions, either nationally or within MVB s market, could be less favorable than expected; 

Changes in market interest rates could affect interest margins and profitability; 

Competitive pressures could be greater than anticipated; 

Legal or accounting changes could affect MVB s results; and 

Adverse changes could occur in the securities and investments markets. In Management s Discussion and Analysis we review and explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for MVB Financial Corp. and its subsidiaries. We have designed this discussion to assist
you in understanding the significant changes in MVB s financial condition and results of operations. We have used accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to prepare the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We
engaged S.R. Snodgrass, A.C. to audit the consolidated financial statements and their independent audit report is included in Item 7 herein. Introduction The following discussion and analysis of the Consolidated Financial Statements of MVB is presented to provide insight into
management s assessment of the financial results and operations of MVB. MVB Bank, Inc. is the sole operating subsidiary of MVB and all comments, unless otherwise noted, are related to the Bank. You should read this discussion and analysis in
conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes and the ratios and statistics contained elsewhere in this Form 10-KSB. Application of Critical Accounting Policies MVB s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U. S. generally
accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements;
accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have
a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the
value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and
liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided
by other third-party sources, when available. When third-party information is not available, valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal forecasting techniques.

 The most significant accounting policies followed by the Bank are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in management s discussion and analysis of operations, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the
financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified the
determination of the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. The allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for
loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of losses inherent in classifications of homogeneous loans based on historical loss
experience of peer banks, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Non-homogeneous loans are specifically evaluated due to the increased risks inherent in those loans. The
loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type in the consolidated balance sheet. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors
driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the Allowance for Loan Losses section of this financial review. Recent
Accounting Pronouncements and Developments Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48 ). FIN 48 clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 will be effective for the Company s fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The adoption of FIN 48 did not materially impact the Company s
financial position, income or cash flows. Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS N. 157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157 ). SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard also responds
to investors request for expanded information about the extent to which a company measures assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. This Statement
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s
financial position. Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS no. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, and amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) SFAS 158 ). SFAS 158 requires the Company to (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as
the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation, (b) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during
the period, (c) measure defined benefit plan assets and defined benefit plan 
 
 12 

Table of Contents 

obligations as of the date of the Company s statement of financial position, and (d) disclose additional information about certain effects on net
periodic benefit costs in the upcoming fiscal year that arise from the delayed recognition of the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits. An employer with publicly traded equity securities is required to initially
recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of
the date of the employer s fiscal year-end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The adoption of FASB 158 did not have a material effect on the financial statements. The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The objective of the FAS No. 159 is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply the
complex provisions of hedge accounting. FAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on
or before November 15, 2007 provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company s
results of operations. Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Agreements
 In September 2006, the FASB reached consensus on the guidance provided by Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 06-4 EITF 06-4 ), Accounting for
Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements. The guidance is applicable to endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangements, whereby the employer owns and controls the
insurance policy, that are associated with a postretirement benefit. EITF 06-4 requires that for a split-dollar life insurance arrangement within the scope of the Issue, an employer should recognize a liability for future benefits in accordance with
FAS No. 106 (if, in substance, a postretirement benefit plan exists) or Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 12 (if the arrangement is, in substance, an individual deferred compensation contract) based on the substantive agreement with
the employee. EITF 06-4 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. The adoption of this EITF is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s results of operations. Accounting for Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life Insurance Agreements In March 2007, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 06-10 EITF 06-10 ), Accounting for Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life Insurance Agreements. EITF 06-10 provides guidance for determining a liability
for the postretirement benefit obligation as well as recognition and measurement of the associated asset on the basis of the terms of the collateral assignment agreement. EITF 06-10 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2007. The adoption of the EITF is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s results of operations. Several other new accounting
standards became effective during the periods presented or will be effective subsequent to December 31, 2007. None of these new standards had or is expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
 Summary Financial Results MVB earned 1.3 million in
2007 compared to 973,000 in 2006. The earnings equated to a 2007 return on average assets of .62 and a return on average equity of 5.78 , compared to prior year results of .58 and 4.86 , respectively. Basic earnings per share was .87 in 2007
compared to .68 in 2006. Diluted earnings per share was .85 in 2007 compared to .67 in 2006. The most significant factor in the increase in 2007 profitability was the performance of two offices added in 2005. Salaries expense increased by
 588,000, 
 
 13 

Table of Contents 

mostly relating to staffing of the additional office, as well as increases for existing staff and the addition of mortgage lending staff. Advertising expense
increased by 154,000 mostly relating to the Berkeley and Harrison County areas. Data processing expense increased by 76,000, the result of an increased volume of transactions and the increased offering of additional services such as online banking
and bill payment. Interest income increased by 3.3 million to 13.3 million and interest expense increased by 2.1 million to 6.4 million, resulting in an increase in net interest income of 1.2 million, mainly relating to the improved performance
of the new offices. Other income increased by 383,000, 131,000 of which related to income on loans held for sale and 56,000 in additional service charges on deposit accounts. In addition other income increased by 136,000, the largest item of
which was 48,000 from title insurance income. The 2007 results support MVB s belief that it has added further value to the franchise by establishing a presence in what we believe are two of the better markets in West Virginia. As these
locations have time to develop further in 2008, results of operations should continue to reap the rewards of the outlay of expenditures in 2005. While
operating in a challenging interest rate environment, the Bank achieved a 7.15 yield on earning assets in 2007 compared to 6.59 in 2006. Despite extensive competition, total loans increased to 181.5 million at December 31, 2007, from 142.6
million at December 31, 2006. The Bank s ability to originate quality loans is supported by a minimal delinquency rate. Deposits increased to
 157.4 million at December 31, 2007, from 134.6 million at December 31, 2006, due in large part to MVB s expansion into the Harrison and Jefferson County markets. MVB offers an uncomplicated product design accompanied by a simple fee
structure that is attractive to customers. The overall cost of funds for the bank was 3.94 in 2007 compared to 3.32 in 2006. This cost of funds, combined with the earning asset yield, resulted in a net interest margin of 3.71 in 2007 compared to
3.72 in 2006. The Bank maintained a high-quality, short-term investment portfolio during 2007 to provide liquidity in the balance sheet, to fund loan
growth, for repurchase agreements and to provide security for state and municipal deposits. Interest Income and Expense Net interest income is the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets
include loans and investment securities. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, borrowed funds such as sweep accounts, and repurchase agreements. Net interest income remains the primary source of revenue for MVB. Net
interest income is also impacted by changes in market interest rates, as well as the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is also impacted favorably by increases in non-interest bearing demand deposits
and equity. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets and serves as a measurement of the net
revenue stream generated by MVB s balance sheet. As noted above, the net interest margin was 3.71 in 2007 compared to 3.72 in 2006. The net interest margin continues to face considerable pressure due to competitive pricing of loans and
deposits in MVB s markets. During 2007, the Federal Reserve decreased interest rates three times for a total decrease of 1.00 which had little impact on MVB s interest margin, as they occurred in the late third and fourth quarter of the
year. Management s estimate of the impact of future changes in market interest rates is shown in the section captioned Interest Rate Risk. Management continues to analyze methods to deploy MVB s assets into an earning asset mix which will result in a stronger net interest margin. Loan growth continues to be strong and management anticipates that loan activity will remain
strong in the near term future. During 2007, net interest income increased by 1.2 million or 22.0 to 6.9 million in 2007 from 5.7 million in 2006.
This increase is largely due to the growth in average earning assets, primarily 33.3 million in loans. Average total earning assets were 
 
 14 

Table of Contents 

185.9 million in 2007 compared to 151.8 million in 2006. Average total loans grew to 158.5 million in 2007 from 124.8 million in 2006. Primarily as a
result of this growth, total interest income increased by 3.3 million, or 32.6 , to 13.3 million in 2007 from 10.0 million in 2006. Average interest-bearing liabilities, mainly deposits, likewise increased in 2007 by 30.5 million. Average
interest-bearing deposits grew to 108.9 million in 2007 from 86.4 million in 2006. Total interest expense increased by 2.0 million or 46.3 , to 6.4 million in 2007 from 4.4 million in 2006. This increase in interest expense was the result of a
62 basis point increase in interest cost from 2006 to 2007, along with an increase in average interest-bearing liabilities of 30.5 million. The growth in
the volume of earning assets during 2007 resulted in the yield on earning assets improving to 7.15 in 2007 from 6.59 in 2006. The loan portfolio yield increased by 49 basis points, due mainly to the volume of adjustable rate loans repricing as
interest rates increased throughout 2006, while MVB s investment portfolio yield increased by 33 basis points and interest-bearing deposits in banks yield increased by 76 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.94 in 2007 from 3.32 in 2006. This increase is primarily the result of the higher interest rates paid on money
market accounts, certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts and repurchase agreements.

 Provision for Loan Losses MVB s provision for loan losses for 2007 and 2006 were approximately 584,000 and 445,000, respectively. This increase principally relates to the increase in loans outstanding. Determining the appropriate level of the Allowance for Loan Losses (ALL) requires considerable management judgment. In exercising this judgment, management considers
numerous internal and external factors including, but not limited to, portfolio growth, national and local economic conditions, trends in the markets served and guidance from the Bank s primary regulators. Management seeks to maintain an ALL
that is appropriate in the circumstances and that complies with applicable accounting and regulatory standards. Further discussion can be found later in this discussion under Allowance for Loan Losses. Non-Interest Income Fees related to deposit accounts and cash
management accounts and income on loans held for sale represent the significant portion of the Bank s primary non-interest income. The total of non-interest income for 2007 was 1.6 million versus 1.2 million in 2006. The most significant increase in non-interest income from 2007 to 2006 was 136,000 in other income. This increase is primarily the result of the following: 48,000 in
title insurance income, 30,000 from a trust preferred transaction, 22,000 in investment commissions and 17,000 in credit card income. Other areas of significant increase in non-interest income were income on loans held for sale, which increased by
 131,000 to 377,000, service charges on deposit accounts which increased by 56,000 to 647,000 and visa debit card income which increased by 42,000 to 212,000. Loss on sale of securities during 2007 totaled 0 versus 4,000 in 2006. The Bank does not routinely sell securities from the portfolio, however, during 2006, some very small mortgage-backed securities were sold and replaced with higher
yielding agencies which were used for repurchase agreements. The Bank is constantly searching for new non-interest income opportunities that enhance
income and provide customer benefits. Non-Interest Expense Non-interest Expense was 6.2 million in 2007 versus 5.1 in 2006. Approximately 56 and 56 of non-interest expense for 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to personnel costs. Personnel is the lifeblood of every service organization,
which is why personnel cost is such a significant part of the expenditure mix. This increase in personnel cost from 2.9 million to 3.5 million represents staffing for the Berkeley office as well as salary adjustments for existing staff, and
additional staff in the mortgage loan area. Data processing comprised approximately 9.5 and 10.1 of total non-interest expense during 2007 and 2006,
respectively, growing from 517,000 in 2006 to 593,000 in 2007. This increase is the result of increasing account and transaction volumes from one year to the next and the continued focus on internet banking and bill payment services. 
 In 2007 other expense increased by 24.3 to 660,000. This was largely the result of increased FDIC insurance costs of 63,000, along with increased travel, training
and postage expense totaling 39,000.

 2006 compared to 2005 Net interest income increased by 1.3 million when comparing 2006 with 2005 results. This increase is largely due to growth in average earning assets, primarily loans, of 37.6 million in 2006. Average interest-bearing liabilities, mainly
deposits, increased by 32.8 million in 2006. This increase was due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of 19.5 million. Non-interest
income is comprised of fees related to deposit accounts and cash management accounts. Non-interest income was 1.2 million in 2006 compared to 876,000 in 2005. This increase was due primarily to increased focus on secondary market loans, along with
continued increases in service charges on deposit accounts and Visa debit card income. Non-interest expense reached 5.1 million in 2006 compared to 4.3
million in 2005. This increase is representative of the continued growth in the Harrison and Jefferson county markets. Income Taxes MVB incurred income tax expense of 414,000 in 2007 and 341,000 in 2006. The effective tax rate was 24 in 2007 and 26 2006. This decrease was due to the fact that MVB had tax credits relating to tax exempt interest on loans from 2004, 2005 and 2006. Return on Assets MVB s return on average assets was .62 in
2007, .58 in 2006 and .45 in 2005. The increased return in 2007 is a direct result of the improving performance of the Harrison and Jefferson offices as they continue to grow and mature. Return on Equity MVB s return on average stockholders 
equity ROE was 5.78 in 2007, compared to 4.86 in 2006 and 4.34 in 2005. The increased return in 2007 is a direct result of the improving performance of the Harrison and Jefferson offices as they continue to grow. Overview of the Statement of Condition The MVB balance sheet changed
significantly from 2006 to 2007. Loans increased by 38.9 million to 181.5 million at December 31, 2007. This increase was largely due to growth in Jefferson and Berkeley Counties, where 20.7 million in new loans were added to the portfolio,
along with Harrison County where loans increased by 13.4 million. Bank premises, furniture and equipment increased by 1.7 million as MVB has constructed a new facility in Berkeley County, West Virginia. Additionally, loans held for sale decreased
by 1.1 million and other assets increased by 1.7 million, 500,000 of which was additional bank owned life insurance, 393,000 accrued interest receivable and 330,000 of which was FHLB stock. Deposits increased by 22.9 million, 14.0 million
relating to Harrison County and 8.0 million relating to the eastern panhandle, comprised of Jefferson and Berkeley Counties. FHLB borrowings increased by 9.8 million, much of which was used to fund loan growth. Long-term debt increased by 4.1
million as MVB completed a trust preferred offering in the first quarter of 2007. Finally, stockholders equity increased by 1.9 million, 587,000 of which represents the beginning of a 4.0 million public offering began in 2007 and 1.3
million in 2007 earnings. These areas of growth are in large part the direct result of growth in the Harrison, Jefferson and Berkeley county markets, in addition to the continued success of MVB in the Marion County market.

 Cash and Cash Equivalents MVB s cash and cash equivalents totaled 4.9 million at December 31, 2007, compared to 6.4 million at December 31, 2006, a decrease of 1.5 million. This represents a decrease in the cash letter on the final day of the year.
 Management believes the current balance of cash and cash equivalents adequately serves MVB s liquidity and performance needs. Total cash and cash
equivalents fluctuate on a daily basis due to transactions in process and other liquidity demands. Management believes the liquidity needs of MVB are satisfied by the current balance of cash and cash equivalents, readily available access to
traditional and non-traditional funding sources, and the portions of the investment and loan portfolios that mature within one year. These sources of funds should enable MVB to meet cash obligations as they come due. Investment Securities Investment securities totaled 27.8 million at
December 31, 2007, compared to 28.7 million at December 31, 2006. MVB s investment securities are primarily classified as
available-for-sale. Management believes the available-for-sale classification provides flexibility for MVB in terms of managing the portfolio for liquidity, yield enhancement and interest rate risk management opportunities. At December 31,
2007, the amortized cost of MVB s investment securities totaled 28.1 million, resulting in unrealized depreciation in the investment portfolio of 266,000. Management monitors the earnings performance and liquidity of the investment portfolio on a regular basis through Investment/Asset and Liability Committee IALC meetings. The IALC also monitors net interest income and manages
interest rate risk for MVB. Through active balance sheet management and analysis of the investment securities portfolio, MVB maintains sufficient liquidity to satisfy depositor requirements and the various credit needs of its customers. Management
believes the risk characteristics inherent in the investment portfolio are acceptable based on these parameters. Loans MVB s lending is primarily focused in Marion, Harrison, Berkeley and Jefferson County, West Virginia with a secondary focus on the adjacent counties in West
Virginia. The portfolio consists principally of commercial lending, retail lending, which includes single-family residential mortgages and consumer lending. Loans totaled 181.5 million as of December 31, 2007, compared to 142.6 million at
December 31, 2006. During 2007, MVB experienced loan growth of 38.9 million, 13.4 million in Harrison County and 20.7 million in Jefferson and
Berkeley counties combined. The most significant portion of the growth came in the commercial and non-residential real estate area. Commercial and non-residential real estate loans grew approximately 45.4 million. At December 31, 2007, commercial loans represented the largest portion of the portfolio approximating 70.8 of the total loan portfolio. Commercial loans totaled
 128.5 million at December 31, 2007, compared to 83.1 million at December 31, 2006. Management will continue to focus on the enhancement and growth of the commercial loan portfolio while maintaining appropriate underwriting standards and
risk/price balance. Management expects commercial loan demand to continue to be strong in 2008.

 Residential real estate loans to MVB s retail customers (including home equity lines of credit) account for the
second largest portion of the loan portfolio, comprising 23.1 of MVB s total loan portfolio. Residential real estate loans totaled 42.0 million at December 31, 2007, compared to 48.1 million at December 31, 2006. Included in
residential real estate loans are home equity credit lines totaling 12.4 million at December 31,2007, compared to 10.7 million at December 31, 2006. Management believes the home equity loans are competitive products with an acceptable
return on investment after risk considerations. Residential real estate lending continues to represent a primary focus of MVB s lending due to the lower risk factors associated with this type of loan and the opportunity to provide service to
those in the Marion, Harrison and Jefferson County markets. Residential real estate portfolio loans were down due to MVB s increased focus on secondary market lending, to better serve customers by offering attractive long-term rates.
 Consumer lending continues to be a part of MVB s core lending. At December 31, 2007, consumer loan balances totaled 11.0 million compared to
 11.4 million at December 31, 2006. The majority of MVB s consumer loans are in the direct lending area. Management is pleased with the performance and quality of the consumer loan portfolio, which can be attributed to the many years of
experience of its consumer lenders. This is another important product necessary to serve MVB s market areas.

Loan Concentration At December 31, 2007, commercial loans comprised the largest component of the loan portfolio. There are very few commercial loans that are not secured by real estate. Such non-real estate secured loans generally are lines of credit
secured by accounts receivable. While the loan concentration is in commercial loans, the commercial portfolio is comprised of loans to many different borrowers, in numerous different industries but primarily located in our market areas. 
 Allowance for Loan Losses Management continually monitors the
risk in the loan portfolio through review of the monthly delinquency reports and the Loan Review Committee. The Loan Review Committee is responsible for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. This analysis involves both
experience of the portfolio to date and the makeup of the overall portfolio. Specific loss estimates are derived for individual loans based on specific criteria such as current delinquent status, related deposit account activity, where applicable,
local market rumors, which are generally based on some factual information, and changes in the local and national economy. While local market rumors are not measurable or perhaps not readily supportable, historically, this form of information has
been a valuable indication of a potential problem.

 The result of the evaluation of the adequacy at each period presented herein indicated that the allowance for loan losses
was considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 MVB had impaired loans totaling 470,000 and
 5,000 respectively. Included in these totals were non-accrual loans totaling 469,000 and 5,000 respectively. A portion of the Allowance for Loan Losses was allocated to cover any loss in these loans. Loans past due more than 30 days were
 2,152,000 and 2,276,000, respectively at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

 Non-performing assets consist of loans that are no longer accruing interest, loans that have been renegotiated to below
market rates based upon financial difficulties of the borrower, and real estate acquired through foreclosure. When interest accruals are suspended, accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to earnings and prior year
amounts generally charged off as a credit loss. When, in management s judgment, the borrower s ability to make periodic interest and principal payments resumes and collectibility is no longer in doubt, the loan is returned to accrual
status. Non-performing assets and past due loans:

 Funding Sources MVB considers a number of alternatives, including but not limited to deposits, short-term borrowings, and long-term borrowings when evaluating funding sources. Traditional deposits continue to be the most significant source of funds for
MVB, totaling 157.4 million, or 78.4 of MVB s funding sources at December 31, 2007. This same information at December 31, 2006 reflected 134.6 million in deposits representing 79.8 of such funding sources. Cash management
accounts, which are available to large corporate customers represented 9.9 and 12.0 of MVB s funding sources at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh for specific purposes
represented the remainder of such funding sources. Management continues to emphasize the development of additional non-interest-bearing deposits as a core
funding source for MVB. At December 31, 2007, non-interest-bearing balances totaled 19.1 million compared to 19.8 million at December 31, 2006 or 12.1 and 14.7 of total deposits respectively. Interest-bearing deposits totaled 138.3 million at December 31, 2007, compared to 114.8 million at December 31, 2006. On a percentage basis, Certificates of
Deposits compose the largest component of MVB s deposits. Average interest-bearing liabilities totaled 161.9 million during 2007 compared to 131.4 million during 2006. Average non-interest bearing liabilities totaled 21.4 million during 2007
compared to 17.5 million during 2006. Management will continue to emphasize deposit gathering in 2008 by offering outstanding customer service and competitively priced products.

 Along with traditional deposits, MVB has access to both overnight repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank
borrowings to fund its operations and investments. MVB s repurchase agreements totaled 19.8 million at December 31, 2007, compared to 20.2 million in 2006. Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings totaled 23.6 million at December 31,
2007, compared to 13.8 million at year-end 2006. Capital/Stockholders Equity During the year ended December 31, 2007, stockholders equity increased approximately 1.9 million to 23.5 million. This increase consists of 587,000 raised through the beginning of a public stock offering
begun in 2007 and MVB s net income for the year of 1.3 million. MVB paid no dividends during 2007 or 2006. At December 31, 2007, accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) totaled 405,000), an increase in the loss of 32,000 from December 31, 2006. This principally represents net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities, net of income taxes, and the adjustment to apply
FASB statement No. 158, net of income taxes, at December 31, 2007. Because the vast majority of all the investment securities in MVB s portfolio are classified as available-for-sale, both the investment and equity sections of
MVB s balance sheet are more sensitive to the changing market values of investments than those institutions that classify more of their investment portfolio as held to maturity . Interest rate fluctuations between year-end 2007 and
2006 resulted in the change in market value of the portfolio. MVB has also complied with the standards of capital adequacy mandated by the banking
industry. Bank regulators have established risk-based capital requirements designed to measure capital adequacy. Risk-based capital ratios reflect the relative risks of various assets banks hold in their portfolios. A weight category of
either 0 (lowest risk assets), 20 , 50 , or 100 (highest risk assets) is assigned to each asset on the balance sheet. Detailed information concerning MVB s risk-based capital ratios can be found in Note 14 of the Notes to the Audited
Financial Statements. At December 31, 2007, MVB s risk-based capital ratios were above the minimum standards for a well-capitalized institution. MVB s risk-based capital ratio of 14.5 at December 31, 2007, is above the
well-capitalized standard of 10 . MVB s Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.6 also exceeded the 
 
 25 

Table of Contents 

well-capitalized minimum of 6 . The leverage ratio at December 31, 2007, was 11.5 and was also above the well-capitalized standard of 5 . Management
believes MVB s capital continues to provide a strong base for profitable growth. Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity The objective of MVB s asset/liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within its policy guidelines. This objective is
accomplished through management of MVB s balance sheet liquidity and interest rate risk exposure based on changes in economic conditions, interest rate levels, and customer preferences. Interest Rate Risk The most significant market risk resulting from
MVB s normal course of business, extending loans and accepting deposits, is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the potential for economic loss due to future interest rate changes which can impact both the earnings stream as well as
market values of financial assets and liabilities. MVB s Investment/ Asset/ Liability Committee (IALC) is responsible for the overall review and management of the Bank s balance sheets related to the management of interest rate risk. The
IALC strives to keep MVB focused on the future, anticipating and exploring alternatives, rather than simply reacting to change after the fact. To this
end, the IALC has established an interest risk management policy that sets the minimum requirements and guidelines for monitoring and controlling the level and amount of interest rate risk. The objective of the interest rate risk policy is to
encourage management to adhere to sound fundamentals of banking while allowing sufficient flexibility to exercise the creativity and innovations necessary to meet the challenges of changing markets. The ultimate goal of these policies is to optimize
net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy, liquidity, and safety. The IALC relies on different methods of assessing interest
rate risk including simulating net interest income, monitoring the sensitivity of the net present market value of equity or economic value of equity, and monitoring the difference or gap between maturing or rate-sensitive assets and liabilities over
various time periods. The IALC places emphasis on simulation modeling as the most beneficial measurement of interest rate risk due to its dynamic measure. By employing a simulation process that measures the impact of potential changes in interest
rates and balance sheet structures, and by establishing limits on changes in net income and net market value, the IALC is better able to evaluate the possible risks associated with alternative strategies. The simulation process starts with a base case simulation which represents projections of current balance sheet growth trends. Base case simulation results are prepared
under a flat interest rate forecast and what is perceived to be the most likely alternative interest rate forecast. Comparisons showing the earnings variance from the flat rate forecast illustrate the risks associated with the current balance sheet
strategy. If necessary, additional balance sheet strategies are developed and simulations prepared. The results from model simulations are reviewed for indications of whether current interest rate risk strategies are accomplishing their goal and, if
not, what alternative strategies should be considered. The policy calls for periodic review by the IALC of assumptions used in the modeling. The IALC
believes that it is beneficial to monitor interest rate risk for both the short-and long-term. Therefore, to effectively evaluate results from model simulations, limits on changes in net interest income and the value of the balance sheet have been
established. The IALC has determined that the earnings at risk of the Bank shall not change more than 10 from the base case for a 1 shift in interest rates, nor more than 15 from the base case for a 2 shift in interest rates. MVB is
in compliance with this policy as of December 31, 2007.

 Liquidity Maintenance of a sufficient level of liquidity is a primary objective of the IALC. Liquidity, as defined by the IALC, is the ability to meet anticipated operating cash needs, loan demand, and deposit withdrawals, without incurring a
sustained negative impact on net interest income. It is MVB s policy to manage liquidity so that there is no need to make unplanned sales of assets or to borrow funds under emergency conditions. The main source of liquidity for MVB comes through deposit growth. Liquidity is also provided from cash generated from investment maturities, principal payments from
loans, and income from loans and investment securities. During the year ended December 31, 2007, cash provided by financing activities totaled 37.0 million, while outflows from investing activity totaled 41.1 million. When appropriate, MVB
has the ability to take advantage of external sources of funds such as advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and national market certificate of deposit issuance programs. These external sources often provide attractive interest rates and
flexible maturity dates that enable MVB to match funding with contractual maturity dates of assets. Securities in the investment portfolio are primarily classified as available-for-sale and can be utilized as an additional source of liquidity.
 Off-Balance Sheet Commitments MVB has entered into
certain agreements that represent off-balance sheet arrangements that could have a significant impact on MVB s financial statements and could have a significant impact in future periods. Specifically, MVB has entered into agreements to extend
credit or provide conditional payments pursuant to standby and commercial letters of credit. Further discussion of these agreements, including the amounts outstanding at December 31, 2007, is included in Note 7 to the financial statements.

 MVB s fourth quarter net income was 328,000 in 2007 compared to 325,000 in the fourth quarter of 2006. This equated to basic earnings per share,
on a quarterly basis, of .22 in 2007 and .23 in 2006. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2007 and 2006 was .22 and .22, respectively. Net interest income increased in each quarter during 2007 and was 1.87 million in the fourth
quarter of 2007 compared to 1.54 million in 2006. Non-interest income was 455,000 in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to 357,000 in 2006. Non-interest expense increased to 1.65 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 from 1.30 million in
2006. Future Outlook The Bank s net income in
2007 exceeded the levels prior to the opening of a new office in Harrison County and the purchase of an existing office in Jefferson County during 2005. These results support management s belief that the new markets will make more opportunities
available to MVB in the future years. Due to continued customer acceptance of our customer service commitment, MVB has become a strong competitor in the Marion, Harrison, Jefferson and Berkeley County markets. MVB will strive to continue penetrating
its markets with an emphasis on customer service with the highest quality products and technology. Future plans for the Bank involve the Bank taking
advantage of both technology and personal customer contact. The Bank continues to expand delivery channels to better serve both retail and business banking customers. In addition to top of the line technology, the Bank is committed to
providing individual and personal banking services. MVB will continue to search for quality banking locations as well as exploring alternative delivery systems.

 Note 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Operations MVB Financial Corp., the
Company , provides banking services to the domestic market with the primary market areas being the Marion, Harrison, Jefferson and Berkeley counties of West Virginia. To a large extent, the operations of the Company, such as loan portfolio
management and deposit growth, are directly affected by the market area economies. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MVB
Financial Corp. Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Estimates, such as the allowance for loan losses, are based upon known facts and circumstances. Estimates are revised by management in the period such facts and circumstances change. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
 Investment Securities Debt
securities that management has the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discounts computed by the interest method from purchase date to
maturity. Other marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale, net of the deferred income tax effect, are recognized as direct increases or
decreases in stockholders equity. Cost of securities sold is recognized using the specific identification method. Loans Held for
Sale Through Taylor, Bean and Whitaker, MVB Bank, Inc. has the ability to offer customers long-term fixed rate mortgage products without
holding these instruments in the bank s loan portfolio. After thorough review of the contract with Taylor, Bean and Whitaker, the Company has concluded that no material derivative instruments exist. Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses Loans
are stated at the amount of unpaid principal reduced by an allowance for loan losses. Loans are considered delinquent when scheduled principal or interest payments are 31 days past due. Interest income on loans is recognized on an accrual basis. The
allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The Company consistently applies a quarterly loan review process to continually evaluate loans for changes in credit risk.
This process serves as the primary means by which the Company evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, and is based upon periodic review of the collectibility of loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the
loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are
susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The
specific component relates to loans that are impaired. The general component covers non-classified loans and is based upon historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. A loan is considered impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled
payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled
principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and shortages generally are not classified as impaired. Generally the Company considers impaired loans to include loans classified as non-accrual loans and
loans past due for longer than 90 days.

Table of Contents 

 Loan Origination Fees and Costs Loan origination fees and costs are accounted for according to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 91, which requires that loan origination and commitment fees and direct loan origination costs be
deferred and the net amount amortized as an adjustment of the related loan s yield. Bank Premises, Furniture and Equipment Bank premises, furniture and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The provision for depreciation is computed for financial
reporting by the straight-line-method based on the estimated useful lives of assets, which range from 7 to 40 years on buildings and leasehold improvements and 3 to 10 years on furniture, fixtures and equipment. Intangible Assets The excess of the cost of an acquired
company over the fair value of the net assets and identified intangibles acquired is recorded as goodwill. The net carrying amount of intangible assets was 975 at December 31, 2007. Other Investments Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock is
recorded at cost and considered to be restricted as the Company is required by the FHLB to hold this investment, and the only market for this stock is the issuing agency. FHLB stock totaled 1,181 and 851 at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. The Company also holds 187 in Silverton Bank, N.A. stock at December 31, 2007. Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense
reported in the financial statements and those reported for income tax purposes. The differences relate principally to accretion of discounts on investment securities, provision for loan losses, minimum pension liability, and differences between
book and tax methods of depreciation. Stock Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123R) which was issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) in December 2004. SFAS No. 123R revises SFAS 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, (APB No. 25) and its related
interpretations. Under SFAS No. 123R, the Company is required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for any unvested options previously granted. Foreclosed Assets Held for Resale Foreclosed assets held
for resale acquired in satisfaction of mortgage obligations and in foreclosure proceedings are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs at the time of foreclosure, with any valuation adjustments charged to the
allowance for loan losses. Any unrealized gains or losses on sale are then recorded in other non-interest expense. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company held other real estate of 55 and 0. Net Income Per Common Share Diluted net income per common
share includes any dilutive effects of stock options, and is computed by dividing net income by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of options under The Company s 2003 Stock
Incentive Plan. Comprehensive Income Accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Although certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities
and minimum pension liability, are reported as a separate component of the equity section of the balance sheet, such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income. Reclassifications Certain amounts in the 2006 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
2007 financial statement presentation.

Table of Contents 

 Investment securities with a carrying value of 20,512 and 20,904 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were
pledged to secure public funds and repurchase agreements. The Company s investment portfolio includes securities that are in an unrealized loss
position as of December 31, 2007, the details of which are included in the following table. Although these securities, if sold at December 31, 2007 would result in a pretax loss of 361, the Company has no intent to sell the applicable
securities at such market values, and maintains the Company has the ability to hold these securities until all principal has been recovered. Declines in the market values of these securities can be traced to general market conditions which reflect
the prospect for the economy as a whole. When determining other-than-temporary impairment on securities, the Company considers such factors as adverse conditions specifically related to a certain security or to specific conditions in an industry or
geographic area, the time frame securities have been in an unrealized loss position, the Company s ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in value, whether or not the security has been
downgraded by a rating agency, and whether or not the financial condition of the security issuer has severely deteriorated. As of December 31, 2007,
the Company considers all securities with unrealized loss positions to be temporarily impaired, and consequently, does not believe the Company will sustain any material realized losses as a result of the current temporary decline in market value.
 The following table discloses investments in an unrealized loss position: At December 31, 2007, total temporary impairment totaled 361.

unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had
impaired loans totaling 470 and 5, respectively, with an allocated reserve for such loans sufficient to cover possible losses. Included in these totals were non-accrual loans totaling 469 and 5, respectively.

In March 2007 the Company completed the private placement of 4 million Floating Rate, Trust
Preferred Securities through its MVB Financial Statutory Trust I subsidiary (the Trust ). The Company established the Trust for the sole purpose of issuing the Trust Preferred Securities pursuant to an Amended and Restated Declaration of
Trust. The proceeds from the sale of the Trust Preferred Securities will be loaned to the Company under subordinated Debentures (the Debentures issued to the Trust pursuant to an Indenture. The Debentures are the only asset of the
Trust. The Trust Preferred Securities have been issued to a pooling vehicle that will use the distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities to securitize note obligations. The securities issued by the Trust are includable for regulatory purposes
as a component of the Company s Tier I capital. The Trust Preferred Securities and the Debentures mature in 30 years and are
redeemable by the Company after five years. Interest payments are due in March, June, September and December and are adjusted at the interest due dates at a rate of 1.62 over the three month LIBOR Rate. The Company reflects borrowed funds in the
amount of 4.1 million as of December 31, 2007 and interest expense of 225 for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Borrowings from the FHLB are secured by stock in the FHLB of Pittsburgh, qualifying first mortgage
loans, mortgage-backed securities and certain investment securities. Additionally the Bank has a line of credit of 4,500 available from
Silverton Bank, N.A. There were no borrowings against this line of credit at December 31, 2007 or 2006. NOTE 7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk The
Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.
These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition. The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the
contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent
future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customers credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount and type of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, varies and is based on
management s credit evaluation of the customer. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to
guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is
essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The Company s policy for obtaining collateral, and the nature of such collateral, is essentially the same as that involved in making commitments to extend credit.
 Total contractual amounts of the commitments as of December 31 were as follows: (Dollars in thousands)

Concentration of Credit Risk The Company grants a majority of its commercial, financial, agricultural, real estate and installment loans to customers throughout the Marion, Harrison,
Jefferson and Berkeley County areas of West Virginia and adjacent counties. Collateral for loans is primarily residential and commercial real estate, personal property, and business equipment. The Company evaluates the credit worthiness of each of
its customers on a case-by-case basis, and the amount of collateral it obtains is based upon management s credit evaluation.

 NOTE 8. INCOME TAXES The Company records income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (FAS 109), Accounting for Income Taxes. FASB 109 is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred
income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of other assets and liabilities. The amount reflected as income taxes represents federal and state income taxes on financial statement income. Certain items of income and expense,
primarily the provision for possible loan losses, allowance for losses on foreclosed assets held for resale, depreciation, and accretion of discounts on investment securities are reported in different accounting periods for income tax purposes.
 The provisions for income taxes for the years ended December 31, were as follows: (Dollars in thousands)

 NOTE 14. REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements
can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines the Bank must meet
specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital amounts and classifications are
also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Quantitative measures
established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier I capital to average assets, as defined. As of December 31, 2007 and
2006, the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. The most recent notification from the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, and Tier I
leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. Both the Company s and the Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios are presented in the table below.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The following summarizes the methods and significant assumptions used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments. Short-term financial instruments: The carrying values of short-term financial instruments including cash and due from banks, interest bearing
balances - FHLB, and certificates of deposit in other banks approximate the fair value of these instruments. Securities: Estimated
fair values of securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable securities. Loans: The estimated fair values for loans are computed based on scheduled future cash flows of principal and interest, discounted at interest
rates currently offered for loans with similar terms of borrowers of similar credit quality. No prepayments of principal are assumed. Accrued interest receivable and payable: The carrying values of accrued interest receivable and payable approximate their estimated fair values. Repurchase agreements: The fair values of repurchase agreements approximate their estimated fair values. Deposits: The estimated fair values of demand deposits (i.e., non interest bearing checking, NOW and money market), savings accounts and other variable rate deposits approximate their carrying values. Fair values of fixed maturity
deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology at rates currently offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities. Any intangible value of long-term relationships with depositors is not considered in estimating the fair
values disclosed. Off-balance sheet instruments: The fair values of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are
estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into 
 
 45 

Table of Contents 

account the remaining terms of agreements and the present credit standing of the counterparties. The amounts of fees currently charged on commitments and
standby letters of credit are deemed insignificant, and therefore, the estimated fair values and carrying values are not shown. The
carrying values and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments are summarized as follows:

 Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information
about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a
significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are 
 
 46 

Table of Contents 

based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other
factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Fair value estimates
are based on existing on-and-off balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders MVB Financial Corp. 
 Fairmont, West Virginia We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet of MVB Financial Corp. and subsidiaries as of December 31. 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on our audit. The financial statements of MVB Financial Corp. and subsidiaries for the
year ended December 31, 2006, were audited by other auditors whose report, dated February 13, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management as well as the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the 2007 consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects the consolidated financial position of MVB Financial Corp. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the year then ended, in corformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We were not engaged to examine management s assertion about the effectiveness of MVB Financial Corp. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, which is included in Form 10-K and, accordingly, we do
not express an opinion thereon.

 ITEM 8.
 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE The Audit Committee and Board of
Directors approved dismissing the current MVB independent certifying accountants, Brown, Edwards Company, L.L.P. BE ), Bluefield, WV, upon completion of the examination of MVB s 2006 financial statements. BE was informed
of this change on January 8, 2007. Brown Edwards also reviewed the MVB 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-KSB prior to its filing. The dismissal is
totally related to the proposed cost for the examination of the 2007 MVB financial statements. Brown Edwards has examined the financial statements for
2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. For 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, the financial statements of MVB contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle. The recommendation to change accountants was approved by the Audit Committee and Board of Directors of MVB. There were no disagreements with Brown Edwards on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures.
 MVB filed a Form 8-K/A on January 8, 2007 regarding a change in accountants. We requested a letter from the dismissed accountants asking that they
furnish a letter to the Commission as to whether or not they agreed with the statements made by MVB. Brown, Edwards Company, L.L.P. furnished a letter addressed to the Commission stating that they agreed with MVB s statements. A copy
of the letter dated January 16, 2007, was filed as Exhibit 16 to the Form 8-K/A. The Audit Committee and Board of Directors of MVB have elected to
engage new accountants to audit MVB s financial statements for 2007. S.R. Snodgrass, A.C., Certified Public Accountants and Consultants Snodgrass ), Wheeling, WV as the new accounting firm to audit the financial statements for MVB
for 2007. Based on the proposal received from Snodgrass, it is expected that they will also audit the financial statements of MVB for 2008 and 2009. MVB
did not discuss the application of accounting principles to a specific completed or contemplated transaction, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on MVB s financial statements and neither written or oral advice was provided that
was an important factor considered by MVB in reaching a decision as to an accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue. ITEM 8A (T) 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management,
including the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer, along with the Company s Chief Financial Officer (the Principal Financial Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness as of December 31, 2007, of the design and operation of
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based upon that evaluation, the Company s
President and Chief Executive Officer, along with the Company s Principal Accounting Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2007. There have been no material changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2007 that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a significant deficiency (as defined in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 2), or a combination of significant
deficiencies, that results in there being more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by management or employees in the normal course of
performing their assigned functions. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007. Management s assessment did not identify any material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Because there were no material weaknesses discovered,
management believes that, as of December 31, 2007, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective. This annual report
does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subjected to attestation by the Company s registered public
accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.

 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE MVB and the Bank have, and expect to continue to
have, banking and other transactions in the ordinary course of business with its directors and officers and their affiliates, including members of their families or corporations, partnerships or other organizations in which officers or directors
have a controlling interest, on substantially the same terms (including documentation, price, interest rates and collateral, repayment and amortization schedules and default provisions) as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions
with unrelated parties. All of these transactions were made on substantially the same terms (including interest rates, collateral and repayment terms on loans) as comparable transactions with non-affiliated persons. MVB s management believes
that these transactions did not involve more than the normal business risk of collection or include any unfavorable features. Total loans outstanding from
the Bank at December 31, 2007 to MVB and Bank officers and directors as a group and members of their immediate families and companies in which they had an ownership interest

 CODE OF ETHICS

Code of Ethics 

Exhibit 14 MVB Financial Corp and MVB Bank, Inc. C ODE OF E THICS FOR S ENIOR F INANCIAL O FFICERS Approved May 1, 2007 This policy
applies to all senior financial officers of MVB Financial Corp. MVBFC and MVB Bank, Inc. MVB ). The senior financial officers of MVBFC and MVB include James R. Martin, Chief Executive Officer; Larry F. Mazza, Executive Vice
President; Eric L. Tichenor, Chief Financial Officer and Roger J. Turner, Senior Vice President Covered Persons ). This Code
of Ethics is required by the United States securities laws and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission as being necessary to deter wrongdoing and to promote: (i) honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
relationships, (ii) avoidance of conflicts of interest, including disclosure to an appropriate person or persons identified in the code of
any material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to such a conflict, (iii) full, fair, accurate,
timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that MVBFC and MVB files with, or submits to, the Commission and in other public communications made by MVFBC and MVB, (iv) compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations, (v) the prompt internal reporting of code violations to an appropriate person or persons identified in the code; and (vi) accountability for adherence to the code. If you have any questions regarding this Code, please refer
to your immediate supervisor, or, with more difficult questions, please feel free to contact the Chief Executive Officer or the Chairman of the Board of Directors. 1. Each Covered Person must avoid any transaction or arrangement that would create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest between personal and professional relationships. 
 A conflict of interest may be generally defined as a conflict between the Covered Person s private interests and his or her responsibilities to
MVBFC and MVB or an entity with which MVBFC and MVB maintains a relationship. A conflict of interest can also arise when an immediate family member is involved in a transaction or arrangement that in any way casts doubt upon the Covered
Person s independence. An immediate family member includes a Covered Person s spouse, parents, children, siblings, mothers and fathers-in-law, sons and daughters-in-law, brothers-in-law, and anyone (other than employees) who
shares the Covered Person s home. 2. Covered Persons may only accept items of nominal value as gifts from MVBFC and MVB or any
individual or entity that is involved or seeks to become involved in a business relationship with MVBFC and MVB. Gifts to Covered
Persons must be inexpensive, unsolicited and not given with the objective of influencing the Covered Person s judgment. It is acceptable for a Covered Person to accept modest meals or other inexpensive forms of entertainment from individuals or
entities that are 

involved or seek to become involved in a business relationship with MVBFC and MVB as long as these items are not provided in order to influence the Covered
Person s business judgment or decision. Under no circumstances is a Covered Person permitted to accept payments, loans, kickbacks, bribes, special privileges or services from anyone. If there are any questions or borderline case, Covered
Persons should discuss them with the General Counsel or designee of the General Counsel. 3. All Covered Persons are responsible for
maintaining accurate financial records for MVBFC and MVB. Covered Persons must closely adhere to the following accounting guidelines:
 (i) All assets, liabilities and transactions of MVBFC and MVB should be accurately recorded in accordance with MVBFC s
and MVB s record keeping procedures and generally accepted accounting principles; (ii) No false or misleading entries
are permitted to be knowingly made or caused to be made in MVBFC s and MVB s record books, even if such entries would not be material to MVBFC and MVB or its operations as a whole; and (iii) Any entries that are inaccurate, false or irregular should be promptly reported to a member of the Audit Committee for an immediate
corrective action. 4. Covered Persons must recognize that confidential information is an asset of MVBFC and MVB, and must refrain from
using inside information to their personal advantage. Covered Persons must maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted to
them by MVBFC and MVB or its customers or suppliers, except when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated. Confidential information includes all non-public information that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to MVBFC and MVB or its
customers or suppliers, if disclosed. At its core, the prohibition against insider trading focuses on the buying, selling or trading in
securities using non-public information. The prohibition applies to securities of MVBFC and MVB as well as to customers and suppliers of MVBFC and MVB, or any entity with which MVBFC and MVB has a business relationship. Covered Persons are in a unique position to acquire non-public information about MVBFC and MVB, and such information might influence their decision to
buy, sell or trade securities. In addition to refraining from using inside information in making their own investment decisions, Covered Persons should also avoid discussing the inside information with friends or immediate family members (whether at
home or in the public) or mailing or faxing the inside information to outside sources unless appropriate confidentiality agreements are in place to ensure that material, non-public information is not used improperly. 5. The conduct of Covered Persons should be governed by the highest standards of integrity and fairness. Covered Persons should avoid those situations in which outside personal interests conflict with MVBFC s and MVB s business. These situations
include: (i) Ownership by a Covered Person, or a member of his or her immediate family, of a material financial interest in
any outside enterprise that is involved or seeks to become involved in a business relationship with MVBFC and MVB; (ii)
Ownership by a Covered Person, or a member of his or her immediate family, of a material financial interest in any outside enterprise that competes for business with MVBFC and MVB; 

(iii) Outside employment of a Covered Person, or a member of his or her immediate family,
whether as a consultant, director, officer, employee or independent contractor, with an entity that is involved or seeks to become involved in a business relationship with MVBFC and MVB; or (iv) Appointment of a Covered Person, or a member of his or her immediate family, to a public office, board or commission that may create
an appearance of a conflict of interest between the goals and purposes of that organization and MVBFC and MVB s business. Such appointment would include a public service organization or a not-for-profit organization. 6. Covered Persons must not take for themselves opportunities that they discover while working for MVBFC and MVB, or use corporate property or
information for personal gain. Covered Persons must not (a) take personal advantage of a situation or knowledge acquired through
the use of his or her position or MVBFC s and MVB s property, if the situation or knowledge could be used for MVBFC s and MVB s benefit, (b) use his or her position or MVBFC and MVB property or information for personal gain,
or (c) compete with the MVBFC and MVB. Covered Persons owe a duty to the MVBFC and MVB to advance its interests whenever the opportunity arises. 7. In drafting periodic reports that are to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Covered Persons should take all steps necessary to ensure full, fair, accurate, timely and complete disclosure. 
 (i) Go Beyond the Minimum Disclosure Required by Law . While in the past periodic reporting has focused on disclosing
only those items that were mandated by the law, Covered Persons should go beyond the minimum requirements to convey the full financial picture of MVBFC and MVB to the public. Areas of special attention include: off-balance sheet structures, insider
and affiliated party transactions, board relationships, accounting policies, and auditor relationships. (ii) Make Sure
All Relationships that Could Give Rise to Any Perceived Conflicts are Fully Disclosed . Given the recent focus of lawmakers on a more complete disclosure of any material conflict of interest to the public, it is important to ensure that any
transaction that threatens to create the appearance of a conflict of interest must be fully disclosed in MVBFC s and MVB s periodic reports. 8. Covered Persons must comply with all laws and regulations that apply to MVBFC s and MVB s business. All Covered Persons should understand those laws that apply to them in the performance of their duties and ensure that their decisions and actions are conducted in conformity with those laws. Any violation of the
applicable laws can subject MVBFC and MVB or the implicated Covered Person to liability. Any inquiries relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations should be directed to MVBFC s and MVB s legal department. 9. Accountability for adherence to the Code. Failure to adhere to the above detailed responsibilities by the Covered Persons may result in disciplinary action being taken against such persons. The disciplinary action may range up to and including termination.
The Board of Directors shall be responsible for determining the proper action to be taken.
