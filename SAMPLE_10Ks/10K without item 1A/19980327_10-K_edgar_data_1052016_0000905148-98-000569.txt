REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

IndyMac, Inc.

We have examined management's assertion about IndyMac, Inc.'s compliance with
the minimum servicing standards identified in the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America's Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage
Bankers (USAP) in its capacity as a Master Servicer as of and for the year
ended December 31, 1997 included in the accompanying management assertion. 
Management is responsible for IndyMac, Inc.'s compliance with those minimum
servicing standards. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assertion about the entity's compliance based on our
examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about IndyMac, Inc.'s compliance with
the minimum servicing standards and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not
provide a legal determination on IndyMac, Inc.'s compliance with the minimum
servicing standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that IndyMac, Inc. complied with the
aforementioned minimum servicing standards as of and for the year ended
December 31, 1997 is fairly stated, in all material respects.
