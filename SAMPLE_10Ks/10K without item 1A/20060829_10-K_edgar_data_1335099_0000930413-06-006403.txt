 EXHIBIT 33.1

 MANAGEMENT'S ASSERTION ON
 COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION AB CRITERIA

 JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the "Asserting Party") is
responsible for assessing compliance as of June 15, 2006 and for the period from
June 16, 2005 through June 15, 2006 (the "Reporting Period") with the servicing
criteria set forth in Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of Federal Regulations
(the "CFR"), except for criteria 229.1122(d) 1(ii)-(iv); 2(iii),(vi); 4(x)-(xv);
in the CFR, which we have concluded are not applicable to the servicing of our
funding trust transactions backed by life insurance receivables and serviced by
the Asserting Party (the "Applicable Servicing Criteria").

 The Asserting Party has assessed its compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period and has concluded that the Asserting
Party has complied, in all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the funding trust transactions backed by life insurance receivables
serviced by the Asserting Party.

 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, has issued an attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in this
assertion.

 EXHIBIT 34.1

 [PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP LETTERHEAD]

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors:
JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying
Management's Assertion on Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria, that JPMorgan
Chase Bank, National Association (the "Bank") complied with the servicing
criteria set forth in Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of Federal Regulations
(the "CFR") for the funding trust transactions backed by life insurance
receivables listed in Appendix A. The Bank acted as servicer for these
transactions as of June 15, 2006 and for the period from June 16, 2005 through
June 15, 2006 (the "Reporting Period"). The servicing criteria (d)(1)(ii) -
(iv), 2(iii), 2(vi) and 4(x) - (xv) described in Section 229.1122(d) of the CFR
are not applicable to the servicing of the funding trust transactions backed by
life insurance receivables for the period. The CFR criteria that apply to the
applicable transactions are considered the "Applicable Servicing Criteria". Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the
Bank's compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria based on our
examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Bank's compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
legal determination on the Bank's compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria.

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Bank complied with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria as of June 15, 2006 and for the period from June
16, 2005 through June 15, 2006 is fairly stated, in all material respects.
