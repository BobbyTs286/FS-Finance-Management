We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Report of
Management on Compliance , that Capital One Bank (the Bank ), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Capital One Financial Corporation, complied with the
requirements of Sections 3.02, 3.04, 3.09, 4.02, 4.03, 4.04, 4.05 and 8.08 of
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement dated as of September 30, 1993, as amended
and restated as of August 1, 2002 between Capital One Funding, LLC, Capital One
Bank, and The Bank of New York (collectively, the Agreement ), and Article IV
of the supplements to the Agreement relating to Series 1996-2, 1996-3, 1997-1,
1997-2, 1998-1, 1998-4, 1998-5, 1998-6, 1999-1, 1999-2, 1999-3, 1999-4, 1999-A,

and 2002-CC (collectively, the Supplements ), for the year ended December 31,
2002. Management is responsible for the
Bank s compliance with those requirements. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion
about the Bank s compliance based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Bank s
compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. 
We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. Our 

examination does not provide a legal determination on the Bank s
compliance with specified requirements. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Bank complied with the
requirements of the sections of the Agreement and the provisions of the
Supplements to the Agreement referred to in the first paragraph above, for the
year ended December 31, 2002 is fairly stated, in all material respects. 

This report is intended solely for the information and use of Capital
One Funding, LLC, Capital One Bank, and The Bank of New York and is not
intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified
parties. However, this report is a
matter of public record and its distribution is not limited.
