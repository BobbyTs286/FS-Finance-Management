PART I 

Item 1. Business 

History and Organization 

The Company was incorporated
in the state of Nevada on October 30, 2007. We have not generated any revenues to date and we are a development stage company.
The Company s initial focus was on becoming an event planning company primarily serving the Las Vegas, Nevada market. During
the year ended August 31, 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed new directors. Prior to this appointment, the Board
consisted of one member. The new Board of Directors of the Company appointed new officers, all of whom are residents of Japan.
The Company currently has four officers and directors as of August 31, 2012. The new management of the Company is seeking new business
focus areas for the Company. 

 Our Business 

We are a small, start-up company, and since our inception on October
30, 2007, we did not generate any revenues and have incurred a cumulative net loss of 627,621 through August 31, 2012. 

With the appointment of the new officers and
directors, the Company has made a strategic shift in its focus, away from the event planning industry in Las Vegas. The Company
aims to maximize shareholders interests by engaging in the new business development and business acquisition across various
sectors. Headquartered in California, the United States of America, the Company is focused on organic growth and expansion through
new business development and mergers and acquisitions in Japan and the United States of America. In pursuit of its objectives,
the Company seeks to combine the practical acquisition knowledge of a private equity firm with the management and operational expertise
of seasoned industry veterans. 

The next twelve (12) months
is dependent on the direction and execution of the Company s future plans of management. 

 The analysis of new business opportunities and evaluating new business
strategies will be undertaken by the new majority owner and/or the Company's management. In analyzing prospective businesses opportunities,
the Company will consider, to the extent applicable, the available technical, financial and managerial resources of any given business
venture. Part of the evaluation will also consider the nature of present and expected competition; potential advances in research
and development or exploration; the potential for growth and expansion; the likelihood of sustaining a profit within given time
frames; the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products, services, trade or service marks; name identification; and
other relevant factors. 

The Company anticipates that
the results of operations of a specific business venture may not necessarily be indicative of the potential for future earnings,
which may be impacted by a change in marketing strategies, business expansion, modifying product emphasis, changing or substantially
augmenting management, and other factors. Management will analyze all relevant factors and make a determination based on a composite
of available information, without reliance on any single factor. 

 Industry Background 

The Company plans for aggressive growth through new business strategies
and acquisition of companies. Management will focus their efforts on adding values on businesses across several sections. 

Business Strategy 

The Company is a developmental
stage company. The Company has brought together a high quality management team with strategically diverse backgrounds including
asset acquisition and business consulting to build a platform of businesses that allow for greater penetration into not only the
Japanese market but also into the American market. This team will allow us to move forward as we strive to become the leader in
the business areas we expand into and maximize returns for the investors. 

 Competition 

 Many of the Company's competitors
include other companies in the industry we expand into and investment companies seeking to acquire and grow businesses. There is
no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against present or future competitors or that competitive pressures
faced by the Company will not have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

 Funding Requirements 

 We do not have sufficient
capital to become fully operational. We will require additional funding to sustain operations. There is no assurance that we will
have revenue in the future or that we will be able to secure the necessary funding to develop our business. Without additional
funding, it is most likely that our business model will fail, and we shall be forced to cease operations. 

 The new management of the
Company is currently accessing the funding requirements to build the new Company. Management will seek different funding sources
in order to initiate its business plan. 

 Future funding could result in potentially dilutive issuances of
equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, which
could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Any future acquisitions
of other businesses, technologies, services or product(s) might require the Company to obtain additional equity or debt financing,
which might not be available on terms favorable to the Company, or at all, and such financing, if available, might be dilutive. 

Compliance with Environmental Laws 

We are not aware of any environmental laws that have been enacted,
nor are we aware of any such laws being contemplated for the future, that impact issues specific to our business. Environmental
laws are anticipated to apply directly to the owners and operators of companies. They do not apply to companies or individuals
providing consulting services, unless they have been engaged to consult on environmental matters. We are not planning to provide
environmental consulting services. 

Employees 

As of August 31, 2012, we
did not have any employees. We are dependent upon our officers and directors for our future business development. As our operations
expand, we anticipate the need to hire additional employees, consultants, and professionals; however, the exact number is not quantifiable
at this time. 

Item 2. Properties. 

Our corporate headquarters are located at 1601 Pacific Coast Highway
Suite 250, Hermosa Beach, CA 90254. Effective October 12, 2012, we lease suite space in Hermosa, California. The agreement is for
a term of thirteen (13) months with monthly rent of 3,000 which was paid in advance at the time the lease was executed. Prior
to this, our office space was provided to us at no charge by former and/or current stockholders. These parties who provided space
to conduct our operations will not seek reimbursement for past office expenses. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 

From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and
legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and
an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. 

We are not presently a party to any material litigation, nor to
the knowledge of management is any litigation threatened against us, which may materially affect us.

and financial condition, capital requirements, statutory and contractual restrictions, future prospects and other factors deemed
relevant.

We did not repurchase any of our equity securities during the years

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations. 

Results of Operations for the year ended August 31, 2012 

Since our inception on October
30, 2007 through August 31, 2012, we generated no revenues. With the new business opportunity emerging in Los Angeles, we anticipate
generating some revenues by the end of August 31, 2013. We have relocated our head office to Hermosa Beach, California, in order
to establish the infrastructure for this new opportunity. 

 As of August 31, 2012, the
Company had cash of 127,988 and prepaid expenses of 34,560, as compared to 2,309 and 659 in cash and prepaid expenses as of
August 31, 2011. 

 During the year ended August
31, 2012, the Company had total expenses of 486,339, as compared to total expenses of 80,944 for the year ended August 31, 2011.
The increase in expenses is comprised of increases in acquisition costs of approximately 343,000, auditing and accounting fees
of 69,000, and operating expenses, related party of approximately 10,000 and decrease of operating expenses of approximately
 17,000. With no revenues since its inception on October 30, 2007, the net losses for the years ended August 31, 2012 and August
31, 2011 were 486,339 and 80,944, respectively. The Company has incurred total expenses of 627,621 since the inception on October
30, 2007 through the year ended August 31, 2012. 

 In our August 31, 2012 year-end financials, our auditors issued
an opinion that our financial condition raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

Revenues 

The Company has no current source of revenue; therefore the Company
has not yet adopted any policy regarding the recognition of revenue or cost. 

Going Concern 

The Company experienced operating
losses of 627,621 since its inception on October 30, 2007 through the year ended August 31, 2012. The financial statements have
been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and
the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. No adjustment has been made to the recorded amount of assets or
the recorded amount or classification of liabilities which would be required if the Company were unable to continue its operations.

Summary of any product research and development that we will
perform for the term of our plan of operation. 

We do not anticipate performing any product research and development
under our current plan of operation. 

Expected purchase or sale of property and significant equipment 

We do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any property or significant
equipment; as such items are not required by us at this time. 

Significant changes in the number of employees 

The Company did not have any employees as of August 31, 2012. As
our operations expand, we anticipate the need to hire additional employees, consultants and professionals; however, the exact number
is not quantifiable at this time. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of August 31, 2012, the
Company had current assets of 162,548 and current liabilities of 4,100. Of 162,548 of current assets, 125,818 (10,000,000 JPN)
of cash was used for incorporation of the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary on September 3, 2012. The Company has limited
financial resources available, which has had an adverse impact on the Company's liquidity, activities and operations. These limitations
have adversely affected the Company's ability to obtain certain projects and pursue additional business. Without realization of
additional capital, it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern. In order for the Company to remain a going
concern it will need to find additional capital. Additional working capital may be sought through additional debt or equity private
placements, additional notes payable to banks or related parties (officers, directors or stockholders), or from other available
funding sources at market rates of interest, or a combination of these. The ability to raise necessary financing will depend on
many factors, including the nature and prospects of any business to be acquired and the economic and market conditions prevailing
at the time financing is sought. Management has been seeking outside funding for the Company with little success. No assurances
can be given that any new financing can be obtained to future the Company's business plan. One former officer received compensation
in the amount of 9,559 for the year ended August 31, 2012. No other amounts were paid to officers or directors during the year. 

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results or operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue on an accrual
basis as it invoices for services. Revenue is generally realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are
met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists between the Company and our customer(s); 2) services have been rendered; 3)
our price to our customer is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured. 

Recent Pronouncements 

The Company's management has evaluated all the recently issued accounting
pronouncements through the filing date of these financial statements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will
have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM 

Board of Directors and Stockholders 

 Your Event, Inc. 

 Hermosa Beach, California 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Your Event, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) as of August 31, 2012, and the related statements of operations, stockholders 
equity (deficit) and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The financial statements
of Your Event, Inc. as of August 31, 2011, were audited by other auditors whose report dated November 28, 2011, expressed an unqualified
opinion on those statements. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Your Event, Inc. as of August 31, 2012 and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has no revenues,
has negative working capital at August 31, 2012, has incurred recurring losses and recurring negative cash flow from operating
activities, and has an accumulated deficit which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 Notes to Financial Statements 

NOTE 1. GENERAL ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS 

Your Event, Inc. (the Company was incorporated under
the laws of the state of Nevada on October 30, 2007. The Company was organized to conduct any lawful business. The Company s
initial focus was on becoming an event planning company primarily serving the Las Vegas, Nevada market. On November 29, 2011, the
Board of Directors of the Company appointed new directors, all of whom are residents of Japan. With the appointment of the new
officers and directors, the Company has made a strategic shift in its focus, away from the event planning industry in Las Vegas.
The Company was seeking new business focus areas, and is now exploring the role of a middleperson between a major Japanese corporation
and a major American corporation. 

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRACTICES 

Basis of Accounting 

 The financial statements present the balance sheet, statements of
operations, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows of the Company. These financial statements are presented in United States
dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Revenue and Cost Recognition 

 The Company has no current source of revenue; therefore the Company
has not yet adopted any policy regarding the recognition of revenue or cost. 

Acquisition Costs 

 Costs incurred to acquire new businesses, new product lines or similar
assets are expensed when incurred. 

Property 

 As of August 31, 2012 and 2011, office space was provided by various
current and former stockholders of the Company and the Company did not own or rent any property during these years. 

Earnings per Share 

 Historical net loss per common share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share include additional dilution from common stock equivalents,
such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted
into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that shared in the earnings of the entity, but these potential common
stock equivalents were determined to be antidilutive.

Your Event, Inc.

Calculation of net loss per share is as follows:

Dividends 

 The Company has not yet adopted any policy regarding payment of
dividends. No dividends have been paid during the years ended August 31, 2012 and 2011. 

Income Taxes 

 The provision for income taxes is the total of the current taxes
payable and the net of the change in the deferred income taxes. Provision is made for the deferred income taxes where differences
exist between the period in which transactions affect current taxable income and the period in which they enter into the determination
of net income in the financial statements. 

Year-end 

 The Company has selected August 31 as its year-end. 

Advertising 

 Advertising is expensed when incurred. No advertising expenses were
incurred during the years ended August 31, 2012 and 2011. 

Use of Estimates 

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 

Reclassification 

 Certain amounts included in the prior financial statements have
been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The reclassifications have no effect on total assets, total liabilities,
stockholders equity (deficit), or net loss as previously reported.

NOTE 3. GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred net losses
of (627,621) for the period from October 30, 2007 (inception) to August 31, 2012. The future of the Company is dependent upon
its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of its new business opportunities. 

 Management has plans to seek additional capital through private
placements and public offerings of its common stock. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event
the Company cannot continue in existence. 

 These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability
to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty. 

NOTE 4. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (DEFICIT) 

The Company is authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of 0.001
par value preferred stock and up to 70,000,000 shares of 0.001 par value common stock. 

Preferred Stock 

 There are no issued shares of preferred stock as of August 31, 2012
and 2011. 

Common Stock 

 On October 30, 2007 (inception), the Company issued 10,000,000 shares
of its 0.001 par value common stock to its founders for 10,000. 

The Company filed a registration statement with the U. S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. The registration was deemed effective on April 10, 2008. The Company coordinated the registration with
the Securities Division of the State of Nevada. When the offering was closed on June 30, 2008, 1,000,000 shares of the Company's
0.001 par value common stock were sold to twenty-nine (29) investors at a price of 0.005 per share pursuant to a self-underwritten
offering in conjunction with the registered offering for an aggregate of 5,000.00. 

There were no other issuances of common or preferred stock or equivalents
since October 30, 2007 (inception) through August 31, 2012. The Company had 11,000,000 common shares issued and outstanding as
of August 31, 2012 and 2011.

NOTE 4. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (DEFICIT) (Continued) 

Subsequent to August 31, 2012, the shareholders granted the Company
stock options to purchase a total of 960,000 shares of the common stock at the exercise price of 0.25 per share. In addition,
the granted stock options were assigned to two directors subsequently. See more detail in Note 11. 

NOTE 5. CONTRIBUTED CAPITAL 

On December 3, 2007, a director of the Company contributed capital
of 200 to provide working capital to the Company. 

On February 27, 2009, a director of the Company contributed capital
of 2,500 to provide working capital to the Company for audit fees. 

On November 24, 2009, a director of the Company contributed capital
of 5,000 to provide working capital to the Company for audit fees. 

On December 9, 2009, a director of the Company contributed capital
of 550 to provide working capital to the Company for transfer fees. 

On January 11, 2010, a director of the Company contributed capital
of 2,500 to provide working capital to the Company for audit fees. 

On April 2, 2010, a director of the Company contributed capital
of 100,000 to provide working capital. 

The director believed it was in the best interest of the Company's
shareholders to contribute the above capital in order to provide the Company with the necessary working capital to pay for its
accounting and transfer agent fees for the near future until such time, if any, that the Company can generate sufficient revenues
to cover expenses. 

During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2009, the Company's corporate
counsel agreed to prepare, write, EDGARize and provide legal opinion for the Company's interim reports and Form 10-K filing, which
the law firm valued at 10,000. 

The law firm decided to contribute this capital based on its recommendation
that the Company engage the services of an auditor, who had his licensed revoked and was not able to complete the Company's audit
for the past fiscal year. Based on this decision, the Company needed to engage a new auditor. The Company's corporate counsel believes
this action will help build goodwill for its law firm.

NOTE 7. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 

The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, Accounting
for Income Taxes , which requires use of the liability method. ASC 740 provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recorded based on the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting
purposes, referred to as temporary differences. Deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each period are determined using
the currently enacted tax rates applied to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected
to be settled or realized. 

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed
by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before provision for income taxes. The sources and tax effects of the
differences are as follows: 

U.S federal statutory rate (34.0 

 Valuation reserve 34.0 

 Total 0 

Income tax benefits as of August 31, 2012 and August 31, 2011, are

During the year ended August 31, 2012, the Company recorded a valuation
allowance of (170,219), as compared to (28,330) for the previous year, on the deferred tax assets to reduce the total to an amount
that management believes will ultimately be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient future taxable
income during the period that deductible temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be available to reduce taxable
income. There was no other activity in the valuation allowance account during the years ended August 31, 2012 and 2011. The net
operating loss (the NOL for the year ended August 31, 2012 will expire in 2032 and for the year ended August 31,
2011 will expire in 2031.

 Notes to Financial Statements 

NOTE 7. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES (Continued) 

However, due to the ownership changes that occurred during the year
ended August 31, 2012, the ability to use the NOLs generated through the ownership change date could be limited. In general, the
amount of NOLs the Company could use for any tax year after the date of the ownership change would be limited to the value of the
stock (as of the ownership change date) multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate. 

NOTE 8. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity
of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

NOTE 9. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

The Company has evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements and
believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company's financial statements. 

NOTE 10. ACQUISITION COSTS 

During the year ended August 31, 2012, the Company incurred approximately
 343,000 of acquisition costs for various Japanese companies in the restaurant, beauty, and advertising industry, among others.
Certain costs were incurred in the due diligence process as it relates to auditing the accounting records of these companies. These
proposed acquisitions turned out to be inefficient, mobility-wise and cost-wise, among other reasons. The Company therefore has
decided not to pursue these acquisitions.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

Our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms adopted by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures. 

Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer, who are also our Board of Directors, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the year covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of August 31, 2012, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses described below under Management's
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, which are in the process of being remediated as described below
under Management Plan to Remediate Material Weaknesses. 

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting, as defined in rules promulgated under the
Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and
affected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and our Board of Directors; and 

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 

 acquisition, use or disposition
of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control
over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met
and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence
and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting human failures. Internal control over financial reporting
also can be circumvented by collusion or improper override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements
may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations
are known features of the financial reporting process, and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though
not eliminate, this risk. Further, over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of August 31, 2012. In making its assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ).
Based on its assessment, management concluded that we had certain control deficiencies described below that constituted material
weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. As a result, our internal control over financial reporting was not
effective as of August 31, 2012. 

A material weakness is defined under SEC rules as
a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis by the company s internal controls. As a result of management s review of the investigation issues and
results, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on
our Board of Directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures,
which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. 

Management Plan to Remediate Material Weaknesses 

Management is pursuing the implementation of corrective measures
to address the material weaknesses described above. In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies
and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures: 

The new officers and directors will undertake the oversight in the
establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions
made by management. 

We believe that the remediation measures described above will remediate
the material weaknesses we have identified and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. We are committed to continuing
to improve our internal control processes and will continue to diligently and vigorously review our financial reporting controls
and procedures. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may determine
to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify, or in appropriate circumstances not to complete,
certain of the remediation measures described above. 

Changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

There was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting
(as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the year covered by this report that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

This annual report does not include an attestation report of the
Corporation's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not
subject to attestation by the Corporation's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit
the Corporation to provide only the management's report in this annual report.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive
officers and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities to file
with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common stock and other equity securities of the
Company. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us
with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. To the best of our knowledge based solely on a review of Forms 3, 4, and 5 (and
any amendments thereof) received by us during or with respect to the year ended August 31, 2010, the following person have failed
to file, on a timely basis, the identified reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during the year ended August 31,
2011: 

Name

Note: Marilyn Montgomery did not file a Form 3 in connection with
her initial ownership and sale of 8,200,000 shares in the Company. 

To the best of our knowledge, no reports which were failed to file
on a timely manner under the Exchange Act during the year ended August 31, 2012. 

Board of Directors 

The Board of Directors met on July 2, 2012 which was attended by
all Board members. This was the only time such meeting was held during the year ended August 31, 2012. 

Audit Committee 

The Company does not presently have an Audit Committee. The Company s
Directors of the Board sit as the Audit Committee. No qualified financial expert has been hired because the company is too small
to afford such expense. 

Committees and Procedures 

(1) 
 The registrant has no standing audit, nominating and compensation committees of the Board
of Directors, or committees performing similar functions. The Board acts itself in lieu of committees due to its small size. 

(2) 
 The view of the Board of Directors is that it is appropriate for the registrant not to have
such a committee because its directors participate in the consideration of director nominees and the Board and the Company are
so small. 

(3) 
 The members of the Board who acts as nominating committee is not independent, pursuant to
the definition of independence of a national securities exchange registered pursuant to section 6(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78f(a)). 

(4) 
 The nominating committee has no policy with regard to the consideration of any director candidates
recommended by security holders, but the committee will consider director candidates recommended by security holders. 

(5) 
 The basis for the view of the board of directors that it is appropriate for the registrant
not to have such a policy is that there is no need to adopt a policy for a small company. 

(6) 
 The nominating committee will consider candidates recommended by security holders, and by
security holders in submitting such recommendations. 

(7) 
 There are no specific, minimum qualifications that the nominating committee believes must
be met by a nominee recommended by security holders except to find anyone willing to serve with a clean background. 

(8) The nominating committee's process
for identifying and evaluation of nominees for director, including nominees recommended by security holders, is to find qualified
persons willing to serve with a clean backgrounds. There are no differences in the manner in which the nominating committee evaluates
nominees for director based on whether the nominee is recommended by a security holder, or found by the board. 

Code of Ethics 

We have not adopted a Code of Ethics for the Board and any salaried
employees. 

Limitation of Liability of Directors 

Pursuant to the Nevada General Corporation Law, our Articles of
Incorporation exclude personal liability for our Directors for monetary damages based upon any violation of their fiduciary duties
as Directors, except as to liability for any breach of the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, or any transaction from which a Director receives an improper personal benefit.
This exclusion of liability does not limit any right which a Director may have to be indemnified and does not affect any Director's
liability under federal or applicable state securities laws. We have agreed to indemnify our directors against expenses, judgments,
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim against a Director if he acted in good faith and in a manner he believed
to be in our best interests. 

Nevada Anti-Takeover Law and Charter and By-law Provisions 

The anti-takeover provisions of Sections 78.411 through 78.445 of
the Nevada Corporation Law apply to Your Event, Inc. Section 78.438 of the Nevada law prohibits the Company from merging with or
selling more than 5 of our assets or stock to any shareholder who owns or owned more than 10 of any stock or any entity related
to a 10 shareholder for three years after the date on which the shareholder acquired the Your Event, Inc. shares, unless the transaction
is approved by Your Event, Inc.'s Board of Directors. The provisions also prohibit the Company from completing any of the transactions
described in the preceding sentence with a 10 shareholder who has held the shares more than three years and its related entities
unless the transaction is approved by our Board of Directors or a majority of our shares, other than shares owned by that 10 shareholder
or any related entity. These provisions could delay, defer or prevent a change in control of Your Event, Inc. 

Item 11. Executive Compensation 

Compensation 

As a result of the Company's current limited available cash, no
officer or director received compensation since October 30, 2007 (inception) through August 31, 2012, except for Marilyn Montgomery,
a former Chief Executive Officer and a director, who resigned the Company on January 5, 2012. Ms. Montgomery received compensation
in the amount of 9,559 for the year ended August 31, 2012. The Company has no intention of paying salaries for other officers
and directors at this time. However, the possibility will be considered depending on the way our business develops in the future. 

We do not have any long-term compensation plans or stock option
plans.

in the year ended August 31, 2012. 

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control

with respect to our named executive officers, which would in any way result in payments to such officers because of his/her resignation,
retirement, or other termination of employment with us, or any change in control of, or a change in his/her responsibilities following
a change in control. 

Director Compensation 

We did not pay our directors any compensation during the years ended
August 31, 2012 and August 31, 2011, except for Marilyn Montgomery as indicated above. 

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
Management and Related Stockholder Matters. 

The following table presents information, to the best of our knowledge,
about the ownership of our common stock on November 29, 2012 relating to those persons known to beneficially own more than 5 of
our capital stock and by our named executive officers and directors. 

 Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and does not necessarily indicate beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under these
rules, beneficial ownership includes those shares of common stock over which the stockholder has sole or shared voting or investment
power. It also includes shares of common stock that the stockholder has a right to acquire within 60 days after November 29, 2012
pursuant to options, warrants, conversion privileges or other right. The percentage ownership of the outstanding common stock,
however, is based on the assumption, expressly required by the rules of the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission, that only
the person or entity whose ownership is being reported has converted options or warrants into shares of the Company's common stock. 

We do not have any outstanding options, warrants or other securities
exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common stock.

Road Tsimshatsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong, P.R. C. . Choi Sio Man, CEO of Billion Sino is beneficial owner who has the ultimate voting
control over the shares held this entity. 

Change of Control 

On June 10, 2011, Million Win Investments (HK) Limited Million
Win entered into a Stock Transfer Agreement, whereby it sold 6,548,993 common shares of its 8,200,000 common shares of the
Company to Infinity, whereby Infinity had an option to purchase the remaining 1,651,007 shares owned
by Million Win. 

On August 1, 2012, Masaya Konishi, CEO and Director of the Company,
purchased 6,548,993 shares from Infinity for an aggregate purchase price of 383,000 USD (30,000,000 JPY) in a private transaction. 

On November 27, 2012, Masaya Konishi, CEO and Director of the Company,
transferred 80,000 shares, 60,000 shares, and 60,000 shares of common stock to June Tsukamoto, Chairperson, Kioko Tsukamoto, and
Junko Top, the daughters of June Tsukamoto, respectively, at free of charge in a private transaction. 

The Company has 11,000,000 common stock issued and outstanding as
of November 29, 2012. With these two transfers above, Mr. Konishi owns 6,348,993 shares which represent 57.72 of the issued and
outstanding shares, the majority ownership interest in the Company as of November 29, 2012. 

On October 18, 2012, Million Win transferred 1,651,007 shares it
owned to its affiliated company, Billion Sino for 82,550 in a private transaction. 

In these private transactions, the Company did not engage in any
form of general solicitation or general advertising in connection with the transactions. Mr. Konishi and Billion Sino were provided
access to all material information, which they requested and all information necessary to verify such information and were afforded
access to any Company information in connection with these transactions. Mr. Konishi and Billion Sino acquired these securities
for investment and not with a view toward distribution, acknowledging such intent. They understood the ramifications of their actions.
The shares of common stock issued contained a legend restricting transferability absent registration or applicable exemption. 

We believe that all persons named have full voting and investment
power with respect to the shares indicated, unless otherwise noted in the table. Under the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, a person (or group of persons) is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if he or she, directly
or indirectly, has or shares the power to vote or to direct the voting of such security, or the power to dispose of or to direct
the disposition of such security. Accordingly, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same security.
A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security, which that person has the right to acquire within 60 days, such
as options or warrants to purchase our common stock. 

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and
Director Independence. 

Transactions with related persons, promoters and certain control
persons. 

The Company paid compensation to Marilyn Montgomery, a former Chief
Executive Officer and a director, who resigned the Company on January 5, 2012, in the amount of 9,559 for the year ended August
31, 2012. 

On August 1, 2012, Masaya Konishi, CEO and Director of the Company
purchased 6,548,993 shares from Infinity for an aggregate purchase price of 383,000 USD (30,000,000 JPY) in a private transaction.
On November 27, 2012, Mr. Konishi transferred his 200,000 shares of common stock to three individuals at free of charge in a private
transaction. The Company has 11,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of November 29, 2012. With these transfers,
Mr. Konishi s ownership of 6,348,993 shares represents approximately 57.72 of the issued and outstanding shares, the majority
ownership interest in the Company as of November 29, 2012. 

Director Independence 

As the Company is quoted on the OTCBB and not one of the national
securities exchanges, it is not subject to any director independence requirements. 

Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services . 

Somerset CPAs, P.C. served as our principal independent public auditors
for the year ended August 31, 2012, and the Company engaged a different auditor for the year ended August 31, 2011. Aggregate fees
billed to us for the years ended August 31, 2012 and 2011 were as follows:

Total fees paid or accrued to our principal auditors. 

(1) 
 Audit fees include fees billed and expected to be billed for services performed to comply
with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), including the recurring audit of the Company's financial statements for such
period included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and for the reviews of the quarterly financial statements included in the Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 (2) 
 Other fees include fees billed for services performed related to due diligence services rendered
related to the potential acquisition of several Japanese businesses. 

Audit Committee Policies and Procedures 

We do not have an audit committee; therefore our Chief Financial
Officer pre-approves all services to be provided to us by our independent auditor. This process involves obtaining (i) a written
description of the proposed services, (ii) the confirmation of our Principal Accounting Officer that the services are compatible
with maintaining specific principles relating to independence, and (iii) confirmation from our securities counsel that the services
are not among those that our independent auditors have been prohibited from performing under SEC rules. Our Chief Financial Officer
then makes a determination to approve or disapprove the engagement of Somerset CPAs, P.C. for the proposed services. In the fiscal
year ended August 31, 2012, all fees paid to Somerset CPAs, P.C. were unanimously pre-approved in accordance with this policy. 

 Less than 50 percent of hours expended on the principal accountant's
engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most recent fiscal year were attributed to work performed by
persons other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees.
