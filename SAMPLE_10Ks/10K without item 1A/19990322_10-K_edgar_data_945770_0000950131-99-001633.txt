PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

 EVEREN Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries ("EVEREN" or the "Company")
is a full-service securities brokerage firm that provides a broad range of
investment services and products primarily to individuals and also to
institutions, corporations and municipalities. The Company's core strength is
its retail operations. The Company also engages in capital markets and asset
management that complement and capitalize on the strength of the Company's
retail operations. The Company still participates in brokerage clearing
operations, but on a reduced level as a result of the sale of 80 of EVEREN
Clearing LLC ("EVEREN Clearing") to The Bank of New York in November 1998.

 In its retail business, conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
EVEREN Securities, Inc. ("EVEREN Securities"), the Company focuses on
maintaining and developing strong client relationships in local and regional
markets while providing the breadth and quality of services and products offered
by national brokerage firms. Headquartered in Chicago, the Company operates its
retail business through an integrated network of approximately 1,820 investment
consultants located in approximately 170 offices in 27 states. At December 31,
1998, EVEREN held over 63.4 billion of customer assets in approximately 650,000
client accounts.

 EVEREN enjoys strong market positions in targeted regional markets with
approximately 70 of branch offices and 71 of its investment consultants
located in the states of Illinois, California, Ohio, Wisconsin, Colorado and
Texas. EVEREN's market penetration is primarily the result of the consolidation
and integration in 1990 of five prominent predecessor firms to form a network of
seasoned investment consultants. In addition, EVEREN acquired the retail
brokerage operations of Principal Financial Securities, Inc. in January 1998,
further strengthening its market positions in these regions.

 The Company also provides a full range of equity and fixed income products,
investment banking services and other capital markets products and services
through approximately 23 professionals located in approximately 430 offices in
major cities in the United States. The Company has increased the coordination of
its investment banking, syndicate and trading activities, focusing those
activities on middle market and growth companies in selectively targeted
industries in which management believes the Company has specialized expertise.
In addition, EVEREN expanded its asset management business through a joint
venture with Mentor Investment Group, Inc. ("Mentor"), an asset management
company that had approximately 16 billion of assets under management at year
end 1998.

 In September 1995, the Company became independently owned when the EVEREN
Capital Corporation 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("KSOP") purchased
96.6 of the Company's then outstanding Common Stock from Kemper Corporation
("Kemper") for an aggregate cash price of 71.4 million 55.0 million of which
was funded by bank borrowings) plus 30.0 million of the Company's Exchangeable
Preferred Stock.

 In October 1996, the Company completed its initial public offering whereby
4.6 million shares of its Common Stock were sold at a price of 18.50 per share.
Approximately 60 of the 

 4

Company's Common Stock is currently employee-owned, with approximately 90 of
the Company's current employees having an ownership interest. The Company
experienced net losses in 1993, 1994 and 1995 of 3.7 million, 2.2 million and
 15.9 million, respectively. Since becoming independent, EVEREN has experienced
improved growth and profitability relative to prior periods. For the year ended
December 31, 1996, the Company generated net income of 62.5 million, including
a 30.2 million after-tax gain on the sale of a subsidiary, on net revenues of
 536.6 million compared to a net loss of 15.9 million on net revenues of 490.7
million for 1995. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company generated
net income of 46.6 million on net revenue of 593.1 million, an 11 increase
compared to 1996. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company generated
net income of 71.3 million on net revenue of 755.4 million. Excluding the
 11.9 million after-tax gain on the sale of a subsidiary, net income for 1998
represents a 27 increase over 1997. Management believes that the Company's
independence and employee ownership have resulted in high levels of employee
motivation, confidence and commitment, which have in turn contributed
significantly to the Company's improved performance.

Nature of the Securities Brokerage Business

 The securities brokerage business is subject to significant risks,
including the risk of losses resulting from the underwriting or ownership of
securities, trading losses, counterparty failure to meet commitments, customer
fraud, employee fraud, issuer fraud, errors and misconduct, failure in
connection with the processing of securities transactions and litigation. The
securities brokerage business is directly affected by many factors, including
economic and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance,
legislation and regulation affecting the national and international business and
financial communities, currency values, inflation, market conditions, the
availability and cost of short-term or long-term funding and capital, the credit
capacity or perceived creditworthiness of the securities industry in the
marketplace and the level and volatility of interest rates. Such factors can
lead to lower price levels for securities and illiquid markets.

 Lower price levels of securities may result in (a) reduced volume of
securities, options and futures transactions, with a consequent reduction in
revenues, (b) losses from declines in the market value of securities held in
trading, investment and underwriting positions and (c) reduced management fees
calculated as a percentage of assets managed. In periods of low volume, levels
of profitability are further adversely affected because certain expenses remain
relatively fixed. Illiquid markets may result in the Company having difficulty
selling securities, hedging its securities positions and investing funds under
its management. The Company believes its trading strategy and risk management
procedures reduce its exposure to losses resulting from such risks, although
there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur or if they do, that
they will not be material.

Dependence on Outside Sources of Financing

 The Company, like others in the securities industry, relies on external
sources to finance a significant portion of its day-to-day operations,
principally to finance customer margin account balances and certain other
transactions. The principal sources of the Company's cash and liquidity are
commissions, repurchase agreements, collateralized bank loans and securities
lending activities. See also the discussion of financing in the "Liquidity and
Capital Resources" Section contained in Item 7 of this report.

 5

Retail Brokerage Activities

 EVEREN's retail business offers clients a complete range of investment
products, such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds, and investment services,
including investment advice, financial planning and asset management. Management
believes that the breadth and quality of the Company's products and services,
coupled with the productivity, tenure and experience of its investment
consultants, allow it to provide superior service to its clients and help to
distinguish EVEREN from its competitors.

 Markets

 EVEREN's investment products and services are marketed to clients by a
network of approximately 1,820 investment consultants operating out of
approximately 170 retail branch offices in 27 states. Although EVEREN
Securities' single largest office in terms of revenue in 1998 was in New York
City, approximately three-quarters of the Company's investment consultants are
located in branch offices in California, Ohio, Illinois, Texas, Wisconsin, and
Colorado. Many of EVEREN's retail offices are located in smaller cities or
suburban areas.

 Retail Products and Services

 EVEREN offers a full line of investment products to its retail clients.
These include cash management accounts, listed and over-the-counter stocks,
government and corporate bonds, tax-exempt state and local government bonds,
open- and closed-end mutual funds, unit investment trusts, commodities,
individual retirement accounts ("IRAs") and a wide variety of investment
advisory products. Service offerings include investment advisory services,
financial planning services such as retirement planning and planning for college
funding, asset allocation advice, margin loans and prototype 401(k) plans and
services.

 In May 1996 as part of its strategy to grow client assets and increase
asset management activity, EVEREN introduced a new form of cash management
account, the EVEREN Advantage(SM) Account ("Advantage"). Advantage is designed
to allow clients to consolidate their financial assets in a full service,
integrated account. Advantage accounts feature numerous services, including a
daily sweep of any cash in the client's account to a money market mutual fund,
unlimited free checking, debit cards, margin account access and automatic bill
payment. Advantage account holders also will receive customized statements
showing gain and loss information, complimentary IRA and EVEREN Online Service,
a service that will provide the client with direct access to his or her account
information via computer modem.

 Investment Advisory Services

 The Company's investment advisory services include performance monitoring,
selection of third party investment managers and, to a limited extent,
discretionary asset management. The investment advisory services offered by the
Company are tailored for a variety of clients, including individuals, pension
and profit-sharing plans, trusts and estates, charitable organizations,
corporations and other business and governmental entities. Investment advisory
services are typically rendered on a fixed or "wrap" fee basis, such that all
services, including execution services, are provided by EVEREN for a fixed fee,
payable quarterly, usually a percentage of assets under management.

 6

Capital Markets Activities

 In support of and as a complement to its retail operations, the Company
engages in a full range of capital markets activities, including product
origination, trading and research of equity, taxable fixed income and municipal
securities. The Company's capital markets activities are primarily client-
driven, in contrast to those of many other securities firms which emphasize
proprietary trading, and currently account for approximately 15 of the
Company's net revenues. Capital markets activities are conducted through
approximately 430 professionals in 23 offices located in major cities across the
United States.

 Equities

 The Company seeks to focus its equity capital markets activities
increasingly on institutional clients because of their greater share volumes and
resulting revenues. The Company has coordinated its equity securities research,
investment banking, syndicate and trading activities by industry group and
focused those activities on middle market and growth companies in a group of
core industries. These industries currently include financial services
(primarily thrifts, insurance companies and finance companies), real estate,
technology (primarily computer hardware and software), consumer goods (primarily
retail, catalogues and restaurants), industrials (primarily specialty chemicals,
capital goods and selected manufacturing), telecommunications (primarily
equipment and wireless and landline services), health care and the energy
industry.

 Research. The Company provides equity research coverage on a group of
middle-market and growth companies in the Company's core industries. The
Company's research staff prepares periodic reports on approximately 175 publicly
traded companies and uses a team approach that is designed to allow depth of
coverage. In addition, the Company purchases research coverage from two well-
regarded investment banks. This out-sourcing of research provides the broad
services needed by retail investment consultants and clients and allows the
Company's in-house analysts to focus where they can add value. The Company also
maintains a research liaison desk to provide responsive support service to its
investment consultants and retail clients.

 Investment Banking. The Company offers a broad range of investment banking
services primarily relating to equity offerings and private placements to middle
market and growth companies, principally in the Company's core industries. The
Company has approximately 70 investment banking professionals in 12 locations.
The Company also offers other investment banking services, including mergers and
acquisitions advisory and debt origination.

 Institutional Sales. The Company distributes equity securities through an
institutional equity sales force that primarily serves mid-size and large
institutional clients. The Company has approximately 25 institutional equity
sales professionals located primarily in Chicago and New York. In 1998, the
institutional equity sales force generated approximately 22 million of
revenues.

 Trading. The Company makes a market in approximately 400 over-the-counter
stocks, including most of those covered by the Company's research department.
EVEREN employs approximately 30 trading professionals who execute transactions
in both over-the-counter and listed securities primarily for retail and
institutional clients. Traders are paid based on a formula that encourages them
to work with the Company's investment consultants and institutional sales
professionals to generate sales revenues as a priority over trading profits. The
Company seeks to limit its exposure to trading losses by focusing its trading
activity on facilitating its retail and institutional businesses rather than on
trading for its own account. The Company imposes low position limits for its
traders.

 7

Taxable Fixed Income

 The Company provides a broad range of government, government agency and
corporate fixed income securities to its retail and generally smaller
institutional clients. A relatively small amount of the taxable fixed income
securities offered by the Company are originated internally, most are obtained
in the secondary market. The taxable fixed income department employs
approximately 100 professionals, including fixed income research personnel who
primarily provide investment ideas and credit oversight. To facilitate its
taxable fixed income activities, the Company enters into standard repurchase and
reverse repurchase agreements with qualified institutional clients.

 Municipals

 The Company provides underwriting and financial advisory services to, and
distributes securities of, tax-exempt municipalities principally in the Midwest.
The Company's municipal securities business includes approximately 20 public
finance investment bankers and analysts that provide underwriting and financial
advisory services.

Employees

 At December 31, 1998, the Company employed approximately 4,000 persons.

Competition

 All aspects of the Company's business are highly competitive. The Company
competes directly with national, regional and local full service broker-dealers
and, to a lesser extent, with discount brokers, dealers, investment banking
firms, investment advisors and certain commercial banks. The Company also
competes indirectly for client assets with insurance companies and others. The
financial services industry has become considerably more concentrated as
numerous securities firms have either ceased operations or have been acquired by
or merged into other firms. Such mergers and acquisitions have increased
competition from these firms, many of whom have significantly greater equity
capital, financial and other resources than the Company. With respect to retail
brokerage activities, many of the regional firms with whom the Company competes
have operated in their regions significantly longer than has the Company and
have established long-standing client relationships. In addition, the Company
expects competition from domestic and international commercial banks to increase
as a result of recent and anticipated legislative and regulatory initiatives in
the United States to remove or relieve certain restrictions on commercial banks
relating to the sale of securities.

 In addition, the Company faces competition for investment consultants.
Although the Company takes steps to maintain strong relationships with its
investment consultants, because of the significant emphasis on and importance of
its retail operations, the Company faces competition in attracting and retaining
high-producing retail brokers. While many competitors require their registered
representatives to enter into restrictive non-competition agreements which seek
to prohibit the representatives from being employed by any competitor, the
Company has not implemented such a requirement because it believes that the
general use of such agreements is not conducive to attracting valuable
employees.

 Management believes that the principal competitive factors influencing the
Company's business are the quality of its investment consultants and other
professional staff, the Company's 

 8

reputation in and penetration of the local markets in which it operates, its
existing client relationships, its mix of market capabilities and the incentives
associated with employee ownership.

Regulation

 The securities industry in the United States is subject to extensive
regulation under both federal and state laws. EVEREN Securities is registered
with the Commission as a broker-dealer and as an investment adviser. It is
subject to regulation by the Commission and by self-regulatory organizations,
principally the NASD and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB") and
national securities exchanges such as the NYSE. Securities firms are also
subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in
which they conduct business. EVEREN Securities is a registered broker-dealer in
all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
Failure to comply with the laws, rules or regulations of the Commission, such
self-regulatory organizations and state securities commissions may result in
censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or
expulsion by such entities of a broker-dealer, an investment adviser, officers
or employees. The Company believes that it is currently in material compliance
with the regulations to which it is subject.

 EVEREN Securities is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission ("CFTC") as a futures commission merchant and is subject to
regulation as such by the CFTC and various domestic boards of trade and other
commodity exchanges. EVEREN Securities' commodity futures and options business
is also regulated by the National Futures Association ("NFA"), a not-for-profit
membership corporation which has been designated as a registered futures
association by the CFTC.

 Because financial services businesses are subject to extensive regulation
on the federal and state level, and because of the possibility of changes
resulting from numerous legislative and regulatory proposals that are advanced
each year and from judicial decisions, it is possible that changes will be
necessary to the way in which the Company and its affiliates conduct their
activities. While it is difficult to predict the impact of any new laws,
regulations or judicial decisions, the Company anticipates that regulation of
the securities and commodities industries will increase at all levels and that
compliance therewith will become more difficult. Monetary penalties and
restrictions on business activities by regulators resulting from compliance
deficiencies are also expected to become more severe.

Capital Requirements

 As a registered broker-dealer, EVEREN Securities is subject to the
Commission's net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1 (the "Net Capital Rule"), promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The
NYSE monitors the application of the Net Capital Rule. EVEREN Securities
computes net capital under the alternative method which requires minimum net
capital equal to the greater of 1 million or 2 of aggregate debit items
arising from customer transactions. A broker-dealer may be required to reduce
its business if its net capital is less than 4 of aggregate debit balances and
may also be prohibited from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if
resulting net capital would be less than 5 of aggregate debit balances. In
addition, the Net Capital Rule does not allow withdrawal of subordinated capital
if net capital would be less than 5 of such debit balances.

 9

The Net Capital Rule also limits the ability of broker-dealers to transfer
large amounts of capital to parent companies and other affiliates. Under the
Net Capital Rule, equity capital cannot be withdrawn from a broker-dealer
without the prior approval of the Commission when net capital after the
withdrawal would be less than 25 of its securities position haircuts (which are
deductions from capital of certain specified percentages of the market value of
securities to reflect the possibility of a market decline prior to disposition).
In addition, the Net Capital Rule requires a broker-dealer to notify the
Commission and the appropriate self-regulatory organization two business days
before a withdrawal of excess net capital if the withdrawal would exceed 30 of
the broker-dealer's excess net capital, and two business days after a withdrawal
that exceeds 20 of excess net capital, provided that no such notice need be
given if the withdrawal is less than 500,000. Finally, the Net Capital Rule
authorizes the Commission to order a freeze on the transfer of capital if a
broker-dealer plans a withdrawal of more than 30 of its excess net capital and
the Commission believes that such a withdrawal would be detrimental to the
financial integrity of such broker-dealer or would jeopardize the broker-
dealer's ability to pay its customers.

 At December 31, 1998, EVEREN Securities had net capital, as defined, of
 187.0 million, which exceeded its minimum net capital requirement by
approximately 165.4 million.

 Compliance with the Net Capital Rule could limit those operations of the
Company that require the intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and
trading activities and the financing of customer account balances, and also
could restrict its ability to pay dividends, repay debt and redeem or purchase
shares of its outstanding common stock.

 The Commission, the NYSE, the CFTC and various other securities and
commodities exchanges and other regulatory bodies in the United States have
rules with respect to net capital requirements which affect the Company. A
change in such rules, or the imposition of new rules, affecting the scope,
coverage, calculation or amount of such net capital requirements, or a
significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against net capital,
could adversely affect the ability of the Company to expand or maintain present
levels of business or pay dividends or interest.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

 EVEREN Securities leases 297,000 square feet of office space (and an
additional 36,000 square feet of warehouse space) in two locations in Chicago,
Illinois; 136,000 square feet in two locations in Houston, Texas, a significant
portion of which is subleased; 29,000 square feet in Cleveland, Ohio; 19,000
square feet in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; 38,000 square feet in two locations in New
York City; 30,000 square feet in San Francisco, California; 21,000 square feet
in Denver, Colorado; and approximately 898,000 square feet in other locations
nationwide.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 Many aspects of the Company's business involve substantial risks of
liability. In recent years there has been an increasing incidence of litigation
involving the securities brokerage industry, including class action suits that
generally seek substantial damages and other suits seeking punitive damages.
Like other securities brokerage firms, the Company has been named as a defendant
in class action and other suits and has in the past been subject to substantial
settlements and judgments.

 10

Following is a description of one of the matters in which the Company is
currently exposed to potential liability. Although there can be no assurances,
the Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of this matter or any
other litigation, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Due, however, to the
relatively early stage of this matter, management cannot accurately make
estimates of potential loss, if any, or assure that such matter will have no
material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations in any particular

 Made to Robert Kanuth in 1991 and 1992. 

 The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has issued a Notice of Proposed
Adjustment with respect to Kemper Corporation's 1991 and 1992 tax returns.
EVEREN Securities was a subsidiary of Kemper at that time. These proposed
adjustments concern the tax treatment of certain payments made to a former
employee, Robert Kanuth, pursuant to an arbitration award against Prescott Ball
& Turben ("PBT"), a predecessor of EVEREN Securities. Prior to his employment
with PBT, Kanuth was a shareholder and the President of Cranston Securities, a
company purchased by PBT in 1987. In connection with that purchase, PBT entered
into an employment agreement with Kanuth. After Kanuth's employment was
terminated, he brought an arbitration claim against PBT seeking recovery of
incentive compensation payable to him pursuant to his employment agreement, and
the arbitrators awarded him approximately 30 million. The payment of that award
by EVEREN Securities was treated as compensation by Kemper. The IRS Notice
asserts that the incentive compensation paid to Kanuth should have been
considered additional purchase price for the purchase of Cranston rather than
compensation. Kemper has filed a protest with the IRS, and Kemper and the
Company are working together to vigorously defend this matter.

Kemper has asserted that the Company is responsible for any tax liability
associated with this matter pursuant to the terms of a Tax Sharing Agreement
between Kemper and the Company. In September 1998, the Company filed a lawsuit
against Kemper in connection with the Tax Sharing Agreement, which alleges that
Kemper failed to disclose information to the Company concerning this potential
tax liability and should therefore be liable for any taxes imposed. Kemper has
denied those claims. The lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice,
pending resolution of the IRS matter, pursuant to a tolling agreement between
the parties.

 In addition to the matter described above, the Company is currently a
defendant in various civil actions and arbitrations arising out of its
activities as a broker-dealer in securities. Some of such actions involve
allegations of misconduct by Company employees, and other actions involve claims
against the Company by current or former employees. Although the ultimate
outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained at this time, it is the opinion
of management, after consultation with counsel, that the resolution of such
suits will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position of the Company, but may be material to the Company's operating results
for any particular period, depending upon the level of the Company's income for
such period.

the Company's 2-for-1 stock split):

14

Calendar Quarter First Second Third Fourth 
 ---------------- ----- ------ ----- ------ 
 
 1998 .055 .07 .07 .07 
 1997 .045 .045 .045 .055 

The Company's ability to pay dividends is contingent upon the earnings of
its subsidiaries, as well as their ability to declare and pay dividends to the
Company. Certain subsidiaries may be limited in their ability to pay dividends
by capital and other rules of regulatory bodies, as well as certain covenants in
instruments governing certain indebtedness.

 Dividend distributions from securities brokerage firms are restricted by
federal and state securities laws, the rules and regulations thereunder and/or
the rules and regulations of exchanges of which the firms are members. As a
result, EVEREN Securities cannot lawfully pay dividends that would either reduce
its net capital amount below the minimum amount required or cause certain net
capital decreases without prior regulatory approval.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the "Selected
Financial Data" in Item 6 and the Company's consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report. In addition to historical
information, this report contains forward-looking statements. Such forward-
looking statements are within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements may include, but are not limited to,
projections of revenues, income or loss, and capital expenditures, as well as
assumptions relating to the foregoing.

 Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified. Future events
and actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the
forward-looking statements. Statements in this report, including the notes to
the consolidated financial statements, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Business", describe factors
that could contribute to or cause such differences. Additional factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such
forward-looking statements include those discussed below.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

 The Company's principal business activity, retail broker-dealer operations,
as well as its investment banking, institutional sales, investment advisory, and
other services, are highly competitive and subject to various risks. The
securities market is affected by general economic and market conditions,
including fluctuations in interest rates, the volume of securities trading,
price levels of securities and the flow of investor funds into and out of mutual
funds, and by factors that apply to particular industries, such as technological
advances and changes in the regulatory environment. Substantial fluctuations
can occur and have occurred in the Company's operating results due to these
factors and other factors. In periods of reduced market activity, profitability
has been and is likely to be adversely affected. Accordingly, net earnings for
any period should not be considered representative of any other period.

 Conditions in the U.S. trading markets continued to be favorable throughout
most of 1998, as moderate economic growth, low levels of unemployment, and
continued growth in corporate profits generally prevailed. Despite these
conditions, the level of inflation has remained relatively low resulting in a
continuation of lower returns to fixed-income investors. As a result, retail
investors continued to shift their holdings to the equity markets. The
performance of U.S. equity markets continued to be very positive in the first
half of 1998, primarily resulting from strong corporate earnings, high levels of
cash inflows into mutual funds, and a continued strong volume of equity
issuances. The third quarter of 1998 was characterized by some of the most
volatile trading markets the industry has had in recent years. Uncertainty
surrounding emerging market currency valuations and significant declines in the
corresponding trading markets had an adverse effect on the U.S. equity markets.
In July 1998, the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced record declines. This
volatility had a tremendous impact on the previously active IPO market, as new
issue equity underwritings declined significantly.

 The favorable market and economic conditions which had characterized 1996
continued throughout much of 1997, contributing to higher industry-wide
securities revenues and net income.

 17

Conditions in the U.S. trading markets were favorable for much of 1997, as
moderate economic growth, low levels of unemployment, and continued growth in
corporate profits generally prevailed. Despite these conditions, the level of
inflation remained relatively low in 1997. U.S. financial markets also
experienced periods of increased volatility during 1997. The market for U.S.
government securities was particularly strong during the latter part of the
year, as market instability in certain Asian markets increased investor demand
for less risky investments. The performance of U.S. equity markets also was very
positive in 1997, primarily resulting from strong corporate earnings, high
levels of cash inflows into mutual funds, and a high volume of equity issuances.
U.S. equity markets also experienced periods of increased volatility,
particularly during the second and fourth quarters of 1997. During both of these
periods, equity markets experienced sharp selloffs that were subsequently
followed by strong recoveries.

COMPANY DEVELOPMENTS

 On January 9, 1998, EVEREN completed the acquisition of Principal
Securities Holding Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Principal
Financial Securities, Inc. ("Principal Securities"), from Principal Life
Insurance Company for 75 million in cash. Principal Securities was a registered
securities broker-dealer and operated as a separate subsidiary of EVEREN until
Principal Securities' back office and other operating activities were combined
with those of EVEREN Securities in the second quarter of 1998.

 On May 11, 1998, the Company's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one
split of its common shares ("Common Stock"). The split was effected in the form
of a stock dividend and distributed on June 16, 1998 to shareholders of record
on June 2, 1998.

 On November 2, 1998, EVEREN and The Bank of New York ("BONY") announced the
completion of a transaction pursuant to which BONY acquired an 80 interest in
EVEREN Clearing. On October 23, 1998 in anticipation of the transaction, EVEREN
Securities became a carrying broker-dealer. In conjunction with the transaction,
EVEREN realized a one-time after-tax gain of approximately 11.9 million in the
fourth quarter of 1998. The transaction is not expected to have a significant
impact on the Company's financial position or ongoing earnings from operations.

 Consistent with the generally strong economic and market conditions seen
throughout the securities industry in 1997, the Company reported strong growth
in both its retail brokerage and investment banking activities in 1998. The
favorable industry conditions combined with the Company's strategy to grow its
core business has resulted in considerable growth in both the number of
investment consultants and their productivity, as well as increases in the
number of underwritings and investment banking transactions in which the Company
has participated. The Company's continued success as a public company and the
continued majority employee ownership have contributed to the strong growth in
the Company's recruiting efforts and generally positive employee morale.
Management believes that significant employee ownership fosters a culture that
encourages strong performance, and provides employees the opportunity to
participate in the future performance of the Company. The Company continues to
sponsor three employee benefit plans that provide employees the opportunity to
acquire the Company's Common Stock outside of the EVEREN Capital Corporation
401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "KSOP"). In connection with these
plans, the Company recognizes additional compensation 

 18

expense equal to the difference between the fair value of the Common Stock
issued and the amount of cash compensation otherwise payable or cash paid under
each respective plan.

 In 1996, the Company undertook several key initiatives to better position
itself as a full service, super-regional securities brokerage firm. These
activities are summarized in the following paragraphs:

 Consistent with its strategy to focus on core businesses, the Company
completed the sale of BETA Systems, Inc. ("BETA"), a wholly-owned data
processing and quote service subsidiary, on April 30, 1996, for 63.5 million.
The sale, which resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately 30.2 million, is
reflected in the Company's 1996 results of operations.

 On June 17, 1996 the Company exchanged all of its outstanding Exchangeable
Preferred Stock for an aggregate 32.2 million principal amount of 13.5 Junior
Subordinated Debentures due 2007 ("Debentures"). On July 30, 1996 the Company
issued a notice calling all of the outstanding Debentures for redemption on
September 16, 1996 at a price of 112 of principal or 36.0 million, plus
accrued interest. This early redemption was funded principally through 36.0
million of bank borrowings and resulted in an extraordinary charge of
approximately 2.9 million after-tax for the year ended December 31, 1996 due to
the early extinguishment of debt.

 On July 25, 1996 the Company entered into a joint venture agreement (the
"JVA"), pursuant to which it acquired an initial 20 ownership interest in
Mentor Investment Group, Inc. ("Mentor"), the asset management subsidiary of
Wheat First Butcher Singer, Inc., for no direct cash consideration. Under the
terms of the JVA, the Company's ownership interest may increase to as much as
50 . This joint venture is being accounted for as an equity investment and the
Company's proportionate share of the earnings or losses of Mentor since November
1, 1996 (commencement of operations) have been included in the Company's
operating results.

 On August 5, 1996 the Company paid a special purpose cash dividend of 1.18
per share on its common shares outstanding as of July 23, 1996. This dividend
allowed the KSOP to repay the balance of its loan to the Company, incurred in
connection with its separation from Kemper Corporation, and allowed the release
of substantially all of the remaining unallocated KSOP shares to employee
participant accounts.

 On October 8, 1996 the Company completed its initial public offering,
whereby 4.6 million shares of its .01 par value Common Stock were sold at a
price of 18.50 per share (or 9.2 million shares of .01 par value common stock
at a price of 9.25, after adjustment for the Company's 2-for-1 stock split
discussed previously). The initial public offering resulted in net proceeds of
approximately 78 million to the Company. Such proceeds were used to reduce
bank loans payable. The Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol "EVR".

 In keeping with its strategic initiative to concentrate on its core
businesses, the Company exited certain portions of its municipal institutional
sales and trading and the unit investment trust origination businesses in the
fourth quarter of 1996.

 Effective January 1, 1996, the Company implemented a quasi-reorganization
and revalued its assets and liabilities to fair value as of that date. This
revaluation resulted in a reduction in net assets of 3.7 million. The quasi-
reorganization also resulted in the transfer of the accumulated deficit as of
January 1, 1996 of 306.5 million to additional paid-in capital. Such
revaluation has 

 19

not had and in the future will not have any significant impact on the operating
results of the Company. The balance in retained earnings at December 31, 1998
and 1997 represents the accumulated net earnings available to common
stockholders arising subsequent to the date of the quasi-reorganization. The
quasi-reorganization was effected in order to reflect the emergence of the
Company as a new organization, signaling the end of its transition from a 
wholly-owned subsidiary to a fully independent company and enable the Company to
present more accurately the new organization's cumulative performance.

YEAR 2000

 The Year 2000 problem is the result of computer programs being written
using two digits (rather than four) to define the applicable year. Computer
programs that have time-sensitive software may recognize a date using "00" as
the year 1900 rather than the year 2000. This could result in a major system
failure or miscalculations.

 The failure of the Company's technology systems relating to a Year 2000
problem would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
results of operations, or financial condition. This effect could include
disruption of normal business transactions, such as the settlement, execution,
processing, and recording of trades in securities and commodities. The Year
2000 problem could also increase the Company's exposure to risk and its need for
liquidity.

 The Company fully recognizes the importance of addressing Year 2000
technology issues and has committed significant funding and resources to the
project. Overall, the firm is comfortable that it is making a reasonable effort
to ensure that all affected areas are identified and, if necessary, remediated.
The Company's Year 2000 project is directed by the Company's Chief Information
Officer, who, utilizing a team of technology professionals, has conducted a
comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could
be affected by the Year 2000 issue and has developed an implementation plan to
address the issue. This plan involves the following phases: awareness,
inventory/assessment, renovation, validation, and implementation. The awareness
phase defined and internally publicized the Year 2000 issue. Management support
was obtained and plans were put in place to develop the project. The
inventory/assessment phase consisted of conducting a thorough inventory of
computer applications used in each of the Company's departments. With the
assistance of technology professionals, each department compiled a complete
inventory of all software and hardware systems currently in use. A departmental
liaison was selected who was then responsible for assigning an impact status to
each system based on the negative impact that would result if a Year 2000
problem were to occur. These reports were then utilized to determine the level
of remediation necessary. The renovation phase involves (1) altering software
and hardware and documenting such changes; (2) developing replacement systems;
and (3) retiring eliminated systems. The process also considered the complex
interdependencies among applications, hardware platforms, databases, and
internal/external interfaces. The validation phase involved the testing of all
converted or replaced systems to (1) discover errors introduced during the
renovation phase; (2) validate Year 2000 compliance; and (3) verify operational
readiness. The testing will address application and database interdependencies
as well as interfaces. A Year 2000 test environment was created to ensure
adequate validation. Once converted or replaced and subsequently tested, Year
2000 compliant applications and system components will be implemented. The
implementation phase is on-going as the reintegration of applications into
production are coordinated to account for certain system interdependencies.

 20

In addition, the Company is actively working with all of its major external
counterparties and suppliers to assess their compliance efforts and the
Company's exposure to them. The Company's major external counterparty is BETA,
the provider of the Company's core brokerage system. The Company's external
interface (ie, point-to-point) testing is being conducted by BETA on the
Company's behalf. The Company, with BETA, has participated in point-to-point
testing with national securities exchanges and utilities and will participate in
industry-wide testing currently scheduled for March and April 1999. The Company
presently believes that, with modifications to existing software and the
conversion to new software, the Year 2000 problem will not pose significant
operational problems for the Company's computer systems as so modified and
converted. However, if such modifications and conversions are not completed
timely, both internally and at the Company's major external service providers,
the Year 2000 problem may have a material impact on the operations of the
Company.

 Each department within the Company, along with dedicated technology
professionals, continues to develop specific contingency plans, with the
particular choice of contingency action dependent on the severity of the problem
being addressed, the availability of alternative products, and the level of
importance of the business activity supported by the problematic system. As part
of its Year 2000 readiness efforts, the Company has undertaken a project to
develop plans to reduce risks associated with a Year 2000 problem.

 A significant portion of the current year's technology budget has been
allocated to the Year 2000 compliance project. As of the end of 1998, the total
estimated expenditures associated with the entire Year 2000 project were
expected to be approximately 6 million, of which approximately 3 million is
remaining. The majority of these remaining expenditures are expected to cover
software remediation, testing, and contingency planning. There can be no
assurance that the costs associated with such remediation efforts will not
exceed those currently anticipated, or that the costs associated with the
remediation efforts or the possible failure of such remediation efforts would
not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of
operations, or financial condition.

1998 Compared to 1997

 The Company experienced strong operating results for 1998 when compared to
1997. Contributing significantly to these results was the acquisition of
Principal Securities in the beginning of the first quarter of 1998. Both
revenues and expenses are higher in the 1998 periods than in the comparable
periods of 1997 as a result of the Principal Securities acquisition;
additionally, revenues from the Company's core businesses increased
significantly. Non-interest expenses have increased in most areas, generally in
direct correlation with the increased revenues. Net income improved
significantly in 1998 when compared to 1997. Management attributes these results
to several factors including the generally favorable conditions which prevailed
in the equity markets throughout the first half of 1998, reflecting continued
investor optimism concerning inflation and relative interest rate stability.
Market volatility in the 1998 third quarter did not have a significant impact on
the Company's operating results, but did impact investment banking activity, as
initial public offering ("IPO") activity dissipated. Additionally, the Company
experienced strong growth in its retail and institutional brokerage operations
and asset management activities. Finally, in the first quarter of 1998, the
Company received an arbitration award of 6.0 million in connection with the
raiding of four of its retail branch offices in 1994 by a competitor firm, which
resulted in a 2.9 million increase in net income after related expenses and
taxes.

 Total revenue increased 179.9 million or 29 to 809.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 1998 from 629.7 million for the year ended December 31,
1997. Net revenues increased 162.3 million or 27 to 755.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 1998 from 593.1 million for the year ended December 31,
1997. As previously noted, the Company acquired Principal Securities in the
first quarter of 1998. This transaction, strong market conditions, and internal
growth, were generally responsible for the significant growth in revenue.

 Commission revenue increased 81.2 million or 30 to 349.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 1998 from 267.9 million for the year ended December 31,
1997. The strong increase in commission revenues is due in part to the
acquisition of the retail brokerage force of Principal Securities and the
continued strong productivity and growth of the Company's retail brokerage
force. The Company experienced strong growth in sales of mutual fund and annuity
products and, to a lesser degree, a movement by investors from over-the-counter
equities to investments in listed securities.

 Principal transactions revenue increased 18.1 million or 18 to 121.0
million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from 102.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 1997. This increase is due largely to the consistently strong
market throughout most of 1998 compared to some volatility that characterized
the equity markets in part of the 1997 first quarter, as well as the increase in
transactional volume that resulted from the larger investment consultant
population in 1998.

 Investment banking revenue increased 16.5 million or 24 to 86.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 1998 from 69.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 1997. These increases are the result of the Company's strategy of
developing its corporate finance business in several targeted industry sectors,
which was aided by favorable IPO market conditions during the 

 23

first half of 1998. This focus enabled the Company to participate in a larger
number of underwritings, including equity, taxable and tax-exempt issues, in
1998 than in 1997. Market volatility in the third quarter of 1998 significantly
impacted the number of equity underwritings that took place in the third and
fourth quarters and had the effect of depressing revenues in this area when
compared to the first two quarters of 1998.

 Asset management revenue increased 34.2 million or 46 to 107.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 1998 from 73.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 1997, due to the significant growth of client assets invested in
managed accounts (approximately 37 over the prior year) and mutual funds and
the resulting increase in managed account fees and 12b-1 distribution fees. The
increase also reflects the growth in earnings in Mentor Investment Group, in
which the Company currently holds a 20 equity interest.

 Other income increased 7.2 million or 24 to 37.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 1998 from 30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.
The increase in 1998 is primarily attributable to the 6.0 million arbitration
award discussed earlier.

 Interest and dividend income increased 22.7 million or 27 to 107.9
million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from 85.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 1997. Net interest increased 5.1 million or 10 to 53.7
million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from 48.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 1997. These increases are a result of significant growth in
the Company's customer margin accounts, specifically a 20 increase in average
margin debits for the year ended December 31, 1998 when compared to 1997.

 Total non-interest expenses increased 141.4 million or 27 to 659.5
million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from 518.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 1997. The acquisition of Principal Securities as well as the
Company's internal growth created significant increases in most expense
categories.

 Compensation and benefits expense increased 96.3 million or 27 to 448.8
million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from 352.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 1997. This increase is primarily attributable to the growth
in commission revenue, principal transactions revenue and investment banking
revenues in 1998, resulting in increased production-based payouts. This increase
is also related to the acquisition of Principal Securities as mentioned above,
which generally had higher percentages of compensation expense to net revenues,
and the increased employee base (approximately 16 in 1998 when compared to
1997.

 Brokerage and clearance expense increased 8.2 million or 48 to 25.4
million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from 17.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 1997. The increase reflects the variable nature of this
expense, which increased in relative proportion to the growth in transactional
revenue in 1998 over 1997, as well as the change to a new clearing agreement
with BNY Clearing in the fourth quarter of 1998. As a result of the sale of 80 
of EVEREN Clearing to BONY, certain primarily fixed expenses previously included
in the Company's consolidated results of operations in all expense categories
have been eliminated but are offset by increased, primarily variable, clearing
expense.

 24

Communications expense increased 9.9 million or 23 to 52.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 1998 from 42.6 million for the year ended December
31, 1997, primarily due to an increased number of employees in 1998 when
compared to 1997 and to ongoing technology enhancements initiated beginning in
late 1997 to improve the Company's overall productivity and competitiveness.

 Occupancy and equipment expense increased 6.3 million or 15 to 47.1
million for the year ended December 31, 1998 from 40.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 1997. This increase is largely the result of the Principal
Securities acquisition, which added approximately 35 new branch office locations
to the Company's existing retail system.

 Promotional expense increased 4.4 million or 20 to 25.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 1998 from 21.5 million for the year ended December 31,
1997. This increase is due primarily to increased participation in sales
incentive programs which have resulted from both the acquisition of Principal
Securities and the Company's own internal growth.

 Other expenses increased 16.3 million or 37 to 59.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 1998 from 43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.
This increase is related primarily to an increase in professional fees which
includes fees related to the aforementioned NYSE arbitration award; as well as
additional costs of licensing, insurance and various other office expenses
resulting from the increased employee and customer base in 1998 when compared to
1997, and the cost of integrating Principal Securities into the operations of
EVEREN Securities.

 The Company's income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 1998
includes the 19.8 million gain on the sale of 80 of EVEREN Clearing to BONY.
The Company's income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 1998 totaled
 44.4 million, which represents an effective tax rate on income before taxes of
38.4 compared to 28.4 million or a 37.9 effective tax rate for the year ended
December 31, 1997.

 Net income increased 24.7 million or 53 to 71.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 1998 from 46.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.
Excluding the 11.9 million after-tax gain on the sale of 80 of EVEREN
Clearing, net income increased 12.8 million or 27 over 1997.

1997 Compared to 1996

 The Company experienced stronger overall operating results for the year
ended December 31, 1997 when compared to 1996. In particular, the strong retail
and equity underwriting markets in the third and fourth quarters of 1997
contributed to the Company's 11 growth in net revenues over the year ended
December 31, 1996. The Company also continued to focus on its core business,
full service securities brokerage. This focus resulted in the sale of the
Company's data-processing and quote service subsidiary, BETA, in April 1996, and
the departure from both the unit investment trust origination business and
portions of the municipal institutional sales and trading business in the fourth
quarter of 1996. The sale of BETA resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately
 50.2 million and an after-tax gain of 

 25

approximately 30.2 million. Net income from the Company's ongoing operations
improved in 1997 by 11.4 million or 32 when compared to 1996. Management
attributes these results to several factors. First, favorable conditions
continued to prevail in the industry for most of the year ended December 31,
1997, reflecting continued investor optimism concerning inflation, interest rate
stability and a strong U.S. economy. Second, the Company continued to enjoy the
benefits of significant employee ownership, which, in management's opinion, has
enhanced employee morale, focus and productivity, and has allowed management to
concentrate on achieving its strategic initiatives. Finally, a continued focus
on cost containment has contributed to the strong operating results.

 Total revenue increased 59.1 million or 10 to 629.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 1997 from 570.6 million for the year ended December 31,
1996. Net revenue increased 56.5 million or 11 to 593.1 for the year ended
December 31, 1997 from 536.6 for the year ended December 31, 1996. As
previously noted, the Company sold or exited certain non-strategic businesses in
1996. Excluding revenue from these businesses, total revenue for the year ended
December 31, 1997 increased by 85.6 million or 16 from 544.1 million in 1996,
and net revenue for the year ended December 31, 1997 increased by 81.1 million
or 16 over 1996.

 Commission revenue increased 42.1 million or 19 to 267.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 1997 from 225.8 million for the year ended December 31,
1996. These increases are primarily due to increased business in both the
retail and institutional areas, consistent with the continued growth in listed
share volume on most major domestic equity exchanges in 1997. The increases are
also a result of an increase in the number of retail investment consultants from
1,220 in 1996 to 1,333 in 1997.

 Principal transactions revenue decreased 12.4 million or 11 to 102.9
million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from 115.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 1996. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 1997 is
attributable, in part, to a shift in transaction volume away from both fixed
income products and from over-the-counter stocks to listed equities, and the
departure from a portion of the Company's institutional municipal trading
business. The third and fourth quarters of 1997 reflected increases over the
same periods of 1996, due to the strong equity markets.

 Investment banking revenue increased 13.6 million or 24 to 69.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 1997 from 55.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 1996. Excluding investment banking revenue of 9.5 million
generated from the aforementioned exited businesses in 1996, investment banking
revenues increased 23.1 million or 50 for the year ended December 31, 1997.
This increase is the result of the Company's strategy of developing corporate
finance transactions in specific targeted industry sectors aided by the strong
equity markets throughout most of 1997. These factors have contributed to the
Company's greater involvement both in average offering size and number of
offerings made in the equity underwriting market for the year ended December 31,
1997.

 Asset management revenue increased 16.3 million or 28 to 73.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 1997 from 57.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 1996, due primarily 

 26

to increased managed account fees and increased 12b-1 distribution fees. These
increases are reflective of increases in the number and asset values of managed
accounts and increased investments in mutual funds in 1997.

 Other income decreased 11.6 million or 27 to 30.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 1997 from 42.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1996.
This decrease is due primarily to the sale of BETA in the second quarter of
1996.

 Interest and dividend income increased 11.1 million or 15 to 85.2
million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from 74.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 1996. Net interest increased 8.5 million or 21 to 48.6
million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from 40.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 1996. The Company experienced significant growth in its
customer margin accounts in 1997 which contributed to its increased interest
revenues.

 Total non-interest expenses increased 39.1 million or 8 to 518.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 1997 from 479.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 1996.

 Compensation and benefits expense increased 21.1 million or 6 to 352.5
million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from 331.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 1996. The increase is attributed to the 11 increase in
commissions, principal transactions and investment banking revenues in 1997.
Compensation as a percentage of net revenues decreased in 1997 versus 1996 due
to the continued focus by management on controlling overall compensation
expense. In addition, 1996 expense includes certain compensation costs related
to the release of unearned KSOP shares.

 Brokerage and clearance expense increased 2.7 million or 19 to 17.2
million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from 14.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 1996. The increase is due primarily to certain variable cost
components of this expense category which have increased as transactional
revenues increased.

 Communications expense increased 4.3 million or 11 to 42.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 1997 from 38.3 million for the year ended December
31, 1996. This increase was due primarily to an increased number of employees
along with technology initiatives and enhancements undertaken in 1997 to improve
the Company's overall productivity and competitiveness.

 Occupancy and equipment expense increased 1.6 million or 4 to 40.8
million for the year ended December 31, 1997 from 39.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 1996. The modest increase in this expense was primarily due
to the Company's focus on utilization of existing office space in its growth
efforts.

 Promotional expense increased 3.7 million or 21 to 21.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 1997 from 17.8 million for the year ended December 31,
1996. This increase was primarily due to increased advertising related to name
recognition and the Company's expansion in 

 27

breadth of products and services, as well as internal marketing of Mentor mutual
fund products and other promotions.

 Other expenses increased 5.7 million or 15 to 43.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 1997 from 37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1996.
This increase was related primarily to an increase in professional fees as well
as additional costs of licensing, insurance and various other office expenses
resulting from the increased number of employees in 1997 when compared to 1996.

 The Company's income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 1997 was
 28.4 million, which represented an effective tax rate on income before taxes of
37.9 compared to 42.4 million or a 39.3 effective tax rate for the year ended
December 31, 1996.

 Net income decreased 15.9 million to 46.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 1997 from 62.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1996. Net
income for the year ended December 31, 1996 included an after-tax extraordinary
charge of 2.9 million related to the early retirement of debt. Excluding the
after-tax gain on sale of BETA of 30.2 million and the 2.9 million after-tax
charge noted above, net income for the year ended December 31, 1997 improved
 11.4 million or 32 over the year ended December 31, 1996.

____________________________

(1) Includes a 19.8 million pretax or 10.7 11.9 million after-tax or 6.4 gain on the sale of 80 of EVEREN Clearing.

 The generally upward trend in the Company's total revenue for the eight
quarterly periods ended December 31, 1998 is consistent with the generally
strong economic and market conditions seen throughout the securities industry.
The third and fourth quarter of 1998 results, however, reflect investor caution
and the slow-down in the IPO markets due to volatility related to overseas
market uncertainty. The Company reported strong growth in both its retail
brokerage and investment banking activities. The favorable industry conditions
combined with the Company's strategy to grow its core business has resulted in
considerable growth in both the number of investment consultants and their
productivity, as well as increases in the number of underwritings and investment
banking transactions in which the Company has participated. Net revenues during
this eight-quarter period follow the same positive trend, with the Company
realizing the benefits of continued growth in its customer margin accounts.

 While in absolute dollar amounts, non-interest expenses have trended up
during the eight periods, such absolute dollar increases are primarily
attributable to compensation and benefits expense and brokerage and clearance
expense, which are significantly correlated to revenue growth. As a percentage
of net revenues, non-interest expenses have remained relatively constant or
grown incrementally in relation to the Company's increased employee base during
such periods.

 Net income (both in absolute dollar amounts and as a percentage of net
revenue) also reflects a positive trend during this eight-quarter period.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 Holding Company

 EVEREN Capital Corporation ("EVEREN Capital") is the parent holding company
for EVEREN Securities Holdings, Inc. ("EVEREN Holdings"), the holding company
for the Company's operating subsidiaries. As the parent, EVEREN Capital expects
to receive dividends, interest on any loans and payments for federal income tax
from its subsidiaries. Dividends and other distributions, as well as certain
interest payments, to EVEREN Capital from its registered broker-dealer
subsidiary, which is EVEREN Capital's primary source of liquidity, are
restricted by applicable laws or regulations as to amounts which may be paid.
The "net capital" rules are the primary regulatory restrictions. EVEREN
Capital's rights (and the rights of its stockholders and creditors) to
participate in the assets of any subsidiary are also subject to prior claims of
the subsidiary's creditors, including customers of the broker-dealer subsidiary
(except to the extent the Company itself may be a creditor with recognized
claims). See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in
Item 8 of this report. The Company has also generated funds from bank loans and
the issuance of Common Stock.

 Upon becoming a publicly-traded company, the Company, with approval from
its Board of Directors, began to pay quarterly dividends of .09 per share on
the outstanding shares of Common Stock. In November 1997, the Board of Directors
approved an increase in the quarterly dividend rate to .11 per share on the
Company's Common Stock, which was paid in December 1997 and March 1998. On May
11, 1998, the Company's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of
its common shares. The split was effected by means of a stock dividend to
shareholders of record on June 2, 1998, and was distributed on June 16, 1998.
The Board of Directors also approved an additional increase in the Company's
dividend to .14 per pre-split share, or .07 per post-split share, beginning in
the second quarter of 1998.

 The Company maintains a 50 million committed revolving credit facility
with two banks all of which is unused at December 31, 1998. The initial term of
the agreement was for two years, subject to a one-year extension by mutual
agreement of the parties. On March 1, 1999, the Company extended the term of
the agreement to June 30, 2000. Commitment fees under this facility are equal
to a rate per annum of .25 on the average daily unused balance. Interest on
the outstanding borrowing is based upon the Company's election of a "reference
rate" equal to LIBOR or the banks' prime rate.

 In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company announced a stock repurchase
program whereby it will repurchase up to one million shares of its common stock
in open market or private transactions subject to market conditions. Shares
repurchased will be used to fund option grants and other equity opportunity
programs.

 In February 1999, the Company created the EVEREN 1999 Capital Fund, LLC
(the "Fund") to enable its key employees or directors to pool their investment
resources and make investments on a more advantageous basis. The Fund expects
to invest exclusively in other investment funds. The Company acts as managing
member and is committed to invest up to 20 million in the Fund.

 The Company believes that its current level of equity capital, funds
generated from operations, and existing credit facilities will be adequate to
fund its capital needs for the foreseeable future.

 31

Operating Subsidiaries

 The assets of EVEREN Securities, Inc., the Company's primary operating
subsidiary (the "Subsidiary" or "EVEREN Securities"), are highly liquid. The
majority of its assets consist of securities inventories and collateralized
receivables, both of which fluctuate depending on the levels of customer
business. Collateralized receivables consist primarily of customer margin
debits, and securities purchased under agreements to resell ("resale
agreements"), all of which is secured by highly marketable equity and corporate
debt securities or U.S. government and agency securities. In addition, EVEREN
Securities has significant receivables from customers, and brokers and dealers
which turn over rapidly. The Subsidiary's total assets and the individual
components of total assets vary significantly from period to period because of
changes relating to customer needs and economic and market conditions. A
relatively small percentage of total assets is fixed or held for a period of
longer than one year. The Company's total assets at December 31, 1998 and 1997,
were approximately 2.2 billion and 1.9 billion, respectively.

 The majority of EVEREN Securities' assets are financed through daily
operations by securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities sold
not yet purchased, bank loans, payables to customers, brokers and dealers, and
securities loaned. Short-term funding is generally obtained at rates based on
the federal funds, LIBOR or money market rates. Other borrowing costs are
negotiated depending upon prevailing market conditions. The Company monitors
overall liquidity by tracking the extent to which unencumbered marketable assets
exceed short-term unsecured borrowings. The Company maintains borrowing
relationships with a broad range of banks, financial institutions,
counterparties and others. At December 31, 1998, EVEREN Securities had
approximately 495 million in uncommitted credit lines with several banks.

 EVEREN Securities maintains two committed, secured lines of credit. The
first committed line is provided through a 500 million facility from BONY. This
facility expires on November 1, 1999, but may be extended for 364-day periods by
mutual agreement of the parties. Extensions of the facility cannot be made more
than twice per year. At December 31, 1998, 171 million of the 271 million in
bank loans payable was drawn against this facility. The second line is provided
under a 200 million facility from various banks, for which the Company pays a
commitment fee on the unused portion. This facility expires on October 29, 1999,
but may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties for successive 364-day
periods through October 29, 2003. No borrowings were outstanding on this
facility at December 31, 1998. Borrowings under each of the committed lines of
credit may be secured by either customer margin or firm securities, with
interest based upon overnight bank lending rates.

 Repurchase agreements are used primarily for customer accommodation
purposes and to finance the Company's inventory positions in U.S. government and
agency securities. These positions provide products and liquidity for customers
and are not maintained for the Company's investment or market speculation. The
level of activity fluctuates significantly depending on customer needs; however,
these fluctuations have no material effect on cash flows, liquidity or capital
resources. The Company monitors the collateral position and counterparty risk on
these transactions daily. See "Risk Management."

 EVEREN Securities is capital intensive. In addition to normal operating
requirements, capital is required to cover financing and regulatory charges on
securities inventories, investment banking commitments and investments in fixed
assets. The Company's overall capital needs are continually reviewed to ensure
that its capital base can appropriately support the anticipated needs 

 32

of the Subsidiary. Management believes that existing capital, funds from
operations and current credit facilities will be sufficient to finance the
operating subsidiaries' ongoing businesses. The majority of the assets of EVEREN
Securities are funded with liabilities that reprice on a matched basis,
generally producing a positive spread. As a result, the Company has modest
exposure to fluctuations in interest rates (other than the effect of interest
rate volatility on market conditions and prices of fixed income securities, and
the impact of any such fluctuations on the Company's revenues).

CASH FLOWS

 The Company's statements of consolidated cash flows classify cash flows
into three broad categories: net cash flows from operating activities, investing
activities and financing activities. The Company's net cash flows are
principally associated with operating and financing activities, which support
the Company's trading, customer and banking activities.

Years Ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996

 Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996 totaled
 20.0 million, 36.2 million, and 46.6 million, respectively, reflecting
decreases of 16.3 million and 10.3 million for 1998 and 1997, respectively,
and an increase of 32.0 million in 1996.

 In 1998, cash provided by operating activities, was used primarily to
reduce bank loans payable and in the acquisition of Principal Securities. In
1997, cash was used in operating activities primarily due to the growth in
customer margin debits which was offset by cash provided by financing activities
primarily through bank loans. For the year ended December 31, 1996, cash
provided from operating activities was used primarily to reduce bank loans
payable.

 Net cash provided by operating activities totaled 61.9 million in 1998.
Net cash used by operating activities totaled 159.5 million in 1997. Net cash
provided by operating activities totaled 74.9 million in 1996. In 1998,
changes in securities borrowed and loaned of 139.7 million combined with a
decrease in securities owned of 45.3 million generated cash. Net increases in
receivables from customers and broker dealers of 82.4 million and a decrease in
securities sold, not yet purchased of 70.8 million partially used this cash.
In 1997, net increases in net receivables from customers and brokers and dealers
of 302.9 million used cash. These uses were partially offset by changes in
securities borrowed and loaned of 47.2 million, and changes in securities
purchased/sold under agreements to resell/repurchase of 26.6 million, and
securities owned and securities sold, not yet purchased of 13.3 million, which
generated cash. In 1996, changes in securities borrowed and securities loaned
of 145.1 million and securities purchased/sold under agreements to
resell/repurchase of 12.7 million generated cash. These sources were partially
offset by a 60.9 million use of funds related to the decrease in net
receivables from and payables to customers, broker-dealers and others.

 In 1998, net cash provided by investing activities of 72,000 is the net
result of the acquisition of Principal Securities which used 51.3 million of
cash and the sale of 80 of the Company's interest in its EVEREN Clearing
subsidiary, which generated 37.8 million of net proceeds. Collections of
principal on investments in mortgage-backed certificates also generated 34.4
million of cash, which is offset by 25.9 million of fixed asset expenditures
related primarily to the Company's rollout of upgraded broker workstations. In
1997, net cash provided by investing activities of 1.2 million were the result
of cash generated through collections of principal on investments in mortgage-
backed securities of 16.4 million, offset by 15.2 million of fixed asset

 33

expenditures, the majority of which relate to investments in technology. In
1996, net cash provided by investing activities of 57.5 million resulted
primarily from the net proceeds of 59.3 million generated by the sale of BETA.
Collections of principal on investments in mortgage-backed securities of 16.5
million were offset by a net increase of 8.8 million of fixed assets and the
purchase of investments in mortgage-backed securities of 9.5 million.

 In 1998, net cash used in financing activities of 78.3 million is made up
of a decrease in bank loans payable of 33.0 million and the repayment of
collateralized mortgage obligations of 38.4 million. In 1997, net cash
provided by financing activities totaled 147.9 million, primarily due to an
increase in bank loans payable of 164.0 million. Proceeds from the issuance of
Common Stock under the Company's stock incentive programs also generated cash of
 9.1 million. These combined to provide cash of 173.1 million which was used
to fund 16.3 million of repayments of collateralized mortgage obligations, 6.5
million of dividends paid on the Company's Common Stock, and 2.4 million of
treasury share purchases. In 1996, net cash flows used by financing activities
amounted to 100.4 million, the net result of the net proceeds of approximately
 77.8 million generated by the Company's initial public offering and the
repayment of bank loans of 157.8 million, retirement of subordinated debt of
 36 million and payment of dividends of 16.4 million.

 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

 Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted certain provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 125, "Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities" ("SFAS
125"), which are applicable to its business. SFAS 125 introduces the financial
components approach, which focuses on the recognition of financial assets and
liabilities an entity controls and the derecognition of financial assets and
liabilities for which control has been transferred. As a result, the Company
continues to report assets it has pledged as collateral in secured borrowings
and other arrangements when the secured party cannot sell or repledge the assets
or the Company can substitute collateral or otherwise redeem it on short notice.
The Company generally does not report assets received as collateral in secured
lending and other arrangements because the debtor typically has the right to
redeem the collateral on short notice. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 125 did
not have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

 In 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position ("SOP")
98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use." SOP 98-1, which is effective January 1, 1999, provides guidance
on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for
internal use which was previously accounted for as an expense. The impact on the
financial statements of implementing SOP 98-1 cannot be determined at this time.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

 Derivatives are financial instruments, the payments on which are linked to
the prices, or relationships between prices, of securities or commodities,
interest rates, currency exchange rates or other financial measures
(collectively referred to as "cash market instruments"). Derivatives enable the
Company and its clients to manage their exposure to interest rates and currency
exchange rates, and security and other price risks. Derivatives include
structured notes, swaps, futures or forward 

 34

contracts and options. Certain types of derivatives, including forwards and
certain options, are traded in the OTC markets. Other types of derivatives,
including futures contracts and listed options, are traded on regulated
exchanges.

 Based on relative notional amounts, management believes that the Company's
derivative activities are not as extensive as those of many of its competitors.
The Company does not engage in the speculative trading of derivatives. Instead,
the Company has focused its derivative activities on trading in forward and
futures contracts in U.S. government and agency issued or guaranteed securities
as hedges against the Company's securities inventory positions. The Company
also executes transactions in exchange-traded futures contracts and listed
options on behalf of its customers.

 The Company enters into certain futures and options contracts on a limited
basis in the ordinary course of its business to hedge or modify exposures to
interest rate fluctuations related to interest-sensitive securities in its
inventory. Given the limited use of such derivatives, the Company has not
incurred and does not expect to incur any material losses relating to its
derivative investments that would not be substantially offset with corresponding
gains on the securities positions hedged. Both the securities hedged and the
derivative instruments are carried on the consolidated statement of financial
condition at their market values. Gains and losses, both realized and
unrealized, from both the hedged securities and the derivative instruments are
included in current operating results.

RISK MANAGEMENT

 Risk is an inherent part of the Company's business and activities. The
extent to which the Company properly and effectively identifies, assesses,
monitors and manages the various types of risks involved in its business is
critical to its profitability. The Company monitors its risk on a daily basis
through a number of control procedures designed to identify and evaluate the
various risks to which the Company is exposed.

 Risk management at the Company is an integrated process with independent
oversight which requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of
specialized products and markets. The Company's senior management takes an
active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and
procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist
in the identification, assessment and control of various risks.

MARKET RISK

 Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more
market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market
factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a specified position or
portfolio.

 The Company often acts as a principal in customer-related transactions in
financial instruments which expose the Company to market risks. The Company
makes dealer markets in certain equity securities, investment-grade corporate
debt, high-yield securities, U.S. government and agency securities, mortgages
and mortgage-backed securities, and municipal fixed-income securities. As such,
the Company maintains securities inventories to facilitate customer
transactions. The Company covers its exposure to market risk by limiting its
net long or short positions, both overall and by individual product area, by
limiting the number of days inventory is held, by selling or buying similar
instruments and by utilizing various derivative financial 

 35

instruments such as futures and forward and option contracts. The Company's
management believes the Company's philosophy, risk management and hedging
practices result in carefully managed market exposure and reduced earnings
volatility.

 At December 31, 1998 and 1997, the Company's securities owned and
securities sold, not yet purchased consisted of the following (in thousands):

1998 1997 
 -------- --------

 60,069 130,868 
 ======== ======== 

The Company manages risk exposure utilizing mechanisms involving various
levels of management. The Company's risk management committee assists senior
management in managing risk associated with trading and inventory accounts. The
primary function of this committee is to establish and monitor position limits
for these accounts on an ongoing basis. Current and proposed underwriting and
other commitments are subject to due diligence reviews by senior management as
well as professionals in the appropriate business and support units involved.

 The Company's trading activities result in the creation of inventory
positions. Position and exposure reports are prepared daily by operations staff.
Such reports are distributed to and reviewed independently on a daily basis by
the Company's risk management committee as well as members of senior management.
In addition, the corporate accounting group prepares a daily consolidated
summarized position report indicating both long and short exposure. These
reports, which are distributed to various levels of management throughout the
Company, enable senior management to better control inventory levels and monitor
results of the trading areas. The Company also reviews and monitors, at various
levels of management, inventory aging, pricing, concentration and securities
ratings.

 In addition to position and exposure reports, the Company produces a daily
revenue report which summarizes the trading, interest, commissions, fees,
underwriting and other revenue items for each of the trading departments. Daily
revenue is reviewed for various risk factors and is independently verified by
members of the risk management committee. The daily revenue report is summarized
by the corporate accounting group and distributed to various levels of
management

 36

throughout the Company, together with position and exposure reports. These
reports enable senior management to monitor and better control the overall
activity of the trading areas.

CREDIT RISK

 The Company's exposure to credit risk arises from the possibility that a
counterparty to a transaction might fail to perform under its contractual
commitment, resulting in the Company incurring losses. Credit risk related to
various financing activities is reduced by the industry practice of obtaining
and maintaining possession and control of collateral. The Company monitors its
exposure to counterparty risk on a daily basis through the use of credit
exposure information and the monitoring of collateral values. The Company's
credit department is responsible for reviewing counterparties to establish
appropriate exposure limits for a variety of transactions. In addition, the
Company actively manages the credit exposure relating to its trading activities
by monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties and their related trading
limits on an ongoing basis, requesting additional collateral when deemed
necessary and limiting the amount and duration of exposure to individual
counterparties.

LEGAL RISK

 Legal risk includes the risk of non-compliance with applicable legal and
regulatory requirements and the risk that a counterparty's performance
obligations will be unenforceable. The Company is generally subject to extensive
regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts business. The
Company has established legal standards and procedures that are designed to
ensure compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. The
Company, principally through the Legal, Compliance and Finance Departments, has
also established procedures that are designed to ensure that senior management's
policies relating to conduct, ethics and business practices are followed. In
connection with its business, the Company has various procedures that address
issues such as regulatory capital requirements, new products, credit granting,
collection activities, and record-keeping. The Company has also established
certain procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterparty's performance
obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal
authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a
transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency
laws limit or alter contractual remedies.

 The Company seeks to control the risks associated with its investment
banking activities through a process that results in a thorough review by
various committees of the risks associated with all significant transactions
prior to acceptance of any engagement. The Company currently has various
commitment and other review committees. Each such committee is chaired by a
member of senior management and has at least one additional senior management
member. Other committee members include employees who provide expertise in the
evaluation and analysis of proposed transactions brought before the particular
committee.

 The Company's risk management effort also includes an emphasis on
compliance. Retail branch managers and other supervisors are required to engage
in specific review and other tasks, and complete various reports, as part of
their supervisory responsibilities. The Company's compliance department
professionals monitor the Company's retail and capital markets activities,
conduct periodic and other examinations, respond to any customer complaints that
arise and interface with the various regulatory agencies that have jurisdiction
over the Company and its business.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
EVEREN Capital Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition
of EVEREN Capital Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December
31, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of EVEREN Capital Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) GENERAL INFORMATION

 EVEREN Capital Corporation ("EVEREN") is a financial services holding
 company, and is engaged primarily in the retail and institutional brokerage
 business, including investment banking and underwriting services. EVEREN's
 primary subsidiary, EVEREN Securities, Inc. ("EVEREN Securities") is
 registered as a broker and dealer in securities under the Securities
 Exchange Act of 1934 and as a futures commission merchant under the
 Commodity Exchange Act. Another subsidiary, Gateway Mortgage Acceptance
 Corporation ("Gateway"), was formed to issue and sell one or more series of
 collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs") directly or through one or
 more beneficially owned trusts (each, a "Trust"). Collectively, EVEREN and
 its subsidiaries are referred to in these notes as the "Company."

 On January 9, 1998, EVEREN completed the acquisition of Principal
 Securities Holding Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Principal
 Financial Securities, Inc. ("Principal Securities") from Principal Life
 Insurance Company for 75 million. Principal Securities was a registered
 securities broker-dealer and operated as a separate subsidiary of EVEREN
 until the second quarter of 1998 when Principal Securities' operating
 activities were combined with those of EVEREN Securities.

 On May 11, 1998, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one
 stock split of its common shares. The split was effected in the form of a
 stock dividend, distributed on June 16, 1998 to shareholders of record on
 June 2, 1998. All share and per share data have been restated to reflect
 the split.

 On November 2, 1998, EVEREN and The Bank of New York ("BONY") completed a
 transaction pursuant to which BONY acquired an 80 interest in EVEREN
 Clearing Corp. ("EVEREN Clearing"). Prior to the transaction, EVEREN
 Clearing was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and its results of
 operations are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of
 income through such date. On October 23, 1998, in anticipation of the
 transaction, EVEREN Securities became a carrying broker-dealer. In
 conjunction with the transaction, the Company realized an after-tax gain of
 approximately 11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 1998. The Company
 accounts for its remaining 20 interest in BNY Clearing Services, LLC ("BNY
 Clearing"), successor to EVEREN Clearing, on the equity method. EVEREN
 Securities now carries the customer securities accounts, which had
 previously been carried by EVEREN Clearing. The transaction is not
 anticipated to have a significant impact on the Company's financial
 position or ongoing operations.

 Since October 23, 1998, EVEREN Securities has cleared all securities
 transactions with and for customers on an omnibus basis through BNY
 Clearing. EVEREN Securities clears all commodities transactions with and
 for customers on a fully disclosed basis through BNY Clearing (see Note
 13).

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During 1996, the Company completed the sale of BETA Systems, Inc.,
 previously a wholly-owned data processing and quote services subsidiary,
 for 63.5 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of approximately 30.2
 million.

 On October 8, 1996 the Company completed its initial public offering,
 whereby 4.6 million shares of common stock were sold at a price of 18.50
 per share (before the 2-for-1 stock split), resulting in net proceeds of
 approximately 78 million to the Company.

(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 Principles of Consolidation
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EVEREN and
 its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
 have been eliminated in consolidation.

 Use of Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
 accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
 assumptions regarding certain securities inventory valuations, the
 potential outcome of litigation, postretirement benefits, and other matters
 that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
 contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
 period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 Securities and Commodities Transactions
 Customer receivables and payables are recorded on a settlement date basis.
 The related commission revenue and expenses from securities and commodities
 transactions are recorded on trade date. Principal securities and
 commodities transactions are also recorded on trade date. Securities owned
 and securities sold, not yet purchased are recorded at market value, with
 unrealized gains and losses included in principal transaction revenue.
 Market value is based primarily on listed or quoted market prices, or at
 values determined by management based on other relevant factors.

 Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under
 Agreements to Repurchase
 Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
 agreements to repurchase are collateralized transactions and are carried at
 the contract amounts at which the securities will be resold or reacquired,
 including accrued interest. It is the policy of the Company to take
 possession of the securities purchased under agreements to resell at the
 time such agreements are entered into. In the event that the market value
 of such securities falls below the contract amount of the related agreement
 to resell, the Company requests additional collateral.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Investment Banking
 Underwriting revenues and fees for mergers and acquisition and advisory
 assignments are recorded when services for the transaction are
 substantially completed. Transaction-related expenses are deferred and
 later expensed to match revenue recognition.

 Securities Borrowed and Securities Loaned
 Securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at the amount of
 cash collateral advanced or received. Securities borrowed transactions
 require the Company to deposit cash, letters of credit, or other collateral
 with the lender. With respect to securities loaned, the Company receives
 collateral in the form of cash or other collateral in an amount generally
 in excess of the market value of securities loaned. The Company monitors
 the market value of securities loaned on a daily basis, with additional
 collateral obtained or refunded as necessary.

 Fixed Assets
 Fixed assets are recorded at historical cost, net of accumulated
 depreciation and amortization. Depreciation on fixed assets is generally
 recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
 assets, which range from four to seven years for furniture and equipment
 and up to thirty years for building and improvements. Leasehold
 improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the
 lease term or the economic life of the asset.

 Goodwill
 Goodwill, which arose from the Principal Securities acquisition and is
 included in other assets, was approximately 35.3 million (net of
 amortization) at December 31, 1998. Goodwill is being amortized on a
 straight-line basis over fifteen years.

 Investments in Mortgage-backed Certificates/Collateralized Mortgage
 Obligations
 The CMOs issued by Gateway are collateralized by certain mortgage-related
 instruments ("Certificates") and the investment of the proceeds relating to
 principal payments and interest on such Certificates. The CMOs are
 accounted for as borrowings. The Certificates are classified as "available-
 for-sale" and are accounted for at market value with unrealized gains or
 losses included in equity. Market value is determined using current market
 valuations from an independent pricing service.

 Investments
 Investments in equity securities and other interests purchased in
 connection with private equity and other principal investment activities
 are initially carried in the consolidated financial statements at their
 original costs. Downward adjustments to the carrying value of such
 securities are made in the event that the Company determines that the
 eventual realizable value is less than the carrying value.

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets, including goodwill, for
 possible impairment based primarily on expected cash flows. When
 circumstances indicate that the

 carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, the carrying amount
 is reduced to the estimated recoverable value. No such impairments existed
 at December 31, 1998 or 1997.

 Stock-Based Compensation 
 The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to employees in
 accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
 Stock Issued to Employees," ("APB Opinion No. 25") which recognizes
 compensation cost based upon the intrinsic value at the date of grant of
 the equity instrument awarded. The Financial Accounting Standards Board
 issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123,
 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which encourages, but does not
 require, companies to recognize compensation expense for grants of stock,
 stock options and other equity instruments based on the fair value of those
 instruments. The Company has elected, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, to
 adopt the disclosure requirement of SFAS No. 123 and continue to account
 for stock-based compensation under APB Opinion No. 25.

 Income Taxes
 Income taxes are provided for using the asset and liability method, under
 which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on differences
 between the financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities
 using currently enacted tax rates.

 Earnings Per Share of Common Stock
 The Company computes earnings per share of common stock in accordance with
 SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share." Basic earnings per share is computed by
 dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average
 number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per
 share assumes the conversion of all dilutive securities.

 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
 Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments not
 held for resale with maturities, when purchased, of three months or less.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted certain provisions of SFAS
 No. 125, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
 Extinguishments of Liabilities." Under SFAS No. 125, the Company continues
 to report assets it has pledged as collateral in secured borrowings and
 other arrangements when the secured party cannot sell or repledge the
 assets or the Company can substitute collateral or otherwise redeem it on
 short notice. The Company generally does not report assets received as
 collateral in secured lending and other arrangements because the debtor
 typically has the right to redeem the collateral on short notice.
 Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 125 did not have a material effect on
 the Company's financial position or results of operations.

 Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, "Reporting
 Comprehensive Income." SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for the reporting
 and display of comprehensive

 income and its components in the consolidated financial statements but has
 no impact on the measurement of such items. The Company's only component of
 other comprehensive income is unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-
 sale securities (net of tax).

 In 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
 Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position
 ("SOP") 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
 Obtained for Internal Use." SOP 98-1, which is effective January 1, 1999,
 provides guidance on the capitalization of costs of computer software
 developed or obtained for internal use which was previously accounted for
 as an expense. The impact on the consolidated financial statements of
 implementing SOP 98-1 cannot be determined at this time.

 Reclassifications
 Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 1998
 financial statement presentation.

(3) RECEIVABLES FROM AND PAYABLES TO CUSTOMERS

 The Company extends credit to its customers to finance their purchases of
 securities on margin. The Company receives income from interest charged on
 such extensions of credit. Customer receivables include amounts due on
 margin balances. Securities owned by customers are held as collateral for
 receivables; such collateral is not recorded in the consolidated financial
 statements. Customer payables include customers' free credit balances.

 outstanding at any month-end during 1998 and 1997 were 487.7 million and
 545.9 million, respectively. Securities sold under agreements to
 repurchase averaged 284.0 million and 342.9 million during 1998 and 1997,
 respectively, and the maximum amounts outstanding at any month-end during
 1998 and 1997 were 453.8 million and 530.6 million, respectively. At
 December 31, 1998, these agreements to repurchase had a weighted-average
 annual interest rate of 4.96 (6.16 at December 31, 1997).

(6) INVESTMENTS IN MORTGAGE-BACKED CERTIFICATES

 As required by the related indenture provisions of the CMOs, the
 Certificates are held as collateral by a trustee of the Trust. The trustee
 collects principal and interest payments from the Certificates, reinvests
 the payments in eligible investments, and makes principal and interest
 payments on the CMOs. A summary of the Certificates is as follows (in

(7) COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS

 Receipt of principal and interest from the Certificates, including
 prepayments, and income earned on the reinvestment of such amounts is
 applied to the extent required by the indenture to make monthly payments of
 principal on the CMOs. Interest rates on the CMOs are fixed and range from
 7.05 to 9.60 per year. The stated maturities range from June 1, 2019
 through May 31, 2026 and represent the dates on which the CMOs of each
 class are expected to be fully paid. The actual maturities of the CMOs will
 depend on the rate of principal payments, including prepayments, on the
 Certificates. The CMOs may be subject to redemption at the option of
 Gateway, in the circumstances and at the redemption price set forth in the
 related prospectus.

(9) BANK LOANS PAYABLE

 At December 31, 1998, bank loans payable consisted of 271 million in loans
 drawn against various lines of credit extended to the Company by various
 banks. These loans are short-term borrowings made primarily to finance
 purchases of securities by customers on margin and purchases of securities
 owned. Interest on such borrowings is based on the federal funds rate
 (4.07 at December 31, 1998).

 The Company maintains various committed and uncommitted lines of credit
 with various banks. The Company maintained uncommitted, unsecured lines of
 credit totaling 40 million, which were utilized fully at December 31,
 1998. At December 31, 1998, uncommitted, secured lines of credit totaling
 455 million had been extended to the Company, of which 60 million was
 utilized.

 EVEREN Securities maintains two committed, secured lines of credit. The
 first committed line is provided through a 500 million facility from BONY.
 This facility expires on November 1, 1999, but may be extended for 364-day
 periods by mutual agreement of the parties. Extensions of the facility
 cannot be made more than twice per year. At December 31, 1998, 171 million
 of the 271 million in bank loans payable was drawn against this facility.

 The second line is provided under a 200 million facility from various
 banks, for which the Company pays a commitment fee on the unused portion.
 This facility expires on October 29, 1999, but may be extended by mutual
 agreement of the parties for successive 364-day periods through October 29,
 2003. No borrowings were outstanding on this facility at December 31, 1998.
 Borrowings under either of the committed lines of credit may be secured by
 either customer margin or firm securities, with interest based upon
 overnight bank lending rates.

 EVEREN has a 50 million committed revolving credit facility with two
 banks, all of which is unused at December 31, 1998. The facility expires on
 July 10, 1999, subject to a one-year extension by mutual agreement of the
 parties. Commitment fees under this facility are paid quarterly at a rate
 per annum of .25 on the average daily unused balance. Fees paid for the
 year ended December 31, 1998 were approximately 70,000.

 Of the bank loans payable outstanding on December 31, 1998, 231 million
 was collateralized by customers' margin account securities with an
 aggregate market value of approximately 296.9 million.

(10) NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

 In accordance with the rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange
 Act of 1934 for registered brokers and dealers, the net capital rules of
 the New York Stock Exchange, and Regulation 1.17 of the Commodity Futures
 Trading Commission, EVEREN Securities must maintain minimum net capital.
 EVEREN Securities operates under the alternative method which requires
 minimum net capital, as defined, equal to the greater of 1 million or 2 
 of aggregate debit items arising from customer transactions, as defined.
 Such net capital requirements could restrict the ability of a subsidiary to
 pay dividends to its parent. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, EVEREN
 Securities had net capital of approximately 187.0 million and 152.0
 million, respectively, which was approximately 165.4 million and 151.0
 million, respectively, in excess of its required minimum net capital.

(11) DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

 EVEREN maintains the EVEREN Capital Corporation 401(k) and Employee Stock
 Ownership Plan ("KSOP") to provide employees with an opportunity to
 accumulate funds for retirement and acquire ownership interests in the
 voting common stock of EVEREN. Participants are eligible to make pretax
 contributions to the KSOP and share in employer contributions, which are
 funded by cash payments and plan forfeitures. Employer contributions are
 generally made at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company.
 Total contribution expense under the KSOP for the years ended December 31,
 1998, 1997 and 1996 was approximately 850,000, 684,000 and 3.0 million,
 respectively.

(12) POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

 The Company sponsors a plan that provides postretirement medical and dental
 benefits for substantially all employees. Employees generally become
 eligible for postretirement benefits when they meet minimum retirement age
 and service requirements. The cost of providing these benefits is shared
 with retirees. The Company reserves the right to change or eliminate the
 benefit plan. The Company accrues the expected cost of providing these
 postretirement benefits during the years that the employee renders the
 necessary service.

 In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 132, "Employers' Disclosures About
 Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits." The provisions of SFAS No. 132
 revise employers' disclosure about pensions and other postretirement
 benefit plans. This pronouncement does not change the measurement or
 recognition of related costs under these plans. The following tables,
 prepared in accordance with the new standard, set forth the changes in
 postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of December 31 (in
 thousands):

 Actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost include
 an annual discount rate of 6.75 for 1998, 7 for 1997, and 7.75 for 1996.
 The assumed health care cost trend rate was 6 for 1999 and is assumed to
 remain at that level thereafter. A one percentage point change in the
 assumed health care cost trend rate would increase and decrease the total
 service and interest cost components and postretirement benefit obligation
 by 32,000 and 262,000, respectively.

(13) TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

 As a part of the sale of an 80 interest in EVEREN Clearing to BONY, EVEREN
 Securities entered into an Omnibus Clearing Agreement (the "Omnibus
 Agreement") and a Facilities Management Agreement (the "Facilities
 Agreement," collectively with the Omnibus Agreement, the "Agreements") with
 BNY Clearing.

 The Omnibus Agreement describes the terms and conditions under which BNY
 Clearing will provide securities execution and clearing services for the
 customer and firm accounts of EVEREN Securities. The Facilities Agreement
 sets forth the terms and conditions under which BNY Clearing will provide
 certain ministerial services relating to activities, including account
 administration, dividend processing, and treasury administration for EVEREN
 Securities. The Agreements provide for an initial term of five years.
 Thereafter, the Agreements remain in effect unless terminated by either
 party upon 180 days' written notice. Under the Agreements, EVEREN
 Securities pays BNY Clearing fees on a per trade basis for clearance,
 settlement, execution and processing. The per trade fees for clearance,
 settlement and processing are subject to discount upon EVEREN Securities'
 attainment of various trade volumes. Fees for clearance and settlement are
 subject to an annual minimum of 24 million in 1999 and 20 million for
 each year thereafter. The Company may terminate the Agreements in the event
 of a change in control upon the payment of a termination fee.

 At December 31, 1998, receivables from brokers and dealers consist entirely
 of amounts due from BNY Clearing in connection with the omnibus clearing
 account.

(14) STOCK OPTIONS

 The Company maintains equity-based incentive plans under which various
 types of stock options are granted to officers, directors, and key
 employees of the Company. The stock options granted under the equity-based
 incentive plans have exercise prices which approximated the market prices
 on the dates of grant, and expire within ten years from the date of grant.
 The options granted generally vest over a three- or five-year period.

 A summary of the Company's stock options for the years ended December 31,
 1998, 1997 and 1996 is as follows (prior periods have been restated to
 reflect the Company's 2-for-1 stock split effected in the second quarter of
 1998):

In 1998 and 1997, had the Company elected to recognize compensation expense
 for its stock option plans pursuant to SFAS No. 123 (based on the fair
 value of options at the grant dates) net income would have been reduced by
 2.6 million and 1.6 million, respectively, and basic and diluted earnings
 per common share would have been reduced by 0.08 and 0.10 and 0.07 and
 0.09, respectively. For options granted in 1996, the compensation cost as
 determined under SFAS No. 123 was not material to the Company's
 consolidated net income or earnings per share calculations.

As a result of certain tax policies adopted by the Company in 1995 as a
 result of its separation from Kemper Corporation (the "Section 338
 election"), the Company recorded its prorata share of a basis reduction in
 its various assets for tax purposes. This reduction in tax basis represents
 future taxable income to the Company as the individual assets are converted
 to cash. Accordingly, a portion of the Company's total deferred tax
 liabilities at December 31, 1998 and 1997 relates to this future income
 recognition.

 have been 1.94 and 1.88, respectively. Historical basic earnings per
 share for 1996, computed in accordance with SFAS No. 128 was 2.68 based on
 22,509,360 weighted average common shares outstanding. Historical diluted
 earnings per share for 1996 was 2.57 based on 23,498,512 weighted average
 common shares outstanding. Dilutive securities include restricted stock and
 options.

 On January 20, 1999, the Company granted options for approximately 965,500
 shares and approximately 561,000 shares of restricted stock pursuant to its
 Restricted Stock Incentive Plans. The effect of these issuances on earnings
 per share will be reflected in the Company's first quarter 1999 results.

(17) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

 The Company leases certain office space under various noncancelable
 operating leases. Future minimum payments under noncancelable operating
 leases with remaining terms greater than one year as of December 31, 1998
 were approximately (in thousands):

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Certain of the leases are subject to changes in the operating costs of the
 particular facilities. Total rental expense for all operating leases,
 including expenses related to the abandonment of leased property, was
 approximately 35.0 million, 31.6 million and 33.3 million for the years
 ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into underwriting
 commitments. Transactions relating to such underwriting commitments, which
 were open at December 31, 1998 and subsequently settled, had no material
 effect on the consolidated financial statements.

 At December 31, 1998, the Company has investments in limited partnerships
 carried at cost with aggregate capital commitments of 10 million over a
 three to five-year period.

 In February 1999, the Company created the EVEREN 1999 Capital Fund, LLC
 (the "Fund") to enable its key employees or directors to pool their
 investment resources and make investments on a more advantageous basis. The
 Fund expects to invest exclusively in other investment funds. The Company
 acts as managing member and is committed to invest up to 20 million in the
 Fund.

(18) LITIGATION

 In the normal course of business, the Company has been named as a defendant
 in various legal actions in connection with its securities and commodities
 business. Some of these lawsuits involve claims for substantial amounts.
 Although the ultimate outcome of these suits cannot be ascertained at this
 time, it is the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel,
 that the resolution of such suits will not have a material adverse effect
 on the financial position of the Company but may be material to the
 Company's operating results for any particular period, depending upon the
 level of the Company's income for such period.

(19) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

 Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk and Concentration of Credit Risk
 Certain market and credit risks are inherent in the Company's business,
 primarily in facilitating customers' trading and financing transactions in
 financial instruments, which include derivatives. In the normal course of
 business, the Company's customer activities include execution, settlement,
 and financing of various customer securities and commodities transactions,
 which may expose the Company to off-balance sheet risk in the event the
 customer is unable to fulfill its contractual obligations.

 The Company's customer securities activities are transacted on either a
 cash or margin basis. In margin transactions, the Company extends credit to
 the customer which is collateralized by cash and/or securities in the
 customer's account. In connection with these activities, the

 59

EVEREN CAPITAL CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Company executes and clears customer transactions involving securities sold
 but not yet purchased ("short sales") and the writing of option contracts.
 The Company also executes customer transactions in the purchase and sale of
 commodity futures contracts (including options on futures), substantially
 all of which are transacted on a margin basis subject to various exchange
 regulations. The Company seeks to control the risks associated with its
 customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in
 compliance with various regulatory, exchange, and internal guidelines. The
 Company monitors required margin levels daily and, pursuant to such
 guidelines, requires the customers to deposit additional collateral or
 reduce positions when necessary. Such transactions may expose the Company
 to significant off-balance sheet risk in the event the margin is not
 sufficient to fully cover losses which customers may incur. In the event
 the customer fails to satisfy its obligations, the Company may be required
 to purchase or sell the collateral at prevailing market prices in order to
 fulfill the customer's obligations.

 In accordance with industry practice, the Company records customer
 securities transactions on a settlement date basis, which is generally
 three business days after trade date. The Company is therefore exposed to
 risk of loss on these transactions in the event of the customer's or
 broker's inability to meet the terms of their contracts in which case the
 Company may have to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing
 market prices. The Company believes that the settlement of these
 transactions will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated
 statement of financial condition or results of operations.

 The Company's customer financing and securities settlement activities
 require the Company to pledge customer securities as collateral in support
 of various secured financing sources such as bank loans, securities loaned
 and agreements to repurchase. Additionally, the Company pledges customer
 securities as collateral to satisfy margin deposits of various exchanges.
 In the event the counterparty is unable to meet its contractual obligation
 to return customer securities pledged as collateral, the Company may be
 exposed to the risk of acquiring the securities at prevailing market prices
 in order to satisfy its customer obligations. The Company controls this
 risk by monitoring the market value of securities pledged on a daily basis
 and by requiring adjustments of collateral levels in the event of excess
 market exposures. Additionally, the Company establishes credit limits for
 such activities and monitors compliance on a daily basis. The Company also
 enters into collateralized financing agreements in which it extends short-
 term credit, primarily to major financial institutions. The Company
 generally controls access to the collateral pledged by the counterparties,
 which consists largely of securities issued by the U.S Government or its
 agencies.

 The Company is engaged in various securities trading and brokerage
 activities servicing a diverse group of corporations, governments, and
 institutional and individual investors primarily located in the United
 States. A substantial portion of the Company's transactions are
 collateralized and are executed with and on behalf of other major brokers
 and dealers. The Company's exposure to credit risk associated with the
 nonperformance of these

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 counterparties in fulfilling their contractual obligation pursuant to
 securities and commodities transactions can be directly impacted by
 volatile trading markets which may impair the counterparties' ability to
 satisfy their obligations to the Company. The Company monitors credit risk
 on both an individual and group counterparty basis.

 Derivatives
 The Company also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge market
 risk, primarily arising from fluctuations in interest rates, in its
 securities inventory. To accomplish this, the Company uses exchange-traded
 futures and option contracts that contain varying degrees of off-balance-
 sheet risk, whereby changes in the market values of the underlying
 securities or other financial instruments may be in excess of the amounts
 reflected in the consolidated statement of financial condition. Under this
 strategy, the Company does not expect any material losses relating to such
 derivative instruments that would not be offset with corresponding gains on
 the securities hedged. These derivative instruments, which consist solely
 of exchange-traded futures and option contracts, are carried in the
 consolidated statements of financial condition at December 31, 1998 and
 1997 at their quoted market values of 0 and 56,000, respectively, in
 aggregate, and have aggregate notional values of approximately 0 and 7.0
 million, respectively. The average market value of these derivative
 instruments during 1998 and 1997 approximated 38,000 and 215,000,
 respectively.

 Fair Value
 The Company's financial instruments are carried at fair value or at amounts
 which approximate fair value. Customer receivables, primarily consisting of
 floating-rate loans collateralized by margin securities, are charged
 interest at rates similar to other such loans made within the industry.
 Reverse repurchase/repurchase agreements, securities borrowed/loaned, and
 notes payable to banks are carried at contract amount plus accrued interest
 or at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received, which
 approximates fair value due to their highly liquid nature and short
 maturity. The Company's remaining financial instruments are generally 
 short-term in nature and are typically liquidated at their carrying values.

(20) SEGMENT INFORMATION

 During 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments
 of An Enterprise and Related Information." SFAS No. 131 requires the
 Company to use the "management approach" in disclosing segment information.
 The Company conducts its business predominantly within one industry
 segment, retail and institutional brokerage, which includes the Company's
 asset management, investment banking and underwriting services, for all
 periods presented. Management assesses the Company's performance and
 measures the Company's income and assets on a single segment basis. The
 single segment generated revenue predominantly from the United States for
 all periods presented.

 --
 EVEREN CAPITAL CORPORATION
 --------------------------
 401(k) AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
 ----------------------------------------
 (As Amended and Restated Effective as of September 1, 1995)

WHEREAS, EVEREN Capital Corporation (the "company") maintains the EVEREN

 New York (`BNY'), EVEREN Securities, Inc. (`ESI'), EVEREN Clearing Corp.,
 and EVEREN Clearing LLC (`ECL'), ESI will sell 80 of the member interests
 in ECL to BNY. The provisions of this Supplement C shall become effective
 only upon the closing of the above-described sale (the `closing date').
 This Supplement C sets forth special provisions applicable to participants

 used in this 

Supplement C shall, unless otherwise defined in this Supplement C, have the
 meanings given to such terms in the plan.

 C-2. Cessation of Contributions. No employee or employer contributions
 -------------------------- 
 shall be made to the plan by or on behalf of an ECL participant (or any
 other employee of ECL) for any period beginning after the closing date.

 C-3. Crediting of Service with ECL and BNY. An ECL participant's period

 CLARIFICATION AGREEMENT
 RE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT

CLARIFICATION AGREEMENT dated as of December 14, 1998, relating to that
certain Joint Venture Agreement (the "JVA") dated as of July 25, 1996, by and
between the parties hereto, each of which is a party to, or a successor to a
party to, the JVA. Unless otherwise stated, terms used in this Agreement shall
have the meanings assigned such terms in the JVA.

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to clarify the meaning of Section 3.3(a)(i) of
the JVA, which sets forth the obligation of EVEREN Securities and Wheat that the
Mentor Money Market Funds be exclusively utilized for its client sweep accounts,
with certain exceptions set forth therein.

 WHEREAS, the parties' intent in Section 3.3(a)(i) of the JVA is to permit
enhancements of sweep account product offerings, while maintaining the
obligation to utilize the Mentor Money Market Funds.

 NOW THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

 1. The recitals set forth above are hereby incorporated by reference as
if set forth in this paragraph.

 2. Section 3.3(a)(iv) shall not prohibit EVEREN Securities or Wheat from
offering both an FDIC-insured account product and the Mentor Money Market Funds
for sweep account assets as long as the interest rates offered by such FDIC-
insured account are not established to compete with the interest rates offered
by the Mentor Money Market Funds, except that interest rates may be established
on a competitive basis for short periods of time in connection with promotional
activities. The parties believe that a customer should be interested in
choosing the FDIC-insured account instead of the Mentor Money Market Funds
primarily due to the FDIC-insured nature of the account, not the interest rate
on the account. The parties further believe that offering an FDIC-insured
account as a product enhancement will have the ultimate effect of increasing
client assets in the Mentor Funds.

 3. Section 3.3(a)(i) of the JVA permits sweep account assets to be
invested in money market open-end investment companies of the type offered in
EVEREN Securities sweep accounts as of the date of the JVA for which there is
not a comparable Mentor Money Market Fund. This exception to the obligation to
utilize the Mentor Money Market Funds was intended where a sweep account product
could be enhanced with money market funds of a type Mentor determines it is not
economically efficient to offer due to the projected size of the fund. The
parties desire to permit such types of money market funds to be offered as
product enhancements; provided that Mentor first has been given the opportunity
to provide such a fund.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed as of the date and year first above written.

 regulation, none of such persons shall participate in the Plan and
 each such person shall qualify as a disinterested person within the
 meaning of 17 C.F.R. (S)240.16b-3 or any successor regulation. The
 Committee is authorized, subject to the provisions of the Plan, to
 establish such rules and regulations as it deems necessary for the
 proper administration of the Plan and to make such determinations and
 interpretations and to take such action in connection with the Plan
 and any Shares made available hereunder as it deems necessary or
 advisable. The Committee shall have the right to determine prior to
 any Offering Period (as defined in Section 9 below) the maximum number
 of Shares which may be offered during the Offering Period and the
 manner of allocating the Shares among eligible employees.

All determinations and interpretations made by the Committee shall be binding
and conclusive on all participating employees (each a "Participant") and their
legal representatives. No member of the Board, no member of the Committee and
no employee of the Company or any subsidiary shall be liable for any act or
failure to act hereunder, by any other member or employee or by any agent to
whom duties in connection with the administration of this Plan have been
delegated or, except in circumstances involving his or her bad faith, gross
negligence or fraud, for any act or failure to act by the member or employee.

4. ELIGIBILITY. All regular full and part-time employees of
 the Company, and of each qualified subsidiary of the Company, other
 than:

 (a) employees whose customary employment is 20 hours or less per
 week; and

 (b) any employee who, immediately after any purchase of shares would
 own stock possessing 5 or more of the total combined voting power or value
 of all classes of stock of the Company

shall be eligible to participate in the Plan as of the first "Enrollment Date"
(as defined in Section 5 below) immediately following the later of (a) the
eligible employee's initial date of hire or (b) the effective date of the Plan's
adoption. For the purposes of this Plan, the term "qualified subsidiary" means
any subsidiary, 50 or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock of which is now owned or hereafter acquired by the Company or any such
qualified subsidiary. For purposes of this Section 4, the provisions of Section
424(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), shall
apply in determining the stock ownership of an employee, and the shares which an
employee may purchase under outstanding rights or options shall be treated as
shares owned by the employee.

 5. PARTICIPATION. Prior to any "Enrollment Date" an eligible
 employee may elect to participate in the Plan as of such date.
 Enrollment Dates shall occur on the first day of each Offering Period
 (as defined in Section 9). Any such election shall be made by
 completing and delivering to the Company's Compensation and Benefits
 Department (the "Department") an enrollment and payroll deduction
 authorization form prior to such Enrollment Date, authorizing payroll
 deductions in such amounts as the employee may request but in no event
 less than any minimum nor more than any maximum amounts specified from
 time to time by the Committee. During an Offering Period, a
 Participant may at any time, but effective as of the next available
 payroll period, increase or decrease his/her payroll deductions with
 respect to the Offering Period by completing and delivering to the
 Department a revised payroll deduction authorization form; provided,
 that (a) changes in payroll deductions shall not be permitted to the
 extent that they would result in total payroll deductions below any
 minimum or above any maximum amounts specified by the Committee; and
 (b) an eligible employee who elects not to participate in the Plan
 through payroll deductions as of any Enrollment Date may not
 participate through payroll deductions in the Plan until the next
 Enrollment Date (at which time the filing of a new election form in
 accordance with this Section 5 will be required).

 Regardless of an eligible employee's election to participate in the Plan
through payroll deductions, any eligible employee may also participate in the
Plan at any time during an Offering Period by making periodic cash contributions
to the Plan during such period through the delivery to the Department of a
personal check for the amount of each contribution. Subject to the right-to-
purchase limitation described in Section 9(b) below, the monthly cash
contribution made by any Participant or eligible employee through a payroll
deduction shall be no less than 50 and no more than 2,000.

 2

6. PAYROLL DEDUCTION AND CASH CONTRIBUTION ACCOUNTS. The Company shall
establish on its books and records a "Payroll Deduction Account" for each
Participant and shall credit to such account all payroll deductions made on
behalf of each Participant (as described in Sections 12 and 13 below). No
interest shall be credited to any Payroll Deduction Account.

 The Company shall also establish on its books and records a separate "Cash
Contribution Account" for each Participant and credit to such account all
voluntary cash contributions made by the Participant during an Offering Period.
No interest shall be credited to any Cash Contribution Account. All cash
dividends paid on shares of Company Stock held in a participant's brokerage or
Plan Share Account will be reinvested (as described in Section 11 below).

 7. WITHDRAWAL. A non-terminated Participant may withdraw from an Offering
Period at any time by completing and delivering a written notice to the Company.
Upon receipt of such notice, payroll deductions on behalf of the Participant
shall be discontinued commencing with the next available payroll period. Amounts
credited to the Payroll Deduction or Cash Contribution Account of any
Participant who withdraws or ceases to participate in the Plan (including any
employee who ceases to participate in the Plan for a non-termination of
employment reason (e.g., a prolonged leave of absence) shall be used to purchase
Shares as described in Section 10 below. An employee may resume participation in
the Plan at the next Enrollment Date, by filing a new election form in
accordance with Section 5.

 8. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. The termination of a Participant's
employment with the Company or any designated subsidiary will constitute a
withdrawal from the Plan. Voluntary cash contributions to the Plan will not be
accepted following any such termination of employment. Payroll deductions and/or
voluntary cash contributions credited to such Participant's account during the
Offering Period but not yet used to purchase shares shall be used automatically
on the "Share Purchase Date" (see Section 9 below), and the maximum number of
full and fractional shares shall be purchased for such participant at the
applicable Purchase Price. All Plan accounts originally established by the
Company on behalf of the terminated Participant will be automatically terminated
and certificates for whole Shares purchased under the Plan will be issued as
soon as practicable after such Participant's termination. Fractional interests
in shares will be paid to the Participant in cash at the same time certificates
are issued. If a share certificate is issued to a Participant, the Participant
will be required to notify the Company of his/her disposition of such shares, if
his/her disposition occurs within time periods established by the Company.

 9. OFFERING PERIODS. The Plan shall be implemented by consecutive three-
month Offering Periods with a new Offering Period commencing on the first day of
each January, April, July and October during the term of the Plan, or on such
other date as the Committee shall determine, and continuing thereafter to the
end of such period, subject to termination in accordance with Section 19 hereof.
"Trading day" shall mean a day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for
trading. The Committee shall have the power to change the duration of Offering
Periods (including the commencement dates thereof) with respect to future
offerings. The last day of each Offering Period prior to the termination of the
Plan (or such other trading date as the Committee shall determine) shall
constitute the purchase date (the "Share Purchase Date") on which each
Participant for whom a Payroll Deduction Account or Cash Contribution Account
has been

 3

maintained shall purchase the number of Shares determined under Section
10(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not permit the exercise
of any right to purchase Shares:

 (a) by an employee who, immediately after such purchase would
 own shares possessing 5 or more of the total combined voting power or
 value of all classes of stock of the Company; or

 (b) which would permit an employee's rights to purchase shares
 under this Plan, or under any other qualified employee stock purchase
 plan maintained by the Company or any parent or subsidiary of the
 Company, to accrue at a rate in excess of 25,000 of the fair market
 value of such shares determined at the time such rights are granted
 for each calendar year in which the right is outstanding at any time.

For the purposes of paragraph (a), the provisions of Code Section 424(d) shall
apply in determining the stock ownership of an employee, and the shares which an
employee may purchase under outstanding rights or options shall be treated as
shares owned by the employee.

 10. PURCHASE OF SHARES.

 (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 5,7, 8 and 9,
 each Participant who is participating in the Plan as of any Enrollment Date
 shall purchase from the Company as many whole Shares (plus any fractional
 interest in a Share) as may be purchased with the combined amounts credited
 to his or her Payroll Deduction and Cash Contribution Accounts as of the
 day immediately preceding the applicable Share Purchase Date (or such other
 date as the Committee shall determine) (the "Cutoff Date"). Participants
 may purchase Shares only through payroll deductions and cash contributions
 to such accounts.

 (b) The "Purchase Price" for Shares purchased under the Plan from the
 Participant's Payroll Deduction Account shall be 92.5 of the lesser of the
 fair market value of shares of Common Stock on the first trading day of
 each calendar quarter or the last trading day of each calendar quarter.
 The Purchase Price for Shares purchased from a Participant's Cash
 Contribution Account will be 100 of the fair market value of such shares
 as of the Share Purchase Date (or such different purchase price established
 by the Committee that complies with the provisions of Code Section 423).
 For this purpose, the fair market value shall be the closing price for such
 date as reported in The Wall Street Journal, Midwest Edition. The
 ----------------------- 
 Committee shall have the authority to establish a different Purchase Price
 as long as any such Purchase Price complies with (i) the provisions of
 Section 423 of the Code.

 (c) On each Share Purchase Date, the amount credited to each
 Participant's Payroll Deduction and Cash Contribution Accounts as of the
 immediately preceding Cutoff Date shall be applied to purchase as many
 whole Shares (plus any fractional interest in a Share) as may be purchased
 with such amount at the applicable Purchase Price. Any amounts remaining in
 a Participant's Payroll Deduction Account and/or Cash Contribution Account
 as of the relevant Cutoff Date in excess of the amount that may properly be
 applied to the purchase of Shares shall be refunded to the Participant as
 soon as practicable.

 4

11. DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT. All cash dividends paid on shares of Common
Stock held in a Participant's brokerage or Plan Share Account (as described in
Section 12 below) will be reinvested. The Purchase Price for Shares purchased
with dividends will be 100 of the fair market value of such Shares as of the
Dividend Payment Date (or such different purchase price established by the
Committee that complies with the provisions of Code Section 423). For this
purpose, the fair market value shall be the closing price for such date as
reported in The Wall Street Journal, Midwest Edition. The Committee shall have
 ----------------------- 
the authority to establish a different Purchase Price as long as any such
Purchase Price complies with (i) the provisions of Section 423 of the Code and
(ii) 17 C.F.R. (S)240.16b-3 if the Board of Directors has determined that the
Plan shall comply with such rule.

 12. BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR PLAN SHARE ACCOUNTS. By enrolling in the Plan,
each Participant shall be deemed to have authorized the establishment of a
brokerage account on his or her behalf at any securities brokerage firm
(including, without limitation, any Company affiliate) selected by the
Department. Alternatively, the Department may provide for Plan share accounts
("Plan Share Accounts") for Participants to be established by the Company or by
an outside entity selected by the Department which is not a brokerage firm.
Shares purchased by a Participant pursuant to the Plan shall be held in the
Participant's brokerage or Plan Share Account in street name, or if the employee
so indicates on his or her payroll deduction authorization form, in the
Participant's name or the Participant's name jointly with a member of the
Participant's family, with right of survivorship.

 13. RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER. A Participant shall have no rights as a
stockholder with respect to Shares which may be issued under this Plan until
payment for such Shares has been completed at the close of business on the
relevant Share Purchase Date. Cash dividends paid on Shares held in a
Participant's Plan Share Account will be reinvested and used to purchase Shares
as described in Section 11.

 14. CERTIFICATES. Certificates for Shares purchased under the Plan will
not be issued automatically to active participants. However, certificates for
whole Shares purchased shall be issued as soon as practicable following a
Participant's written request. The Company may assess or impose a reasonable
charge for the issuance of such certificates. Fractional interests in Shares
shall be carried forward in a Participant's Plan Share Account until they equal
one whole Share or until the termination of the Participant's participation in
the Plan, in which event an amount in cash equal to the value of such fractional
interest shall be paid to the Participant in cash. If a share certificate is
issued to a Participant, the Participant will be required to notify the Company
of his/her disposition of such shares, if his/her disposition occurs within time
periods established by the Company.

 15. RIGHTS NOT TRANSFERABLE. Rights granted under this Plan are not
transferable by a Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution, and are exercisable during an employee's lifetime only by the
Participant.

 16. EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS. Neither participation in the Plan, nor the exercise
of any right granted under the Plan, shall be made a condition of employment, or
of continued employment with

 5

the Company or any subsidiary. Participation in the Plan does not limit the
right of the Company or any subsidiary to terminate a Participant's employment
at any time or give any right to a Participant to remain employed by the Company
or any subsidiary in any particular position or at any particular rate of
remuneration.

 17. APPLICATION OF FUNDS. All funds received by the Company for Shares
sold by the Company on any Share Purchase Date pursuant to this Plan may be used
for any corporate purpose.

 18. WITHHOLDING TAX AND/OR REQUIRING PAYMENT OF TAXES. The Company shall
have the right to withhold with respect to any payments made to Participants
under the Plan any taxes required by law to be withheld with regard to such
payments and/or to require, prior to the delivery of any shares of Common Stock,
payment by Participants of any taxes required by law with respect to the
issuance of delivery of such shares (or any portion thereof) for which such
taxes have not been withheld.

 19. AMENDMENTS AND TERMINATION. The Board of Directors may amend the Plan
at any time, provided that no such amendment shall be effective unless approved
within 12 months after the date of adoption of such amendment by the affirmative
vote of stockholders holding the majority of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock entitled to vote if such stockholder approval is required for the Plan to
continue to comply with Code Section 423. The Board of Directors may suspend the
Plan or discontinue the Plan at any time. Upon termination of the Plan, all
payroll deductions shall cease and all amounts then credited to the
Participants' Payroll Deduction Accounts shall be equitably applied to the
purchase of whole Shares then available for sale, and any remaining amounts
shall be promptly refunded to the Participants.

 20. APPLICABLE LAWS. This Plan, and all rights granted hereunder, are
intended to meet the requirements of an "employee stock purchase plan" under
Code Section 423, as from time to time amended, and the Plan shall be construed
and interpreted to accomplish this intent. The delivery or issuance of any
shares of Common Stock may be postponed by the Company for such period as may be
required to comply with the applicable requirements under the Federal and state
securities laws, and any applicable listing requirements of any national
securities exchange (in the event the Company is or becomes subject to such laws
or requirements prior to the termination of this Plan) and with all requirements
under any other law or regulation applicable to the issuance or delivery of such
shares. Further, the Company shall not be obligated to deliver or issue any
shares of Common Stock if the delivery or issuance of such shares shall
constitute a violation of any provision of any national securities exchange (in
the event the Company becomes subject to the provisions of such an exchange
prior to the termination of this Plan) or any law or regulation of any
governmental authority. Sales of Shares under the Plan are subject to, and
shall be accomplished only in accordance with, the requirements of all
applicable securities and other laws.

 21. CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION AND SIMILAR CHANGES. In the event of any
change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend
or split, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of
shares or other similar corporate change, the maximum aggregate number and class
of shares available for sale under the Plan shall be equitably adjusted by the
Committee. Such determination of the Committee shall be conclusive.

 6

22. EXPENSES. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, all expenses
of administering the Plan, including expenses incurred in connection with any
purchase of Shares in the open market for sale to Participants, shall be borne
by the Company and its subsidiaries.

 23. ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES. Any dispute between the Company or any of its
affiliates and any Participant relating to this Plan shall be submitted to
arbitration before the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or the
New York Stock Exchange, Inc. in accordance with its rules and regulations.

 24. EFFECTIVE DATE AND STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL. The Plan initially became
effective on April 15, 1996. The amended and restated Plan became effective on
