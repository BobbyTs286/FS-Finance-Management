PART I 
 
 ITEM 1 
 
 BUSINESS 
 
Description of Business 
 
Business of Slade's Ferry Bancorp 
- --------------------------------- 
 
 Slade's Ferry Bancorp ("the Company") is a business corporation that 
was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on June 
13, 1989 as Weetamoe Bancorp. The name Weetamoe Bancorp was changed to 
Slade's Ferry Bancorp effective January 1, 1997. The office of Slade's Ferry 
Bancorp is located at the office of the Bank at 100 Slade's Ferry Avenue, 
Somerset, Massachusetts, 02726, and its telephone number is the same as the 
Bank's: (508)675-2121. 
 
 The Company was organized for the purpose of becoming the holding 
company of the Bank. The Company's acquisition of the Bank was completed on 
April 1, 1990. The Bank (Slade's Ferry Trust Company) is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Slade's Ferry Bancorp. 
 
Competition 
- ----------- 
 
 The primary business of Slade's Ferry Bancorp is the ongoing business 
of the Bank. The competitive conditions to be faced by Slade's Ferry Bancorp 
will be the same as those faced by the Bank. It is likely that, as a holding 
company, it may compete with other holding companies engaged in bank-related 
activities. Thus, the Company will face competition in undertaking to 
acquire other banks, financial institutions or companies engaged in bank-
related activities, and in operating subsequent to any such acquisitions. 
 
 While the Company investigates opportunities to acquire other banks or 
bank facilities when they occur and may in the future acquire other banks, 
financial institutions, or bank facilities, it is not currently engaged in 
any such acquisition. 
 
Employees 
- --------- 
 
 At present there are four employees of the Bank and the Company whose 
compensation is paid by the Company. Although the Company has no current 
plans to do so, if the Company should acquire other financial institutions 
or pursue other lines of business, it may at such time hire additional 
employees. 
 
Business of Slade's Ferry Trust Company 
- --------------------------------------- 
 
 On September 30, 1959, the Slade's Ferry Trust Company opened for 
business as a state chartered trust company incorporated under the laws of 
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and as a member of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The founders were a group of individuals from 
Somerset, Swansea, Fall River and Seekonk, Massachusetts who recognized the 
need for a local bank committed to personalized services. 
 
 During the past three years, assets of the Bank increased by 107 
Million of which 49 Million is attributed to overall growth and 58 Million 
attributed to the acquisition of the National Bank of Fairhaven, which 
occurred in August 1996. The Bank currently has ten banking facilities 
extending east from Seekonk, Massachusetts to Fairhaven, Massachusetts. The 
Bank also provides limited banking services at the Somerset High School. The 
Bank employs 136 full-time employees and 54 part-time employees. 
 
 The Bank currently services numerous communities in Southeastern 
Massachusetts and contiguous areas of Rhode Island through its ten 
facilities in Fall River, Somerset, Swansea, Seekonk, New Bedford and 
Fairhaven. 
 
 The Bank's major customer base consists of almost 32,000 personal 
savings, checking and money market accounts and 8,200 personal certificates 
of deposit and individual retirement accounts. Its commercial base consists 
of over 3,200 checking, money market, corporate, and certificate of deposit 
accounts. 
 
 The Bank does not have any major target accounts, nor does it derive a 
material portion of its deposits from any single depositor. It is a retail 
bank that services the needs of the local communities, and its loans are not 
concentrated within any single industry or group of related industries that 
would have any possible adverse effect on the business of the Bank. The 
Bank's business is not seasonal and its loan demand is well diversified. As 
of December 31, 1998, commitments under standby letters of credit aggregate 
approximately 2,307,880. 
 
Services 
- -------- 
 
 The Bank engages actively in a broad range of banking activities, 
including demand, savings, time deposits, related personal and commercial 
checking account services, real estate mortgages, commercial and installment 
lending, payroll services, money orders, travelers checks, Visa, Mastercard, 
safe deposit rentals, automatic teller machines and cash management 
services. The Bank offers a full range of commercial, installment, student, 
and real estate loans. The service area of the Bank is approximately 300 
square miles, including the southern geographic area of Bristol County, 
Massachusetts and extends over to the towns of Tiverton, Warren, Bristol and 
Barrington in the state of Rhode Island. 
 
Competition 
- ----------- 
 
 The banking business in the market area served by the Bank is highly 
competitive. The Bank actively competes with other banks, financial 
institutions, and credit unions, including major banks and bank holding 
companies which have numerous offices and affiliates operating over wide 
geographic areas. The Bank competes for deposits, loans, and other business 
with these institutions. 
 
 Many of the major commercial banks, or other affiliates in the service 
areas of the Bank, offer services such as international banking, and 
investment and trust services which are not offered directly by the Bank. 
 
Supervision and Regulation 
 
Holding Company Regulation 
- -------------------------- 
 
 Under the Federal Bank Holding Company Act ("BHCA"), the prior 
approval of the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB") is required before a 
corporation may acquire control of a bank. FRB approval must also be 
obtained before a bank holding company acquires all or substantially all of 
the assets of a bank, or merges or consolidates with another bank holding 
company. In considering any applications for approval of an acquisition or 
merger, the FRB is required to consider the financial and managerial 
resources of the companies and banks concerned, and the convenience and 
needs of the communities to be served. 
 
 As a registered bank holding company, the Company is required to file 
with the FRB annual and periodic reports and such other additional 
information as the Board may require. The Company and its subsidiaries are 
also subject to continuing regulation, supervision and examinations by the 
FRB. 
 
 A bank holding company, with certain exceptions, may not acquire more 
than 5 of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and may not 
engage, directly or through subsidiaries, in any activity other than 
banking, managing or controlling banks, or furnishing services to or 
performing services for its subsidiaries, without prior approval of the FRB. 
The FRB is authorized to approve the ownership by a bank holding company of 
voting shares of any company whose activities the FRB determines to be so 
closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a 
proper incident thereof. Under the FRB's current regulations, and subject to 
certain restrictions and limitations specified therein, bank holding 
companies and their subsidiaries may be permitted by the FRB to engage in 
such non-banking activities as: (1) making, acquiring, or servicing loans or 
other extensions of credit such as would be made by a mortgage, finance, 
credit card, or factoring company; (2) operating an industrial bank or 
industrial loan company; (3) performing the functions of a trust company; 
(4) acting as an investment or financial advisor; (5) leasing real or 
personal property or acting as an agent or broker in leasing such property 
or acting as an agent or broker in leasing property in certain situations; 
(6) making investments to promote community welfare; (7) providing certain 
data processing and transmission services; (8) acting as principal, agent, 
or broker with respect to insurance directly related to extensions of credit 
by the bank holding company or its subsidiaries, and engaging in certain 
other insurance activities subject to specified conditions and limitations; 
(9) providing courier services for checks and certain other instrument 
exchanges among banks, and for audit and accounting media of a banking or 
financial nature; (10) providing management consulting advice under 
specified conditions to banks not affiliated with the bank holding company; 
(11) issuing and selling retail money orders having a face value of not more 
than 1,000 and travelers checks and selling U.S. Savings Bonds; (12) 
performing appraisals of real and personal property; (13) arranging 
commercial real estate equity financing under certain circumstances; (14) 
providing securities brokerage services as agent for the accounts of 
customers; (15) underwriting and dealing in certain government obligations 
and money market instruments; (16) providing foreign exchange advisory and 
transactional services; (17) acting as a futures commission merchant in 
specified capacities or providing investment advice as a futures commission 
merchant or commodity trading advisor with respect to certain financial 
futures contracts and options; (18) providing consumer financial counseling 
services; (19) providing tax planning and preparation services; (20) 
providing check guaranty services to subscribing merchants; (21) operating a 
collection agency; and (22) operating a credit bureau. In addition, a bank 
holding company may file an application for FRB approval to engage, directly 
or through subsidiaries, in other nonbank activities that the holding 
company reasonably believes are so closely related to banking as to be a 
proper incident thereto. 
 
 In addition, pursuant to the Bank Export Services Act of 1982, a bank 
holding company may invest up to 5 of its consolidated capital and surplus 
in shares of an export trading company unless such investment is disapproved 
by the FRB after notice as provided in that Act. 
 
 As a bank holding company, the Company will be required to give the 
FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding 
equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, 
when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or 
redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 or more of 
Bancorp's consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or 
redemption if it determines that the proposal would violate any law, 
regulation, FRB order, directive, or any condition imposed by, or written 
agreement with, the FRB. 
 
 The status of the Company as a registered bank holding company under 
the BHCA does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and 
regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without 
limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws. 
 
 Under Massachusetts law, Board of Bank Incorporation approval is 
required before any company may become a bank holding company by directly or 
indirectly owning, controlling or holding the power to vote 25 or more of 
the voting stock of two or more banks. Further, such approval is required 
prior to a bank holding company's (i) acquiring voting stock of another bank 
institution if, as a result of the acquisition, such acquirer would, 
directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5 of the voting stock of 
such institution, or (ii) engaging in certain other transactions. The 
Company is not considered a bank holding company under Massachusetts law 
since it does not control two or more banks. The activities of the Company, 
however, will be limited under Massachusetts law to activities described 
above which would be permissible for a bank holding company registered under 
the BHCA. In addition, the acquisition by the Company of 25 or more of the 
voting stock or the power to elect a majority of the directors of another 
commercial bank, savings bank, cooperative bank, or savings and loan 
association would subject the Company to regulation as a bank holding 
company under applicable Massachusetts law and would require the approval of 
the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation. 
 
Bank Regulation 
- --------------- 
 
 As a Massachusetts-chartered, FDIC-insured trust company, the Bank is 
subject to regulation and supervision by the Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC 
and the FRB. 
 
 The Massachusetts statutes and regulations govern, among other things, 
investment powers, deposit activities, borrowings, maintenance of surplus 
and reserve accounts, distribution of earnings, and payment of dividends. 
The Bank is also subject to state regulatory provisions covering such 
matters as issuance of capital stock, branching, and mergers and 
acquisitions. 
 
 Deposit accounts at the Bank are insured by the FDIC, generally up to 
a maximum of 100,000 per insured depositor. As an insurer of deposits of 
certain thrift institutions and commercial banks, the FDIC issues 
regulations, conducts examinations, requires the filing of reports, and 
generally supervises the operations of institutions to which it provides 
deposit insurance. The approval of the FDIC is required prior to any merger 
or consolidation with another financial institution, or the establishment or 
relocation of an office facility. This supervision is intended primarily for 
the protection of depositors. 
 
 As an FDIC-insured bank, the Bank is subject to certain FDIC 
requirements designed to maintain the safety and soundness of individual 
banks and the banking system. The FDIC periodically conducts examinations of 
insured institutions and, based upon appraisals, may revalue assets of an 
insured institution and require establishment of specific reserves in 
amounts equal to the difference between such revaluation and the book value 
of the assets. In addition, the FDIC has a regulation which defines and sets 
minimum requirements for capital adequacy. 
 
 Bank regulators have implemented risk based capital guidelines that 
require a bank to maintain certain minimum capital as a percent of such 
bank's assets and certain off-balance sheet items adjusted for predefined 
credit risk factors (risk adjusted assets). Under the requirements a minimum 
level of capital will vary among banks on safety and soundness of operation. 
At December 31, 1998 the minimum regulatory capital level of Risk Based 
Capital was 4 for Tier 1 Capital, 8 for Total Capital and Leverage Capital 
was 4 . 
 
 The Company, the Bank, the Slade's Ferry Realty Trust, and the Slade's 
Ferry Securities Corporation are "affiliates" within the meaning of the 
Federal Reserve Act. Certain provisions of the Federal Reserve Act, made 
applicable to the Bank by Section 18(j) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
and administered with respect to the Bank by the FDIC, limit the amounts of 
and establish collateral requirements with respect to the Bank's loans or 
extensions of credit to and investments in affiliates. In addition, related 
provisions of the Federal Reserve Act and FRB regulations also administered 
with respect to the Bank by the FDIC limit the amounts of and establish 
required procedures and credit standards with respect to loans and other 
extensions of credit to officers, directors and principal stockholders of 
the Bank, of the Company, and of any subsidiaries of the Company, and to 
related interests of such persons. 
 
Recent Regulatory Examinations 
- ------------------------------ 
 
 During the most recent regulatory examinations of the Company and the 
Bank, encompassing year end 1997 and three months ending March 31, 1998, no 
major or consequential violations were found.

Changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to 
 changes in both volume and rate have been allocated equally to changes 
 due to volume and changes due to rate.
 The change in interest income on investments and net interest income 
 includes interest on a fully taxable equivalent basis based on a tax 
 rate of 34 . 

Interest Rate Risk 
- ------------------ 
 
 The Company considers interest rate risk to be a significant market 
risk as it could potentially have an effect on the Company's financial 
condition and results of operation. The definition of interest rate risk is 
the exposure of the Company's earnings to adverse movements in interest 
rates. Volatility in interest rates requires the Company to manage interest 
rate risk which arises from the differences in the timing of repricing of 
assets and liabilities. 
 
 The Company's Asset-Liability Management Committee, comprised of the 
Bank's Executive Management team, has the responsibility of managing 
interest rate risk, and monitoring and evaluating the difference between 
interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities within various 
time periods. 
 
 The Company's objective is to reduce and control the volatility of its 
net interest income by managing the relationship of interest-earning assets 
and interest-bearing liabilities. In order to manage this relationship, the 
Committee utilizes a monthly GAP report. This report for the period ending 
December 31, 1998 is set forth below. 
 
 The GAP report provides a static analysis of repricing opportunities 
of rate-sensitive assets and rate-sensitive liabilities. It is prepared by 
categorizing these assets and liabilities into time periods based upon 
either their contractual or anticipated maturity or repricing. The analysis 
determines the net dollar amount of assets less liabilities that are 
repricing in various time frames. This, in conjunction with certain 
assumptions and other related factors, such as anticipated changes in 
interest rates, projected cash flows from loans, investments and deposits, 
provides a means of evaluating interest rate risk. Management also takes 
into consideration that certain assets and liabilities react differently to 
changes in interest rates. 
 
 The interest sensitivity gap is determined by subtracting the amount 
of liabilities from the amount of assets that reprice in a particular time 
period. When more liabilities than assets reprice or mature within a given 
time frame, a liability sensitive position results (negative gap). A 
negative gap position would tend to increase net interest income when 
interest rates are falling, and decrease net interest income when rates are 
rising. Conversely, an asset sensitive position (positive gap) results when 
more assets than liabilities reprice within a given period. In this 
scenario, net interest income would increase when interest rates rise and 
decrease when rates fall. 
 
 At December 31, 1998, the GAP report shown below indicates the 
Company's interest rate risk to have a reliance on short term liabilities. 
This position would have an adverse effect on earnings in a rising rate 
environment and a positive effect on earnings in a decreasing rate 
environment.

Nonaccrual loans amounting to 3.3 Million have been eliminated from

In addition to the GAP report, the Company also uses an analysis to 
measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
over a relatively short time period (i.e. 12 months). This analysis involves 
projecting future interest income and expenses from the Company's earning 
assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Depending on the GAP position, the 
Company's policy limit on interest rate risk specifies that if interest 
rates were to change immediately up or down 200 basis points, the effect on 
estimated net interest income for the next 12 months that would be tolerated 
would be not more than a ten percent decrease. The following table reflects 
the Company's estimated exposure as a percentage of estimated net interest 
income for the next 12 months, assuming an immediate change in interest 
rates:

 (Basis Points) Percentage of Net Interest Income

 The model used to monitor earnings-at-risk provides management a 
measurement tool to assess the effect of changes in interest rates on the 
Company's current and future earnings. The Company's 10 limit establishes 
an internal tolerance level to control the Company's interest rate risk 
exposure and is monitored on a quarterly basis.

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days 
or more and still accruing, restructured loans not performing in accordance 
with amended terms, and other real estate acquired through foreclosure. 
Nonperforming assets as a total decreased to 4.7 Million at year end 1998, 
from 4.9 Million reported at year end 1997. Nonaccrual loans at December 
31, 1998 were down by 1.3 Million to 3.3 Million from 4.6 Million 
reported on December 31, 1997. Included in the 3.3 Million of nonaccrual 
loans is a 1.3 Million commercial real estate loan that was classified as 
nonaccrual in March 1997. The real estate collateralizing this loan was 
appraised in December 1997 at 2.7 Million. Due to the excess collateral 
value, the Bank does not anticipate any loss on this loan. Loans that became 
nonaccrual during the current year, amounted to 1,797,493. Offsetting this 
increase were receipts of loan payments of 629,032 and loans of 753,485 
that were deemed uncollectible and charged off to the Allowance for Loan 
Losses. There was a transfer to Other Real Estate Owned of 1,049,634, 
property sold at auction of 156,000 and a transfer to accrual status of 
loans totaling 474,457. 
 
 The Company places a loan on nonaccrual status when, in the opinion of 
management, the collectibility of the principal and interest becomes 
doubtful. Generally, when a commercial loan, commercial real estate loan or 
a residential real estate loan becomes past due 90 days or more, the Company 
discontinues the accrual of interest and reverses previously accrued 
interest. The loan remains in the nonaccrual status until the loan is 
current and six consecutive months of payments are made, then it is 
reclassified as an accruing loan. When it is determined that the 
collectibility of the loan no longer exists, it is charged off to the 
Allowance for Loan Losses or, if applicable, any real estate that is 
collateralizing the loan is acquired through foreclosure, at which time it 
is categorized as Other Real Estate Owned. The nonaccrual category is 
comprised of 1,035,145 of residential real estate loans, 1,966,307 of 
commercial real estate loans, 292,080 of commercial loans and 37,885 of 
other types of loans. 
 
 Real Estate acquired by foreclosure increased to 1,026,000 at 
December 31, 1998 compared to 159,000 reported at year end 1997. This 
amount consists of five separate parcels of property. Annual appraisals are 
performed on these properties and if the appraised value is less than the 
carrying value of the property, the carrying value is written down by a 
charge to the Writedown on Other Real Estate Owned expense account. The Bank 
currently has one purchase and sales agreement on hand for an early 1999 
sale.

Ratio of net charge-offs to
 average loans outstanding 0.34 0.08 0.00 0.25 0.23 

The Allowance for Loan Losses at year end December 31, 1998 was 
 3,569,282; and 3,693,865, 3,354,311, 2,497,774 and 2,305,860, for years 
ending 1997, 1996, 1995 and 1994 respectively. The Allowance for Loan Losses 
as a percent of year end loans was 1.64 in 1998, 1.73 in 1997, 1.69 in 
1996, 1.65 in 1995 and 1.70 in 1994. 
 
 The level of the Allowance for Loan Losses is evaluated by management 
and encompasses several factors. These factors include but are not limited 
to recent trends in the nonperforming loans, the adequacy of the assets 
which collateralize the nonperforming loans, current economic conditions in 
the market area and various other external and internal factors. 
Management's assessment of the adequacy of the Allowance for Loan Losses is 
reviewed by regulators and by the Company's independent accountants. 
 
 The Company's provision for loan losses, which is a deduction from 
earnings, in 1998 was 600,000. Prior years' provisions were 500,000, 
 400,000, 550,000 and 645,000 for years ending 1997, 1996, 1995 and 1994 
respectively. In 1998, the Company realized recoveries of previously 
charged-off loans of 67,000. Recoveries recorded in previous years were 
 95,000, 439,000, 39,000 and 68,000 in 1997, 1996, 1995 and 1994 
respectively. 
 
 The amount provided to the Allowance for Loan Losses was deemed 
appropriate by management after full consideration of the value of the 
assets securing the nonaccrual loans. 
 
 This table shows an allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of 
the end of each of the last five years.

The loan portfolio's largest segment of loans is commercial real 
estate loans, which represent 51.7 of gross loans. Residential real estate, 
which is the second largest segment of the loan portfolio, represents 23.5 
of gross loans. The Company requires a loan to value ratio of 80 in both 
commercial and residential mortgages. These mortgages are secured by real 
properties which have a readily ascertainable value. 
 
 Generally, commercial real estate loans have a higher degree of credit 
risk than residential real estate loans because they depend primarily on the 
success of the business. When granting these loans, the Company evaluates 
the financial statements of the borrower(s), the location of the real 
estate, the quality of management, and general economic and competitive 
conditions. When granting a residential mortgage, the Company reviews the 
borrower(s) repayment history on past debts, and assesses the borrower(s) 
ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loans. 
 
 Commercial loans consist of loans predominantly collateralized by 
inventory, furniture and fixtures, and accounts receivable. In assessing the 
collateral for this type of loan, management applies a 40 liquidation value 
to inventories; 25 to furniture, fixtures and equipment; and 60 to 
accounts receivable. Commercial loans represent 20.1 of the loan portfolio. 
 
 Consumer loans are generally unsecured borrowings and represent 3.0 
of the total loan portfolio. These loans have a higher degree of risk than 
residential mortgage loans. The underlying collateral of a secured consumer 
loan tends to depreciate in value. Consumer loans are typically made based 
on the borrower's ability to repay the loan through continued financial 
stability. The Company endeavors to minimize risk by reviewing the 
borrower's repayment history on past debts, and assessing the borrower's 
ability to meet existing obligations on the proposed loans. 
 
 Charge-offs in 1998 amounted to 792,000, up by 537,000 when compared 
to losses incurred in 1997 of 255,000. The Company had charge-offs of 
 439,000 in 1996, 397,000 in 1995 and 361,000 in 1994. The real estate-
mortgage category incurred losses of 716,000 in 1998 compared to 147,000 
in 1997, 136,000 in 1996, 79,000 in 1995 and 246,000 in 1994. 
 
V. DEPOSITS

The Bank has the ability to borrow funds from correspondent banks and 
the Federal Home Loan Bank, as well as the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, 
by pledging various investment securities as collateral. The Company did not 
borrow during 1998 and 1997. Tax payments made by our customers, which are 
owed to the Federal Reserve Bank Treasury Tax and Loan account, are 
classified as borrowed funds. The Company has notes payable of 847,990 due 
to Fleet Bank with a final maturity in November 1999. This note was assumed 
from Fairbank, Inc. at the time of the acquisition. Because of the term of 
the note, including applicable prepayment fees, management determined it 
advantageous for the Bank not to pay off the note. There is also 4,475,454 
in borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank which represent the match 
funding program that is available to qualified borrowers. 
 
Accounting for Deferred Income Taxes

primarily alleged a breach of contract. The original demand by the plaintiff

plaintiff in 1998. Discovery has been completed, and the case is currently 
scheduled for trial on April 22, 1999. The Company believes there are 
meritorious defenses to the plaintiff's claim, and it intends to vigorously

of 1989 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is a one bank 
holding company which owns and controls 100 of the assets of Slade's Ferry

nearby Rhode Island, currently operating twelve strategically located

as of December 31, 1998. The Bank keeps convenient business hours,

personal service throughout its marketplace.

Corporate offices are located at 100 Slade's Ferry Avenue, Somerset, MA.

SHAREHOLDERS LETTER

 As we bring this century to a close and finalize our preparation for 
the new millenium, the accomplishments of 1998 will serve as a springboard 
for our future success in the new century.

 Our assets grew from 302 Million at year-end 1997 to 340 Million or 
12.6 by year-end 1998. Our growth in new business came primarily from two 
marketplaces, the Rhode Island border towns and the Greater New Bedford 
area. Our investment in the New Bedford market in 1996 is now paying the 
dividends projected when we acquired the National Bank of Fairhaven.

 Profits rose dramatically from 2,845,990 at year-end 1997 to 
 3,363,042 or 18.2 by year-end 1998. The increased earnings were fueled by 
two sources: the highest interest margin on investable funds we have 
enjoyed in over twenty years, and the gains of 382,370 that we were able 
to realize from our stock portfolio. During the fourth quarter of 1998, we 
saw multiple reductions in interest rates, which have already greatly 
reduced our margins and put pressure on our earning projections for 1999.

 The return on average assets rose to 1.06 from .96 in 1997, while 
the earnings per share on a fully diluted basis rose .09 from .89 to 
 .98.

 During 1998, our stock price rode the crest of the market, as did 
most stocks, reaching a high of 19.13 per share and settling consistently 
at year-end at approximately 14.00 per share. Early in the year, we issued 
a 5 stock dividend, followed at mid year with an increase in cash 
dividends to .06 per share, as well as an extra cash dividend at year end.

 During the summer, we purchased land on Ashley Boulevard in New 
Bedford and commenced construction of a new branch facility to be 
operational during the first quarter of 1999.

 We also purchased the former BankBoston banking facility on South 
Main Street in Fall River and completed extensive renovations by year-end. 
The newly refurbished branch opened in January of 1999 and promises to be 
one of the fastest growing and busiest branches in the years to come.

 The addition of these two branches will fill in gaps in our market 
service area, and makes Slade's Ferry Bank convenient to thousands more new 
and existing customers.

 In addition of these two branches will fill in gaps in our market 
service area, and makes Slade's Ferry Bank convenient to thousands more new 
and existing customers.

 In addition, during the year, we committed substantial resources to 
addressing all of the issues affecting us with the upcoming transition into 
the Year 2000 (Y2K). We assessed all of our computer system concerns to 
identify problems or replacement needs. We have systematically replaced, 
upgraded, tested and continue to test all our systems to assure our 
customers that the transition into the Year 2000 will be made without any 
interruption to our servicing abilities. We are extremely confident that 
your bank and the industry have sufficiently addressed the Y2K concerns to 
enter the new millenium prepared to continue the levels of service you have 
come to expect.

 1999 will mark the fortieth anniversary of Slade's Ferry Bank, which 
started from humble beginnings back in 1959.

 Because of your faith in us and our focus on personalized customer 
service, we have grown to be a well-respected, well-capitalized financial 
organization with continued bright prospects for the future.

 The addition of two new branches to our delivery system, our growth 
in 1998 and our Y2K preparations will propel us into the new century with 
solid financial footings, exciting growth potential, and increased ability 
to provide value and reward for your investment in our bank.

 We look to the new millenium with great excitement and anticipation.

Sincerely,

James D. Carey

Dividends - History and Policy
- ------------------------------

The Company, since its inception in 1990 and prior thereto the Bank, has 
consistently paid dividends to the stockholders since 1961. In January 
1998, the Company issued a 5 stock dividend on the Company's common stock, 
resulting in a distribution of 161,698 shares. The Company also paid two 
quarterly cash dividends of .05 per share and then increased its dividend 
to .06 per share for the third and fourth quarter in 1998. In addition, 
an extra cash dividend of .06 per share was paid in December 1998 for a 
total of .28 per share paid in 1998.

In 1997, the Company paid quarterly cash dividends of .05 per share, plus 
an extra cash dividend of .05 per share, for a total of .25 per share 
before the effect of the 5 stock dividend issued in 1998.

The declaration of cash dividends is dependent on a number of factors, 
including regulatory limitations, and the Bank's operating results and 
financial condition. The stockholders of the Company will be entitled to 
dividends only when, and if, declared by the Company's Board of Directors 
out of funds legally available. Under the Massachusetts Business 
Corporation Law, a dividend may not be declared if the corporation is 
insolvent or if the declaration of the dividend would render the 
corporation insolvent.

Furthermore, the directors may be liable for authorization of a dividend if 
such dividend is in violation of the Articles of Organization, or if the 
corporation is then or is thereby rendered insolvent. The Company will be 
considered insolvent when it is unable to pay debts as they fall due in the 
usual course of business, or when its liabilities are in excess of the 
reasonable market value of assets held.

Chapter 172 Section 28 of the Massachusetts Statutes on Bank and Banking 
provides that a bank's Board of Directors may, subject to the restriction 
contained in the section, declare and pay dividends on capital stock out of 
net profits from time to time and to such extent as they deem advisable. 
However, under this provision, no cash dividend shall be paid unless, 
following the payment of such dividend, the capital stock and retained 
earnings account will be unimpaired.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
- ------------------------------------

The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis is to focus on certain 
significant factors which have affected the Company's operating results and 
financial condition, and to provide stockholders a more comprehensive 
review of the figures contained in the financial data of this report.

Overview:

 In 1998, Slade's Ferry Bancorp recorded net income of 3,363,042 or 
 0.98 per share on a diluted basis compared to 2,845,990 or 0.89 
 per share on a diluted basis in 1997. This represents an increase of 
 517,052 or 18.2 in net income and .09 or 10.11 per share on a 
 diluted basis between 1998 and 1997.

 Return on average assets increased to 1.06 in 1998 from .96 in 1997 
 and .94 in 1996. Return on average equity for 1998, 1997 and 1996 
 was 11.98 , 12.27 , and 12.69 respectively.

 Book value of the Company's common stock increased to 8.62 in 1998 
 from 8.17 reported in 1997, and 7.12 reported in 1996.

 The Company in February 1998 issued a 5 stock dividend to its 
 stockholders of common stock, and the cash dividend for the year 
 totaled .28 per share, up from .246 per share in 1997 and .229 per 
 share in 1996.

 Assets at December 31, 1998 increased by 38.8 Million or 12.9 to 
 340.4 Million when compared to 301.6 Million in assets at December 
 31, 1997. Net loans increased by 2.2 during 1998. Deposit levels 
 were up by 12.0 at December 31, 1998 when compared to 1997.

 Two new branch banking facilities are being added to the branch 
 network and are scheduled to open in early 1999.

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

Net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividend 
income earned on earning assets and interest expense paid on interest-
bearing liabilities, is the dominate contributor to net income. Increases 
or decreases in interest rates affect the yields earned on loans and 
investments and the rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. On a 
fully taxable basis, net interest income was 13.8 Million in 1998, 12.9 
Million in 1997, and 10.6 Million in 1996. The increase in net interest 
income in 1998 when compared to 1997 is primarily a result of growth in 
average earning assets of 6.13 from the prior year. Growth in earning 
assets is due to general increases in business volumes. The average 
earning assets produced a 8.35 yield, down slightly when compared to 8.43 
in 1997. In 1996 the yield on earning assets was 8.25 . The loan 
portfolio, which generally produces higher yields than other earning assets 
represents 67.5 of average assets in 1998 compared to 69 in 1997 and 
67.3 in 1996.

Cost of funds decreased to 4.44 in 1998 primarily due to the lowering of 
rates paid on Other Time Deposits which is the largest component of 
interest-bearing liabilities. Cost of funds in 1997 was 4.55 and 4.53 in 
1996. During 1998 the average balances in interest-bearing liabilities 
increased to 241.4 Million compared to 229.1 Million in 1997 and 200.5 
Million in 1996.

The net interest spread, which represents the difference between the 
weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average 
cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.91 in 1998 from 3.88 
reported in 1997 and 3.72 in 1996.

Net yield on earning assets, which represents net interest income as a 
percent of average earning assets, increased to 4.70 from 4.66 in 1997 
and 4.44 in 1996.

The Provision to the Allowance for Loan Losses in 1998 was increased to 
 600,000 compared to 500,000 in 1997 and 400,000 in 1996. This increase 
to the provision was based upon management's desire to maintain an 
appropriate ratio of the Allowance for Loan Losses to outstanding loans 
while recognizing the growth in the loan portfolio and the amount of charge 
offs that occurred in 1998 compared to prior years.

Total Other Income in 1998 increased slightly to 1,568,112 compared to 
 1,562,257 reported in 1997. In 1996, Total Other Income was 1,305,497 
which reflected only four months of merger-related income associated with 
the acquisition of the National Bank of Fairhaven that took place in late 
August 1996. Service charges on deposit accounts and overdrafts which are 
the largest component of Other Income decreased slightly to 881,964 in 
1998 compared to 902,079 and 849,425 reported in 1997 and 1996 
respectively. As a result of favorable market conditions, various 
marketable equity securities were sold throughout 1998 whereby gains were 
realized totaling 382,370. The Company realized gains in the security 
portfolio in 1997 totaling 313,844 and 112,631 in 1996.

Total Other Expense for 1998 decreased by 49,326 to 8,984,181 from 
 9,033,507 reported in 1997. Salaries and Employees Benefits which is the 
largest component of Other Expenses increased by 162,571 due to general 
wage adjustments and increased costs associated with employees medical 
insurance and retirement plan. In 1997 the Company incurred an increase of 
 989,218 in Salaries and Employees Benefits when compared to 1996 which was 
attributable to a full year associated with the retention of officers and 
employees of the National Bank of Fairhaven acquired by Slade's Ferry Bank 
in late August 1996. Personnel costs associated with these new employees 
were expensed for twelve months in 1997 compared to four months in 1996.

The increase in Salaries and Employees Benefits in 1998 was offset by the 
combination of a decrease in Occupancy Expense and Equipment Expense 
totaling 31,237, and a decrease of 97,047 created by a Gain on Sale of 
Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) totaling 54,590 in 1998 as opposed to a 
loss of 42,457 realized in 1997. In 1996 the Bank incurred a loss of 
 21,008 on sale of OREO properties. In 1998 the Bank did not incur any 
expense associated with the writedown of values on Other Real Estate Owned, 
while in 1997, writedowns totaled 67,480 and 30,000 in 1996.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit insurance premiums in 
1998 were 32,353 compared to 71,880 in 1997 and 6,278 in 1996. In 1997, 
under federal legislation enacted in 1996, FDIC Bank Insurance Fund 
deposits were assessed to finance the annual interest costs on government 
bonds issued to assist in recapitalizing certain thrift institutions in 
prior years. The resulting increase is reflected in 1997 and 1998 
premiums.

Stationery and Supplies expense in 1998 decreased to 229,344 from costs of 
 311,546 in 1997 and 243,653 in 1996. In 1997 the Bank incurred 
additional costs due to the need to stock the Fairhaven and New Bedford 
Massachusetts branches which were acquired through the merger acquisition.

The following table sets forth the components of the line item Other 
Expense, which reflects an increase of 105,596 to 2,042,253 in 1998 
compared to 1,936,657 in 1997. In 1996 Other Expense was 1,678,873. 
Expense items in 1996 reflect four months attributed to the acquisition of 
the National Bank of Fairhaven compared to twelve full months in 1997 and 
1998.

 Interest income on investments and net interest income includes a 
 fully taxable equivalent adjustment of 212,000 in 1998, 157,000 in 
 1997 and 133,000 in 1996.

 Average balance includes non-accruing loans. The effect of including 
 such loans is to reduce the average rate earned on the Company's 
 loans.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Loans
- -----

The loan portfolio increased by 4.5 Million to 218.2 Million at the end 
of 1998 when compared to 213.7 Million reported at the end of 1997, 
notwithstanding principal pay-downs averaging 2.5 Million per month. 
Paydowns reflect the normal monthly amortization occurring under the 
original terms of the loans. In addition, throughout 1998, a very 
competitive rate environment existed among lending entities along with some 
lowering of credit underwriting standards. The Bank, while offering 
competitive rates, however, has not lessened any of its credit criteria and 
strives to maintain the quality of the loan portfolio. The Bank manages 
its credit granting programs for commercial loans through an internal 
credit department that performs an independent analysis of the financial 
condition of the borrower and the business entity. In turn, the borrowing 
request is further evaluated by Executive Management and submitted to the 
Executive Committee of the Board of Directors for final approval before the 
loan is granted.

The largest segment of the loan portfolio is commercial real estate loans 
which represent 52 of total loans. These loans are collateralized by 
various types of commercial properties located within the Bank's market 
area extending throughout southeastern Massachusetts and abutting cities 
and towns in Rhode Island. There is no predominate type of property nor 
concentration of credit in any one industry. The properties consist of 
apartment complexes, medical centers, strip malls, factories with multiple 
tenants, and retail office units. Commercial real estate loans generally 
have a higher degree of credit risk than residential real estate loans 
because they are predominately dependent on the success of the business. 
Analysis of financial statements of the business is performed periodically 
and if it is determined that there are any weaknesses developing in the 
business or any negative trends occurring, contact with the borrower is 
made to determine the cause and what remedial action is planned.

Residential real estate, another large component of loans which accounts 
for 23 of the loan portfolio, is comprised of mortgages on one to four 
family residential properties. Credit is granted based on income to debt 
ratio, a satisfactory credit report and the appraised value of the 
property. The Bank also provides a "minimum down-payment" program to 
encourage home ownership for first time home buyers. This enables 
prospective homeowners the opportunity to purchase a home without having to 
save over an extended period of time, the normally required 20 down 
payment.

Other types of loans total 25 of the portfolio and are comprised of 
commercial loans, which are generally short term loans to finance business 
inventory, consumer credit installment loans, automobile financing and 
credit card loans.

Deposits
- --------

Deposit levels increased substantially in 1998 to 303.8 Million, up by 
 32.5 Million when compared to 271.3 Million reported at the end of 1997. 
The most significant increase occurred in the time deposit category. Time 
deposits is the largest component of deposits. Growth in deposits occurred 
through a practical customer service philosophy complimented by competitive 
interest rates and fees. This approach contributed to the overall 
expansion of the Bank's customer base. Deposits are the Bank's largest 
source of funding.

The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank, (FHLB) and borrows 
funds secured by residential mortgage loans and other assets. This 
borrowing mechanism enables the Bank to match-fund loans to commercial 
borrowers that meet certain credit and deposit requirements. At December 
31, 1998, the Bank had 4.5 Million of loans match-funded with FHLB.

Interest Rate Risk
- ------------------

The Company's Asset-Liability Management Committee, comprised of the Bank's 
Executive Management team, monitors and evaluates the interest rate 
sensitivity of the Company's assets and liabilities. The committee 
utilizes a GAP report which indicates the differences or gap between 
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities in various 
maturity time periods. This, in conjunction with certain assumptions and 
other related factors, such as anticipated changes in interest rates and 
anticipated cash flows from loans, investments and deposits, provides a 
means of evaluating interest rate risk. Management also considers that 
certain assets and liabilities react differently to changes in interest 
rates. Some assets may have rate caps or prepayment fees attached to the 
instrument, and some liabilities have early withdrawal penalties.

A positive gap results when more assets than liabilities are expected to 
reprice within a certain time frame and a negative gap reflects an excess 
of liabilities repricing in that period. A positive gap would tend to 
increase net interest income when rates are rising and decrease net 
interest income when rates are falling. A negative gap position would tend 
to produce the opposite effect. At December 31, 1998 the analysis of the 
GAP report indicates that there is an excess of 0.7 Million in assets 
subject to repricing in the 0 to 2 year category. This equates to a 
percentage of total assets of 0.19 . Management believes that this is an 
ideal situation recognizing that most of the liabilities will be repriced 
in relatively the same time frame as assets, thereby having a minimal 
impact on interest rate risk.

In addition to the gap analysis used to evaluate the Bank's interest rate 
risk exposure, the Bank utilizes a model to monitor earnings-at-risk. This 
model provides management a measurement tool to assess the effect of 
changes in interest rates on the Bank's current and future earnings. A 
specific risk limit with respect to the Bank's potential loss of net 
interest income due to rising or declining interest rates has been 
established. This limit provides management an internal tolerance level to 
control interest rate risk exposure and is monitored on a quarterly basis.

Investments
- -----------

The investment portfolio represents the second largest component of the 
Company's assets and consists of securities in the Available-for-Sale 
category and securities in the Held-to-Maturity category. The designation 
of which category the security is to be classified as is determined at the 
time of the purchase of the investment instrument. Securities in the 
Available-for-Sale category are securities that the Company intends to hold 
for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. These 
securities may be sold in response to interest rate changes, liquidity 
needs or other factors. Any unrecognized gains or losses, net of taxes, is 
reflected in Stockholders Equity as a separate component. Securities in 
the Available-for-Sale category consist predominately of securities of U.S. 
Treasury and other U.S. Government corporations and agencies, mortgage-
backed securities, and marketable equity securities. Securities of U.S. 
Treasury and U.S. Government corporations and agencies have little or no 
credit risk, other than being sensitive to changes in interest rates; and 
if held to maturity, these securities will mature at par. The Company 
amortizes premiums and accretes discounts over the life of the security 
unless it is a callable bond, in which case the premium or discount is 
amortized or accreted to the call date. Marketable equity securities, 
however, have a greater risk as they are subject to rapid market 
fluctuations. These securities are constantly monitored and evaluated to 
determine their suitability for sale or retention in the portfolio. 
Management minimizes its risk by limiting the total amount invested into 
marketable equity securities to 5 of the total investment portfolio. At 
December 31, 1998, the amount invested in marketable equity securities was 
2.5 of the total investment portfolio distributed over various business 
sectors.

The Held-to-Maturity category consists predominately of securities of U.S. 
Treasury, U.S. Government corporations and agencies, and securities issued 
by states of the United States and political subdivisions of states. The 
Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to 
maturity. In managing the Held-to-Maturity portfolio the Company seeks to 
maximize its return and maintain consistency to meet short and long term 
liquidity forecasts by purchasing securities with maturities laddered 
within a short term period of 1-3 years, a mid term period of 3-5 years and 
some securities extending out to 10 years. The Company does not purchase 
investments with off-balance sheet characteristics, such as swaps, options, 
futures and other hedging activities that are called derivatives. The main 
objective of the investment policy is to provide adequate liquidity to meet 
reasonable declines in deposits and any anticipated increases in the loan 
portfolio, to provide safety of principal and interest, to generate 
earnings adequate to provide a stable income, and to fit within the overall 
asset/liability management of the objectives of the Company.

Nonperforming Assets
- --------------------

The Company considers nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more but 
still accruing, restructured loans not performing in accordance with 
amended terms, and real estate acquired through foreclosure as 
nonperforming assets. Nonperforming assets as a total decreased to 4.7 
Million at year end 1998, from 4.9 Million reported at year end 1997.

Nonaccrual loans is the largest component of nonperforming assets, and at 
December 31, 1998, this category decreased to 3.3 Million from 4.6 
Million reported at the end of the previous year.

The Company places a loan on nonaccrual status, when, in the opinion of 
management, the collectability of the principal and interest becomes 
doubtful. Generally, when a commercial loan, commercial real estate loan 
or a residential real estate loan becomes past due 90 days or more, the 
Company discontinues the accrual of interest and reverses previously 
accrued interest. The loan remains in the nonaccrual status until the loan 
is current and six months of payments are made. Then it is reclassified as 
an accruing loan.

If it is determined that the collectibility of the loan no longer exists, 
the loan is charged off to the Allowance for Loan Losses, or if applicable, 
any real estate collateralizing the loan is acquired through foreclosure, 
and categorized as Other Real Estate Owned.

Loans 90 days or more past due but still accruing increased to 317,000 
from 147,000 reported at year end 1997. Management continues to accrue on 
these loans due to the excess values of collateral securing these loans 
compared to their outstanding balances.

Real estate acquired by foreclosure or substantively repossessed increased 
to 1,026,000 at December 31, 1998 compared to 159,000 reported at the end 
of the prior year. This amount represents five separate pieces of 
property. The Bank currently has one purchase and sales agreement on hand 
which is targeted for an early 1999 sale.

The percentage of nonaccrual loans to total loans decreased substantially 
from prior years due to the reduction in the nonaccrual category and the 
growth of the loan portfolio. In addition, the percentage of nonaccrual 
loans, restructured loans and real estate acquired by foreclosure to total 
assets also decreased as a result of increased asset levels. The 867,000 
of restructured loans represent several borrowers whose original loan terms 
were amended and are current in their payments under the amended terms.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114 "Accounting by 
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" applies to all loans except large 
groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated 
for impairment, loans measured at fair value or at a lower of cost or fair 
value, leases, and debt securities as defined in Statement 115. Statement 
114 requires that impaired loans be valued at the present value of expected 
future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or as a 
practical expedient, at the loan's observable market value of the 
collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Smaller-balance 
homogeneous loans are considered by the Company to include consumer 
installment loans and credit card loans.

At December 31, 1998, there were 5.2 Million of loans which the Company 
has determined to be impaired, of which 1.3 Million has a related 
allowance for credit losses of 0.3 Million and 3.9 Million has no related 
allowance for credit losses.

Management is not aware of any other loans that pose a potential credit 
risk or where the loans are current but the borrowers are experiencing 
financial difficulty.

Allowance for Loan Losses
- -------------------------

The Allowance for Loan Losses is available to absorb losses on loans deemed 
by management as uncollectible. In assessing the adequacy of the level of 
the allowance, management considers the status of nonaccrual loans and 
specific borrower situations, the current and anticipated economic climate 
of the area including national credit trends and the historical credit 
experiences within the region. Additions to the Allowance are provided by 
charges to earnings and recoveries on previously charged- off loans. 
Deductions from the Allowance are transacted as a charge off when a loan is 
deemed uncollectible. The Allowance for Loan Losses as a percentage of 
outstanding loans at December 31, 1998 was 1.64 compared to 1.73 reported 
at year end 1997. The ratios at years ending 1996, 1995 and 1994 were 
1.69 , 1.65 and 1.70 respectively. In 1998 the Company provided 600,000 
to the allowance and recovered 67,724 from previously charged off loans. 
Loans charged off during 1998 totaled 792,307. This resulted in net 
charge-offs of 724,583. Net charge-offs for prior years were 160,446, 
- -0-, 358,085, and 293,003 for 1997, 1996, 1995 and 1994 respectively.

In addition to management's assessment of the Allowance for Loan Losses, 
the allowance is also evaluated by regulatory agencies and independent 
accountants as part of their examination and audit procedures.

The table below illustrates the changes in the Allowance for Loan Losses 
for the periods indicated.

Liquidity
- ---------

Liquidity represents the ability of the Bank to meet its funding 
requirements. In assessing the appropriate level of liquidity, the Bank 
considers deposit levels, lending requirements and investment maturities in 
light of prevailing economic conditions. Through this assessment, the Bank 
manages its liquidity level to optimize earnings and respond to 
fluctuations in customer borrowing needs.

The Company's principal sources of funds are customer deposits, loan 
amortization, loan payoffs, and the maturities of investment securities. 
Through these sources, funds are provided for customer withdrawals from 
deposit accounts, loan origination, draw-downs on loan commitments, 
acquisitions of investment securities and other normal business activities. 
Investors' capital also provides a source of funding.

The largest source of funds is provided by depositors. The largest 
component of the Company's deposit base is term certificates which extend 
out to a maximum of three years. The Company does not participate in 
brokered deposits. Deposits are obtained from consumers and commercial 
customers within the Bank's community reinvestment area, being Bristol 
County, Massachusetts and several abutting towns in Rhode Island.

The Company also has the ability to borrow funds for liquidity purposes 
from correspondent banks, the Federal Home Loan Bank, as well as the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston by pledging various investment securities as 
collateral. Tax payments made by our customers which are owed to the 
Federal Reserve Bank Treasury Tax and Loan account are classified as Other 
Borrowed Funds. Note Payable represents a note due to Fleet Bank. The 
note is attributable to Fairbank, Inc. and was assumed at the time of the 
merger. It has a final maturity in November, 1999. Due to the applicable 
prepayment fees, it is advantageous for the Bank to continue with the 
applicable terms of the note. Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank 
represents the match funding program that is available to qualified 
borrowers.

Excess available funds are invested on a daily basis into Federal Funds 
Sold. An appropriate level of Federal Funds Sold is maintained to meet 
loan commitments, anticipated loan growth and deposit forecasts. Funds 
exceeding this level are then used to purchase investment securities that 
are suitable in yields and maturities for the investment portfolio.

Liquidity in 1998 was primarily provided by the maturity and sales of 
securities totaling 43.5 Million, and the increase in deposits of 32.5 
Million. This was offset by the purchases of additional securities of 
 64.0 Million and the net increase in loans totaling 6.2 Million. Other 
events that affected liquidity were advances from the Federal Home Loan 
Bank of 4.1 Million, investment in life insurance policies of 1.6 
Million, capital expenditures of 1.6 Million, and other factors including 
cash provided by operating and financing activities as indicated in the 
cash flow statements.

Capital
- -------

At December 31, 1998, the Company had total capital of 29,707,385, up by 
 3,270,959 from 26,436,426 reported at year end 1997. The increase 
consists primarily of net earnings totaling 3,363,042 offset by cash 
dividends of 959,693 and 8,117 paid for fractional shares resulting from 
the 5 stock dividend issued in February 1998. Other additions to capital 
consisted of 215,924 of optional cash contributions, 473,242 of dividend 
reinvestment associated with the Dividend Reinvestment Program and proceeds 
from exercised stock options of 51,789. Also affecting capital is the net 
increase in other comprehensive income which consists of the net increase 
in unrealized Available-for-Sale securities from December 31, 1997 to 
December 31, 1998 of 215,657, net of taxes, and the minimum pension 
liability adjustment of 80,885, net of taxes, for a total of 134,772.

Under the requirements for Risk-Based and Leverage Capital of the federal 
banking agencies, a minimum level capital will vary among banks based on 
safety and soundness of operations. Risk-Based Capital ratios are 
calculated with reference to risk-weighted assets, which include both on 
and off balance sheet exposure.

In addition to meeting the minimum requirements, the Company and the Bank's 
capital ratios meet the criteria for the "well capitalized" category 
established by the federal banking agencies at December 31, 1998.

The following table illustrates the capital position of Slade's Ferry 
Bancorp and Slade's Ferry Trust Company for years ending December 31, 1998 
and 1997.

Year 2000 Compliance
- --------------------

The approaching Year 2000 presents companies in all industries with a 
myriad of challenges including the ongoing operation of their data systems 
to check proper interpretation of calendar year digits and resulting 
calculations. To meet these challenges, the Company has completed an 
assessment of Year 2000 issues, developed a plan to resolve these issues, 
and commenced the implementation of changes and testing required to achieve 
compliance.

The Company is on schedule to complete changes and testing of essential 
systems by March 31, 1999 utilizing both internal and external resources. 
Essential systems have been identified as the applications for processing 
depositors' and borrowers' accounts, stockholder information, origination 
and receiving of electronic charges and credits (ACH) items, general ledger 
processing and the PC network system, including the teller system. The 
first two phases of a four phase testing schedule have been completed and 
verified. The remaining phases three and four have been installed and are 
currently in the process of final testing and verification.

The final phase of testing on the Federal Reserve Bank's fedline system, 
which provides the Company the ability to perform various operations 
including originating and receiving ACH items, performing wire transfers 
and purchasing securities, was completed and verified in December 1998. 
The necessary upgrade to the teller system has been installed and is being 
tested with final verification by February 1999. The ATM renovation and 
testing is in process and due for completion by June 1999.

Key vendors and customers have been identified and contacted to determine 
any vulnerability the Company may have due to the failure of these parties 
to remedy their own Year 2000 issues. The above mentioned testing has been 
performed using the resources of the key vendors and the Company's own 
internal resources. To the extent that key vendors, customers or other 
general suppliers, not affiliated with the Company, such as communications 
and electric suppliers, are unsuccessful in properly addressing the Year 
2000 issue, the Company could possibly be negatively impacted.

Although the Company does not anticipate any system to be non-compliant, 
should a problem arise with a key vendor, customer or general supplier, the 
Company is finalizing a contingency plan to deal with these issues. It is 
impossible at this time to determine what effect this could have on the 
Company's operations, liquidity and financial condition.

The total cost of the Year 2000 project is estimated at 40,000 to 50,000. 
These costs are not expected to be material to the Company's operations, 
liquidity and financial condition. These estimated costs are based upon 
management's best estimates which have been derived from numerous 
assumptions of future events which include the availability of certain 
resources, third party modification plans and other factors. However, there 
is no guarantee that these estimates will hold true and actual results 
could differ from those anticipated. The Company has incurred Year 2000 
related expenses of 5,300 during 1998.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has established Year 2000 
standards for safety and soundness consistent with the Federal Financial 
Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidance papers describing certain 
essential steps that each FDIC-supervised financial institution must take 
to become Year 2000 ready. There is ongoing regulatory oversight by the 
FDIC of all insured financial institution, including the Company, 
concerning Year 2000 compliance.

Other Matters
- -------------

The Bank is involved in a civil suit brought in Plymouth Superior Court by 
a former employee of the National Bank of Fairhaven, which primarily 
alleges a breach of contract. The original demand by the plaintiff was 
 550,000 to settle the case, which was lowered to 250,000 by the plaintiff 
in 1998. Discovery has been completed and the case is currently scheduled 
for trial on February 22, 1999. The Company believes there are meritorious 
defenses to the plaintiff's claim and it intends to vigorously defend the 
suit. The Company believes that the suit will not have a material adverse 
effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operation, or 
liquidity; and no reserves have been accrued to cover the potential 
liability.

SLADE'S FERRY BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARY
 ------------------------------------

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 ------------------------------------------

 Years Ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996
 --------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS
- -----------------------------

Slade's Ferry Bancorp (Company) (formerly known as Weetamoe Bancorp) is a 
Massachusetts corporation that was organized in 1990 to become the holding 
company of Slade's Ferry Trust Company (Bank). In December of 1996 the 
stockholders of the Company approved the change of the name of the Company 
to Slade's Ferry Bancorp effective January 1, 1997. The Company's primary 
activity is to act as the holding company for the Bank. The Bank is a state 
chartered bank, which was incorporated in 1959 and is headquartered in 
Somerset, Massachusetts. The Bank operates its business from ten banking 
offices located in Massachusetts. The Bank is engaged principally in the 
business of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those 
deposits in residential and real estate loans, and in commercial, consumer 
and small business loans.

NOTE 2 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- ----------------------------

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company and its subsidiary 
conform to generally accepted accounting principles and predominant 
practices within the banking industry. The consolidated financial 
statements were prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. The 
significant accounting policies are summarized below to assist the reader in 
better understanding the consolidated financial statements and other data 
contained herein.

 PERVASIVENESS OF ESTIMATES:

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
 accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates 
 and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
 liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the 
 date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues 
 and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ 
 from the estimates.

 BASIS OF PRESENTATION:

 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the 
 Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank and the Bank's 
 wholly-owned subsidiaries, Slade's Ferry Realty Trust and Slade's 
 Ferry Securities Corporation. Slade's Ferry Realty Trust was formed 
 to hold ownership of real estate and Slade's Ferry Securities 
 Corporation was formed to hold securities for tax benefits in 
 Massachusetts. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions 
 have been eliminated in the consolidation.

 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:

 For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents 
 include cash on hand, cash items, due from banks and federal funds 
 sold.

 Cash and due from banks as of December 31, 1998 includes 4,551,000 
 which is subject to withdrawals and usage restrictions to satisfy the 
 reserve requirements of the Federal Reserve Bank.

 SECURITIES:

 Investments in debt securities are adjusted for amortization of 
 premiums and accretion of discounts. Gains or losses on sales of 
 investment securities are computed on a specific identification basis.

 The Company classifies debt and equity securities into one of three 
 categories: held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading. This 
 security classification may be modified after acquisition only under 
 certain specified conditions. In general, securities may be 
 classified as held-to-maturity only if the Company has the positive 
 intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Trading securities are 
 defined as those bought and held principally for the purpose of 
 selling them in the near term. All other securities must be 
 classified as available-for-sale.

 -- Held-to-maturity securities are measured at amortized cost in 
 the balance sheet. Unrealized holding gains and losses are 
 not included in earnings or in a separate component of 
 capital. They are merely disclosed in the notes to the 
 consolidated financial statements.

 -- Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value on the 
 balance sheet. Unrealized holding gains and losses are not 
 included in earnings, but are reported as a net amount (less 
 expected tax) in a separate component of capital until 
 realized.

 -- Trading securities are carried at fair value on the balance 
 sheet. Unrealized holding gains and losses for trading 
 securities are included in earnings.

 LOANS:

 Loans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold 
 until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstanding principal 
 balances reduced by amounts due to borrowers on unadvanced loans, by 
 any charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses and any deferred fees 
 or costs on originated loans, or unamortized premiums or discounts on 
 purchased loans.

 Interest on loans is recognized on a simple interest basis.

 Loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct origination 
 costs are deferred, and the net amount amortized as an adjustment of 
 the related loan's yield. The Company is amortizing these amounts 
 over the contractual life of the related loans.

 Cash receipts of interest income on impaired loans is credited to 
 principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the 
 collectibility of the net carrying amount of the loan. Some or all of 
 the cash receipts of interest income on impaired loans is recognized 
 as interest income if the remaining net carrying amount of the loan is 
 deemed to be fully collectible. When recognition of interest income 
 on an impaired loan on a cash basis is appropriate, the amount of 
 income that is recognized is limited to that which would have been 
 accrued on the net carrying amount of the loan at the contractual 
 interest rate. Any cash interest payments received in excess of the 
 limit and not applied to reduce the net carrying amount of the loan 
 are recorded as recoveries of charge-offs until the charge-offs are 
 fully recovered.

 ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES:

 The allowance is increased by provisions charged to current operations 
 and is decreased by loan losses, net of recoveries. The provision for 
 loan losses is based on management's evaluation of current and 
 anticipated economic conditions, changes in the character and size of 
 the loan portfolio, and other indicators.

 The Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current 
 information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable 
 to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the 
 loan agreement. The Company measures impaired loans by either the 
 present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's 
 effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price, or the 
 fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

 The Company considers for impairment all loans, except large groups of 
 smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for 
 impairment, loans that are measured at fair value or at the lower of 
 cost or fair value, leases, and convertible or nonconvertible 
 debentures and bonds and other debt securities. The Company considers 
 its residential real estate loans and consumer loans that are not 
 individually significant to be large groups of smaller balance 
 homogeneous loans.

 Factors considered by management in determining impairment include 
 payment status, net worth and collateral value. An insignificant 
 payment delay or an insignificant shortfall in payment does not in 
 itself result in the review of a loan for impairment. The Company 
 reviews its loans for impairment on a loan-by-loan basis. The Company 
 does not apply impairment to aggregations of loans that have risk 
 characteristics in common with other impaired loans. Interest on a 
 loan is not generally accrued when the loan becomes ninety or more 
 days overdue. The Company may place a loan on nonaccrual status but 
 not classify it as impaired, if (i) it is probable that the Company 
 will collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
 of the loan or (ii) the loan is an individually insignificant 
 residential mortgage loan or consumer loan. Impaired loans are 
 charged-off when management believes that the collectibility of the 
 loan's principal is remote. Substantially all of the Company's loans 
 that have been identified as impaired have been measured by the fair 
 value of existing collateral.

 PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT:

 Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated 
 depreciation and amortization. Cost and related allowances for 
 depreciation and amortization of premises and equipment retired or 
 otherwise disposed of are removed from the respective accounts with 
 any gain or loss included in income or expense. Depreciation and 
 amortization are calculated principally on the straight-line method 
 over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

 GOODWILL:

 Goodwill arising from the acquisition of Fairbank, Inc. is reported 
 net of accumulated amortization. Goodwill is being amortized on a 
 straight-line basis over a period of fifteen years.

 OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED AND IN-SUBSTANCE FORECLOSURES:

 Other real estate owned includes properties acquired through 
 foreclosure and properties classified as in-substance foreclosures in 
 accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 15, 
 "Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructuring." 
 These properties are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair 
 value less estimated cost to sell. Any writedown from cost to 
 estimated fair value required at the time of foreclosure or 
 classification as in-substance foreclosure is charged to the allowance 
 for loan losses. Expenses incurred in connection with maintaining 
 these assets, subsequent writedowns and gains or losses recognized 
 upon sale are included in other expense.

 In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114 
 "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," the Company 
 classifies loans as in-substance repossessed or foreclosed if the 
 Company receives physical possession of the debtor's assets regardless 
 of whether formal foreclosure proceedings take place.

 INCOME TAXES:

 The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability 
 method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
 established for the temporary differences between the accounting basis 
 and the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities at enacted 
 tax rates expected to be in effect when the amounts related to such 
 temporary differences are realized or settled.

 FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures 
 about Fair Value of Financial Instruments," requires that the Company 
 disclose estimated fair value for its financial instruments. Fair 
 value methods and assumptions used by the Company in estimating its 
 fair value disclosures are as follows:

 Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amounts reported in the 
 balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate those assets' 
 fair values.

 Securities (including mortgage-backed securities): Fair values for 
 securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If 
 quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on 
 quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

 Loans receivable: For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and 
 with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on 
 carrying values. The fair values for other loans are estimated using 
 discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being 
 offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit 
 quality. The carrying amount of accrued interest approximates its 
 fair value.

 Accrued interest receivable: The carrying amount of accrued interest 
 receivable approximates its fair value.

 Deposit liabilities: The fair values disclosed for demand deposits 
 (e.g., interest and non-interest checking, passbook savings, and money 
 market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on 
 demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). Fair 
 values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a 
 discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently 
 being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected 
 monthly maturities on time deposits.

 Federal Home Loan Bank Advances: Fair values for FHLB advances are 
 estimated using a discounted cash flow technique that applies interest 
 rates currently being offered on advances to a schedule of aggregated 
 expected monthly maturities on FHLB advances.

 Note payable and other borrowed funds: Fair values for the note 
 payable and other borrowed funds are estimated using discounted cash 
 flow analyses based on the Company's current incremental borrowing 
 rates for similar borrowings.

 Off-balance sheet instruments: The fair value of commitments to 
 originate loans is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter 
 similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the 
 agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. 
 For fixed-rate loan commitments and the unadvanced portion of loans, 
 fair value also considers the difference between current levels of 
 interest rates and the committed rates. The fair value of letters of 
 credit is based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or on 
 the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise settle the 
 obligation with the counterparties at the reporting date.

 EARNINGS PER SHARE:

 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 (SFAS No. 128), 
 "Earnings per Share" is effective for periods ending after December 
 15, 1997. SFAS No. 128 simplifies the standards of computing earnings 
 per share (EPS) previously found in APB Opinion No. 15. It replaces 
 the presentation of primary EPS with a presentation of basic EPS. It 
 also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face 
 of the income statement for all entities with complex capital 
 structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and 
 denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and 
 denominator of the diluted EPS computation.

 Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income 
 available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of 
 common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the 
 potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts 
 to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or 
 resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the 
 earnings of the entity. Diluted EPS is computed similarly to fully 
 diluted EPS pursuant to APB Opinion No. 15.

 The Company has computed and presented EPS for the years ended 
 December 31, 1998 and 1997 in accordance with SFAS No. 128. EPS as so 
 computed does not differ materially from EPS that would have resulted 
 if APB Opinion No. 15 had been applied. In accordance with SFAS No. 
 128 EPS data presented for the year ended December 31, 1996 has been 
 restated. EPS so restated does not differ materially from EPS 
 previously presented.

 STOCK BASED COMPENSATION:

 Prior to 1997, the Company did not make stock-based compensation 
 awards. In 1997, the Company began making such awards and had the 
 option, under SFAS No. 123, of accounting for stock-based compensation 
 using the intrinsic value approach in APB No. 25 and the fair value 
 method introduced in SFAS No. 123. The Company elected to use the APB 
 No. 25 method. Entities electing to follow the provisions of APB No. 
 25 must make pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per 
 share, as if the fair value method of accounting defined in SFAS No. 
 123 had been applied. The Company has made the pro forma disclosures 
 required by SFAS No. 123.

NOTE 3 - ACQUISITION OF FAIRBANK, INC.
- --------------------------------------

On August 23, 1996 the Company effected its acquisition of Fairbank, Inc., a 
Massachusetts corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiary, the National 
Bank of Fairhaven, through the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Slade's 
Ferry Trust Company. The acquisition was accomplished by the payment by 
Slade's Ferry Trust Company of 8,575,284 in cash from its capital funds for 
all of the outstanding shares of the common stock of Fairbank, Inc. As a 
result of the acquisition, Fairbank, Inc. was dissolved, and the National 
Bank of Fairhaven was merged into Slade's Ferry Trust Company. The National 
Bank of Fairhaven's two banking offices in Fairhaven and New Bedford, 
Massachusetts have become branches of Slade's Ferry Trust Company.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase, and the results of 
operations of Fairbank, Inc. since the date of the acquisition are included 
in the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill reflected by the 
purchase accounting amounted to 3,405,368 and is being amortized over 15 
years on a straight-line basis.

The following summary, prepared on an unaudited pro forma basis presents the 
results of operations as though the Company and Fairbank, Inc. had been 
merged as of the beginning of the year ended December 31, 1996:

Net interest income after provision for loan losses 12,077,046
Noninterest income 1,349,224
 -----------
 Total 13,426,270
Noninterest expense 9,251,100
 -----------
 Income before income taxes 4,175,170
Income taxes 1,543,200
 -----------
 Net income 2,631,970
 ===========

The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what actually would 
have occurred if the acquisition had been in effect for the entire year of 
1996. In addition, they are not intended to be a projection of future 
results and do not reflect any effects that might be achieved from combined 
operations.

loss carryovers for tax purposes which expire in 2010.

NOTE 12 - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
- ---------------------------

The Company has a defined benefit pension plan (plan) covering substantially 
all of its full time employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. 
Employees are eligible under the plan upon attaining age 21 and completing 
one year of service. The benefits paid are based on 1.5 of total salary 
plus .5 of compensation in excess of integration level per year of service. 
The integration level is the first 750 of monthly compensation. The 
accrued benefit is based on years of service. As of December 31, 1998 the 
Bank has suspended the plan so that employees no longer earn additional 
defined benefits for future service.

The following tables set forth information about the plan as of December 31 
and the years then ended:

1997 and 1996, respectively. The weighted-average expected long-term rate 
of return on assets was 7.0 for 1998, and 8.5 for 1997 and 1996,

Bancorp stock.

The Company has a 401K plan for eligible employees who attain age 21 and 
complete one year of service. The Company contributes a discretionary 
amount to be allocated to eligible participants. Current contributions vest 
fully after seven years of continuous service. The amount that may be 
deferred by the employees is limited by the amount that will not cause the 
plan to exceed IRS limitations. Contributions made by the Company charged 
to employee benefit expense amounted to 9,750, 9,500 and 7,000 for the 
years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

The Company adopted a profit-sharing plan, ("Plan") effective October 1, 
1998. The Company contributes amounts to the plan at the Company's 
discretion.

Cost recognized by the Company for the profit-sharing plan amounted to 
 80,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998.

NOTE 13 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
- ------------------------------------------------

The Company is obligated under certain agreements issued during the normal 
course of business which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements.

The Company is obligated under various lease agreements covering branch 
offices and equipment. These agreements are considered to be operating 
leases. The total minimum rental due in future periods under these 
agreements is as follows as of December 31, 1998:

1999 104,111
 2000 99,875
 2001 92,952
 2002 87,354
 2003 75,501
 Thereafter 224,448
 --------
 Total minimum lease payments 684,241
 ========

Certain leases contain provisions for escalation of minimum lease payments 
contingent upon increases in real estate taxes and percentage increases in 
the consumer price index. The total rental expense amounted to 114,848 for 
1998, 90,210 for 1997 and 66,223 for 1996.

NOTE 14 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
- -------------------------------

The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in 
the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. 
These financial instruments include commitments to originate loans, standby 
letters of credit and unadvanced funds on loans. The instruments involve, 
to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount 
recognized in the balance sheets. The contract amounts of those instruments 
reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of 
financial instruments.

The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the 
other party to the financial instrument for loan commitments and standby 
letters of credit is represented by the contractual amounts of those 
instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making 
commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet 
instruments.

Commitments to originate loans are agreements to lend to a customer provided 
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. 
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination 
clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are 
expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do 
not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates 
each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of 
collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of 
credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower. 
Collateral held varies, but may include secured interests in mortgages, 
accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment and income-
producing properties.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company 
to guarantee the performance by a customer to a third party. The credit 
risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that 
involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Of the total standby 
letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 1998, 199,880 are secured 
by deposits at the Bank.

The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments, all of 
which are held or issued for purposes other than trading, are as follows as 
of December 31:

1998 1997
 ---------------------------- ----------------------------

The carrying amounts of financial instruments shown in the above table are 
included in the consolidated balance sheet under the indicated captions. 
Accounting policies related to financial instruments are described in Note 2.

The notional amounts of financial instrument liabilities with off-balance 
sheet credit risk are as follows as of December 31:

1998 1997

 33,694,049 35,204,220
 =========== ===========

There is no material difference between the notional amounts and the 
estimated fair values of the off-balance sheet liabilities.

The Company has no derivative financial instruments subject to the 
provisions of SFAS No. 119 "Disclosure About Derivative Financial 
Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments" other than the interest 
rate swap described in Note 9.

NOTE 15 - SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
- ---------------------------------------------------------

Most of the Bank's business activity is with customers located within the 
state. There are no concentrations of credit to borrowers that have similar 
economic characteristics. The majority of the Bank's loan portfolio is 
comprised of loans collateralized by real estate located in the state of 
Massachusetts.

NOTE 16 - EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)
- ----------------------------------

Earnings per share were calculated using the weighted average number of 
shares outstanding.

Earnings per share as previously stated has been reduced to reflect the 
issuance of a 5 stock dividend in February of 1998, as follows. EPS in 
1997 was reduced by .05 and EPS in 1996 was reduced by .04. Dividends per 
share was reduced by .01 for both 1997 and 1996.

Reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and 
diluted per share computations for net income are as follows:

NOTE 17 - REGULATORY MATTERS
- ----------------------------

The Company and its subsidiary the Bank are subject to various regulatory 
capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure 
to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and 
possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that, if 
undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's and the 
Bank's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the 
regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank 
must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of 
their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated 
under regulatory accounting practices. Their capital amounts and 
classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators 
about components, risk weightings and other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy 
require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set 
forth in the table below) of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the 
regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital (as 
defined) to average assets (as defined). Management believes, as of 
December 31, 1998, that the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy 
requirements to which they are subject.

As of December 31, 1998, the most recent notification from the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation categorized the Bank as well capitalized under 
the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as 
well capitalized the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 
risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table. There are 
no conditions or events since that notification that management believes 
have changed the Bank's category.

The Company's and the Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios are also 
presented in the table.

The declaration of cash dividends is dependent on a number of factors, 
including regulatory limitations, and the Company's operating results and 
financial condition. The stockholders of the Company will be entitled to 
dividends only when, and if, declared by the Company's Board of Directors 
out of funds legally available therefore. Under the Massachusetts Business 
Corporation Law, a dividend may not be declared if the corporation is 
insolvent or if the declaration of the dividend would render the corporation 
insolvent. The declaration of future dividends, whether by the Board of 
Directors of the Company or the Bank, will be subject to favorable operating 
results, financial conditions, tax considerations, and other factors.

As of December 31, 1998 the Company would be restricted from declaring 
dividends in an amount greater than 29,707,385 as such declaration would 
render the corporation insolvent. As of December 31, 1998 the Bank would be 
restricted from declaring dividends in an amount greater than approximately 
 8,534,000 as such declaration would decrease capital below the Bank's 
required minimum level of regulatory capital.

NOTE 18 - STOCK OPTION PLAN
- ---------------------------

At the 1996 annual meeting stockholders approved a 1996 stock option plan 
(Plan). No options were granted in 1996. A summary of the Plan is as 
follows.

The Plan is divided into two separate equity incentive programs, a 
Discretionary Grant Program and an Automatic Grant Program. The maximum 
number of shares of common stock issuable over the term of the Plan may not 
exceed 262,500 shares and the maximum aggregate number of shares issuable 
under both programs in any plan year may not exceed 52,500 shares. Unless 
sooner terminated by the Board, the Plan will in all events terminate on 
March 11, 2006.

Under the Discretionary Grant Program, key employees, including officers, 
may be granted incentive stock options to purchase shares of common stock. 
The option exercise price per share may not be less than one hundred percent 
of the fair market value of common stock at grant date and generally become 
exercisable in periodic installments over the optionee's period of service. 
Two types of stock appreciation rights are authorized for issuance: (1) 
tandem rights, which require the option holder to elect between the exercise 
of the underlying option for shares of common stock and the surrender of 
such option for appreciation distribution and (2) limited rights, which are 
automatically exercised upon the occurance of a hostile takeover.

Eligibility for participation in the Automatic Grant Program is limited to 
non-employee directors of the Company or its subsidiary who have completed 
three full years of service as directors. Under the Automatic Grant Program 
a nonstatutory option for 2,000 shares of common stock shall be granted each 
plan year to eligible directors. The exercise price per share will be equal 
to one hundred percent of the fair market value per share of common stock at 
grant date and each option will have a maximum five year term. In 1998 the 
Board voted to amend the plan so that each option under the Automatic Grant 
Program will be immediately vested.

The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related Interpretations in accounting 
for its plan. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for its 
stock option plan. Had compensation cost for the Company's stock-based 
compensation plan been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates 
for awards under those plans consistent with the method of FASB Statement 
123, the Company's net income and earnings per share for the years ended 
December 31, 1998 and 1997 would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts 
indicated below:

1998 1997
 ---------- ----------

Net income As reported 3,363,042 2,845,990
 Pro forma 3,298,016 2,807,466

Basic earnings per share As reported .99 .89
 Pro forma .97 .88

Diluted earnings per share As reported .98 .89
 Pro forma .97 .88

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using 
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average 
assumptions used for grants in the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997: 
dividend yield of 2 percent; expected volatility of 13 percent, risk-free 
interest rate of 5.7 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively; and expected 
lives of 4 years.

A summary of the status of the Company's stock option plan as of December 
31, 1998 and 1997 and changes during the years then ending are presented 
below:

The following table summarizes information about fixed stock options 
outstanding at December 31, 1998:

 13.21 60,550 4.2 years 13.21

Exercise prices and options outstanding have been adjusted to reflect the 5 
stock dividend declared in February of 1998.

NOTE 19 - LITIGATION
- --------------------

The Bank is involved in a civil suit brought by a former employee of the 
National Bank of Fairhaven, which primarily alleges a breach of contract and 
other related claims. The demand by the plaintiff is 250,000 to settle the 
case. The case is presently scheduled for trial in February 1999. The 
Company estimates its potential liability to be less than 250,000 and it 
believes it has meritorious defenses to the claim. The Company believes 
that the suit will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's 
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

NOTE 20 - RECLASSIFICATION
