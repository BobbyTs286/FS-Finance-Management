ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Introduction

1mage Software, Inc., (the "Company") develops and markets computer-based
document management systems that capture, store and display electronic files and
paper documents as graphical images. Document management systems like 1MAGE(R)
(pronounced "one image") offer organizations of every size the ability to
deliver the information embedded in their documents to employees, customers, and
authorized persons across their existing computing infrastructure. In addition,
the Company provides the tools to efficiently manage the proliferation of
digital documents for eBusiness deployment. The modular 1MAGE system captures
entire documents from a variety of sources. Memos, letters, source documents,
contracts, purchase orders, word processing files, e-mail, computer reports,
faxes, industry and market studies, spreadsheets, databases, multimedia, maps
and regulatory forms are examples of documents that are automatically captured
into secure, permanent digital images that are indexed for instantaneous
retrieval. Using an open, client/server architecture design, 1MAGE provides a
comprehensive solution for scanning, indexing, storing and retrieving document
images so that they may be viewed, printed, faxed, e-mailed or made available
for eBusiness or eCommerce applications. The 1MAGE system is designed to
integrate easily with existing IT infrastructure, using an extensive library of
multi-platform APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), rather than forcing
expensive investments in re-engineered or new computing hardware and software.

Today's workplace is dramatically changing with the advent of eBusiness,
eCommerce, and affordable electronic document management. During 2004, the
Company concentrated its efforts on selling document imaging software to its
niche markets. These markets include users that prefer a choice of (1) operating
platforms, such as RedHat Linux, Windows, and UNIX, or (2) application software
developers that wish to offer a document imaging solution as part of their
portfolio. The Company also changed its sales strategy in 2004. Instead of
selling its products primarily through a direct sales organization, the Company
made a concerted effort to establish a broad-based independent sales network for
its imaging software. In addition to Value Added Resellers ("VARs") , the
Company seeks to partner with Value Added Dealers ("VAD") such as software
developers, consultants, and other businesses which provide software to their
targeted markets in specific geographical territories. While the Company
recognizes that its increased efforts to utilize an outside sales network had a
detrimental effect on its sales during 2004, the Company believes this is a
short term issue and that the Company's best long-term strategy is to fully
develop that independent sales network.

Imaging Software Market

 Historically, the Company marketed its products through its direct sales
force but, as noted above, has recently changed that strategy, to place a
greater emphasis on its distribution channel partners. The Company now focuses
its sales and marketing efforts on VARs, VADs, systems integrators, developers,
consultants, and other companies that market complementary software, services,
or other products. The Company's decision to build this outside sales network
was based, in part, on its recognition that 1MAGE software has an established
presence in a multitude of industries, including retail, distribution,
education, state and local government, healthcare, manufacturing, energy,
automotive, public safety, transportation and utilities, that should support
such a "partnering' approach.

 The Company offers a comprehensive channel partner program, which
provides, in the context of a cooperative marketing effort, a broad range of
sales, marketing, and technical support. The program includes technical training
and assistance, marketing communications, sales training and assistance,
excellent support and training, lead referral services, customized product
literature, and a discounted demonstration/development system.

Products

 As noted above, the Company's flagship product is 1MAGE(R), its
proprietary document management software package. The Company is continually
enhancing this product portfolio in order to improve its performance and expand
its possible uses.

 1MAGE(R) Document Management - 1MAGE is a powerful electronic document
management system created to operate the same on Linux, Windows(TM) and
Unix-based computer systems. It provides a comprehensive solution for the
scanning, indexing, storage and retrieval of images and is designed to file,
route, track, archive, and manage an organization's incoming and outgoing
documents and electronic files.

Additional products include the following:

 o 1API for image-enabling an application using a toolkit
 o 1SCAN for scanning, pre-indexing, and bar code reading
 o 1FAX for inbound and outbound fax or e-mail and cover sheet
 management
 o 1COLD/ERM for storing computer-generated formatted data
 o 1FORM for business form template administration
 o 1RENDITION for merging spooled data with supporting images for
 billing or other needs
 o 1WORKFLOW for electronically moving a document from one task to
 another
 o 1OCR/OMR for automatic indexing and data capture via optical and
 mark character recognition
 o 1SUITE for bringing images to Windows-based PC clients
 o 1SERVER for accessing documents via the Internet
 o 1VIEW for using standard browsers to access images over the Intranet
 and Internet
 o 1ACCESS for bringing images to desktop computers that support JAVA
 programming languages
 o 1SEARCH for full text/keyword retrieval of documents
 o 1PUBLISH for selecting and recording images on output media such as
 CD or DVD

 verification and retrieval
 o 1GATEWAY - JAVA API tools for managing workflows associated with
 business process management requirements
 o 1MAGEwf - for managing business process workflows utilizing "open
 source" technologies

A key element of the Company's product line is its open systems technology,
namely:

 o Open Systems compliant with Linux, Unix, and Windows Operating
 Systems
 o Supports file formats in most common formats such as; TIFF, JPEG,
 PCX, PCL, WAV, PDF, HTML or HPGL
 o The server software (1MAGE) operates the same on Linux, Unix, and
 Windows servers
 o Supporting clients include Microsoft Windows, Linux, X-Windows,
 ASCII, JAVA and browser clients
 o Device connectivity via Ethernet or token ring networks using TCP/IP
 communication protocol
 o Compatibility with IBM AIX, HP-UX, Sun Solaris, RedHat Linux and
 Windows
 o Recognition technology and scanning tasks run on Microsoft Windows
 o UniVerse and UniData ("U2") Relational Database software from IBM
 o Support for J2EE technologies including JBoss(R), MaxDB(R) (MySQL),
 WfmOpen(R), Combined to form 1mage's open source workflow
 applications: 1MAGEwf

 4

1MAGE includes several distinguishing features: the ability to use many
different types of workstations, the ability to quickly and easily integrate
with the existing business application software using application programming
interfaces ("APIs"), and the scalability to handle the needs of companies of all
sizes economically. Through the use of the Linux, UNIX, and Windows operating
systems and open systems technology, the Company seeks to offer its customers an
imaging solution at a reasonable cost. Because 1MAGE is a server-based product,
the Linux operating system ("O/S") has become very popular with end users of the
Company's software.

 1MAGE utilizes the Linux, UNIX, and Windows operating systems and IBM's U2
database software. The Company's open systems technology makes its software
transportable to numerous hardware products from varying manufacturers. Because
of the number of hardware manufacturers using the Linux, UNIX, and Windows
operating systems, the Company's software customers are rarely restricted in
their choice of hardware manufacturers.

 During 2004, sales of 1MAGE software licenses (excluding annual license
fees) accounted for 412,000 (30 of total revenue); in 2003, revenue from sales
of software licenses accounted for 815,000 (39 of total revenue).

Services and Annual Fees

 The Company licenses its 1MAGE software to its customers and charges an
annual license and maintenance fee, which must be paid to continue receiving
support, updates and add-on products for the software. During 2004 and 2003,
annual license fees accounted for 703,000 (50 and 786,000 (37 ),
respectively, of the Company's net sales. The Company believes recurring annual
license fees from new and existing customers are important to the stability of
the Company. The Company also provides professional services to its customers
and business partners. These services include preparation of image management
plans ("IMP"), installation, training, image enabling existing software, and
consulting services for customers. The Company believes that its new workflow
product 1MAGEwf will increase the need by its customers for additional
professional services as they automate business processes associated with
document management. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the
revenues from these services accounted for 244,000 (17 ), and 299,000 (14 ),
of the Company's net sales.

Hardware Sales

 The Company also recommends hardware and related products, but typically
only sells specialized peripheral products, such as high-end scanners, at the
customer's request. Computer hardware and peripheral products are purchased only
upon request to fill specific customer orders, no inventory is maintained.
Hardware is generally shipped directly from the manufacturer to the customer.
During 2004, hardware sales accounted for 37,000 (3 of total revenue); in
2003, revenue from sales of hardware accounted for 205,000 (10 of total
revenue).

Marketing and Distribution

 In 2004, the Company radically changed its sales strategy from one
primarily focused on direct sales to end-users through its employee sales
organization to a distribution channels approach, where sales of the Company's
products will be primarily through business partners. By that change, the cost
associated with maintaining a dedicated employee based end-user sales force was
eliminated. To date, the Company has signed partnering agreements for 1MAGE with
a variety of resellers (VARs), dealers (VADs), and marketing alliance partners
(MAPs) specializing in a number of different industries, including retail,
healthcare, construction, human resources, and distribution/manufacturing. In
addition, the Company licenses its software and certain other products and
services through agreements with Application Service Providers (ASP) in the
healthcare industry. In 2004, the Company also began to license its products to

 5

end-users through twelve independent sales representatives. The Company's
overall marketing and sales objective is to support the current business
partners and to continue to enroll new software integrators, independent sales
representatives, and consultants in the program. The Company provides training
aids, an Internet demonstration site, user instruction manuals and other
documentation, and a newsletter to keep its partners, as well as prospective
resellers and customers, informed of new product applications and developments.
In 2004 the Company established a consulting certification program to train and
educate outside consultants on the support of the Company's products. As a
result of this program the Company expects to outsource some of its technical
service and support projects when needed.

 The general strategy is to assist its partners to (1) help customers
define the goals for their system, (2) provide the means of achieving those
goals through document management software, workflow processes, and
appropriately configured computer systems, and (3) help assure the ongoing
success of this collaborative process by providing continuing support, including
on-site training and educational programs, and ongoing maintenance. The Company
also markets its products and services over the Internet on its website at
www.1mage.com.

Customers

 The Company sells its 1MAGE software primarily through its distribution
channels to businesses in a wide variety of industries and markets.

Sources of Supply

 The Company has a Value Add Reseller (VAR) Software Agreement with IBM
Corp. to sublicense their UniVerse and UniData database programs. The agreement
authorizes the Company to include certain IBM database programs as part of their
imaging solution. This agreement currently runs until September 28, 2005 and it
may be automatically renewed for additional one (1) year terms. The Company has
designed its product such that, through the use of its Application Program
Interfaces ("API"s), third party software can be easily integrated into the core
products with minimal difficulty and effort.

Possible Fluctuations in Operating Results

 The Company's sales cycle, which generally commences at the time a
prospective distribution partner or customer demonstrates a serious interest in
purchasing a system or software license, and ends upon execution of a sales
contract, is lengthy and not predictable with any degree of certainty. Prior
sales and implementation cycles are not necessarily an indication of future
cycles. Operating results could vary from period to period as a result of the
length of the sales cycle, the timing of individual system sales, business
partners' performance and conditions in the target markets and the economy in
general.

 Despite the negative short-term results during the transition period in
2004, it is the Company's expectation that its recent decision to focus on
offering its proprietary imaging software to a broader range of business
partners and customers, through its distribution channel could lessen the
historical quarterly fluctuations in the Company's operating results. In any
event, however, large volume sales, special product packaging, or groups of
sales of software licenses may still cause significant variances in quarterly
results that may be difficult to predict.

Trade Secret and Copyright Laws

 The Company regards its software as proprietary and relies for protection
upon trade secret and copyright laws and non-disclosure agreements with its
employees as well as restrictions on disclosure and transferability contained in
its software license agreements with its customers. Despite these restrictions,
it may be possible for competitors or customers to copy, or reverse compile,
aspects of the Company's products or obtain information that the Company regards
as proprietary. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not
independently develop software products similar to those developed or planned by
the Company.

 6

Although the Company believes its software does not infringe on the
proprietary rights of others and has not received any notice of claimed
infringement, it is possible that portions of the software marketed by the
Company could be claimed to infringe on existing proprietary rights. In the
unlikely event that any such infringements are found to exist, there can be no
assurance that any necessary licenses or rights could be obtained, or could be
obtained on terms satisfactory to the Company. Further, in such event, the
Company could be required to modify the infringing software. There can be no
assurance that the Company would be able to do so in a timely manner, upon
acceptable terms and conditions, or at all; even though the failure to do so
could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Backlog

 As a practical matter, the Company's business has evolved to the point
where the Company has minimal backlog at any given point in time. With respect
to software license sales, because there is no significant time delay between
receipt of an order and shipment of the software, electronically or otherwise,
there is effectively no backlog. For hardware, because of direct delivery of the
hardware by the manufacturer, hardware sales have such short lead times that
unfilled firm orders seldom, if ever, build up to significant levels.

 The Company normally receives a deposit of between 25 and 50 of the
hardware and software price when an order is placed. This deposit may or may not
be returned upon cancellation, depending on the circumstances of the
cancellation.

Competition

 The Company experiences intense competition in its business from
competitors who target one or more of the same markets or market segments as the
Company. Software and systems that perform many of the same functions as the
Company's systems and software are also available from a number of competitors
of the Company. Some of these competitors are larger and have longer operating
histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other
resources, significantly greater name recognition and a larger installed base
than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly
to emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote
greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than
we can.

 The Company believes that usage of the Linux and Windows operating systems
and the IBM U2 databases has strengthened the Company's competitive position by
making the Company's software compatible with more types of hardware and with
the IBM U2 application software offered by other software developers and system
integrators. The Company further believes that its principal advantage over its
competitors is the Company's ability to give its customers and partners a choice
in selecting a Linux, UNIX, or Windows-based open systems architecture and the
IBM U2 database that can be offered at lower prices.

Limited Markets

 The Company's channels program targets complementary markets and allows
the Company to draw from a variety of industries with respect to its imaging
software products. As noted above, the Company's strategy is to expand the
domestic and international markets for its imaging software by placing more
emphasis on its distribution channel network of partners.

 7

The Company's experience has been that economic downturns or increased
competitive pressures in its niche markets sometimes result in reduction or
deferral of capital expenditures or large purchases, like software licenses, by
potential customers. On the other hand, certain adverse conditions can sometimes
lead to opportunities as potential customers downsize to smaller, more
cost-efficient computer systems or replace custom designed systems that require
higher levels of support and maintenance.

Product Development

 The software and services market in which the Company competes is
characterized by (1) rapid technological change, (2) frequent introduction of
new products and enhancements, and (3) changing customer needs. Accordingly, the
Company's future success depends on its ability to support existing products and
develop new products.

 During 2004, the Company developed a new release of 1MAGE(C) which employs
new technologies, including workflow and business process management (1MAGEwf)
requirements and significant development on creating JAVA and J2EE integration
and application integration tools. In addition, improvements were made to the
hardware/software compatibility offerings available for Linux and Windows users.
During 2004 and 2003, the Company spent 267,000 and 261,000, respectively, for
computer software development. The Company capitalizes its software development
costs once technological feasibility is established.

Employees

 As of March 11, 2005, the Company employed sixteen persons, thirteen of
whom serve on a full-time basis and three on a part-time basis. Responsibilities
are divided as follows: four persons in channel sales and marketing, eight in
technical support and programming functions, and four in administrative
positions. In addition, the Company established a certification program in 2004
for outside technical contractors and independent sales representatives. This
program is expected to facilitate outsourcing of some of the Company's technical
service and support requirements when necessary and to decrease the dependency
on employing additional personnel to do such work.

 The Company provides incentive compensation packages to many of its
employees, including its executive officers. The Company's chief executive
officer, David R. DeYoung, receives a quarterly bonus equal to 5 of the
Company's pretax profits. Sales and Consulting personnel receive a commission
based upon sales. The Company has a policy of encouraging the effort and loyalty
of all of its employees by making all employees eligible for the grant of stock
options under its Equity Incentive Plan, subject to vesting schedules. The
Company believes that these incentive programs are important in attracting and
retaining skilled personnel. The future success of the Company will depend in
large part upon the quality of its employees and the efforts they expend on
behalf of the Company.

 None of the Company's employees are represented by a labor union, and the
Company has experienced no work stoppage. The Company believes that its employee
relations are good.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

 The Company's executive offices consist of approximately 5,464 square feet
at Plaza Quebec, 6025 South Quebec Street, Suite 300, Englewood, Colorado, 80111
and are occupied pursuant to a lease agreement between the Company and Trammel
Crow, Inc. with monthly rental payments of 7,058, currently, and scaling to
 7,741 by the end of the lease term. The term of the lease commenced May 1, 2003
and will terminate on August 31, 2008. The landlord is responsible for property
taxes, utilities, janitorial services, repairs, and maintenance. The Company
believes that its facilities and equipment are in good condition and are
satisfactory for their present uses. As a condition of renewing the lease, the
Company requested and received two months free rent in 2004 at 6,830 per month
and two months free rent in 2005 at 7,058 per month. Rent is expensed under the
straight-line method over the term of the lease at 6,822 per month. Deferred
rent at 12/31/04 is 12,636.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 In May 1994, the Company signed a software license agreement (the "1994
Agreement") with Reynolds and Reynolds, Inc. ("Reynolds")for the exclusive right
to sublicense certain modules of 1MAGE (without payment of further license fees
to the Company) to businesses primarily engaged in retail sales of new or used
automobiles, trucks, or tractors (the "Licensed Software"). In 1996, the Company
signed a subscription and maintenance agreement with Reynolds (the "1996
Agreement") under which annual subscription fees are to be paid to the Company.

 On January 18, 2002, Reynolds notified the Company of its intent to
terminate the 1996 Agreement effective April 22, 2002. Reynolds had installed
the 1MAGE document management software in approximately 1,000 of its customer
sites in the United States and Canada. As a result of various disputes arising
out of the termination of the 1996 agreement, including Reynolds' decision to
continue sublicensing the Company's software notwithstanding such termination,
the Company and Reynolds became involved in litigation.

 On June 21, 2002, the Company filed a civil action seeking monies owed by
Reynolds under its 1996 Agreement with the Company in the District Court for the
City and County of Denver, Colorado, 1mage Software, Inc. v. The Reynolds and
Reynolds Co. Case No.: 02-CV-4701 ("the "Collection Action"). In its complaint
in the Collection Action, the Company demanded immediate payment of 193,611
currently due under that contract plus interest and costs. Reynolds deposited
the 193,611 with the court clerk, pending order of the court as to its
disposition and has filed an answer denying liability. The Company filed a
Motion for Summary Judgment to which Reynolds responded, denying liability and
stating that in all events, the amount due was only 166,741. The Court then
referred the matter to arbitration before the American Arbitration Association.

 A lawsuit was filed by the Company in the United States District Court for
the District of Colorado, 1mage Software, Inc. v. The Reynolds and Reynolds Co.,
et al., No. 02-K-1688 (OES), (the "Infringement Action"), in which the Company
sought damages for copyright infringement resulting from continuing use of the
Company's software without any license or authority by Reynolds and
approximately 1,000 automobile dealers throughout the United States. The
Infringement Action was also referred to arbitration.

 In the Arbitration, besides the claims raised by the Company in the
Collection Action and the Infringement Action, Reynolds asserted a counterclaim
for 580,000, alleging that the Company, without justification or privilege,
advised customers and/or prospects of Reynolds that Reynolds no longer had a
license to distribute the Company software. The Company denied that it
improperly informed Reynolds' dealers.

 On June 17, 2004, the Company received notification from the American
Arbitration Association that all of the Company's claims against Reynolds had
been dismissed and a second hearing would be held, as previously scheduled, on
October 11, 2004, for consideration of Reynolds' counterclaims against the
Company. In this first phase of the arbitration, the Arbitrator determined that
Reynolds has a perpetual license under the 1994 Agreement to all software listed
therein and to all software related to updates, upgrades and enhancements

 9

provided under the 1996 Agreement, with one exception, the Flex LM software in
use at Reynolds' facilities. The Flex LM software provides the Company with a
means by which it could control the software's features, user count and time
periods within which its licensees would be enabled to operate their copies of
the Company's Licensed Software and shut down that software unless additional
fees for future periods were paid. The Arbitrator found that the Flex LM
software provides no benefit to Reynolds and was either surplusage or provided
an actual impediment, inconsistent with the 1994 Agreement, to Reynolds' use of
the Licensed Software. He also found that there was no basis for the Company's
claim that Reynolds either breached any agreement or infringed any of its
copyright rights. Since the 1994 Agreement prohibits the Arbitrator from
awarding costs or attorneys' fees, he did not address those issues and no award
was made. The Arbitrator also noted that the 1994 Agreement did not appear to
speak to the allocation or award of arbitration fees paid to the American
Arbitration Association but whether any such award would be made would be
reserved for the second phase of the arbitration.

 A second hearing was held on October 11 and 12, 2004, for consideration of
Reynolds' counterclaims seeking 836,643 in damages from the Company. Among the
counterclaims considered by the arbitrator were those based upon Reynolds'
claimed damages from having to replace 39 copies of the Company's DocVantage
software product that expired after only a 1 year license with Reynolds' new
choice of software, EDM. It was the Company's contention that all but
approximately 40,000 of Reynolds' damage claims were barred by a limitation of
remedies clause contained in the 1996 agreement. Reynolds claimed that the 1996
agreement did not apply to the counterclaims but admitted that the Company is
entitled to the 193,611 in accounts receivable previously deposited by Reynolds
with the court in a related case. The Company also argued that 597,000 in
hardware costs claimed by Reynolds was unproven because the hardware in question
was returned to Reynolds and reused for other purposes by Reynolds. The November
12, 2004 decision of the arbitrator concerning Reynolds' counterclaims was
issued on November 17, 2004. The arbitrator ruled in favor of Reynolds on
substantially all of its counterclaims, finding that the Company breached both
the 1994 and 1996 agreements with Reynolds by delivering only 1 year DocVantage
licenses to 39 Reynolds customers after Reynolds terminated its agreement with
the Company. The arbitrator refused to uphold the limitation of remedies clause
in the 1996 agreement on the grounds that it was unconscionable as applied to
the Company's decision to provide Reynolds with only 1 year DocVantage licenses.
While admitting that it was "not simple" to devise a fair method of assessing
damages for the breach beyond the undisputed 40,131 attributable to the 39
software licenses, the arbitrator nevertheless allowed 36,205 for installation,
 40,725 for training, and 275,000 of the total 577,273 Reynolds was found to
have spent for new equipment, for a total of 392,061 in damages to be paid by
the Company.

 Reynolds subsequently obtained a judgment on the arbitrator's award
against the Company on the counterclaims and denial of the Company's claims in
the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, which had
retained jurisdiction of the dispute pending resolution of the arbitration.
Since the parties no longer disputed the Company's entitlement to the 193,611
deposited with the court, the net result of the judgment was that Reynolds took
the 193,611 deposited with the court and applied that deposit to the judgment,
so that the Company still owed the balance of 198,450 to Reynolds.

Instead of satisfying the balance of the judgment, the Company filed an
appeal from the court's judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Tenth Circuit and in April, 2005 filed a cash bond in the amount of the
remaining judgment pending appeal. The Company obtained the money needed to post
that bond by borrowing approximately 180,000 in additional funds from the
private line of credit extended to the Company by DEMALE, LLC. DEMALE is owned
and controlled by members of the Company's Board of Directors. In connection
with DEMALE's loan of the additional 180,000 to the Company, which increased
the total amount loaned under that private line of credit to 468,000 plus
interest, the Company and DEMALE agreed to change the price for DEMALE's
conversion right for the principal amount of, and unpaid interest on, the line
of credit. The conversion price was previously equal to 80 of the fair market
value on the date that DEMALE's written notice of such conversion to the
Company's Common Stock is received by the Company. The amendment changed the
conversion price to 0.14 per share, or 80 of the fair market value on the date
of the written notice, whichever is lower. As a result of the increase in the
amount owed to DEMALE under the line of credit to 500,000 and the fixing of the
maximum conversion price at 0.14 per share, DEMALE is now the beneficial owner
of at least 3,571,429 shares, or 52.0 of the Company's outstanding shares of
common stock, as calculated under Securities Exchange Act Rule 13d-3(a). In
connection with the amendment of the line of credit agreement, DEMALE also
agreed to extend the expiration date of the line of credit from June 30, 2005 to
June 30, 2007

10

The Company intends to vigorously pursue its appeal of the adverse
judgment of the district court confirming (a) the arbitrator's award against the
Company and (b) the arbitrator's denial of all of the Company's claims against
Reynolds. There can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in all or any
portion of its appeal.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
 OF OPERATIONS

 OVERVIEW

 Management believes that operating performance of the Company during 2004
was negatively affected by the short-term impact of the Company's change in
sales strategy from internal direct sales by Company employees, to a partnering
or indirect sales strategy through a network of VARs, VADs, and other
independent sales representatives. In addition, a significant portion of the
losses in 2004 are the result of the 392,000 award against the Company on the
counterclaims brought against it by Reynolds & Reynolds in the arbitration
brought by the Company against Reynolds. Besides the general economic slowdown
in the technology sector, the extent to which the Company's limited resources
were dedicated to the Reynolds litigation probably contributed to the poor sales
performance. Thus, identifying specific trends based on the Company's
performance in 2004 is particularly difficult.

 While interest in the Company's products remains positive, there can be no
assurance that the Company's revenue for 2005 will expand beyond current levels.
As such, the Company has implemented stringent cost cutting measures. There is
no certainty that the Company will in fact be profitable in 2005 but the Company
believes that its recurring annual license fee revenue, tight expense controls,
and the maturation of its re-directed sales strategy will help return the
Company to profitability by the end of the year.

 Results of Operations
 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

 The Company's total revenue was 1.4 million for the year ended December
31, 2004, compared to 2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003,
representing a decrease of 709,000 (34 ). Mid-year 2004, the Company changed
its sales strategy from selling through a direct sales force to selling through
business partnerships in various markets. Unfortunately, establishing these
relationships takes time both in signing up new partners and then securing
business through those relationships. As a result, the Company's revenue from
new business dropped 56 in 2004 as compared to 2003, primarily due to a decline
in new software licenses caused by the transition to an outside sales network.

 The Company's 2004 and 2003 revenue was derived from four sources:
software licenses, annual maintenance/license fees, consulting services, and
hardware sales.

 In 2004, software license revenue decreased 49 , or 403,000 from 2003
levels, primarily due to the drop in new business. Annual license fees decreased
11 , or 83,000 due to a few customers going out of business or electing not to
renew maintenance. The professional service group's revenue decreased by 55,000
(18 for the year primarily due to decreased services typically generated from
new installations. Hardware sales decreased 82 , or 168,000, from 2003 levels,
as the Company has changed its distribution strategy from a direct sales force
to that of a business partner network, where most partners sell their own
hardware solutions.

 Gross profit on revenue for the year ended 2004 was 45 , as compared to
57 for 2003, primarily due to the decrease in high profit margin software
sales. In 2004, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 390,000
(32 due to a 112,000 increase in legal fees plus a litigation judgment of
 392,000 offset by tight expense controls across all departments and the
elimination of its direct sales force. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the
Company reported a net loss of 1.1 million, or (.34) per share, a decrease of
 1.21 million over net income of 96,000 or .03 per share for the previous
year.

 13

The more pressing challenge faced by the Company today, however, is that
of liquidity. Because the Company has limited capital resources, namely an
undrawn balance of around 32,000 on its private convertible line of credit from
DEMALE, LLC, it cannot sustain future losses without an adverse effect on its
liquidity and operations. In addition, the Company's potential inability to
satisfy the bank's request for a gradual pay down on its credit line could have
severe consequences for the Company.

 Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002.

 The Company's total revenue was 2.1 million for the year ended December
31, 2003, compared to 2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
representing a decrease of 138,000 (6 ). The Company's revenue decreased
 428,000 as a result of the loss of the Company's largest customer, Reynolds and
Reynolds, during the year as total revenue from Reynolds declined from 441,000
to 13,000. The Company does not anticipate any significant revenue from
Reynolds in 2004.

 The Company's revenue for 2003 and 2002 was derived from four sources:
software licenses, annual maintenance/license fees, consulting services, and
hardware sales.

 In 2003, software license revenue increased 6 , or 49,000 from 2002
levels, of which a decrease of 121,000 was attributable to the loss of this
single customer. Without the loss of this large customer, software license
revenue would have increased 170,000. Annual license fees decreased 20 , or
 192,000 of which a decrease of 307,000 was attributable to the loss of
business from this large customer. Without the loss of this large customer,
annual license fees would have increased 115,000. The professional service
group's revenue decreased by 20,000 (6 for the year primarily due to
decreased consulting services provided due to the timing of year-end contracts.
Hardware sales of 205,000 increased 24,000 (13 over 181,000 for 2002.

 Gross profit on revenue for the year ended 2003 was 57 , as compared to
49 for 2002, primarily due to the increase in software sales. In 2003, selling,
general and administrative expenses decreased 151,000 (11 due to tight
expense controls across all departments of the Company. In addition, during
2003, the Company settled a payable of 138,000 that was due to a vendor in
connection with a software purchase for an earlier period. For the year ended
December 31, 2003, the Company reported net income of 96,000 or .03 per share,
an improvement of 378,000 over a net loss of 282,000 or (.09) per share for
the previous year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 The Company's cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately 93,000
during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 as compared to December 31,
2003. During 2004, the Company used cash of 267,000 for deferred development
expenses. The Company had deficit working capital of 776,000 as of December 31,
2004. Included in current liabilities is 310,000 for Deferred Revenue, which
will be earned throughout 2005 from its annual license and maintenance
contracts. The Company had drawn 172,000 on its bank line of credit at December
31, 2004, as compared to 139,000 drawn at December 31, 2003. The line is
collateralized by all accounts receivable, assets, and general intangibles of
the Company. The Company's line of credit agreement with its bank expired
February 24, 2005 and will not be renewed. On March 31, 2005 the bank line was
advanced 162,000. The Company is currently in negotiations with the bank to
implement a payment plan that will amortize the debt over a 48-month period,
with a new maturity date of April 15, 2006. The bank has granted the Company an
extension of time to repay the promissory note underlying the line of credit,
which was due in full on March 31, 2005, until April 15, 2005. There can be no
assurance that the bank will agree to any additional extension or to any plan to
retire the debt over time or to any other resolution that is acceptable to the
Company.

 In April, 2003, the Company established an additional line of credit with
DEMALE, LLC, a limited liability corporation owned and controlled by the
principal shareholders and members of the Board of Directors of the Company. The
initial line provided for borrowings of up to 300,000 and is secured by
substantially all of the Company's assets and is expressly subordinated to the
bank's line of credit. Under the terms of the agreement with DEMALE, the
outstanding balance, including unpaid principal and accrued but unpaid interest
can be converted by DEMAL:E to equity at any time. The conversion price is the
lower of .14 or 80 of the fair market value, of the Company's stock at the
time of conversion. At December 31, 2004, DEMALE had advanced 223,600, as
compared to 54,600 at December 31, 2003. On March 31, 2005, DEMALE agreed to
increase the line to 500,000 in order to fund the Company's appeal bond in the
litigation challenging the results of the Reynolds & Reynolds arbitration
proceeding. As of March 31, 2005, the Company had advanced 468,000 on the line
of credit. DEMALE also agreed to extend the expiration date of the line of
credit from June 30, 2005 to June 30, 2007.

 As noted above in "Results of Operations", the termination by Reynolds and
Reynolds ("Reynolds") of its 1996 Agreement and the resulting judgement had a
significantly adverse impact on the Company's 2004 financial results.

 The Company has developed a new, lower cost, strategy for the distribution
of its products and services. The downturn in revenue associated with this
change in strategy, however, has required the Company to bring its cost
structure in line with its available revenue. As a result, the Company
implemented new stringent cost cutting measures throughout 2004 and into 2005
that are expected to help improve its results of operations in 2005.

 The Company receives its revenues from software licenses, recurring annual
maintenance/license fees, consulting services and minimal hardware sales.
Notwithstanding the burdens imposed by the Reynolds' judgement, the Company
believes that its continued relationship with DEMALE, and the cash flows
generated from current operations, may be sufficient to meet its immediate needs
for working capital.

 The Company has no material commitments for capital expenditures for 2005.

 Contractual obligations at December 31, 2004 are as follows:

(1) Lines of credit, consist of two revolving line of credit agreements, one
 with the bank that expired on February 24, 2005 and one with related
 parties that will expire on June 30, 2007. The Company is negotiating with
 the bank to pursue the option of making monthly payments over the next 48
 months. DEMALE is entitled to monthly interest payments and the
 outstanding principal balance is due at maturity. DEMALE, at their option,
 can elect to convert the debt to equity.

(2) Amounts shown under capital lease arise under leases for office equipment
 expiring in 2006 and 2008 with monthly lease payments of approximately
 418 and 55.

Risks to Future Financial Performance

Severely Limited Capital Resources. As a result of the Company's operating
losses in 2004 and the 392,000 award against it in the Reynolds arbitration,
the Company's capital resources have been stretched to unprecedented lengths.
The Company cannot bear any significant operating or other losses in 2005 if it
is to survive. While preliminary indications are that the Company has not
incurred such a significant loss in the first quarter of 2005, the Company still
requires the continuing forbearance of its bank, which has already declined to
renew the 162,000 owed on its line of credit, and the continued support of
DEMALE, LLC, which the Company owes 468,000 as of March 31, 2005. There is no
assurance that such forbearance or support will continue or that the Company
will not incur additional operating losses. Accordingly, unless the Company can
obtain additional capital to cover future losses, if the Company incurs
additional losses or otherwise experiences negative cash flow, there is a
substantial risk that the Company will not be able to continue as a going
concern.

Variable operating results. Our future operating results may vary significantly
and are difficult to predict due to a number of factors, of which many are
beyond our control. These factors include:

 o Demand for our products;
 o Productivity of our business partners;
 o The level of product and price competition;
 o The length of our sales cycle;
 o The size and timing of individual license transactions;
 o The delay or deferral of customer implementations;
 o Our success in expanding our customer support organization, direct
 sales force and indirect distribution channels;
 o The timing of new product introductions and product enhancements;
 o Changes in our pricing policy;
 o The mix of products and services sold;
 o Our ability to develop and market new products and control costs;
 and
 o Current economic and political conditions

 16

Current Economic and Political Conditions May Affect Results. Due to the
discretionary nature of our customers' budget and purchase cycles and the
absence of long-term customer purchase commitments, it is expected to remain
difficult for the Company to avoid significant fluctuations in quarterly
operating results. On the other hand, if the overall economy continues to
improve, of which there can be no certainty, the Company believes that such
improvement will assist it in its return to profitability.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 In preparing financial statements, management must make estimates and
judgments that affect the carrying values of the Company's assets and
liabilities as well as recognition of revenue and expenses. Management's
estimates and judgments are based on the Company's historical experience and
management's knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances. The
policy discussed below is considered by management to be critical to an
understanding of the Company's financial statements. The application of this
policy places significant demands on management's judgment, with financial
reporting results relying on estimations about the effect of the matter that is
inherently uncertain. For this policy, management cautions that future events
rarely develop as a forecast, and estimates routinely require adjustment and may
require material adjustment. There have been no significant changes in critical
accounting policies in the past year.

 Software Development Costs are capitalized when technological feasibility
is established. Such costs are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net
realizable value. Amortization is computed using either the straight-line method
based on estimated economic lives of the products (five years) or the ratio that
current product revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated future
product revenues, whichever is greater. It is reasonably possible that those
estimates of anticipated future gross revenues, the remaining estimated economic
life of the products, or both will be reduced significantly in the near term due
to competitive pressure. As a result, the carrying amount of the capitalized
software costs may be reduced materially in the near term. The net realizable
value of such capitalized costs is reviewed by management on a periodic basis,
and costs in excess of net realizable value, if any, are charged to operations.

 Revenue Recognition - Revenue from the sale of software licenses, computer
equipment, and existing application software packages is recognized when the
software and computer equipment are shipped to the customer, remaining vendor
obligations are insignificant, there are no significant uncertainties about
customer acceptance and collectibility is probable. Revenue from related
services, including installation and software modifications, is recognized upon
performance of services. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the
maintenance period.

Forward Looking Statements

Some of the statements made in this Form 10-K are not historical facts and may
be considered "forward looking statements." All forward-looking statements are,

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Audit Committee, Board of Directors and Stockholders
1mage Software, Inc.
Englewood, Colorado

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of 1mage Software, Inc. as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements of operations,
shareholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of 1mage Software, Inc. as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company
will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 11, the Company has
suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that
raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 11. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003, AND 2002

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ORGANIZATION

 Organization and Nature of Business - 1mage Software, Inc. (the "Company")
 was incorporated in Colorado in December 1981.

 The Company develops and markets a Linux, UNIX, and Windows-based
 electronic document image management and retrieval system. The Company
 earns the majority of its revenues in the United States.

 Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid debt
 instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to
 be cash equivalents.

 Inventories consist of third party software and are stated at the lower of
 cost (specific identification method) or market (net realizable value).
 This software is ultimately integrated into the Company's products.

 Property and Equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization
 are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
 lives (generally five years) of the assets or the lease term, if shorter.
 The Company capitalizes all expenditures for property and equipment in
 excess of 500. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
 depreciation expense totaled 16,226, 18,292, and 21,896, respectively.

 Advertising Costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses totaled
 40,522, 63,552, and 118,373, in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

 Software Development Costs are capitalized when technological feasibility
 is established. Such costs are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or
 net realizable value. Amortization is computed using either the
 straight-line method based on estimated economic lives of the products
 (five years) or the ratio that current product revenues bear to the total
 of current and anticipated future product revenues, whichever is greater.

 It is reasonably possible that those estimates of anticipated future gross
 revenues, the remaining estimated economic life of the products, or both
 will be reduced significantly in the near term due to competitive
 pressure. As a result, the carrying amount of the capitalized software
 costs may be reduced materially in the near term. The amounts capitalized
 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 were 267,351,
 261,346, and 296,510, respectively. Amortization of these costs totaled
 281,000, 288,000, and 301,200, respectively. The net realizable value
 of such capitalized costs is reviewed by management on a periodic basis,
 and costs in excess of net realizable value, if any, are charged to
 operations.

 Loan Costs are amortized using the effective interest method over the term
 of the debt agreement.

 Revenue Recognition - Revenue from the sale of software licenses, computer
 equipment, and existing application software packages is recognized when
 the software and computer equipment are shipped to the customer, remaining
 vendor obligations are insignificant, there are no significant
 uncertainties about customer acceptance and collectibility is probable.
 Revenue from related services, including installation and software
 modifications, is recognized upon performance of services. Maintenance
 revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance period.

25

A single customer, Reynolds and Reynolds, accounted for 0 , 0.1 , and 20 
 of revenues in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. No other customer
 accounted for more than 10 of revenue for 2004, 2003, or 2002.

 Debt Discount - is amortized using the effective interest method over the
 term of the debt agreement.

 Accounts Receivable - Accounts receivable are stated at the amount billed
 to customers. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts,
 which is based upon a review of outstanding accounts receivable,
 historical collection information and existing economic conditions. The
 Company performs credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition
 and generally does not require collateral. The Company retains a security
 interest in the equipment and software sold until they are paid in full.
 Accounts receivable are ordinarily due 30 days after the issuance of the
 invoice, with those customers not meeting those requirements being subject
 to stricter credit policies. Delinquent receivables are written off based
 on individual credit evaluation and specific circumstances of the
 customer.

 Three customers accounted for 41 , 13 and 11 of accounts receivable at
 December 31, 2004. One customer accounted for 31 of accounts receivable
 at December 31, 2003. Three different customers accounted for 32 , 12 and
 11 of accounts receivable at December 31, 2002.

 Earnings (Loss) per Share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the
 weighted average number of common and equivalent shares outstanding during
 the year. Fully diluted earnings per share are either anti-dilutive or not
 materially different from basic earnings per share.

 Income Taxes The Company follows the liability method of accounting for
 income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
 Standards (SFAS) No. 109. Under this method, deferred income taxes are
 recorded based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax
 bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates
 and laws that will be in effect when the underlying assets or liabilities
 are received or settled.

 The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax
 assets due to the uncertainty of ultimate realizability.

 Stock-based Compensation At December 31, 2004, the Company has three
 stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in
 Note 5. The Company accounts for these plans under the recognition and
 measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
 to Employees, and related Interpretations. No stock-based employee
 compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under
 those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
 underlying common stock on the grant date. The following table illustrates
 the effect on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied
 the fair value provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for
 Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation.

Estimates -The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
 reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent
 assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
 reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods.
 Actual results could differ from those estimates.

4. LINES OF CREDIT

 Bank

 On February 24, 2004, the Company entered into a 200,000 annual revolving
 bank line of credit that expired on February 24, 2005 and had borne
 interest at prime plus 1.75 (total rate of 7.0 at December 31, 2004) not
 to exceed 18 , and was collateralized by all accounts receivable, assets,
 and general intangibles of the Company. The proceeds from this bank line
 of credit were used to payoff the bank line of credit that existed at
 December 31, 2003. Total borrowings outstanding under the line of credit
 were 172,300 at December 31, 2004. The bank has informed the Company that
 the line will not be renewed. On March 25, 2005, the bank line of credit
 was amended to extend the due date until April 15, 2005 and reduce the
 line to 162,300. The Company is currently in negotiations with the bank
 to implement a payment plan that will amortize the debt over a 48-month
 period, with a new maturity date of April 15, 2006.

 The Company had a 200,000 annual revolving bank line of credit which
 expired on February 24, 2004 and had borne interest at the greater of 7 
 or prime plus 1.5 , not to exceed 18 , and was collateralized by all
 accounts receivable and general intangibles of the Company. Total
 borrowings outstanding under the line of credit were 139,314 at December
 31, 2003.

Related Parties

 On April 1, 2003, the Company entered into a 300,000 convertible
 revolving line-of-credit agreement (the Agreement) with DEMALE, LLC, an
 entity owned by certain stockholders of the Company. The lender may elect
 to convert all or any portion of the unpaid principal and interest owed
 under the line at the termination of the Agreement into shares of the
 Company's common stock at a conversion price equal to 80 of the fair
 market value on that date. The estimated fair value of the beneficial
 conversion terms related to this convertible line of credit amounted to
 67,150 and was recorded as a discount on the line of credit with an
 offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital. In connection with the
 Agreement, the Company issued 90,000 shares of restricted common stock and
 stock purchase warrants to purchase an additional 90,000 shares of
 restricted common stock as payment for loan origination costs. The line
 expires on June 30, 2005 and requires the Company, among other things, to
 maintain certain financial conditions. At December 31, 2004 and 2003,
 there was 223,600 and 54,600, respectively, borrowed against this line.
 The line is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets and is
 subordinated to the bank line of credit. Interest is accrued and payable
 quarterly at the greater of 7 or prime plus 1.5 (total interest rate of
 7.0 at December 31, 2004). At December 31, 2004 and 2003, accrued and
 unpaid interest was 12,560 and 1,733, respectively, and is included in
 the balance under the heading "Accrued liabilities." On February 7, 2005,
 the Board of Directors voted to amend the line and, effective March 31,
 2005, the line was amended to increase the line to 500,000 and extend the
 due date until June 30, 2007 or such earlier date as is mutually agreed
 upon by the Company and DEMALE. Additionally, in connection with the
 amendment, DEMALE right to convert any or all of the unpaid principal and
 interest into shares of the Company's common stock was set at the lesser
 of 0.14 per share, that price being equal to 80 of the fair market value
 as of the date of the amendment, or 80 of the fair market value as of the
 date of the actual conversion.

5. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

 Stock Compensation Plans

 At December 31, 2004, the Company has three stock-based compensation
 plans, which are described below. The Company applies Accounting
 Principles Board (APB) Opinion 25 and related interpretations in
 accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
 recognized. Had compensation cost for the Company's three stock-based
 compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the dates of
 awards under those plans consistent with the method of FASB Statement 123,
 the Company's net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share would have
 been as indicated below:

28

2004 2003 2002
 ------------ ----------- -------------
 
 Net Income (Loss):
 As Reported (1,123,612) 95,540 (282,357)
 Pro Forma (1,152,027) (10,345) (379,523)

 Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share:
 As Reported (0.34) 0.03 (0.09)
 Pro Forma (0.35) -- (0.12)

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
 weighted-average assumptions for grants in 2004, 2003, and 2002:

 2004 2003 2002
 ------------ ----------- -------------

 Dividend Yield 0 0 0 
 Expected Volatility 134 1328 128 
 Risk-Free Interest Rate 5.00 4.25 4.25 
 Expected Lives 5.0 years 9.0 years 8.8 years

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating
 the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and
 are freely transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
 input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
 volatility. Because the Company's employee stock options have
 characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and
 because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect
 the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do
 not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its
 employee stock options.

 1996 Equity Incentive Plan

 In September 1996, the Board of Directors authorized 1,000,000 shares of
 Common Stock for issuance under its 1996 Equity Incentive Plan ("1996
 Plan") as incentive stock options ("ISOs") or non-qualified stock options
 ("NQSOs"). On June 7, 2004, the Board of Directors voted to amend the 1996
 Plan to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock available
 for issuance from 1,000,000 shares to 1,200,000 shares. The Company grants
 ISOs only to employees. The Company grants NQSOs and restricted stock to
 persons who are employees of the Company and to non-employee directors
 under the 1996 Plan.

 The options are granted to purchase Common Stock at the fair market value
 on the grant date or at other prices as determined by the Board of
 Directors. The option-vesting period is determined at the time of each
 grant, and all options expire five to ten years from the grant date.

 1994 Stock Option and Grant Plan

 In April 1994, the Company authorized 700,000 shares of Common Stock for
 issuance under its 1994 Stock Option and Grant Plan ("1994 Plan") to
 employees, consultants and contractors of the Company. The Plan was
 amended in 2002 to permit grants to employees who were also members of the
 board of directors.

 The options are granted to purchase Common Stock at the fair market value
 on the date of grant or at other prices as determined by the Board of
 Directors ("the Board"). Options issued under the 1994 Plan become
 exercisable in one or more installments during its term and the right to
 exercise may be cumulative, as determined by the Board. Options expire as
 determined by the Board, but not more than 10 years after the date of
 grant.

 2,550,000 2,144,000
 =========== ===========

 The Company has net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax
 purposes of approximately 6,584,000. These carry forwards expire on
 varying dates through 2024.

7. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

 The Company has a Cash or Deferred Profit Sharing Plan ("the 401(k)
 Plan"). The 401(k) Plan is designed to qualify under Section 401(k) of the
 Internal Revenue Code and allows the Company to make discretionary
 contributions as determined by the Company's Board of Directors. For the
 years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company contributed
 2,954, 3,225, and 4,923 to the 401(k) Plan.

 The Company leases its executive offices under a noncancelable-operating
 lease, which expires in August 2008. Total rent expense for the years
 ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was 81,847, 76,352, and 89,306

 agreements for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
 respectively.

9. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

 All financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading. The
 following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
 each financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that
 value:

 Cash and Cash Equivalents

 The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity
 of those instruments.

 Debt

 The fair value of the Company's debt is estimated based on borrowing rates
 currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and
 maturities.

35

The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments at
 December 31, 2004 are as follows:

 Carrying
 Amount Fair Value
 ----------- -----------
 Assets:
 Cash and cash equivalents 50,503 50,503
 Receivables 82,244 82,244

 Liabilities:
 Accounts Payable 60,002 60,002
 Line of Credit-bank 172,300 172,300
 Line of Credit-related parties 197,772 223,600

 The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments at
 December 31, 2003 are as follows:

 Carrying
 Amount Fair Value
 ----------- -----------
 Assets:
 Cash and cash equivalents 143,505 143,505
 Receivables 628,848 628,848

 Liabilities:
 Accounts Payable 162,255 162,255
 Line of Credit-bank 139,314 139,314
 Line of Credit-related parties 54,600 54,600

10. SEGMENT INFORMATION

 The Company operates in one industry segment consisting of the development
 and marketing of electronic document image management and retrieval
 systems. The Company's technologies are managed as one segment because it
 offers similar products in similar markets and the factors determining
 strategic decisions are comparable for all products and markets.

 Sales to foreign markets totaled 35,471, 35,556, and 38,197 for the
 years ending December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

36

11. LIQUIDITY

 The Company's cash and cash equivalents decreased 93,002 during the year
 ended December 31, 2004 to approximately 51,000 at December 31, 2004.
 During 2004, the Company incurred cash expenditures for deferred
 development costs of approximately 267,000. As of December 31, 2004, the
 Company had deficit working capital of approximately 789,000. At December
 31, 2004, current liabilities included deferred revenue of approximately
 310,000, which will be earned throughout calendar year 2004 and does not
 require additional direct cash flow needs to be earned.

 At December 31, 2004, the Company's line of credit with a bank had a
 balance of 172,300 and the Company's line of credit with a related party
 had a balance of 223,600. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the bank
 notified the Company that it would not be renewing the line of credit in
 February, 2005. The line is collateralized by accounts receivable and
 general intangibles of the Company and bears interest at prime plus 1.75 
 not to exceed 18 . During March 2005, the bank line of credit was amended
 to extend the due date until April 15, 2005 and reduce the line to
 162,300. Currently, the Company is in negotiations with the bank to
 implement a payment plan that will amortize the debt over a 48-month
 period, with a new maturity date of April 15, 2006.

 Additionally, during March 2005, the related party line of credit was
 amended to extend the due date until June 30, 2007, or an earlier date as
 mutually agreed upon by the Company and DEMALE, and increase the line to
 500,000. The line is collateralized by all accounts receivable and
 general intangibles of the Company. As of December 31, 2004, the Company
 had no material commitments for capital expenditures to be made during
 calendar 2005.

 As a result of the Company's operating losses in 2004 and the 392,000
 award against it in the Reynolds arbitration, the Company's capital
 resources have been stretched to unprecedented lengths. The Company cannot
 bear any significant operating or other losses in 2005 if it is to
 survive. While preliminary indications are that the Company has not
 incurred such a significant loss in the first quarter of 2005, the Company
 still requires the continuing forbearance of its bank, which has already
 declined to renew the 162,000 owed on its line of credit, and the
 continued support of DEMALE, LLC, which the Company owes 468,000 as of
 March 31, 2005. There is no assurance that such forbearance or support
 will continue or that the Company will not incur additional operating
 losses. Accordingly, unless the Company can obtain additional capital to
 cover future losses, if the Company incurs additional losses or otherwise
 experiences negative cash flow, there is a substantial risk that the
 Company will not be able to continue as a going concern.

selected as an executive officer.

 Audit Committee Expert

 The Company does not have a "financial expert", as defined by the SEC's
rules under Sarbanes-Oxley, serving on the Committee because the Board of
Directors believes that all of the members of the Board, including but not
limited to those serving on the Audit Committee, have sufficient financial
knowledge, experience and sophistication to comprehend and critically analyze
the Company's financial statements and the audit thereof. Accordingly, the Board
has determined that adding a "financial expert" to the Board and the Audit
Committee at this time is not a necessary or productive expenditure of the
Company's limited resources.

 Codes of Ethics

 The Company has not yet adopted a code of ethics for its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer since they are the Company's
only two executive officers. The Board of Directors will continue to evaluate,
from time to time, whether a code of ethics should be developed and adopted. If
the Company does adopt a code of ethics in the future, in light of the Company's
modest size, it is likely to apply to all employees rather than only executive
officers.

 Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

 Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's executive
officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of the Common
Stock of the Company, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the exchange on which the Common
Stock is listed for trading. Those persons are required by regulations
promulgated under the Exchange Act to furnish the Company with copies of all
reports filed pursuant to Section 16(a). The Company believes that all Section
16(a) Securities and Exchange Commission filing requirements applicable to the
Company's executive officers and directors for calendar 2004 were timely met.

(1) The 1994 Stock Option and Grant Plan, which was adopted by the Company but
not approved by the Company's securities holders, was intended to provide
incentives for selected persons to promote the financial success and progress of
the Company by granting such persons options to purchase shares of Common Stock
of the Company, or through the award of shares of the Company's Common Stock.
The maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Plan is
700,000. The Plan is administered by the Board of Directors of the Company. The
Plan was amended in 2002 to permit grants to employees who were also members of
the Board. In addition, options for 20,000 shares were granted outside of the
1996 Equity Incentive Plan (which was approved by the shareholders) by the Board
of Directors on December 31, 2003. Those options are treated in all respects as
to terms and conditions as if they were granted under the 1996 Plan.

43

Employment Contracts

 Mr. DeYoung, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, is
employed pursuant to a three-year employment contract between the Company and
Mr. DeYoung, which has been extended and will expire on October 31, 2005. Since
November 1, 1999, the compensation of Mr. DeYoung has been established under the
terms of this employment contract. The contract calls for an annual base salary,
in an amount determined annually by the Board of Directors, payable
semi-monthly, plus expenses and normal fringe benefits. Mr. DeYoung earns a
bonus of 5 of the Company's pretax earnings, calculated on a quarterly basis.
An annual bonus may be paid to Mr. DeYoung based on the performance of the
Company and at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Mr. DeYoung's
employment contract provides that should his employment be terminated for any
reason other than for cause, he is entitled to a cash severance package equal to
one year's cash compensation. In addition, Mr. DeYoung is entitled to receive a
grant of a sufficient number of ten-year options as are necessary to permit him
to retain the same percentage of beneficial ownership interest in the Company as
he held on December 16, 1996. These grants would be made from the Company's
Equity Incentive Plan at the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date
of grant.

 Ms. DeYoung, the Company's Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial
Officer, is employed pursuant to three-year employment contract between the
Company and Ms. DeYoung which has been extended and will expire on October 31,
2005. Her compensation is established under the terms of this employment
contract. The contract calls for an annual base salary, expenses, normal fringe
benefits, as well as a bonus equal to 4 of the Company's pretax earnings,

provides that should her employment be terminated for any reason other than for

compensation.

 DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION

 The Company currently pays non-employee Directors 1,500 per quarter plus
specific hourly fees for special meetings or additional participation as a
director. Any director who serves on the Compensation Committee automatically
receives 4,000 options on the last trading day in June pursuant to the Company's
1996 Equity Incentive Option Plan. Accordingly, on June 30, 2004, Messrs.
Wiegand & Lehman, as members of the Compensation Committee, received fully
vested ten year options to purchase 4,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise
price of 0.59 per share, the closing price on the date of grant.

 Change of Control

 As a result of transaction described in the following Item 13. Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions, and in the Company's Form 8-K filed on
April 7, 2005, describing the Amendment to the Company's Revolving Credit
Agreement with DEMALE, LLC, the private lender controlled by affiliates of the
Company, to increase the line of credit by 200,000 to 500,000 and the fixing
of the maximum conversion price at 0.14 per share, DEMALE is now the beneficial
owner of at least 3,571,429 shares, or 52.0 of the outstanding shares as
calculated under Rule 13d-3(a).

46

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

 On April 30, 2003, the Company closed on a Revolving Credit Loan Agreement
dated effective April 1, 2003 (the "Agreement") with DEMALE, LLC, a Colorado
limited liability company ("DEMALE"), under which DEMALE agreed to provide the
Company with a line of credit up to 300,000. At that time, DEMALE had three
members, David R. DeYoung, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer,
and John G. Mazza and Spencer D. Lehman, both Directors and more than 10 
shareholders. At closing, each of Messrs. DeYoung, Mazza and Lehman received
30,000 shares of Common Stock based on the closing bid price of 0.23 on April
1, 2003, and a warrant to purchase up to an additional 30,000 shares of Common
Stock at 0.18 per share, which price was set by reference to 80 of the closing
bid price on April 1, 2003. In addition, the amount of any outstanding and
unpaid principal and interest on the line of credit could be converted, at
DEMALE's option, into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price
equal to 80 of the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of
conversion. At December 31, 2004, the Company had been advanced 223,600 under
the DEMALE line of credit. On March 31, 2005 Gold King Investments LLC became an
equal member of DEMALE. Mr. Robert Wiegand II, a member of the Company's Board
of Directors, holds a minority interest in Gold King Investments LLC. On March
31, 2005, DEMALE agreed to raise the line to 500,000 and extend the due date to
June 30, 2007. In addition, the conversion price of the debt has been changed to
the lesser of .14 or 80 of the fair market value. Conversion of the debt into
equity is at the option of DEMALE.

 As a result of the amendment of the DEMALE line of credit agreement and
the increase of the amount drawn by the Company under that line of credit to
 468,000 plus interest as of March 31, 2005, DEMALE is now the beneficial owner
of at least 3,571,429 shares, or 52.0 of the outstanding shares as calculated
under Rule 13d-3(a).

 Management of the Company is of the opinion that the terms and conditions
of the foregoing transactions were no less favorable for the Company than could
be obtained from unaffiliated third parties.
