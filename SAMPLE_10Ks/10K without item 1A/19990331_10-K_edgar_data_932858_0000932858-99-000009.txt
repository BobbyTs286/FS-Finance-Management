ITEM 14 EXHIBIT #2

 Report of Independent Accountants

March 22, 1999

To the Board of Directors and Stockholder
of Residential Funding Corporation

We have examined management's assertion about Residential Funding Corporation's
(the "Company") compliance with their minimum servicing standards in their role
as Master Servicer as of and for the year ended December 31, 1998 included in
the accompanying management assertion. Such assertions were examined relating to
those mortgage loans included in the listing of mortgage loans and series of
certificates included in the attached Exhibit 1. Our testing procedures were
applied only to the series of certificates serviced on or before September 30,
1998. Direct servicing functions are performed by various subservicers.
Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with their minimum
servicing standards. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's
assertion about the entity's compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with their
minimum servicing standards and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Loans and series of certificates
subject to such procedures were selected using sampling methods, and
accordingly, we make no representation that our examination procedures were
performed on a specific loan or series of certificates as listed in the attached
Exhibit 1. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's
compliance with their minimum servicing standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned minimum servicing standards as of and for the year ended December
31, 1998 is fairly stated, in all material respects.
