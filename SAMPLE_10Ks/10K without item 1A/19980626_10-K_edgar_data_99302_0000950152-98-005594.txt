Item 1. Business
- -----------------

Transmation, Inc., the "Company", an Ohio corporation organized in 1964, is
primarily engaged in the sale and distribution, development, manufacture and
service of electronic instrumentation which is used principally for measurement,
indication and transmission of information. The principal products sold and
serviced by Transmation fall within two main categories:

 Test, measurement and calibration equipment - Instruments used
 for calibrating, measuring and testing many physical
 parameters in industry and science. These products are
 manufactured by Transmation or by other manufacturers and are
 distributed and serviced by Transmation.

 Process monitoring instrumentation - A line of instrumentation
 which measures low level signals, proportional to some
 parameter such as temperature, and then amplifies the
 measurement to permit transmission to a receiving device which
 may be used to alter the process or trigger an alarm. Certain
 of these products may be used to monitor one or more points of
 a process by multiplexing information into one or more digital
 devices. These products are manufactured, distributed and
 serviced by Transmation.

Products and services sold range in price from 100 for a single calibration
service to more than 200,000 for a large multiplexing system.

The principal market for Transmation's products and services is within the
process industry and is primarily directed to the petroleum refining and
chemical manufacturing industries, and secondarily to the pulp and paper, gas
pipeline and primary metals industries. Transmation's sales are accomplished
through a catalog distribution division, the Transcat Division ("Transcat"), a
manufacturing division, the Instrument Division, a manufacturing subsidiary,
Altek Industries Corp. ("Altek"), and four foreign sales subsidiaries.

Sales of test, measurement and calibration equipment and services are
principally made through Transcat, which sells through a catalog distributed to
existing and prospective customers, and through salespeople in selected
locations in the United States and Canada. Transcat sells
Transmation-manufactured products and re-sells the products of approximately 200
other manufacturers through an annual catalog, which is currently approximately
550 pages. To date, more than one million catalogs have been distributed through
this part of Transmation's sales and marketing effort. In addition to the annual
catalog, Transcat makes periodic mailings to existing and prospective customers
to spur additional sales as well as to generate names for future catalog or
product mailings.

In addition to catalog sales, Transmation engages in direct sales of test,
measurement and calibration equipment and services as well as process monitoring
instrumentation. The Company employs over 30 direct sales people in Transcat and
four sales managers in the Instrument Division and Altek. Two sales people are
employed in Australia to manage Far Eastern sales representative or distributor
organizations and to direct sell in Australia. The Company also maintains one
regional sales manager in Singapore. In addition, the Company has arrangements
with over 60 sales representative and distributor organizations, each employing
one or more sales engineers, located in other areas of concentrated demand for
Transmation's products in the United States, Canada, the Far East, Central and
South America, Australia, the Middle East and Eastern and Western Europe. These
sales representatives and distributors either promote Transmation's products on
a commission basis or purchase them from Transmation at a discount and resell to
end users at a gross price.

The Company's Transcat CalXpress operations, which are ISO 9002 registered,
provide periodic calibration and repair services for customers owning
instrumentation manufactured by others and by Transmation. At March 31, 1998,
there were Transcat CalXpress facilities in 14 locations in the United States
and Canada.

The Company's two manufacturing operations, both located in Rochester, New York,
primarily develop, manufacture and sell electronic and pneumatic instrumentation
used to calibrate and test instrumentation used primarily in the process
industries. The Instrument Division's facility has ISO 9001 registration.

The Company's value added operations, which customize, modify and repair analog
gauges, are located in Dayton, Ohio and Baltimore, Maryland.

Since the beginning of fiscal 1997, Transmation has expanded its business
through two acquisitions:

 Altek Acquisition. In April 1996, the Company acquired all of the stock
of Altek, a manufacturer of electronic calibration equipment, for cash and notes
aggregating 4.8 million, and 300,000 shares of Common Stock. As a result of
this acquisition, the Company's sales have increased by more than 5 million
annually.

 EIL Acquisition. In April 1997, the Company acquired substantially all
of the assets of the Sales and Service Divisions of E.I.L. Instruments, Inc. a
distributor and servicer of electronic test, measurement and calibration
instrumentation, for 22 million in cash and the value of certain assumed
liabilities. As a result of this acquisition, the Company has added a
significant base of potential new customers, a value added meter modification
business and several new product lines, and has significantly increased its
overall capabilities to provide repair, calibration and certification services.

 Transmation's future performance will depend substantially on its
ability to integrate and manage its acquired businesses and operations, to
respond to competitive developments, to further develop markets for its products
and services, and to anticipate future customer needs and to provide solutions
for customers in a timely, cost-effective manner.

 The Company's principal executive offices are located at 10 Vantage
Point Drive, Rochester, New York 14624. Its telephone number is (716) 352-7777.

 The following information is set forth as it is deemed material to an
understanding of the business of the registrant:

 COMPETITION. The market to which the Company sells the products it
manufactures is highly competitive, and the Company expects that competition
will increase in the future. Failure to keep pace with rapid technological
advances, which characterize the industry, could adversely affect the Company's
competitive position with respect to the products it manufactures and the way it
distributes its products. In its manufacturing operations, the Company competes
on the basis of price, performance, inventory availability, quality, reliability
and customer service and support. To maintain its competitive position with
respect to manufactured product, the Company must continue to develop new
products, periodically enhance its existing products, reduce its cost of
manufacturing such products, maintain the quality of its products and compete
effectively in the areas described above. Although the Company believes that its
products are competitive in each of the above-described areas, there can be no
assurance that existing or future competitors, some of which have greater
financial resources than the Company, will not introduce comparable or superior
products incorporating more advanced technology at lower prices. The Company's
competitors are numerous, ranging from large corporations to many relatively
small and highly specialized firms. Although no single company competes in all

4
 5

of the Company's product markets, some of the major competitors which compete in
the Company's individual product markets include Fluke Corporation, Beta (a
division of Hathaway Corporation) and certain divisions of Ametek Corporation.
Some of these competitors have more extensive sales, distribution, engineering,
manufacturing and/or marketing capabilities and substantially greater financial,
technological and personnel resources than does the Company.

 The markets to which the Company, through Transcat, sells products and
related services is also highly competitive. Competition for sales in
distribution and service is quite fragmented and ranges from large, well
financed national distributors to small local distribution organizations and
service providers, as well as the manufacturers of the products themselves.
Transcat competes on the basis of price, inventory availability, service quality
and customer service and support. To maintain its competitive position with
respect to such products and services, the Company must continually demonstrate
to customers its commitment to achieving the highest level of performance
possible for a distributor and compete effectively in the areas described above.

Significant Customers
 ---------------------

 There were no sales to any customer or controlled group which amounted
to 10 percent or more of the Company's consolidated net sales during the years
1998-1996, nor is the Company dependent on a single customer or a few customers,
the loss of any one or more of which would have a material adverse effect on the
Company.

 Backlog
 -------

 At the close of the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998, Transmation had a
firm order backlog of approximately 2,485,000 as compared to 1,460,000 in 1997
and 1,347,000 in 1996.

 It is anticipated that 100 percent of Transmation's backlog existing on
March 31, 1998 will be filled by shipments in fiscal year 1999. Transmation's
cycle of sales to delivery at the present time is 1 day to 12 weeks on all
product categories except for process monitoring systems, where the cycle is
10-40 weeks. However, backlog has generally not been a significant factor in
Transmation's business.

 Seasonality
 -----------

 Transmation does not believe that its line of business has any
significant seasonal factor.

 Raw Materials
 -------------

 Finished products required for the Transcat division's catalog sales
are generally available from only one source per product (the manufacturer)
although on occasion substitutions of product are possible. Additionally, while
the raw materials and components essential to Transmation's manufacturing
business are available from a number of sources of supply, a portion of the
Company's manufacturing operations is dependent on the ability to deliver
completed products, sub-assemblies or components in time to meet critical
distribution and manufacturing schedules. In certain instances, important parts
and components are available through fewer suppliers than Transmation deems
suitable. If such suppliers should fail in deliveries, delays in Transmation's
production could result which in turn could have a material adverse effect on
the Company's business, prospects, results of operations and financial
condition. Periodically, Transmation has experienced delays in obtaining certain
parts and components or finished products. Such delays are primarily
attributable to demand for parts or products and long lead times. In order to
minimize such delays, Transmation has placed scheduled blanket purchase orders,
has sought out alternate sources of supply, has provided vendors with greater
lead time in filling such orders and has placed certain finished product in its
inventory. 

5
 6

Transmation believes that such delays have not had a material adverse effect on
its business to date, although it cannot predict what effect such delays may
have in the future.

 Patents
 -------

 The Company's success and ability to compete depends in part upon
protecting its proprietary rights in its products, its name and its trade names.
There can be no assurance that the measures taken by the Company will be
adequate to deter misappropriation of its products, its name and its trade names
or independent third-party development of its products, or that its intellectual
property rights can be successfully enforced or defended if challenged. Given
the continuing development of technology, there can be no assurance that certain
aspects of the Company's products do not or will not infringe upon the existing
or future proprietary rights of others or that, if licenses or rights are
required to avoid infringement, such licenses or rights could be obtained on
terms that would not have a material adverse effect on the Company, if at all.

 It is the opinion of management that the obtaining of patent protection
is not essential to the conduct of Transmation's business. Transmation has,
however, sought patent protection for its manufactured products in certain
instances and presently holds several United States patents, the most recent of
which was granted in 1994; patents expire at various dates through 2012.
Transmation believes that the patents obtained provide a short-term marketing
benefit, particularly when marketing products against similar products produced
by competitors. However, Transmation does not believe that the patents have a
significant impact on its business.

 Transmation has registered numerous trademarks in the United States
Patent and Trademark Office, including Transcat(R), Quick-Cal(R), CalXpress(R)
and Shop Access(R).

 Research and Development
 ------------------------

 During the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998, Transmation expended
approximately 1,660,110 in research and development as compared with an
approximate expenditure of 1,560,974 in 1997 and 1,099,508 in 1996. The
research and development costs in fiscal 1998 reflected the Company's efforts in
all of its product lines in its Instrument Division and Altek subsidiary.

 Research and Development is Company sponsored. Approximately 26 of its
employees and several consultants are engaged in product development. All such
employees hold technical degrees.

 Many of the instruments which the Company designs and manufactures are
used in the petroleum refining and chemical manufacturing industries. The
tolerance for error in the design, manufacture or use of these products may be
small or non-existent. If an instrument designed or manufactured by the Company
is found to be defective, whether due to design or manufacturing defects,
improper use of the product or other reasons, the instrument may need to be
recalled, possibly at the Company's expense. Furthermore, the adverse effect of
a product recall on the Company might not be limited to the cost of the recall
to the Company. Recalls, especially if accompanied by unfavorable publicity or
termination of customer contracts, could result in substantial costs, loss of
revenues and diminution of the Company's reputation, each of which could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, the manufacture and sale of the
instruments manufactured by the Company also involves the risk of product
liability claims. The Company evaluates its insurance coverage from time to time
in view of developments in its business and products currently under
development. Product liability insurance is expensive and, in the future, may
not be available on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all. A
successful claim brought against the Company in excess of its insurance coverage

6
 7

or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied or limited could
have a material adverse effects on the Company's business, prospects, results of
operations and financial condition.

 Employees
 ---------

 Transmation employed 407 persons (including 3 part-time employees) as
of March 31, 1998 in all aspects of its business. At March 31, 1997, Transmation
employed 250 persons of which 2 were part-time. The EIL acquisition on April 4,
1997 increased Transmation's number of employees to 496. At March 31, 1996, the
Company employed 211 persons of which 3 were part-time. None of Transmation's
employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements.

 Since April 1996, the Company has acquired one manufacturing business
and one business engaged in the distribution and service of products. This has
resulted in a 150 increase in the Company's work force, the addition of one
manufacturing facility, the addition of three value added operations and the
addition of ten service facilities. The Company is in the process of integrating
the acquired operations and efforts are underway to assimilate into Transmation
the products and services formerly sold independently by the acquired
businesses, their operations, corporate cultures, product lines, personnel,
management information systems, financial control systems, facilities
infrastructure and customer relationships. There can be no assurance that the
Company will be successful in these efforts. If the Company is unable to
integrate and manage all of the elements of these acquisitions effectively and
efficiently, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, if the Company continues to experience rapid growth, a significant
strain may be placed on its financial, management and other resources. The
Company's ability to manage growth effectively will require it to continue to
improve its operational and financial control systems, infrastructure and
management information systems, and to attract, train, motivate, manage and
retain key employees. There can be no assurance that the Company will be
successful in doing so. Failure to manage its growth effectively could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of
operations and financial condition.

 Environmental Matters
 ---------------------

 Registrant does not believe that compliance with Federal, State or
local provisions relating to the protection of the environment have any material
effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Information as to classes of similar products:

 ---- ---- ----
 
 Test, Measurement & Calibration Equipment
 and Service 97.9 94.2 93.3

 Process Monitoring Instrumentation
 and Service 2.1 5.8 6.7

The change in sales mix from 1997 to 1998 and from 1996 to 1997 is
primarily the result of increased sales of resale product and service of test,
measurement and calibration equipment to the U.S. marketplace resulting from
increases in the number of company employed sales personnel in the Company's
Transcat division and from significant catalog mailings to customers and
prospective customers during fiscal 1998-1996 in the Company's Transcat
division. Additionally, all sales resulting from the Company's Altek Industries
Corp. subsidiary, acquired on April 3, 1996, were of calibration products and
sales which resulted from the Company's acquisition of the sales and service
division of EIL Instruments in April 1997 were of service and calibration
products.

 Information Regarding Export Sales
 ----------------------------------

 Approximately 19.1 percent of Transmation's sales in 1998 resulted from
sales in foreign countries. This compares with 27.8 percent of sales in 1997 and
20.7 percent of sales in 1996. In 1998, the percentage of foreign sales
decreased as compared to 1997 as the result of the Company's acquisition of the
assets of EIL Instruments. The EIL business acquired was and is primarily
conducted in the U.S. The increase in 1997 compared to 1996 is primarily the
result of increased sales in the international marketplace of products
distributed through the Company's Transcat division. Sales in foreign countries
generate relatively the same profit margins as domestic sales. Management
believes that the relative lower value of the dollar compared to foreign
currencies that existed for several years through 1997 had a positive effect on
international sales. During fiscal 1998, many Asian currencies weakened
significantly compared to the U.S. dollar. The Company believes the stronger
U.S. dollar contributed to reduced sales in 1998; below levels which would
otherwise have been anticipated from Asian markets. Those markets are areas of
significant market potential for the Company. Management believes that continued
weakness in Asian currencies will continue to have a negative influence on our
future sales to Asia although it is impossible to predict the magnitude of such
impact. In addition, Transmation's revenues are subject to the customary risks
of operating in an international environment, including the potential imposition
of trade or foreign exchange restrictions, tariff and other tax increases,
fluctuations in exchange rates and unstable political situations, any one or
more of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

 The information contained in Notes 2 and 3 to the Financial Statements
of this report is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 2. Properties
- -------------------------

Transmation's manufacturing operation is housed in owned facilities located at
977 Mt. Read Boulevard, Rochester, New York comprising 26,800 square feet of
plant, storage and office space.

In addition, Transmation has leased an additional 19,000 square feet of space in
Rochester. This space is being used for certain executive, administrative,
sales, service and manufacturing purposes. The lease for this space will expire
in October, 2002.

Transmation also leases an additional 9,500 square feet which houses the
operations of its Altek subsidiary. This lease will expire in fiscal 2000.

Various sales office and CalXpress space is leased by the Company and its
subsidiary, Transmation (Canada), Inc., and is considered adequate to meet both
present and future needs in those locations. (See Note 7 to the Financial
Statements.)

Generally, Transmation's present facilities are being fully utilized and are
considered suitable for its current needs and there is no present requirement
for significant additional space. Any expansion or change in business facilities
as the result of a consolidation of manufacturing operations will be made in the
future if necessary.

Net Sales
- ---------

The 66 sales increase in 1998 was attributable to the Company's acquisition of
the assets of the Sales and Service divisions of E.I.L. Instruments Inc. in
April 1997.

The sales increase in 1997 of 23 is attributable to the Company's acquisition
of Altek Industries Corp. in April 1996 and to increased sales of products and
services by the Company's Transcat division in fiscal 1997. The effect of having
added salesmen in areas of significant market concentration in Transcat during
fiscal 1996, together with improved customer mail list techniques, resulted in
improved market penetration and increased sales in 1997 compared to 1996.

Cost of Product Sold
- --------------------

Cost of product sold increased by 86 in 1998 compared to 1997. This increase
resulted from proportionately greater sales through the Company's Transcat
division in 1998 compared to 1997. Gross margins on distribution and service
sales achieved through the Company's Transcat division are lower than in the
Company's manufacturing division.

Costs of product sold increased by 18 but as a percentage of sales decreased by
2.7 in 1997 compared to 1996. The improvement in 1997 is the result of the
addition of high margin Altek products to Transmation's sales and of
improvements in gross margins of both resale and service billings in the
Company's Transcat division.

Selling and Administrative Expenses
- -----------------------------------

Selling and administrative expenses in 1998 increased by 41 compared to 1997
but as a percentage of sales fell to 24.4 from 28.7 . The increased spending
was the result of increases in sales and marketing related costs which were
added as the result of the Company's April 1997 acquisition of the Sales and
Service divisions of E.I.L. Instruments Inc. Additionally, goodwill amortization
resulting from acquisitions totaled 1,007,000 in 1998 compared to

11
 12

 313,600 in 1997. Overall, economies of scale resulted in lower total sales and
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 1998 compared to 1997.

Selling and administrative expenses increased by 25 in 1997 compared to 1996;
however, as a percentage of sales, the increase is .6 . Increased spending
represents the full year effect of direct salespeople added in the Company's
Transcat division in areas of significant market potential. Additionally,
amortization of goodwill totaling 313,600 resulting from Transmation's April
1996 acquisition of Altek Industries Corp. is included in 1997 costs and there
were no similar costs in 1996.

Research and Development
- ------------------------

Research and development costs increased by 6 in 1998 compared to 1997.
Spending in this area is considered appropriate to enable the Company to
maintain its strong competitive position in the marketplace.

Research and development costs increased by 42 in 1997 compared to 1996. This
increase is the result of the acquisition of Altek Industries Corp. by the
Company in April 1996.

Interest Expense
- ----------------

Interest expense increased by 301 in 1998 compared to 1997. This increase is
the result of financing the Company's acquisition of the assets of the Sales and
Service divisions of E.I.L. Instruments in April 1997.

Interest expense increased by 90 in 1997 compared to 1996. This increase is the
result of financing the Company's acquisition of Altek Industries Corp. in April
1996.

Other Income
- ------------

Other income in 1997 is comprised primarily of the sale of land. The Company
sold a parcel of land it owned in a Rochester suburb which did not have a part
in the Company's future plans, resulting in a one-time net gain of 479,000.

Income Taxes
- ------------

The Company's effective tax rate was 39.2 of pretax profits in 1998 compared to
37.2 of profits in 1997. The higher tax rate in 1998 compared to 1997 is
primarily the result of the necessity to file returns in additional states as
the result of the Company's acquisition of the assets of the Sales and Service
divisions of E.I.L. Instruments in April 1997.

The Company's effective tax rate was 37.2 of pretax profits in 1997 compared to
32.6 of pretax profits in 1996. In 1997 and 1996 the Company used tax benefits
from foreign subsidiaries which will become available against future tax
liabilities in the determination of its income tax expense.

Impact of Inflation
- -------------------

The effects of inflation have not been significant to Transmation during
1998-1996 because inflation rates have been relatively low.

Year 2000 Issue
- ---------------

The Company has reviewed all of its current computer applications with respect
to the Year 2000 issue. The Company believes all of its relevant applications
are Year 2000 compliant and that no material costs with respect to Year 2000
compliance will be incurred by the Company. The Company is unable to determine
the effects of the Year 2000 compliance issue, if any, by its suppliers and
customers.

Operating Activities
- --------------------

Net cash from operations totaled 2,852,000 in 1998, an increase of 1,291,000
from 1997. Although net income decreased by 1,062,000 in 1998 compared to 1997,
depreciation and amortization increased by 1,701,000, trade accounts receivable
were reduced by 701,000 from amounts outstanding one year ago (after giving
consideration to receivables purchased in the EIL asset acquisition).
Inventories increased by 643,000 in 1998 and trade accounts payable increased
by 295,000 as an offset to the inventory increase. Other liabilities,
principally interest which resulted from additional borrowings in 1998 compared
to 1997 as the result of the EIL acquisition, increased by 793,000 in 1998 vs
1997. Income taxes payable were 454,000 lower in 1998 compared to 1997 due to
Transmation's lower profitability in 1998 vs 1997.

Net cash from operations totaled 1,561,000 in 1997 which was down by
approximately 688,000 from cash generated from operations in 1996. Net Income
in 1997 increased by 825,000 compared to 1996 and depreciation and amortization
increased by 521,000 in 1997 versus 1996. The effect of these cash generators
was offset in 1997 by an increase in accounts receivable of 776,000 and in
inventories of 457,000 which were the result of increased business through the
Company's Transcat division and of its purchase in April 1996 of the stock of
Altek Industries Corp.

Investing Activities
- --------------------

Cash used in investing activities totaled 24,084,000 in 1998 compared to
 5,088,000 in 1997. The Company invested 22,000,000 in its purchase of the
sales and service divisions of EIL Instruments in April 1997 and 6,637,500 in
its purchase of Altek Industries Corp in April 1996. Capital assets acquired
totaled 2,084,000 in 1998 compared to 815,000 in 1997.

Financing Activities
- --------------------

Financing activities generated 16,999,000 more cash in 1998 than in 1997.
 21,109,000 of additional bank debt was added in 1998 to finance the Company's
operations, acquire the assets of the former sales and service divisions of EIL
Instruments and to repay 600,000 of debt related to the Company's April 1996
acquisition of Altek Industries Corp. During 1998, employees and directors
exercised options and warrants which provided 261,000 more cash to the Company
as the result of such transactions in 1998 compared to 1997.

During 1997, financing activities generated 5,821,000 more cash than in 1996.
In addition, 1,838,000 worth of Company stock was issued as partial payment for
the stock of Altek Industries Corp., an additional 36,000 of stock was sold to
employees and directors under various stock option and warrant plans in 1997
versus 1996, and 5,184,000 of additional bank and other debt was added in 1997
compared to 1996 to finance the Company's operations and to acquire the stock of
Altek Industries Corp.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders of
Transmation, Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Transmation, Inc. and its subsidiaries at March 31, 1998 and 1997, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended March 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 1998, 1997, AND 1996
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
- ---------------------------------------------------

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from these estimates.

Principles of Consolidation

The financial statements include the accounts of wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Foreign Operations

The accounts of Transmation's foreign subsidiaries are maintained in the local
currency of the countries in which they operate and have been translated to U.S.
dollars in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
52. Accordingly, accounts representing assets and liabilities, except for
long-term intercompany and equity accounts, have been translated at the year-end
rates of exchange and related revenue and expense accounts have been translated
at average rates of exchange during the year. Gains and losses arising from
translation of subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars are recorded
directly to the accumulated translation adjustment component of stockholders'
equity. Currency gains and losses on business transactions are included in net
income. In 1998, transaction losses totaled 59,303, in 1997 and 1996,
transaction gains totaled 1,336 and 20,652 respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of standard cost or market. Standard costs
approximate the average cost method of inventory valuation.

Depreciation and Amortization

The cost of properties is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis. For income tax
purposes, depreciation is determined by accelerated methods as permitted under
tax regulations. Additions and betterments are capitalized; maintenance and
repairs are charged to income. The cost and accumulated depreciation of assets
retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the accounts and any
resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to income. Leasehold improvements
are amortized over the terms of the related leases.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for certain income and expense items differently for
financial reporting purposes than for income tax reporting purposes. Deferred
income taxes are provided in recognition of these temporary differences.

21
 22

Deferred Catalog Costs

Costs relating to mail order catalogs are amortized over a two-year period
beginning in the month of distribution. Such amortization periods approximate
the estimated productive life of a catalog. Prepaid expenses and deferred
charges at March 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996 consist principally of the unamortized
balance of costs associated with the catalogs. Catalog costs expensed in 1998,
1997, and 1996 were 1,059,418, 1,040,716, and 1,240,752 respectively.

Fiscal Year

The Company operates within a conventional 52 week accounting fiscal year ending
on March 31 of each year.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over fair value of assets
acquired at the time subsidiaries were purchased. The excess acquisition cost is
being amortized over 20 years on a straight-line basis. The Company evaluates
the carrying value of the excess acquisition costs of its subsidiaries whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. The carrying value of excess acquisition costs is considered
impaired when the projected undiscounted future cash flows from the related
business unit is less than its carrying value. The Company measures impairment
based on the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair market value. Fair
market value is determined primarily using the projected future cash flows
discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.

Stock Options

The Company follows the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," to account for its stock
option and warrant activity in the financial statements. The Company granted all
options currently outstanding at an exercise price equal to the market price at
the date of grant and, therefore, under APB 25, no compensation expense is
recorded. The Company follows the disclosure provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation."

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Management is unaware of any litigation which is likely to result in any
material adverse impact on the Company.

24
 25

requires 21 consecutive quarterly installment payments which commenced January
1, 1998. Interest is payable on a formula basis, at the Company's option, at
rates above prime or above LIBOR determined on the basis of Company performance
as determined by its leverage ratio. On March 31, 1998, interest to be paid
under the Term Loan was at 2.50 above LIBOR or 1.00 above the bank's prime
lending rate. At March 31, 1998, 10,322,922 was borrowed under the Revolving
Credit portion of the Company's credit facility. The term of the Revolving
Credit facility, dated April 4, 1997, extends through January 4, 2001. Interest
is payable under the revolving credit facility on a formula basis, at the
Company's option, at rates above prime or above LIBOR determined on the basis of
Company performance as determined by its leverage ratio. On March 31, 1998,
interest to be paid under the Revolving Credit Agreement was at 2.25 above
LIBOR or .75 above the bank's prime lending rate. At March 31, 1998, interest

Note 8 - Stockholders' Equity
- -----------------------------

In August 1993, an incentive Stock Option plan was adopted. This plan was
amended and restated in August 1995, 1996 and 1997. Options are available to be
granted to employees under the 1993 Plan at prices not less than fair market
value at the date of grant and are exercisable in annual installments beginning
at the date of grant and expiring up to ten years later. A plan adopted in
August 1981 has now expired; however, certain options under that plan were
exercised during 1997.

The following table summarizes the transactions under the plans during 1998,
1997, and 1996:

On August 21, 1984, shareholders approved the Directors' Warrant Plan. This Plan
was amended and restated in August 1995. The Plan provides that warrants may be
granted to non-employee directors of Transmation to purchase in the aggregate
not more than 200,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The purchase price
for shares issued under the Directors' Warrant Plan shall be equal to the fair
market value of the stock on the date of the grant of the warrant. A summary of
activity under the 1984 Directors' Warrant Plan is as follows:

On August 15, 1995, the Board of Directors granted the then President of the
Company's Transcat Division a non-qualified stock option to purchase 47,900
shares of the Company's common stock at 3.13 per share, the fair market value
at the date of the grant. These shares are exercisable in equal annual
installments beginning at the date of the grant and expiring five years later.

During 1997, the Company adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." SFAS No. 123 introduced a fair value
method of accounting for stock-based compensation. To calculate the fair value
of the options and warrants awarded, the Company elected to use the
Black-Scholes pricing model which produced a weighted average fair value of
options granted of 3.90, 4.65 and 2.35 in 1998, 1997 and 1996 respectively.

The following assumptions were used in the pricing model: a weighted average
expected option life of five years; an annualized volatility rate of 54.4 for
1998, 58.6 for 1997, and 63.6 for 1996; a weighted average risk-free rate of
return of 6.64 in 1998, 6.31 in 1997, and 6.37 for 1996; and no dividends in
any year. The Company elected to account for terminations when they occur rather
than include an attrition factor into its model.

If compensation cost had been measured based on the fair-value based accounting
method under SFAS 123, the following would have been disclosed for March 31:

1998 1997 1996
 ------------- ------------- -------------
 
 Pro Forma
 Net (Loss)Income 458,150) 746,932 1,071,103
 Earnings Per Share
 Basic .08) .13 .22
 Diluted .08) .13 .21

The effect of applying SFAS 123 in the current year is not representative of the
effect on income for future years since each subsequent year will reflect
expense for additional year's vesting.

On June 23, 1997, the Company declared a two-for-one stock split effected in the
form of a 100 stock dividend to shareholders of record on July 22, 1997.
Accordingly, 1,426,846 was transferred from Capital in Excess of Par Value to
Common Stock, representing the par value of additional shares issued. All
references in the consolidated financial statements referring to shares, share
prices, per share amounts and stock plans have been adjusted retroactively for
the two-for-one stock split.

Note 9 - Net Earnings Per Share
- -------------------------------

In 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share," which requires
disclosure of basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is
computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the assumed conversion of
dilutive stock options and warrants. In computing the per share effect of
assumed conversion, funds which would have been received from the exercise of
options and warrants are considered to have been used to purchase common shares
at average market prices for the period, and the resulting net additional common

27
 28

shares are included in the calculation of average common shares outstanding. All
previously reported earnings per share amounts were restated upon adoption of
SFAS No. 128.

The table below summarizes the amounts used to calculate basic and diluted
earnings per share:

Certain anti-dilutive outstanding stock options and warrants were excluded from
the calculation of average shares outstanding since their exercise prices
exceeded the average market price of common shares during the period. The
anti-dilutive stock options and warrants so excluded at the end of each of the
last three years and their associated exercise prices are summarized below. The
options expire at various times between 1999 and 2002.

During 1998, 1997, and 1996, 17,900, 14,200 and 45,100 respectively of a
foreign valuation allowance was recognized due to the increase in the likelihood
that benefits will be recognized. Management believes net deferred tax assets
are more likely than not to be recognized.

On February 28, 1995, William J. Berk, former President of Transmation, Inc.
retired. In accordance with terms of a deferred compensation agreement between
the Company and Mr. Berk, payments due under such agreement commenced on March
1, 1995. Mr. Berk is entitled to annual payments amounting to 96,456 for life.
His wife will receive 60 of the annual benefit for her lifetime should she
survive him. This deferred compensation agreement was not funded and the
estimated present value of the future benefits was recorded as an expense and a
liability over the term of Mr. Berk's actual employment. There were no charges
to expense for retirement benefits to be paid to Mr. Berk under his now expired
employment contract during 1996-1998.

Note 13 - Deferred Profit Sharing

to a contributory defined contribution plan and renamed the Transmation, Inc.
Long-Term Savings and Deferred Profit Sharing Plan. All United States employees
of Transmation, Inc. are eligible to participate in the plan providing certain
qualifications are met. Employer contributions are made to the plan at the
discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company. Payments of benefits
accrued for plan participants will be made upon retirement or upon termination
of employment prior to retirement providing certain conditions have been met by
the employee prior to termination. There were no company profit sharing
contributions made under this plan in any of the periods 1996-1998.

instruments using available market information and appropriate valuation
methodologies as follows:

 Cash and accounts receivable:
 The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash
 and receivables approximate their fair value.

 Long-term debt:
 The carrying amount of debt under the Company's floating rate
 revolving credit agreement with a bank approximates it fair
 value.

and compensation (if any) in the form of stock or options to purchase stock)
payable to the Employee by the Corporation during the 12 months immediately
preceding the date of termination specified in Section 9(a)(iv) hereof (the

within 30 days following the Termination Date unless and to the extent that the
Employee determines otherwise. For purposes of calculating the cash amount of
such severance payment, any such compensation that had been payable to the
Employee other than in cash shall be valued at its fair market value on the date
it was payable.

 EXHIBIT 10 (d)

 NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

THIS NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT is made as of April 21, 1998
by and between TRANSMATION, INC., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), and BARRY
F. WHARITY (the "Optionee").

 The parties agree as follows:

 1. GRANT OF OPTION. The Company hereby grants to the Optionee an option
(the "Option") to purchase an aggregate of 25,000 Shares under the terms and
conditions hereof. As used in this Agreement, the term "Shares" shall mean
shares of the Company's common stock, par value .50 per share (the "Common
Stock"), or other securities resulting from an adjustment under Section 9.

 2. TERM. The Option shall become exercisable and terminate in accordance
with the schedule set forth in Section 5(a); provided, however, that the Option
shall lapse and terminate on the earliest of the following dates:

 (a) the date that is one year after the date of the Optionee's
 death, provided that the Optionee's death occurs (i) while he is an
 employee of the Company or of any subsidiary of the Company (a
 "Subsidiary") or (ii) within three months after termination of such
 employment;

 (b) the date that is one year after the date that the Optionee's
 employment by the Company or a Subsidiary is terminated because of his
 permanent and total disability;

 (c) the date that is three months after the date on which the
 Optionee's employment by the Company or a Subsidiary terminates for any
 other reason; or

 (d) April 20, 2003.

Upon such termination of the Option, the Optionee's rights under this Agreement,
including the right to exercise the Option, shall thereupon terminate. In the
event of any exercise of the Option after the Optionee's death or other
termination of employment, as permitted by this Section 2, the Option shall be
exercisable only to the extent that it was exercisable under the terms hereof on
the date of death or such other termination, and subject to all of the
conditions on exercise imposed hereby.

 3. NON-TRANSFERABILITY, ETC.

 (a) The Option is not transferable other than by will or the laws of
descent and distribution. Except as provided by Section 3(b), the Option shall
be exercisable only during the Optionee's lifetime, and only by him.

 (b) In the event that the Optionee shall die (i) while he is an
employee of the Company or a Subsidiary, or within three months after
termination of such employment, and (ii) prior to the complete exercise of the
Option, then the Option may be exercised, within the applicable term provided by
Section 2, by the Optionee's estate or by such person(s) to whom the Optionee's
rights hereunder shall have passed under his will or the laws of descent and
distribution. In such event, as used herein the term "Optionee" shall mean the
Optionee's estate or such person(s).

 4. PRICE. The price of each Share purchased upon exercise of the Option
shall be 7.25 (that being the last transaction price of the Common Stock on
April 21, 1998 quoted by The Nasdaq Stock Market).

 59
 2

 5. SCHEDULE AND METHOD OF EXERCISE.

 (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2, the Option shall be
exercisable as follows:

 (i) as to 5,000 Shares beginning on April 21, 1998 and
 terminating on April 20, 2003;

 (ii) as to an additional 5,000 Shares beginning on April 21, 
 1999 and terminating on April 20, 2003;

 (iii) as to an additional 5,000 Shares beginning on April 21,
 2000 and terminating on April 20, 2003;

 (iv) as to an additional 5,000 Shares beginning on April 21, 
 2001 and terminating on April 20, 2003; and

 (v) as to an additional 5,000 Shares beginning on April 21, 
 2002 and terminating on April 20, 2003.

 (b) The Option, to the extent exercisable under Section 5(a), may be
exercised in whole or in part, provided that the Option may not be exercised for
less than one Share in any single exercise transaction.

 (c) The Option shall be exercised by written notice given by the
Optionee to the Company specifying the number of Shares that the Optionee elects
to purchase and the purchase price being paid, accompanied by full payment of
such purchase price. Upon each exercise, the Option price shall be payable by
one or any combination of the following methods, as determined by the Optionee
and specified in his notice of exercise: (i) in cash, or (ii) by delivery of
Shares already owned by the Optionee. Any Shares that are so delivered to pay
the Option price shall be valued at their fair market value on the date of such
Option exercise. Upon determining that compliance with this Agreement has
occurred, including compliance with such reasonable requirements as the Company
may impose pursuant to Section 10, the Company shall issue certificate(s) for
the Shares purchased.

 6. NO ISO TREATMENT. The Option is not an "incentive stock option"
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended.

 7. NO RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDER. No person, estate or other entity shall
have the rights of a shareholder of the Company with respect to any of the
Shares subject to the Option until a certificate for such Shares has been
delivered to the Optionee.

 8. RIGHTS OF THE COMPANY. This Agreement does not affect the Company's
right to take any corporate action whatsoever, including without limitation its
right to recapitalize, reorganize or make other changes in its capital structure
or business, merge or consolidate, issue bonds, notes, Shares or other
securities, including preferred stock, or options therefor, dissolve or
liquidate, or sell or transfer any part of its assets or business.

 9. ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS. In the event that (a) in connection with a
merger or consolidation of the Company or a sale by the Company of all or a part
of its assets, the outstanding Shares are exchanged for a different number or
class of shares of stock or other securities of the Company, or for shares of
the stock or other securities of any other entity; or (b) new, different or
additional Shares or other securities of the Company or of another entity are
received by the holders of Shares, whether by way of recapitalization or
otherwise; or (c) any dividend in the form of stock is made to the holders of
Shares, or any stock split or reverse split pertaining to Shares is effected;
then appropriate adjustment shall be made to (i) the number and kind of Shares

60
 3

or other securities that may be issued upon exercise of the Option; and (ii) the
Option price per Share to be paid upon exercise of the Option. Under no
circumstance shall the Optionee be entitled to an adjustment hereunder to
reflect dilution resulting from the issuance or acquisition of Shares or other
securities by the Company, except as expressly provided in the preceding
sentence, regardless of whether such Shares or other securities are issued for
less than the exercise price of the Option.

 10. TAXES; SECURITIES LAWS MATTERS.

 (a) The exercise of the Option shall be conditioned upon the
Optionee making arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the payment to the
Company of the amount of all taxes required by any governmental authority to be
withheld and paid over by the Company to the governmental authority on account
of the exercise. The payment of such withholding taxes to the Company may be
made by either or a combination of the following methods: (i) in cash, or (ii)
by the Company withholding such taxes from any other compensation owed to the
Optionee by the Company or a Subsidiary.

 (b) As a precondition to the Company's execution of this Agreement
and the issuance of the Option hereunder, the Optionee represents to the Company
that the Option is being, and (unless a Registration Statement with respect
thereto shall then be effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Act")) any Shares acquired by him upon exercise of the Option shall be,
acquired by him solely for investment and not with a view to, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof, nor with any present intention of
selling, transferring or disposing of the same.

 (c) The Optionee acknowledges and agrees that the Option may not be
offered for sale, sold, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred or
disposed of in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement. The Optionee agrees
and consents that any Shares acquired upon exercise of the Option may not be
offered for sale, sold or otherwise transferred or disposed of unless (i) a
registration statement with respect thereto shall then be effective under the
Act, and the Optionee shall have provided proof satisfactory to counsel for the
Company that he has complied with all applicable state securities laws, or (ii)
the Company shall have received an opinion of counsel in form and substance
satisfactory to counsel for the Company that the proposed offer for sale, sale
or transfer of the Shares is exempt from the registration requirements of the
Act and may otherwise be effected in compliance with any other applicable law,
including all applicable state securities laws. The Optionee agrees that unless
a Registration Statement with respect thereto shall then be effective under the
Act, a legend to this effect may be placed on each certificate, and that a stop
transfer order may be placed against his account, relating to such Shares. In
addition, each such certificate shall bear such additional legends and
statements as the Company deems advisable to assure compliance with all Federal
and state laws and regulations, including securities laws and regulations.

 (d) The Optionee confirms that the Company is relying upon his
representations contained in this Section 10 in connection with the issuance to
him of the Option and the Shares underlying the Option. In consideration of the
issuance to the Optionee of the Option and the Shares upon any exercise of the
Option, the Optionee hereby indemnifies and holds harmless the Company, and the
officers, directors, employees and agents thereof, from and against any and all
liability, losses, damages, expenses and attorneys' fees which they may
hereafter incur, suffer or be required to pay by reason of the falsity of, or
his failure to comply with, any representation or agreement contained in this
Section 10.

 11. TENURE. The Optionee's right, if any, to continue to serve the
Company or a Subsidiary as an officer, employee or otherwise will not be
enlarged or otherwise affected by this Agreement. This Agreement does not

61
 4

restrict the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate the Optionee's
employment at any time.

 12. CHOICE OF LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made
and to be performed entirely within such State.

 13. NOTICES. All notices and other communications required or permitted
under this Agreement shall be written, and shall be either delivered personally
or sent by registered or certified first-class mail, postage prepaid and return
receipt requested, or by telex or telecopier, addressed as follows: if to the
Company, to the Company's principal office, Attention: Corporate Secretary; and
if to Optionee or his successor, to the address last furnished by such person to
the Company. Each such notice and other communication delivered personally shall
be deemed to have been given when delivered. Each such notice and other
communication delivered by mail shall be deemed to have been given when it is
deposited in the United States mail in the manner specified herein, and each
such notice and other communication delivered by telex or telecopier shall be
deemed to have been given when it is so transmitted and the appropriate
answerback is received. A party may change its address for the purpose hereof by
giving notice in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.

 14. IN GENERAL. This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive
expression of the understanding between the parties and supersedes any prior or
contemporaneous agreement or representation, oral or written, between them.
Modification of this Agreement or waiver of a provision hereof must be written
and signed by the party to be bound. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement shall be held to be illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be
severed from this Agreement and the entire Agreement shall not fail on account
thereof, but shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. As used herein,
the term "Section" shall mean the appropriate section of this Agreement.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Optionee and the Company have executed this
Agreement as of the date first above written.
