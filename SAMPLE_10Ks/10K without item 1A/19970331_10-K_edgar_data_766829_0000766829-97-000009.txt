PART I

Item 1. Business.

(a) General Development of Business.

SJW Corp., incorporated in California on February 8, 1985, is a holding
company with two wholly owned subsidiaries, San Jose Water Company and SJW
Land Company.

San Jose Water Company, with headquarters at 374 West Santa Clara Street,
San Jose, California 95196, was incorporated under the laws of the State of
California in 1931, succeeding a business founded in 1866. San Jose Water
Company is a public utility in the business of providing water service to a
population of approximately 944,000 in an area comprising about 134 square
miles in the metropolitan San Jose area.

SJW Land Company was incorporated in October, 1985.

SJW Corp. also owns 549,976 shares of California Water Service Company,
acquired through the liquidation of Western Precision, Inc., formerly a
wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Corp.

Regulation and Rates.

San Jose Water Company's rates, service and other matters affecting its
business are subject to regulation by the Public Utilities Commission of the
State of California (the "Commission").

Ordinarily, there are two types of rate increases, general and offset. The
purpose of the latter is generally to compensate utilities for increases in
specific expenses, such as those for purchased water or power.

The most recent general rate case decision authorized an initial increase
followed by two annual step increases designed to maintain the authorized
return on equity over a three-year period. General rate applications are
normally filed and processed during the last year covered by the most recent
rate case in an attempt to avoid regulatory lag.

Pursuant to Section 792.5 of the Public Utilities Code, a balancing account
is to be kept for all expense items for which revenue offsets have been
authorized. A separate balancing account must be maintained for each offset
expense item. The purpose of a balancing account is to track the under
collection or overcollection associated with expense changes and the revenue
authorized by the Commission to offset those expense changes. At December
31,1996 the balancing account had a net under-collected balance to be offset of
 840,370.

This report contains forward looking statements relating to future events
and financial performance of the company. Such forward-looking statements
are identified by words including "expect," "estimate", "anticipate" and
similar expressions. The company's actual results could differ materially
from those discussed in such forward-looking statements. Important factors
that could cause or contribute to such differences include the following:

 The Public Utilities Commission of California's policy and regulations
can adversely affect San Jose Water Company's operating results through the
availability, timeliness and amount of rate relief. The Commission's
willingness to allow San Jose Water Company to recover all of its capital
expenditure and to provide financial and operational flexibility to engage
in non-regulated operations can also affect San Jose Water Company's
operating results.

 San Jose Water Company's sales and therefore its operating results
could be adversely affected by several events:

 Difficulties in obtaining a secured water supply from the Santa Clara
Valley Water District which receives its allotment from the state and
federal water projects could prevent the company from satisfying its
customer demand within its service area;

 Fluctuation of customer sales due to lifestyle or weather;

 Availability of recycled water and its acceptance by customers as a
substitute to potable water; and

 Economic development and growth in San Jose Water Company's service
area.

 SJW Corp.'s expenses and therefore its operating results could be
adversely affected by the following:

 Fluctuation of surface water availability from San Jose Water Company's
Santa Cruz mountain watershed, which produces a less costly water supply,
could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources;

 Stringent environmental and water quality regulations could increase
San Jose Water Company's water quality compliance costs;

 Consequences from pollution and contamination of San Jose Water
Company's well and source of supply could result in the need to procure more
costly water from other sources;

 The level of labor and non-labor operating and maintenance expenses as
affected by inflationary forces and collective bargaining power could
adversely affect the operating and maintenance expenses of the corporation;

 Cost and other effects of lawsuits against SJW Corp. or its
subsidiaries, whether civil, environmental, product-related or liability-
related could increase the corporation's legal, liability and insurance
costs.

See also the heading "Factors That May Adversely Affect Future Operation
Results" under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update the information including
the forward-looking statements, contained in this report.

(b) Financial Information about Industry Segments.

San Jose Water Company generated 99 , 98 and 94 of SJW Corp.'s
consolidated revenue, and 66 , 91 and 86 of SJW Corp.'s consolidated
income for the years
ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. There were no
significant changes in 1996 in the type of products produced or services
rendered by San Jose Water Company, or in its markets or methods of
distribution.

SJW Land Company sold non-utility property in 1996 and contributed 28 to
SJW Corp.'s consolidated income for the year.

Western Precision, Inc. a mechanical parts manufacturing operation, which
was acquired December 31, 1992 and sold on February 28, 1995, generated 1 
and 6 of SJW Corp.'s consolidated revenue for the years 1995 and 1994,
respectively. Dividend income from California Water Service generated 5 , 8 
and 9 of consolidated income for the years 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

(c) Narrative Description of Business.

(1) (i) General.

The principal business of San Jose Water Company consists of the production,
purchase, storage, purification, distribution and retail sale of water. San
Jose Water Company provides water service to customers in portions of the
cities of Cupertino and San Jose and in the cities of Campbell, Monte
Sereno, Saratoga and the Town of Los Gatos, and adjacent unincorporated
territory, all in the County of Santa Clara in the State of California. It
distributes water to customers in accordance with accepted water utility
methods, which include pumping from storage and gravity feed from high
elevation reservoirs.

(1) (iii) Water Supply.

San Jose Water Company's water supply is obtained from wells, surface run-
off or diversion and by purchases from the Santa Clara Valley Water District
("SCVWD"). Surface supplies, which during a year of normal rainfall satisfy
about 6 to 8 of San Jose Water Company's current annual needs, provide
approximately 1 of its water supply in a dry year and approximately 14 in
a wet year. In dry years the decrease in water from surface run-off and
diversion, and the corresponding increase in purchased and pumped water
increases production costs substantially.

San Jose Water Company implemented various mandatory water rationing
programs throughout the period of 1989-1993. Effective March 14, 1993 San
Jose Water Company terminated its mandatory water rationing plan and
instituted a voluntary conservation plan intended to reduce usage 15 from
1987 levels. Effective February 16, 1994, San Jose Water Company
discontinued its voluntary conservation plan.

Groundwater levels in 1996 maintained at a high level reflecting the impact
of the last rainfall season. SCVWD's reservoir storage of approximately
158,000 acre feet (93 of capacity) was reported on February 18, 1997.

Until 1989, San Jose Water Company had never found it necessary to impose
mandatory water rationing. Except in a few isolated cases when service had
been interrupted or curtailed because of power or equipment failures,
construction shutdowns or other operating difficulties, San Jose Water
Company had not at any prior time in its history interrupted or imposed
mandatory curtailment of service to any type or class of customer.

(1) (iv) Franchises.

San Jose Water Company holds such franchises or permits in the communities
it serves as it judges necessary to operate and maintain its facilities in
the public streets.

(1) (v) Seasonal Factors.

Water sales are seasonal in nature. The demand for water, especially by
residential customers, is generally influenced by weather conditions. The
timing of precipitation and climatic conditions can cause seasonal water
consumption by residential customers to vary significantly.

(1) (x) Competition and Condemnation.
San Jose Water Company is a public utility regulated by the Commission and
operates within a service area approved by the Commission. The laws of the
State of California provide that no other investor owned public utility may
operate in San Jose Water Company's service area without first obtaining
from the Commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity. Past
experience shows such a certificate will be issued only after demonstrating
San Jose Water Company's service in such area is inadequate.

California law also provides that whenever a public agency constructs
facilities to extend utility service to the service area of a privately
owned public utility (like San Jose Water Company), such an act constitutes
the taking of property and is conditioned upon payment of just compensation
to the private utility.

Under the constitution and statutes of the State of California,
municipalities, water districts and other public agencies have been
authorized to engage in the ownership and operation of water systems. Such
agencies are empowered to condemn properties operated by privately owned
public utilities upon payment of just compensation and are further
authorized to issue bonds (including revenue bonds) for the purpose of
acquiring or constructing water systems. To the Company's knowledge, no
municipality, water district or other public agency has pending any action
to condemn any part of San Jose Water Company's system.

(1) (xii) Environmental Matters.

San Jose Water Company maintains procedures to produce potable water in
accordance with all applicable county, state and federal environmental rules
and regulations. Additionally, San Jose Water Company is subject to
environmental regulation by various other governmental authorities.
(See Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.")

(1) (xiii) Employees.

As of December 31, 1996, San Jose Water Company had 284 employees, of whom
57 were executive, administrative or supervisory personnel, and of whom 227
were members of unions. San Jose Water Company reached a two-year
collective bargaining agreement with the Utility Workers of America,
representing the majority of employees and the International Union of
Operating Engineers, representing certain employees in the engineering
department covering the years 1997 and 1998. Both groups are affiliated
with the AFL-CIO. Executive Officers of the Registrant.

(d) Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export
Sales. Substantially all of SJW Corp.'s revenue and expense are derived from

Item 2. Properties.

The properties of San Jose Water Company consist of a unified system of water
production, storage, purification and distribution located in the County of 
Santa Clara in the State of California. In general, the property is
comprised of franchise rights, water rights, necessary rights-of-way, 
approximately 7,000 acres of land held in fee (which is primarily
nondevelopable watershed), impounding reservoirs with a capacity of
approximately 2.256 billion gallons, diversion facilities, wells,
distribution storage of approximately 240 million gallons and all water
facilities, equipment and other property necessary to supply its customers.

San Jose Water Company maintains all of its properties in good operating
condition in accordance with customary proper practice for a water utility.
San Jose Water Company's well pumping stations have a production capacity of
approximately 259 million gallons per day and the present capacity for taking
purchased water is approximately 169 million gallons per day. The gravity
water collection system has a physical delivery capacity of approximately 25
million gallons per day. During 1996, a maximum and average of 207 million
gallons and 132 million gallons of water per day, respectively, were 
delivered to the system.

San Jose Water Company holds all its principal properties in fee, subject to
current tax and assessment liens, rights-of-way, easements, and certain minor
clouds or defects in title which do not materially affect their use and to
the lien of the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds, of which there
were outstanding at December 31, 1996, 1,500,000 in principal amount.

SJW Land Company owns approximately nine acres of property adjacent to San Jose
Water Company's general office facilities and another approximately 6
undeveloped acres in the San Jose Metropolitan area. Eight of the nine acres
of land adjacent to San Jose Water Company are used as surface parking
facilities and generate substantially all SJW Land Company's revenue.
 
Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

In October 1993, Valley Title Company and its insurer filed a lawsuit in
Santa Clara County Superior Court naming San Jose Water Company as a
defendant. Plaintiffs claimed a fire service pipeline ruptured in October
1992, causing water to flood the title company's basement.

In April 1995, San Jose Water Company's insurance carrier settled with the
plaintiff's insurance company for 3.5 million. Whether or not San Jose
Water Company will be compelled to contribute to the settlement is uncertain.

However, management has consistently maintained that the pollution exclusion
asserted by the insurance carrier does not apply to this type of incident.
Therefore, the company will aggressively resist any demand for contribution.
 
The jury awarded the title company 3 million for its loss of records, and the
insurance carrier for San Jose Water Company has appealed that decision. San
Jose Water Company believes that any final award to the title company will be
within the stated limits of the company's insurance coverage.
 
On June 27, 1995, the City of San Jose passed an ordinance imposing a
franchise fee on the gross annual receipts arising from the use, operation,
or possession of a "Potable Water Franchise." This ordinance became
effective on July 28, 1995. San Jose Water Company maintains that it has a
"constitutional franchise" dating from at least 1891, and that the City of
San Jose cannot legally impose any new franchise or new franchise fees on
San Jose Water Company's operations. San Jose Water Company has filed suit
to challenge this new city ordinance.

Although the company could have filed an advice letter with the California
Public Utilities Commission requesting authorization to collect the new
franchise fee from its customers, San Jose Water Company, with the
concurrence of the Division of Ratepayer Advocates, decided to ask the
Commission for permission to establish a memorandum account for the imposed
franchise fee. A Commission decision issued on November 8, 1995, authorized
San Jose Water Company to establish such an account. San Jose Water Company
will be able to collect the franchise fee from its customers by surcharge in
the event that its efforts to invalidate the ordinance are unsuccessful.
In September 1996, a judgment in favor of San Jose Water Company was
rendered. It is unknown whether the City will appeal the decision. San Jose
Water Company does not believe, based upon all available information, that
the outcome of this event will have a material effect on its financial
position.

Description of the Business

SJW Corp. is a holding company with two wholly owned subsidiaries: San
Jose Water Company and SJW Land Company. San Jose Water Company is a
public utility in the business of providing water service to a population
of approximately 944,000 in an area comprising about 134 square miles in
the metropolitan San Jose area. SJW Land Company owns and operates a 900-
space surface parking facility located adjacent to the San Jose Arena and
also owns several undeveloped real estate parcels in San Jose Water
Company's service area. SJW Corp. also owns 549,976 shares of California
Water Service Company, acquired through the liquidation of Western
Precision, Inc., formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Corp.

Results of Operations

Consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 1995
and 1994 include the results of Western Precision, Inc. which was acquired
on December 31, 1992 and disposed of on February 28,1995.

 ======== ====== ======

Consolidated operating revenue for 1996 increased 5,208,000 or 5 from 1995
due to increased water consumption and the approval of a rate increase from
the California Public Utilities Commission (Commission). Consolidated
operating revenue for 1995 decreased 2,037,000 or 2 from 1994 due to the
sale of Western Precision, Inc. San Jose Water Company's revenue increased
3 over 1994 mainly due to a similar growth in customer usage.

In 1996, consolidated operating expense increased 4 due to increased
water production to satisfy water consumption growth. In 1995,
consolidated operating expense decreased 4 due to cost savings from
increased production of surface water and the sale of Western Precision,
Inc.

The effective consolidated income tax rates for 1996, 1995 and 1994 were
38 , 40 and 39 , respectively. Refer to page 21 of the Notes To
Consolidated Financial Statements for the reconciliation of income tax
expense to the amount computed by applying the federal statutory rate to
income before income taxes.

OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE

Dividend income increased 22,000, or 2 , over 1995 due to a .04 per share
increase in the California Water Service Company annual dividend.

San Jose Water Company's interest expense on long-term debt in 1996,
including capitalized interest, increased 1,004,000 or 21 , from 1995 due
to the issuance of the Series D unsecured notes. San Jose Water Company's
weighted average cost of long-term debt, including amortization of debt
issuance costs, was 8.22 , 8.21 and 8.34 as of December 31, 1996, 1995 and
1994, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

San Jose Water Company's budgeted capital expenditures for 1997 compared to
1996, exclusive of capital expenditures financed by customer contributions
and advances, are as follows:

BUDGETED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (in thousands)
 1997 1996
Source of supply 827 5 550 4 
Reservoirs and tanks 870 5 813 5 
Pump stations and equipment 1,649 9 1,721 11 
Distribution system 11,692 65 10,171 67 
Equipment and other 2,964 16 1,949 13 
 18,002 100 15,204 100 

The 1997 capital budget is concentrated in two areas: 11,692,000 in main
replacements and related services to systematically renew the company's
aging infrastructure; and 1,800,000 to implement the third phase of a
geographical information and mapping system and a new accounting system.

San Jose Water Company expects to incur approximately 100,000,000,
exclusive of customer contributions and advances, in capital expenditures
over the next five years. San Jose Water Company's actual capital
expenditures may vary from its projection due to changes in the expected
demand for services, weather patterns, actions by governmental agencies and
general economic conditions. Total additions to utility plant normally
exceed company-financed additions by several million dollars because certain
new facilities are constructed using advances from developers and
contributions in aid of construction.

Most of San Jose Water Company's distribution system has been constructed
over the last forty years. Expenditure levels for renewal and modernization
of this part of the system will grow at an increasing rate as these
components reach the end of their useful lives. Additionally, in most cases
replacement cost will significantly exceed the cost of the retired asset due
to increases in the cost of goods and services.

SOURCES OF CAPITAL

San Jose Water Company's ability to finance future construction programs and
sustain dividend payments depends on its ability to attract external
financing and maintain or increase internally generated funds. The level of
future earnings and the related cash flow from operations is dependent, in
large part, upon the timing and outcome of regulatory proceedings.

Over the past five years SJW Corp. has paid its shareholders, in the form of
dividends, an average of 54 of its net income. The remaining earnings have
been reinvested. Capital requirements not funded by earnings are expected
to be funded through external financing in the form of unsecured senior
notes or a commercial bank line of credit. As of December 31, 1996, San
Jose Water Company had 20,000,000 of unused line of credit and over
 50,000,000 of borrowing capacity under the terms of the senior note
agreements.

San Jose Water Company's financing activity is designed to achieve a capital
structure consistent with regulatory guidelines - approximately 50 debt and
50 equity.

In 1996, San Jose Water Company redeemed its 1,000,000 Series O 6.5 first
mortgage bonds at maturity. In 1995, San Jose Water Company issued
 15,000,000 in Series D unsecured 30-year senior notes and redeemed its
 1,500,000 Series N 4.85 first mortgage bonds at maturity. In 1994, San
Jose Water Company redeemed its 2,000,000 Series M 4.65 first mortgage
bonds at maturity. San Jose Water Company intends to retire all remaining
first mortgage bonds by 1998 and satisfy all forseeable future long-term
financing needs with senior notes.

Factors That May Affect Future Results

The results of operations of San Jose Water Company generally depend on the
following factors: (1) regulation, (2) surface water supply, and (3)
operation and maintenance expense.

REGULATION

Principally all the operating revenue of San Jose Water Company results from
the sale of water at rates authorized by the Commission. The Commission
sets rates that are intended to provide revenue sufficient to recover
operating expenses and produce a reasonable return on common equity.

As a result of the Commission's General Rate Case decision, San Jose Water
Company was authorized new rates, which became effective on July 22, 1996.
In the decision the Commission authorized an average annual rate increase of
1.25 through 1999, for a total rate increase of 4.8 million during this
period. The new rates reflect an authorized return on equity of 10.2 ,
which is within the range of recent rates of return authorized by the
Commission for water utilities. Additionally, San Jose Water Company was
authorized to recover the 1.4 million balance in its Voluntary Conservation
Memorandum Account via a oneyear surcharge effective concurrently with the
general rate increase.

The General Rate Case decision granted San Jose Water Company memorandum
account protection for the largely indeterminate costs associated with the
new or more stringent federal water quality regulations. With the
establishment of the water quality memorandum account, any potential
financial exposure resulting from these regulations has been substantially
reduced. The decision also authorized the 457,000 balance in the Tax
Memorandum Account to be transferred to the Balancing Account for future
collection in rates.

In November 1996, San Jose Water Company filed an advice letter requesting a
step rate increase in the amount of 1,212,000 to be effective January 1,
1997.

SURFACE WATER SUPPLY

The level of surface water available in each year depends on the amount of
rainfall and run-off collected in San Jose Water Company's Santa Cruz
Mountain reservoirs. In a normal year, surface supply provides 6-8 of the
total water supply of the system. Surface water is a less costly source of
water and its availability may significantly impact the results of
operations.

OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE

San Jose Water Company reached an agreement with its unionized personnel
covering 1997 and 1998. The agreement includes a 3.5 wage increase each
year and minor benefit modifications.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

San Jose Water Company's operations are subject to water quality and
pollution control regulations issued by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), the California Department of Health Services and the
California Regional Water Quality Control Board. The company is also
subject to environmental laws and regulations administered by other state
and local regulatory agencies.

Under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), San Jose Water Company is
subject to regulation by the EPA of the quality of water it sells and
treatment techniques it uses to make the water potable. The EPA promulgates
nationally applicable maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for "contaminants"
found in drinking water. San Jose Water Company is currently in compliance
with all of the 84 MCLs promulgated to date. The EPA has continuing
authority, however, to issue additional regulations under the SDWA. San
Jose Water Company has implemented monitoring activities and installed
specific water treatment improvements enabling it to comply with all
existing MCLs and plan for compliance with future drinking water
regulations.

To comply with the State Total Coliform Regulation, disinfection of San Jose
Water Company wells is being phased in over the next two to three years. To
date, ten of the company's nineteen key groundwater production stations have
been equipped with hypochlorinators, with six more installations to be
completed in 1997. The EPA is expected to mandate disinfection of all
groundwater supplies by 1999.

In 1995, State Assembly Bill No. 733 was signed into law requiring public
water systems in California serving at least 10,000 connections to
fluoridate water. The law provides that water systems would not be required
to comply unless funding for the needed capital and associated costs are
available from any source other than ratepayers, shareholders, local
taxpayers or bondholders of the public water system.

In addition to SDWA, other environmental regulations are becoming
increasingly important. The Santa Clara County Toxic Gas Ordinance became
effective in 1993 requiring the elimination of chlorine gas disinfection
systems or the installation of complete containment systems to control
accidental chlorine gas discharges. During 1994, San Jose Water Company
replaced the chlorine gas disinfection systems at its two water treatment
plants with hypochlorinators which accomplish disinfection with liquid
sodium hypochlorite. These facilities are currently operational and in
compliance with all state and local hazardous materials storage regulations.

Other state and local environmental regulations apply to San Jose Water
Company's operations and facilities. These regulations relate primarily to
the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. San Jose Water
Company is currently in compliance with state and local regulations
governing underground storage tanks, disposal of hazardous wastes, non-point
source discharges, and the warning provisions of the California Safe
Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986.

Future drinking water regulations will most likely require increased
monitoring, and may mandate disinfection or other treatment of underground
water supplies, more stringent performance standards for treatment plants
and procedures to reduce levels of disinfection by-products. San Jose Water
Company continues to seek to establish mechanisms for recovery of government
mandated environmental compliance costs. However, there are limited
regulatory mechanisms and procedures available to the company for the
recovery of such costs and there can be no assurance that such costs will be
fully recovered.

Of all of the regulations being considered under the current SDWA, the
proposed Disinfectants/Disinfection By-Products Rule is anticipated to have
the most significant impact on water utilities. Due to be promulgated in
the year 2000, this rule would impose more stringent monitoring requirements
and drinking water standards for by-products formed during the disinfection
of water. The Santa Clara Valley Water District, whose imported surface
water represents approximately 45 of San Jose Water Company's supply,
projects that compliance with this regulation could, by the year 2003, cost
over 100,000,000 in capital improvements and an additional 3,000,000 per
year in operating expenses. If incurred, part of these costs would be passed
along to San Jose Water Company and other water retailers in the form of
higher rates for purchased water and pump taxes. San Jose Water Company
would seek a rate increase, via an advice letter filing, to recover the
additional costs. The company's surface and groundwater sources are
generally of a higher quality than the imported water supplies, and are not
expected to require extensive modifications of existing treatment processes.

NONREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES

The investment in California Water Service Company is expected to produce
1997 pre-tax dividend income and cash flow of approximately 1,100,000. SJW
Land Company's parking revenue is largely dependent upon the level of events
and activities at the San Jose Arena which is located adjacent to its
parking facility.

SJW CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994
(Dollars in thousands, except share data)

Note 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
SJW Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated.

SJW Corp.'s principal subsidiary, San Jose Water Company, is a regulated
California water utility providing water service to the greater metropolitan
San Jose area. San Jose Water Company's accounting policies comply with the
applicable uniform system of accounts prescribed by the California Public
Utilities Commission (Commission) and conform to generally accepted
accounting principles for rate-regulated public utilities. More than 90 of
San Jose Water Company's revenue is derived from the sale of water to
residential and business customers.

SJW Land Company owns and operates a 900-space surface parking facility
adjacent to the San Jose Arena, and also owns several undeveloped real
estate parcels in San Jose Water Company's service area.

The consolidated financial results of 1995 and 1994 included the operation
of Western Precision, Inc., which was sold in February 1995. Western
Precision, Inc. contributed 1,051 and 5,968 of SJW Corp.'s operating
revenues in 1995 and 1994, respectively.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Utility Plant - The cost of additions, replacements and betterments to
utility plant is capitalized. The amount of interest capitalized in 1996,
1995 and 1994 was 201, 245 and 103, respectively. Construction in
progress was 2,021 in 1996, 1,813 in 1995 and 2,658 in 1994.

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
service lives of the assets, ranging from 5 to 75 years. The cost of
utility plant retired, including retirement costs (less salvage), is charged
to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized.

In 1996, SJW Corp. adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. SFAS No. 121 prescribes that rate-
regulated enterprises should charge a regulatory asset to earnings if and
when that asset no longer meets the criteria for being recorded as a
regulatory asset. Rateregulated enterprises should also recognize an
impairment of an asset if the regulator excludes all or part of a cost from
rates. The adoption of SFAS No. 121 did not result in any material effect
on the corporation's results of operations, or on its financial condition
taken as a whole.

Nonutility Property - Nonutility property is recorded at cost and consists
primarily of land and parking facilities. Depreciation is computed using
accelerated depreciation method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, ranging from 5 to 15 years.

Financial Instruments - Cash and equivalents include certain highly liquid
investments with remaining maturities of three months or less when
purchased. Cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which
approximates fair value. Temporary investments consist principally of tax-
exempt municipal obligations with maturities between three and twelve
months, and are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates
fair value.

Investment in California Water Service Company - SJW Corp.'s investment in
California Water Service Company is reported at quoted market price, with
the unrealized gain or loss excluded from earnings and reported as a
separate component of shareholders' equity.

The fair value of SJW Corp.'s investment in California Water Service Company
approximated 23,099 and 18,012 as of December 31, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. The increase in fair value of 5,087, after offsetting the
deferred tax liabilities of 2,085, resulted in a net increase of 3,002 to
shareholders' equity as of December 31, 1996.

Other Assets - Debt reacquisition costs are amortized over the term of the
new debt. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the life of each issue.
The excess cost over fair market value of net assets acquired is recorded as
goodwill and amortized over the periods estimated to be benefited, not
exceeding 40 years. Management periodically evaluates goodwill to determine
if an impairment has occurred.

Income Taxes - Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the effect
of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable to
future years.

To the extent that the tax benefits of the temporary differences
have previously been passed through to customers through lower water rates,
management anticipates that the payment of the future tax liabilities
resulting from the reversal of the temporary differences will be recoverable
through rates. Therefore, a regulatory asset has been recorded for the
portion of net deferred tax liabilities which are expected to be recovered
through future rates. Although realization is not assured, management
believes it is more likely than not that all of the regulatory asset will be
realized.

To the extent permitted by the Commission, investment tax credits resulting
from utility plant additions are deferred and amortized over the estimated
useful lives of the related property.

Advances for Construction and Contributions in Aid of Construction -
Advances for construction received after 1981 are being refunded ratably
over 40 years. Prior customer advances are refunded based on 22 of related
revenues. Estimated refunds for 1997 are 1,420.

Contributions in aid of construction represent funds received from
developers that are not refundable under Commission regulations.
Depreciation applicable to utility plant constructed with these
contributions is charged to contributions in aid of construction.

Customer advances and contributions in aid of construction received
subsequent to 1986 and prior to June 12, 1996 generally must be included in
federal taxable income. Taxes paid relating to advances and contributions
are recorded as deferred tax assets for financial reporting purposes and
amortized over 40 years for advances, and over the tax depreciable life of
the related asset for contributions.

Beginning in 1992, advances and contributions are also included in state
taxable income.

Advances and contributions in aid of construction received subsequent to
June 12, 1996 are generally exempt from federal taxable income.

Revenue - Revenue of San Jose Water Company includes amounts billed to
customers, and unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the latest
meter reading to the end of the year. Included in 1996's operating revenue
is 631 relating to recovery of prior years' net revenue lost due to
voluntary conservation programs.

Earnings Per Share - Per share data are calculated using net income divided
by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.

Note 2

CAPITALIZATION

At December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994, 176,407 shares of preferred stock were
authorized and unissued.

In 1996, SJW Corp. repurchased and cancelled 80,399 shares of its
outstanding stock at the prevailing market price at an aggregate cost of
 3,225.

Note 3

LINE OF CREDIT

San Jose Water Company has available an unsecured bank line of credit,
allowing aggregate short-term borrowings of up to 20,000. This line of
credit bears
interest at variable rates and expires on May 31, 1997.

Note 4

GAIN ON SALE OF NONUTILITY PROPERTY

In September 1996, SJW Land Company sold nonutility property receiving as
consideration 6,750 in cash and a parcel of nonutility property with a
fair value of 1,050. The transaction resulted in a gain of 5,269, net
of income tax expense of 2,155, or 1.62 per share.

Note 5

LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt as of December 31 was as follows:
 Description Due Date 1996 1995
- ------------------------------------------------
 First mortgage bonds:
 O 6.5 1996 - 1,000
 P 6.5 1997 1,500 1,500
- ------------------------------------------------
 1,500 2,500
 Senior notes:
 A 8.58 2022 20,000 20,000
 B 7.37 2024 30,000 30,000
 C 9.45 2020 10,000 10,000
 D 7.15 2026 15,000 15,000
- ------------------------------------------------
 75,000 75,000
- ------------------------------------------------
 Total long-term debt 76,500 77,500
 Less current maturities 1,500 1,000
- ------------------------------------------------
 75,000 76,500

First mortgage bonds and senior notes are obligations of San Jose Water
Company. Maturities of long-term debt, including sinking fund requirements,
amount to 1,500 in 1997.

Substantially all utility plant is pledged as collateral for first mortgage
bonds. Senior notes are unsecured. To minimize issuance costs, all of San
Jose Water Company's debt has historically been privately placed. The fair
value of long-term debt, including current maturities, as of December 31,
1996 and 1995 was approximately 86,500 and 97,300, respectively based on
the amount of essentially risk-free assets that would have to be placed in
trust to extinguish these obligations.

Note 6

INCOME TAXES

The following table reconciles income tax expense to the amount computed by
applying the federal statutory rate to income before income taxes:
 1996 1995 1994
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Computed "expected" federal
 income tax at the
 statutory rate of 35 10,423 6,756 5,701
 Increase (decrease) in taxes
 attributable to:
 Utility plant basis 462 400 448
 State taxes, net of federal
 income tax benefit 1,800 1,167 985
 Dividend received deduction (280) (275) (267)
 Nonutility property sale (922) - -
 Other items, net (262) (280) (480)
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 11,221 7,768 6,387
 ============================================================
 The components of income tax expense were:
 1996 1995 1994
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Current:
 Federal 7,830 5,564 4,276
 State 2,961 2,041 1,683
 Deferred:
 Federal 907 549 782
 State (477) (386) (354)
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 11,221 7,768 6,387
 ============================================================
 The components of the net deferred tax liability as of December 31 were
 as follows:
 1996 1995
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 Deferred tax assets:
 Advances and contributions 12,252 11,466
 Unamortized investment tax credit 1,277 1,306
 Pensions and postretirement
 benefits 596 438
 California franchise tax 668 538
 Other 257 183
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Total deferred tax assets 15,050 13,931
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Deferred tax liabilities:
 Utility plant 21,965 20,514
 Investment 7,215 5,130
 Debt reacquisition costs 1,355 1,406
 Other 573 210
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Total deferred tax liabilities 31,108 27,260
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Net deferred tax liabilities 16,058 13,329
 ============================================================
 
Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for
future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are
deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the company will
realize the benefits of these deductible differences.

Note 7

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Pension Plans - San Jose Water Company sponsors noncontributory defined
benefit pension plans. Benefits under the plans are based on an employee's
years of service and highest consecutive three years of compensation. San
Jose Water Company's policy is to contribute the net periodic pension cost
to the extent it is tax deductible.

San Jose Water Company has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, which
is a defined benefit plan under which the company will pay supplemental
pension
benefits to key executives in addition to the amounts received under the
retirement plan. The annual cost of this plan has been included in the
determination of the net periodic pension cost shown below. The plan,
which is unfunded, had a projected benefit obligation of 1,413 and 1,277
as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, and net periodic pension
cost of 193, 159 and 152 for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Net periodic pension cost for the defined benefit plans was as follows:
 1996 1995 1994
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Service cost-benefits earned
 during the period 869 536 637
 Interest cost on projected
 benefit obligation 1,444 1,349 1,290
 Actual return on plan assets (3,767) (3,896) 347
 Net amortization and deferral 2,146 2,403 (1,802)
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 692 392 472
 ============================================================
 
The actuarial present value of benefit obligations and the funded status of
San Jose Water Company's defined benefit pension plans as of December 31
were as follows:
 1996 1995
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 Actuarial present value of
 accumulated benefit obligation,
 including vested benefits of
 16,981 and 16,254 (18,686) (17,743)
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Projected benefit obligation (23,314) (22,300)
 Plan assets at fair value 25,813 22,486
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 Plan assets in excess
 of projected benefit obligation 2,499 186
 Unrecognized net gain (4,532) (1,997)
 Prior service cost not recognized
 in net periodic pension cost 1,331 1,463
 Unrecognized net obligation at
 January 1, 1987 and 1992 being
 recognized over 15 and 13.7 years 221 223
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Accrued pension cost included
 in other current liabilities (481) (125)
 ===========================================================

The plans invest primarily in listed stocks, bonds, government securities
and cash and use the projected unit credit actuarial cost method. Average
remaining service lives were 14.5 years for 1996 and 1995.

In determining net periodic pension cost for 1996, 1995 and 1994 the
following assumptions were used: weighted average discount rate, 6.5 , 8.5 
and 7.0 , respectively; compensation growth rate, 4.0 , 5.0 and 5.0 ,
respectively; and rate of return on plan assets, 8.0 for all years. In
determining projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 1996 and 1995,
the following assumptions were used: weighted average discount rate, 6.75 
and 6.5 , respectively; and compensation growth rate, 4.0 for both years.

Savings Plans - San Jose Water Company sponsors savings plans which allow
employees to defer and contribute a portion of their earnings to the plans.
Contributions, not to exceed set limits, are matched 50 by the company.
Company contributions were 366, 345 and 266 in 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.

Other Postretirement Benefits - In addition to providing pension and savings
benefits, San Jose Water Company provides health care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees.

Net periodic postretirement benefit costs were as follows:
 1996 1995 1994
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Service cost - benefits earned
 during the period 48 28 40
 Interest cost on benefit obligation 89 87 89
 Actual return on plan assets (9) (5) -
 Net amortization and deferral 51 28 50
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 179 138 179
 ------------------------------------------------------------
Benefits paid were 71, 72 and 72 in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

 The Plan's combined funded status and the related accrual as of December 31
 were as follows:
 1996 1995
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Accumulated postretirement
 benefit obligation:
 Retirees (593) (630)
 Active plan participants:
 Fully eligible (180) (168)
 Other (646) (643)
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 (1,419) (1,441)
 Plan assets 291 218
 Accumulated postretirement
 obligation in excess of plan assets (1,128) (1,223)
 Unrecognized net gain from
 past experience and changes in
 assumptions (231) (151)
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Unrecognized net transition
 obligation 886 945
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Accrued postretirement benefit cost
 included in other current liabilities (473) (429)
 ------------------------------------------------------------

For measurement purposes, an 8.0 annual increase in the per capita cost of
covered health care benefits was assumed for 1996; this increase was
assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0 by 2002 and remain at that level
thereafter. The weighted average discount rate used in determining the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 6.75 for 1996 and 6.5 
for 1995. In determining the net periodic postretirement benefit cost,
6.5 and 8.5 discount rates were used respectively for 1996 and 1995.
The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the
amounts reported. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by
1 each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation as of December 31, 1996 by 104 and the aggregate of the service
and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost
for 1996 by 15.

Note 8

COMMITMENT

San Jose Water Company purchases water from the Santa Clara Valley Water
District (SCVWD). Delivery schedules for purchased water are based on a
contract year beginning July 1, and are negotiated every three years under
terms of a master contract with SCVWD expiring in 2051.

According to the contract terms, San Jose Water Company is obligated to
purchase a minimum of 90 of the delivery schedule. The delivery schedule is
established based on 95 of the water delivered to San Jose Water Company
within the prior three years.

Based on current prices and estimated deliveries, San Jose Water Company
expects to purchase 18,000 of water from SCVWD in the contract year ending
June 30, 1997.

Note 9

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION

Supplemental information on cash flows and noncash transaction is as follows:
 1996 1995 1994
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cash paid during the year for:
 Interest 5,607 5,284 4,482
 Income taxes 11,443 5,810 5,760
 Noncash investing and financing
 activities - adjustments to
 purchase price - - 488

Note 10

CONTINGENCY

In October 1993, Valley Title Company and its insurer filed a lawsuit in
Santa Clara County Superior Court naming San Jose Water Company as a
defendant. Plaintiffs claimed that a fire service pipeline ruptured in
October 1992, causing oil-contaminated water to flood the title company's
basement.

In April 1995, San Jose Water Company's insurance carrier settled with the
plaintiff insurance company for 3,500. Whether or not San Jose Water
Company will be compelled to contribute to the settlement is uncertain.
However, management has consistently maintained that the pollution exclusion
asserted by the insurance carrier does not apply to this type of incident,
and therefore San Jose Water Company will aggressively resist any demand for
contribution.

The jury awarded the title company 3,000 for its loss of files, and the
insurance carrier for San Jose Water Company has appealed that decision.
San Jose Water Company believes that any final award to the title
company will be within the stated limits of the company's insurance
coverage.

 SERVICE

This Plan uses the hours of service method of crediting service.
Unless otherwise indicated in this Plan, the following provisions
apply for purposes of computing vesting and Credited Service.

2.01 Hour of Service.01 Hour of Service. An Hour of Service
 is:

 (a) Each hour for which an Employee is directly or
 indirectly paid or entitled to payment for the
 performance of duties. Such hours shall be credited
 for the computation period or periods in which the
 duties were performed.

 (b) Each hour for which back pay, irrespective of
 mitigation of damages, has been awarded or agreed to.
 Such hours shall be credited for the computation
 period or periods to which the award or agreement
 pertains. Such hours shall not include any hours which
 duplicate hours credited under subsection (a) above.

 (c) Each hour for which an Employee is directly or
 indirectly paid or entitled to payment for reasons
 (such as periods of paid vacation, regular holidays,
 sickness or disability, Authorized Leave of Absence,
 Military Service, temporary leave of absence, jury
 duty or non-work due to a labor-management dispute)
 other than for the performance of duties. Such hours
 shall be credited for the computation period or
 periods in which either payment is actually made or
 the amounts payable come due. Such hours shall be
 determined by dividing the payments received or due by
 the lesser of (i) the employee's most recent hourly
 rate of compensation or ii) the employee's average
 hourly rate of compensation for the most recent period
 in which he completed more than 500 Hours of Service.

 (d) Effective for absences in Plan Years beginning
 with or in calendar year 1985 and solely for purposes
 of determining whether a Break-in-Service for vesting
 purposes has occurred in a Computation Period, each
 hour an individual who is absent from work for
 maternity or paternity reasons. Such individual shall
 receive credit for the Hours of Service which would
 otherwise have been credited to such individual but
 for such absence, or in any case in which such hours
 cannot be determined, eight (8) Hours of Service per
 day of such absence. For purposes of this paragraph,
 an absence from work for maternity or paternity
 reasons means an absence (1) by reason of the
 pregnancy of the individual, (2) by reason of a birth
 of a child of the individual, (3) by reason of the
 placement of a child with the individual in connection
 with the adoption of such child by such individual, or
 (4) for purposes of caring for such child for a period
 beginning immediately following such birth or
 placement. The Hours of Service credited under this
 paragraph shall be credited (1) only in the
 Computation Period in which the absence begins if the
 crediting is necessary to prevent a Break-in-Service
 in that period, or (2) in all other cases, in the
 following Computation Period. The Administrator may
 require the Participant to furnish such timely
 information as the Administrator may reasonably
 require to establish that the absence from work was
 for maternity or paternity reasons (as described in
 this paragraph) and the number of days for which there
 was such an absence.

 (e) Such hours shall be determined pursuant to the
 rules established in Labor Department regulation 29
 CFR 2530.200b-2(b), and any succeeding regulations,
 and such hours shall be credited to Years of Service
 in accordance with the rules for crediting Hours of
 Service to computation periods established in Labor
 Department regulation 29 CFR 2530.200b-2(c) and any
 succeeding regulations.

2.02 Year of Service.02 Year of Service. Is a twelve-month
 period commencing on the first day on which an Employee
 performs an Hour of Service, or on a reemployment date,
 during which the Employee has performed at least 1,000
 Hours of Service.

2.03 Authorized Leave of Absence.03 Authorized Leave of
 Absence. Authorized Leave of Absence means an unpaid,
 temporary cessation from active employment with an
 Affiliated Company pursuant to an established policy,
 whether occasioned by illness, vacation, disability,
 layoff, or any other reason.

2.04 Military Service.04 Military Service. To the extent
 required by law, Hours of Service will be credited for
 periods of military service.

 ARTICLE III

 PARTICIPATION

3.01 Participation Date.01 Participation Date. All Employees
 who were Participants on December 31, 1992, shall continue
 to be such. All other Eligible Employees of the Company
 shall be eligible for participation in the Plan on the date
 of their employment.

3.02 Cessation and Resumption.02 Cessation and Resumption. An
 individual will cease to be a Participant when he ceases to
 have an accrued benefit under the Plan. An individual who
 ceases to be a Participant will again become a Participant
 on the date the individual performs an Hour of Service as
 an Eligible Employee.

 ARTICLE IV

 ACCRUALS

4.01 Benefit Accrual.01 Benefit Accrual. Subject to the
 provisions of Articles VI, VII and XII a Participant shall
 accrue monthly pension benefits for each year of Credited
 Service as follows: (i) for each year of Credited Service
 completed after January 1, 1978, 1.6 of average monthly
 compensation for such year; (ii) for each year of Credited
 Service completed after January 1, 1969 and prior to
 January 1, 1978, the greater of: (A) 7, or (B) 1.2 of the
 first 650 of average monthly compensation for such year
 plus 1.6 of the excess, if any, of average monthly
 compensation for such year of 650; (iii) 7 for each year
 of Credited Service completed before January 1, 1969, and
 before reaching the age of 35 years; (iv) for each year of
 Credited Service completed before January 1, 1969, but
 after reaching the age of 35 years, the greater of 7 or
 1.2 of the first 650 of average past service monthly
 compensation plus 1.6 of the excess, if any, of average
 past service monthly compensation over 650. For this
 purpose average past service monthly compensation shall be
 the average monthly compensation received by such employee
 during such part or all of the period from January l, 1964,
 through December 31, 1968, in which he was employed by the
 Company.

4.02 Minimum Benefit.02 Minimum Benefit. Notwithstanding the
 provisions of Section 4.01, but subject to the provisions
 of Section 4.04, Article VI and Article XII, the pension
 benefits accrued by each Participant who is an employee on
 or after January 1, 1981 shall not be less than a monthly
 benefit equal to an amount computed as follows:

 (a) 50 of the employee's average monthly
 compensation for the employee's thirty-six (36)
 consecutive months of highest compensation prior to
 his normal retirement date (or his earlier retirement
 or termination of employment), adjusted to a monthly
 basis for consecutive months of Credited Service less
 than thirty-six (36) and for partial months of
 Credited Service, less

 (b) 50 of the employee's Primary Insurance Amount,
 as defined in Section 4.05.

The monthly benefit determined under this Section shall be
 reduced 1/30 for each year by which the employee's Credited
 Service is less than thirty (30) years, adjusted to give
 credit for partial years of Credited Service.

4.03 Special Benefit.03 Special Benefit. Notwithstanding the
 provisions of Sections 4.01 or 4.02, but subject to the
 provisions of Article VI and Article XII, the pension
 benefits accrued by each Participant who is an employee on
 or after January 1, 1993 and whose combined age at
 retirement and Years of Service equals or exceeds eighty-
 five (85) (the combined age and and Years of Service
 requirement shall be reduced to eighty (80) for
 Participant's employed on or after January 1, 1997) shall
 not be less than a monthly benefit equal to the amount
 computed as follows:

 (a) 55 of the employee's average monthly
 compensation for the employee's thirty-six (36)
 consecutive months of highest compensation prior to
 his normal retirement date (or his earlier retirement
 or termination of employment), adjusted to a monthly
 basis for consecutive months of Credited Service less
 than thirty-six (36) and for partial months of
 Credited Service, less

 (b) 50 of the employee's Primary Insurance Amount,
 as defined in Section 4.05.

 The monthly benefit determined under this Section shall be
 reduced 1/30 for each year by which the employee's Credited
 Service is less than thirty (30) years.

4.04 Statutory Benefit.04 Statutory Benefit. In no event
 shall a Participant's pension benefit accrue at a rate less
 than the rate required by Section 411(b)(1)(A) of the Code.

4.05 Primary Insurance Amount.05 Primary Insurance Amount.

 (a) An employee's Primary Insurance Amount shall mean
 the old-age insurance benefit under Section 202 of the
 Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402) payable to each
 employee at age 65. The Primary Insurance Amount
 shall be determined under the Social Security Act as
 in effect at the time the employee's offset is
 determined. Thus, it is determined without assuming
 any future increases in the taxable wage base, any
 changes in the formulas used under the Social security
 Act to determine the Primary Insurance Amount or any
 future increases in the consumer price index. If an
 employee retires or otherwise terminates his
 employment prior to age 65, the employee's Primary
 Insurance Amount shall be computed on the assumption
 that the employee receives no wages for Social
 Security purposes after the time of his retirement or
 termination of employment.

(b) The Committee may adopt rules governing the
 computation of the amounts of Primary Insurance
 Amounts of employees, and the fact that an employee
 does not actually receive the amount computed, because
 of failure to apply or any other reason, shall be
 disregarded. If discontinuance or reduction of
 benefits under the Social Security System occurs, the
 Committee may thereafter calculate the Primary
 Insurance Amount using the benefit tables and formulas
 in effect immediately prior to such discontinuance or
 reduction of benefits. The Primary Insurance Amount
 shall be determined in a consistent manner for all
 Participants.

4.06 1985 Retiree Benefit Increase.06 1985 Retiree Benefit
 Increase. The monthly pension of each Participant who has
 retired (or Beneficiary in the case of a deceased
 Participant) shall be increased .001667 for each month or
 partial month which has elapsed from the earlier of the
 date retirement or death benefits commenced until February
 28, 1985.

4.07 1992 Retiree Benefit Increase.07 1992 Retiree Benefit
 Increase. Subject to a 21 maximum benefit increase, the
 monthly pension of each Participant (or Beneficiary in the
 case of a deceased Participant) shall be increased .25 for
 each month or partial month which has elapsed from the date
 of the initial payment of Participant retirement benefits
 until February 28, 1992.

4.08 Retirement Benefits as of Normal or Late Retirement.08
 Retirement Benefits as of Normal or Late Retirement. A
 Participant who retires at or after his Normal Retirement
 Date and a Former Participant who has not elected early
 retirement benefits, shall be entitled to a retirement
 benefit based on his accrued benefits under this Article.
 The amount may be reduced actuarially depending upon the
 form of benefit as provided in Article VII. If
 distribution of a Participant's accrued benefit begins
 after his Normal Retirement Date, the retirement benefit
 shall be greater of the accrued benefit at termination and
 the Actuarial Equivalent of his accrued benefit at Normal
 Retirement Age.

4.09 Retirement Benefits as of Early Retirement Date.09
 Retirement Benefits as of Early Retirement Date. A
 Participant who retires on or after January 1, 1981 and
 before January 1, 1987, and a Former Participant who elects
 on or after January 1, 1981 an early retirement date, shall
 be entitled to a retirement benefit based on his accrued
 benefits under this Article, but reduced in accordance with
 column (2) of Table A below based on his age at retirement
 as specified in column (1), thereof. A Participant who
 retires on or after January 1, 1987 shall be entitled to a
 retirement benefit based on his accrued benefits under this
 Article, but reduced in accordance with column (3) of Table
 A below based on his age at retirement as specified in
 column (1). A Participant who retires on or after January
 1, 1993 whose combined age at retirement and Years of
 Service equals or exceeds eighty-five (85) shall be
 entitled to a retirement benefit based on his accrued
 benefits under this Article, but reduced in accordance with
 column (4) of Table A below based on his age at retirement
 as specified in column (1). A Participant who is employed
 on or after January 1, 1997 whose combined age at
 retirement and Years of Service equals or exceeds ninety
 (90) shall be entitled to an unreduced retirement benefit
 based on his accrued benefits under this Article. The
 reduction percentages in Table A shall be prorated based on
 whole months and fractions thereof where the Participant
 retires on a date other than his birthday.

 CONTRIBUTIONS

This Plan provides for Company contributions, and does not permit
Employee contributions.

5.01 Company Contributions.01 Company Contributions.

 (a) The Company will make contributions to the Plan
 as determined from time to time by the Company and the
 Plan actuary as are required to fund the benefits
 provided for in this Plan. Actuarial gains and/or
 forfeitures, if any, arising from termination of
 participation, or from any other source, shall not be
 applied to increase the benefits any Participant would
 otherwise receive under the Plan but shall be used to
 reduce the Employer's future contributions becoming
 due thereafter.

 (b) All of the contributions to the Plan shall be
 transmitted to the Trustee and shall become a part of
 the Trust Fund to be administered by the Trustee in
 accordance with the terms of the Plan and the Trust.
 All of the benefits under the Plan will be payable by
 the Trustee from the Trust Fund pursuant to written
 instructions from the Committee.

 (c) Except as otherwise provided by law, no liability
 for payment of benefits hereunder shall be imposed
 upon the Company, its officers, directors or
 shareholders or the Committee and its members.

5.02 Deductibility.02 Deductibility. To the extent that the
 Company is not allowed a deduction under the Code for any
 contribution to the Plan for the year for which it is
 contributed, the Company will, within one year following a
 final determination of the disallowance, whether by
 agreement with the Internal Revenue Service or by final
 decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, demand
 repayment of such disallowed contribution, and the Trustee
 will return such contribution within one year following the
 disallowance. Earnings of the Plan attributable to such a
 contribution may not be returned to the Company, but any
 losses attributable to such a contribution will reduce the
 amount returned.

5.03 Mistake of Fact.03 Mistake of Fact. If, within one year
 of making a contribution to the Plan, the Committee
 certifies to the Trustee that the contribution was made by
 the Company under a mistake of fact, the Trustee will,
 before the expiration of that year, return the contribution
 to the Company.

 ARTICLE VI

 VESTING

6.01 Vesting Schedule.01 Vesting Schedule. Subject to rules in
 Article XIX, the accrued benefit of a Participant will
 become fully vested, and nonforfeitable on the earlier of
 the date on which the Participant is credited with five (5)
 Years of Service, or the date the Participant attains age
 65.

6.02 Forfeitures.02 Forfeitures. If a Participant separates
 from service before the Participant is vested in his
 accrued benefit, the Participant's accrued benefit will be
 forfeited as of the date that the Participant separates
 from service. Such a Participant's accrued benefit will be
 restored at such time as the Participant again becomes an
 Employee. Forfeitures will not be applied to increase the
 benefit any Participant would receive under the Plan but
 shall be used to reduce the Company's future contributions
 becoming due thereafter.

6.03 Change in Vesting Schedule.03 Change in Vesting Schedule.
 If the Plan's vesting schedule is changed for any reason,
 including a change by reason of the Plan becoming Top-Heavy
 or ceasing to be Top-Heavy, the vested percentage of every
 Employee who is a Participant on the amendment adoption
 date or the amendment effective date, whichever is later,
 will not be less than the Participant's vested percentage
 determined under the Plan without regard to the amendment.
 In addition, if the Plan's vesting schedule is changed,
 each Participant who has completed three Years of Service
 and whose vested percentage is determined under the new
 vesting schedule may elect to have his vested percentage
 determined under the old vesting schedule if the old
 vesting schedule would be more favorable.

 ARTICLE VII

 BENEFIT FORMS

This Article outlines the Normal Forms of Benefit provided under
the Plan, and the requirements for electing optional forms of
benefit.

7.01 Normal Forms of Benefit.01 Normal Forms of Benefit.

 (a) If a Participant is not married on his Annuity
 Starting Date, the Participant's Normal Form of
 Benefit will be a straight life annuity.

 (b) If a Participant is married on his Annuity
 Starting Date, the Participant's Normal Form of
 Benefit will be a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity
 that provides an annuity for the life of the
 Participant and a survivor annuity for the life of the
 Participant's spouse that is equal to 50 of the
 amount of the annuity payable during the Participant's
 lifetime. The Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity
 will be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant's
 Normal, Early or, Late Retirement Benefit, as the case
 may be, calculated as though the Participant were not
 married on his Annuity Starting Date.

7.02 Optional Forms of Benefit.02 Optional Forms of Benefit.
 Subject to the waiver procedures outlined below, a
 Participant may designate, in a manner prescribed by the
 Committee, that retirement benefits be paid in one of the
 following optional forms, instead of in the Normal Form of
 Benefit. A benefit paid in an optional form of benefit
 will be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant's
 Normal, Early, or Late Retirement Benefit, as the case may
 be, calculated as though the Participant were not married
 on his Annuity Starting Date.

 (a) A straight life annuity payable to the
 Participant during the Participant's lifetime.

 (b) A reduced monthly benefit payable for a 10-year
 period to the Participant and, should the Participant
 die within the 10-year period, to the Participant's
 designated Beneficiary for the balance of the 10-year
 period. If, however, the Participant should live
 longer than 10 years, this benefit will continue to be
 paid to the Participant for the Participant's
 lifetime.

7.03 Cessation.03 Cessation. A Participant's retirement
 annuity will terminate with the last monthly payment
 preceding the Participant's death. If a Participant
 receives Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, the
 Beneficiary's annuity will terminate with the last monthly
 payment preceding the Beneficiary's death. If a
 Participant elects a 10-year certain and life annuity, the
 Beneficiary's retirement annuity will terminate on the date
 of the last payment under the term certain period. Should
 the Beneficiary of such a term certain annuity die before
 the end of the term certain period, the balance of the term
 certain benefit will be paid to the Beneficiary's estate.

7.04 Waiver of Normal Form of Benefit.04 Waiver of Normal
 Form of Benefit. A Participant's waiver of the Normal Form
 of Benefit must satisfy the following conditions:

 (a) Conditions Applicable to All Participants.

 (1) No less than 30 days and no more than
 90 days before the Annuity Starting Date, the
 Committee will provide the Participant with a
 written explanation of the terms and conditions
 of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, the
 Participant's right to make, and the effect of,
 an election to waive the Qualified Joint and
 Survivor Annuity, the rights of the Participant's
 spouse to approve such a waiver, the
 Participant's right to revoke such a waiver and
 the effect of the Participant's right to revoke
 such a waiver.

 (2) A Participant's waiver must be made on
 a form prepared by, and delivered to, the
 Committee no earlier than 90 days before the
 Participant's Annuity Starting Date.

 (3) Participants may revoke or change their
 waivers at any time prior to their Annuity
 Starting Date by delivering a subsequent form to
 the Committee.

 (b) Additional Conditions Applicable to Married
 Participants.

 (1) A Participant's surviving spouse must
 consent to the Participant's waiver of the Normal
 Form of Benefit in a written document, delivered
 to the Committee, that acknowledges the effect of
 the waiver, and that is witnessed by a notary
 public. In the waiver, the Participant's
 surviving spouse must either consent to the
 specific non-spouse Beneficiary or Beneficiaries
 named by the Participant, and the optional form
 of benefit selected by the Participant, or
 acknowledge that the surviving spouse had the
 right to limit consent only to a specific non-
 spouse Beneficiary or Beneficiaries, and to a
 specific optional form of benefit, and that the
 surviving spouse voluntarily elected to
 relinquish that right.

 (2) If the Participant is legally separated
 or abandoned (within the meaning of local law)
 and the Participant has a court order to that
 effect (and there is no Qualified Domestic
 Relations Order as defined in Code Section 414(p)
 that provides otherwise), or the surviving spouse
 cannot be located, then the waiver described in
 the preceding paragraph need not be filed with
 the Committee when a married Participant elects
 an optional form of benefit.

 (3) Any waiver by a spouse obtained
 pursuant to these procedures (or establishment
 that the consent of a spouse could not be
 obtained) shall be effective only with respect to
 that spouse.

7.05 Amounts of 3,500 or Less.05 Amounts of 3,500 or Less.
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, if a
 vested Participant separates from service with the Company
 and with all Affiliated Companies, and the present value of
 that Participant's Normal Retirement Benefit has never
 exceeded 3,500, the Committee may, without the consent of
 the Participant or the Participant's spouse, distribute the
 present value of the benefit to the Participant or the
 Participant's Beneficiary, as the case may be, as soon as
 administratively feasible. Similarly, if a Qualified
 Preretirement Survivor Annuity has become payable under the
 Plan, and the present value of that benefit has never
 exceeded 3,500, the Committee may, without the consent of
 the Beneficiary, distribute the present value of the
 benefit to the Beneficiary.

7.06 No Vested Benefit.06 No Vested Benefit. If the present
 value of an individual's vested accrued benefit is zero,
 the individual will be deemed to have received a
 distribution of that vested accrued benefit as of the date
 of termination.

 ARTICLE VIII

 REEMPLOYMENT

8.01 Repayment.01 Repayment. As permitted under Section
 411(a)(7)(C) of the Code, if a Participant who has received
 less than 100 of his accrued benefit again becomes an
 Eligible Employee, the Participant may repay in cash the
 total amount that he received under the Plan with interest
 from the date of receipt at the rate permitted under
 Section 411(c)(2)(C) of the Code. Such repayment must be
 made by delivering the required amount to the Trustee
 within 5 years after the date on which the Participant
 again becomes an Eligible Employee. By making this
 repayment, the Participant will be entitled to have
 reinstated the Credited Service with which the Participant
 was credited as of the date of the separation from service
 to which the benefit relates and to have no reduction made
 to any subsequent benefit under the Plan for any prior
 benefit payments.

8.02 Suspension Upon Reemployment.02 Suspension Upon
 Reemployment. If a Participant who has separated from
 service again becomes an Employee, any Plan benefit payable
 to the Participant will be continued for each month during
 which the Participant would not be credited with forty
 Hours of Service or such other amount of time that does not
 constitute Section 203(a)(3)(B) service under ERISA. Any
 benefits to which the Participant may become entitled
 because of this subsequent separation from service will be
 actuarially determined on the basis of increased service,
 age and other relevant factors and will be actuarially
 reduced for payments received before reemployment unless
 the Participant repaid all such amounts in accordance with
 the preceding Section.

8.03 Resumption.03 Resumption. Benefits suspended because they
 constitute Section 203(a)(3)(B) service under ERISA will
 resume on the first day of the calendar month coincident
 with or next following the calendar month in which the
 Participant ceases such service and has notified the
 appropriate Company of such cessation of service.

8.04 Death.04 Death. If a Participant dies while benefits are
 suspended, with respect to the Participant's retirement
 benefits earned before the suspension, a death benefit will
 be paid as provided under the form of benefit payment
 previously elected by the Participant, and will be based on
 the benefit that would have been paid if the Participant
 had again retired on the date of death. With respect to
 the benefit earned during the suspension, any death
 benefits will be provided in accordance with Article IX.

 DEATH BENEFITS

9.01 Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity.01 Qualified
 Preretirement Survivor Annuity. If a married Participant
 dies after his accrued benefit has vested, but before his
 Annuity Starting Date, that Participant's surviving spouse
 will be entitled to a Qualified Preretirement Survivor
 Annuity if the surviving spouse had been married to the
 Participant as of the applicable retirement date or as of
 the earlier date of death of the Participant.

 (a) The Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity will
 become payable on the later of (1) the first day of
 the month coinciding with or next following the
 Participant's death, or (2) the first date on which
 the Participant would have been eligible to receive a
 Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity.

 (b) The Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity will
 be 50 of the amount the Participant would have
 received had the Participant terminated employment on
 the day before the Participant's death without having
 waived a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity. In the
 case of a vested Participant who dies on or before the
 date that he or she would have been eligible to
 receive a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, the
 value of the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity
 will be computed as though the Participant had
 survived until he was eligible to receive a Qualified
 Joint and Survivor Annuity, retired at that time with
 an immediate Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, and
 died the next day.

9.02 Alternative Calculation.02 Alternative Calculation. If,
 within 90 days before the Participant's Annuity Starting
 Date, the Participant properly elects an optional form of
 benefit under Article VII that will provide the
 Participant's spouse with a death benefit of equal or
 greater value than the calculation under the immediately
 preceding Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity
 calculation, the death benefit under the properly elected
 optional form of benefit will be the Qualified
 Preretirement Survivor Annuity.

9.03 Death Benefit.03 Death Benefit. Effective March 1,
 1995, if an unmarried Participant dies after his accrued
 benefit has vested, but before his Annuity Starting Date,
 his Beneficiaries are entitled to a Death Benefit.

 (a) The Death Benefit will become payable on the
 later of (1) the first day of the month coinciding
 with or next following the Participant's death, or (2)
 the first date on which the Participant would have
 been eligible to receive a retirement benefit.

 (b) A death Benefit will be equal to the monthly
 retirement benefit the Participant would have received
 had the Participant terminated employment on the day
 before the Participant's death and elected to receive
 the optional form of benefit described in Section
 7.02(b) of the Plan. In the case of a vested
 Participant who dies on or before the date that he
 would have been eligible to receive a retirement
 benefit, the amount of the Death Benefit will be
 computed as though the Participant had survived until
 he was eligible to receive a retirement benefit,
 retired at that time and elected to receive the
 optional form of benefit described in Section 7.02(b)
 of the Plan, and died the next day.

 ARTICLE XI

 DISTRIBUTIONS

11.01 Distribution.01 Distribution. Once Plan benefits have
 become payable, they will be distributed at such time as is
 administratively feasible after the Participant or the
 Beneficiary, as the case may be, has elected a distribu
 tion, in writing, subject to the following provisions:

 (a) There shall be no distribution of benefits to a
 Participant or his Beneficiary prior to termination of
 the Participant's employment, unless such Participant
 has attained his Normal Retirement Date and his
 combined age at the time of his election to begin
 receiving distribution of Plan benefits and Years of
 Service equals or exceeds one hundred (100).

 (b) If a Participant does not elect a distribution,
 in writing, benefits will be distributed within the
 60 days following the end of the Plan Year in which
 the Participant attains age 65 or separates from
 service, whichever occurs later.

 (c) If the amount of a distribution cannot be
 determined by the date payment is required, or it is
 not possible to make such payment because the
 Committee has been unable to locate the recipient
 after making reasonable efforts to do so, a payment
 retroactive to the date payment is required may be
 made no later than 60 days after the earliest date on
 which the amount of the payment can be determined, or
 the date on which the recipient is located (whichever
 is applicable).

 (d) If a distribution is to be made to a minor, or to
 an incompetent person, the Committee may direct that
 the distribution be paid to the legal guardian, or if
 none, to a parent of such person, or to a responsible
 adult with whom the person maintains residence, or to
 the custodian for the person under the Uniform Gift to
 Minors Act or Gift to Minors Act, if permitted by the
 laws of the state in which the person resides.

 (e) If a benefit under the Plan remains unpaid for 2
 years from the date it becomes payable, solely because
 the Committee, exercising due diligence, cannot locate
 the recipient, the benefit will be treated as a
 forfeiture.

 (1) Any such forfeited amount will be
 restored, without earnings, upon presentation of
 an authenticated written claim by the recipient
 or the recipient's personal representative.

 (2) For purposes of this section, due
 diligence includes written notice to the
 recipient at the last known address shown in the
 relevant Company's records, and contacts with the
 federal Social Security Administration designed
 to determine the whereabouts of the recipient.

11.02 Required Beginning Date.02 Required Beginning Date.

 Section 401(a)(9), and the incidental death benefit
 requirements in Code Section 401(a)(9)(G).
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan,
 a Participant may not defer commencement of his
 benefits past his required beginning date. A
 Participant's required beginning date is April 1 of
 the calendar year following the calendar year in which
 the Participant attains age 70-1/2, or such earlier
 date on which payments have irrevocably begun as an
 annuity.

 (b) If the Participant dies after the Participant's
 required beginning date, the remaining portion of that
 Participant's accrued benefit shall continue to be
 distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of
 distribution being used prior to the Participant's
 death.

 (c) If the Participant dies before his required
 beginning date, the date distributions are required to
 begin to the Participant's surviving spouse shall not
 be earlier than the later of December 31 of the
 calendar year immediately following the calendar year
 in which the Participant died and December 31 of the
 calendar year in which the Participant would have
 attained age 70-1/2. The date that distributions are
 required to begin to a designated Beneficiary who is
 not the Participant's surviving spouse shall be
 December 31 of the calendar year immediately following
 the calendar year of the Participant's death.

11.03 Limit of Benefits for 25 Highest Paid Employees.03
 Limit of Benefits for 25 Highest Paid Employees. This
 Section sets forth limitations required by the Internal
 Revenue Service on the Normal Retirement Benefit payable to
 certain Participants in the event of an early termination
 of the Plan. It shall apply to a Participant only if he is
 a Highly-Compensated Employee or former Highly-Compensated
 Employee, who is one of the 25 nonexcludable employees and
 former employees of the employer with the largest amount of
 compensation in the current or any prior year on the
 original effective date of the Plan ("Restricted
 Employee").

 (a) In the event of Plan termination, the benefit of
 any Highly-compensated Employee and any former Highly-
 Compensated Employee is limited to a benefit that is
 nondiscriminatory under Code Section 401(a)(4).

 (b) In any year, the payment of benefits to or on
 behalf of a Restricted Employee shall not exceed an
 amount equal to the payments that would be made to or
 on behalf of the Restricted Employee in that year
 under:

 (1) A straight life annuity that is the
 Actuarial Equivalent of the Accrued Benefit and
 other benefits to which the Restricted Employee
 is entitled under the Plan (other than a social
 security supplement); and

 (2) A social security supplement, if any,
 that the Restricted Employee is entitled to
 receive.

 (c) For purposes of this Section, the term benefit
 includes, among other benefits, loans in excess of the
 amounts set forth in Code Section 72(p)(2)(A), any
 periodic income, any withdrawal values payable to a
 living Employee or former Employee, and any death
 benefits not provided for by insurance on the
 Employee's or former Employee's life.

 (d) If one of the following requirements is
 satisfied, the restrictions of this section 11.03(a)
 and (b) shall not apply:

 (1) After taking into account payment to or
 on behalf of the Restricted Employee of all
 benefits payable to or on behalf of that
 Restricted Empoyee of all benefits payable to or
 on behalf of that Restricted Employee under the
 Plan, the value of Plan assets must equal or
 exceed 110 percent of the value of current
 liabilities, as defined in Code Section
 412(l)(7).

 (2) The value of the benefits payable to or
 on behalf of the Restricted Employee must be less
 than one percent of the value of current
 liabilities before distribution.

 (3) The value of the benefits payable to or
 on behalf of the Restricted Employee must not
 exceed the amount described in Code Section
 411(a)(11)(A) (restrictions on certain mandatory
 distributions).

11.04 Annuity Contracts.04 Annuity Contracts. Annuity
 contracts purchased and distributed under the Plan will
 satisfy all requirements of the Retirement Equity Act.

11.05 Timing.05 Timing. Subject to Regulation 1.411(a)-11(c)(7)
 and the provisions of this Plan, benefits to a Former
 Participant will become distributable no later than 60 days
 after the last to occur of (a) the last day of the Plan
 Year in which the Participant attains age 65, (b) the last
 day of the Plan Year in which the Participant separates
 from employment with all Affiliated Companies, or (c) the
 10th anniversary of the last day of the Plan Year in which
 the Participant commenced participation in the Plan.

11.06 Satisfaction of Claims.06 Satisfaction of Claims. Any
 payment to a Participant, the Participant's legal
 representative or Beneficiary, in accordance with the terms
 of this Plan and the Trust, shall, to the extent thereof,
 be in full satisfaction of all claims such person may have
 against the Trustee, the Committee and the Company, any of
 whom may condition the payment upon execution of a receipt
 and release therefor as determined by the Trustee, the
 Committee or the Company.

11.07 Source.07 Source. All Plan benefits will be paid solely
 from the Trust, and the Company assume no liability or
 responsibility therefor.

11.08 Determinations.08 Determinations. The amount of any Plan
 benefit will be determined under Plan provisions in effect
 when the Participant separated from service.

11.09 Mistaken Payments.09 Mistaken Payments. Benefits
 improperly paid to a person will be owed by that person to
 the Plan and, notwithstanding any other provisions of this
 Plan, may be deducted from future benefits payable to the
 person entitled to receive such benefits.

11.10 Direct Rollover.10 Direct Rollover. Effective January 1,
 1993, notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the
 contrary that would otherwise limit a Distributee's
 election under this Plan, a Distributee may elect, at the
 time and in the manner prescribed by the Committee, to have
 any portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution paid
 directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the
 Distributee in a Direct Rollover. For these purposes, the
 following definitions apply:

 (a) An Eligible Rollover Distribution is any
 distribution of all or any portion of the balance to
 the credit of the Distributee, except that an Eligible
 Rollover Distribution does not include: any
 distribution that is one of a series of substantially
 equal periodic payments (not less frequently than
 annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of
 the Distributee or the joint lives (or joint life
 expectancies) of the Distributee and the Distributee's
 designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of
 10 years or more; any distribution to the extent that
 distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of
 the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is
 not includable in gross income.

 (b) An Eligible Retirement Plan is an individual
 retirement account described in Code Section 408(a),

 Section 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code
 Section 403(a), or a qualified trust described in Code
 Section 401(a), that accepts the Distributee's
 Eligible Rollover Distribution. However, in the case

 retirement account or individual retirement annuity.

 (c) A Distributee includes an Employee or former
 Employee. In addition, the Employee's or former
 Employee's surviving spouse and the Employee's or
 former Employee's spouse or former spouse who is the
 alternate payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations
 Order, as defined in Code Section 414(p), are
 Distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse
 or former spouse.

 (d) A Direct Rollover is a payment by the Plan to the
 Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee.

 ARTICLE XII

 LIMITATIONS ON BENEFITS

This Article outlines the requirements of Code Section 415 and is
effective January 1, 1987.

12.01 Section 415 Limitation.01 Section 415 Limitation. The
 annual benefit (as defined below) payable to a Participant
 at any time will not exceed the maximum permissible amount
 (as defined below). This limit will be deemed satisfied if
 the annual benefit is not more than 1,000 multiplied by
 the Participant's Years of Service or parts thereof (not to
 exceed 10) with an Affiliated Company, and the Affiliated
 Company has not at any time maintained a defined
 contribution plan, a welfare benefit plan as defined in
 Code Section 419(e), or an individual medical account as
 defined in Code Section 415(1)(2) in which the Participant
 participated.

12.02 Annual Benefit.02 Annual Benefit. An annual benefit is a
 retirement benefit that is payable annually in the form of
 a straight life annuity. Except as provided below, a
 benefit payable in a form other than a straight life
 annuity must be adjusted to an actuarially equivalent
 straight life annuity before applying the limitations of
 this Article.

 (a) The interest rate assumption used to determine
 actuarial equivalence will be the greater of the
 interest rate specified in the Plan's definition of
 Actuarial Equivalent, or 5 .

 (b) The annual benefit does not include any benefits
 attributable to Employee contributions, to rollover
 contributions, or to assets transferred from a
 qualified plan that was not maintained by an
 Affiliated Company.

 (c) No actuarial adjustment is required for: (i) the
 value of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity; (ii)
 the value of benefits that are not directly related to
 retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability
 benefit, pre-retirement death benefits, and post-
 retirement medical benefits); and (iii) the value of
 post-retirement cost-of-living increases made in
 accordance with Code Section 415(d) and Regulation
 1.415-3(c)(2)(iii).

12.03 Maximum Permissible Amount.03 Maximum Permissible Amount.

 (a) The lesser of the defined benefit dollar
 limitation of Code Section 415 (b)(1)(A) which was
 90,000 in 1987, or the compensation limitation which
 is 100 of the Participant's highest average
 Remuneration, as defined in Code Section 415(b)(3), as
 adjusted automatically pursuant to Regulations to
 reflect cost of living increases.

 (b) If a Participant has fewer than 10 years of
 participation (as defined below) in this Plan, the
 defined benefit dollar limitation is reduced by 1/10
 for each year of participation (or part thereof) less
 than 10, and the compensation limitation is reduced by
 1/10 for each Year of Service (or part thereof) less
 than 10. These adjustments shall be applied in the
 denominator of the defined benefit fraction based upon
 Years of Service. Years of Service shall include
 future years occurring before the Participant's Normal
 Retirement Age, only if it can be reasonably
 anticipated that the Participant will receive a Year
 of Service for such a year.

 (1) A Participant will be credited with a
 year of participation (computed to fractional
 parts of a year) for each accrual computation
 period for which the following conditions are
 met: (i) The Participant is credited with at
 least the number of Hours of Service (or period
 of service if the elapsed time method is used)
 required under the terms of the Plan in order to
 accrue a benefit, and (ii) The Participant is
 included as a Participant under the eligibility
 provisions of the Plan for at least one day of
 the accrual computation period.

 If above two conditions are met, the portion of a
 year of participation credited to the Participant
 shall equal the amount of benefit accrual service
 credited to the Participant for such accrual
 computation period. A Participant who is permanently
 and totally disabled within the meaning of Code
 Section 415(c)(3)(C)(i) for an accrual computation
 period shall receive a year of participation with
 respect to that period. In addition, for a
 Participant to receive a year of participation (or
 part thereof) for an accrual computation period, the
 Plan must be established no later than the last day of
 such accrual computation period. In no event will
 more than one year of participation be credited for
 any 12-month period.

 (2) To the extent provided in Regulations,
 or in other guidance issued by the Internal
 Revenue Service, the participation limit
 applicable to the defined benefit dollar
 limitation shall also be applied separately with
 respect to each change in the benefit structure
 of the Plan.

 (c) If the annual benefit of the Participant
 commences before the Participant's social security
 retirement age (as defined below), but on or after age
 62, the defined benefit dollar limitation, as reduced
 above if necessary, shall be determined as follows:

 (1) If a Participant's social security
 retirement age is 65, the dollar limitation for
 benefits commencing on or after age 62 is
 determined by reducing the defined benefit dollar
 limitation by 5/9 of 1 for each month by which
 benefits commence before the month in which the
 Participant attains age 65.

(2) If a Participant's social security
 retirement age is greater than age 65, the dollar
 limitation for benefits commencing on or after
 age 62 is determined by reducing the defined
 benefit dollar limitation by 5/9 of 1 for each
 of the first 36 months and 5/12 of 1 for each of
 the additional months (up to 24 months) by which
 benefits commence before the month of the
 Participant's social security retirement age.

 (d) If the annual benefit of a Participant begins
 before age 62, the defined benefit dollar limitation
 will be the actuarial equivalent of an annual benefit
 beginning at age 62, as determined above, reduced for
 each month by which benefits commence before the month
 in which the Participant attains age 62. To determine
 actuarial equivalence, the interest rate assumption is
 the greater of the rate specified in the Plan's
 definition of Actuarial Equivalent, or 5 . Any
 decrease in the defined benefit dollar limitation
 determined in accordance with this provision shall not
 reflect the mortality decrement to the extent that
 benefits will not be forfeited upon the death of the
 Participant.

 (e) If the annual benefit of a Participant commences
 after the Participant's social security retirement
 age, the defined benefit dollar limitation shall be
 increased so that it is the actuarial equivalent of an
 annual benefit beginning at the Participant's social
 security retirement age. To determine actuarial
 equivalence, the interest rate assumption used will be
 the lesser of the rate specified in the Plan's
 definition of Actuarial Equivalent or 5 .

 (f) Age 65 for a Participant born before January 1,
 1938; age 66 for a Participant born after December 31,
 1937, but before January 1, 1955; and age 67 for a
 Participant born after December 31, 1954.

12.04 Adjustment.04 Adjustment. If the benefit the Participant
 would otherwise accrue in a limitation year would produce
 an annual benefit in excess of the maximum permissible
 amount, the rate of the Participant's benefit accrual will
 be reduced so that the annual benefit will equal the
 maximum permissible amount.

12.05 Multiple Defined Benefit Plans.05 Multiple Defined Benefit
 Plans. If a Participant has ever been covered under more
 than one defined benefit plan maintained by an Affiliated
 Company, and the sum of the Participant's annual benefits
 from all such plans would exceed the maximum permissible
 amount, the rate of the Participant's benefit accrual in
 each of the plans will be reduced, pro rata, so that the
 annual benefit will equal the maximum permissible amount.

12.06 Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution Plans.06 Defined
 Benefit and Defined Contribution Plans. If the Affiliated
 Company maintains, or at any time maintained, one or more
 qualified defined contribution plans covering any
 Participant in this plan, a welfare benefit fund, as
 defined in Code Section 419(e), or an individual medical
 account as defined in Code Section 415(1)(2), the sum of
 the Participant's defined contribution fraction (as defined
 below) and defined benefit fraction (as defined below) will
 not exceed 1.0 in any limitation year. The Plan Year shall
 be the limitation year.

 (a) Defined Benefit Fraction means that fraction, the
 numerator of which is the Participant's projected
 annual benefit (defined below), determined as of the
 close of the Plan Year, under all defined benefit
 plans of all Affiliated Companies and the denominator
 of which is the lesser of: (i) the product of 1.25 and
 the dollar limitation in effect under Code Section
 415(b)(1)(A) for such Plan Year; or (ii) the product
 of 1.4 and the compensation limitation, which is the
 Participant's average annual Remuneration for the
 three consecutive Plan Years for which such average is
 the highest. A Participant's "projected annual
 benefit" shall be equal to the total annual benefit to
 which the Participant would be entitled under all
 defined benefit plans of all Affiliated Companies if
 the Participant were to remain an Employee until
 normal retirement age under each such plan and all
 other relevant factors used to determine benefits
 under such plans were to remain constant for all
 future Plan Years.

 (b) Defined Contribution Fraction means that
 fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the
 Annual Additions (as defined below) to the
 Participant's accounts under each defined contribution
 plan maintained by an Affiliated Company for the Plan
 Year and all prior Plan Years (less the amount, if
 any, permitted to be subtracted under: (i) the transi
 tional rule of Section 235(g)(3) of the Tax Equity and
 Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982; or (ii) the
 transitional rule of Section 1106(h)(4) of the Tax
 Reform Act of 1986) and the denominator of which is
 the lesser of the following amounts with respect to
 the Plan Year and each prior Plan Year during which
 the Participant was an employee of an Affiliated
 Company: (A) the product of 1.25 and the dollar limit
 in effect under Code Section 415(c)(1)(A) (without
 regard to Code Section 415(c)(6)) for such Plan Year;
 or (B) the product of 1.4 and 25 of the Participant's
 Remuneration for the Plan Year; provided that the
 Committee may, in its discretion, calculate the denomi
 nator of the Defined Contribution Fraction for all
 defined contribution plans of Affiliated Companies
 using the alternative method set forth in Code
 Section 415(e)(6).

12.07 Annual Addition.07 Annual Addition. For purposes of this
 Article, "Annual Addition" means, for any Plan Year, the
 aggregate amount (excluding Rollover Contributions and
 trustee-to-trustee transfers) credited to a Participant's
 accounts under each defined contribution plan of an
 Affiliated Company with respect to such Plan Year from:

 (a) Company contributions and forfeitures allocated
 to a Participant's account (excluding any amount
 reinstated to an account pursuant to Code Sections
 411(a)(7)(C) (cash-outs) or 411(a)(3)(D) (mandatory
 contributions)).

 (b) A Participant's own contributions made on behalf
 of the Participant; provided, however, that the Annual
 Addition for any Plan Year beginning before January 1,
 1987, shall not be recomputed to treat all Participant
 contributions as Annual Additions.

 (c) With respect to a Participant who is a key
 employee, as defined in Code Section 416(i), with
 respect to such Plan Year or any preceding Plan Year,
 any amount paid or accrued to such Participant's
 account under a welfare benefit fund pursuant to
 Section 419A(d) of the Code and contributions to an
 individual medical account (as defined in Section
 415(1) of the Code) for a Participant as part of a
 defined benefit plan.

12.08 Adjustments.08 Adjustments. If the sum of the defined
 benefit fraction and the defined contribution fraction
 would exceed 1.0 in any limitation year for a Participant,
 and if an adjustment would, therefore, be required by law,
 the Committee shall adjust the numerator of the defined
 benefit fraction so that the sum of both fractions shall
 not exceed 1.0 in any limitation year for the Participant.

 (a) If, due to required top heavy adjustments
 pursuant to Code Section 416(h), or due to excess
 benefit accruals or Annual Additions pursuant to
 Internal Revenue Service Notice 82-19, the 1.0 limit
 is exceeded for a Participant in any limitation year,
 the Participant will be subject to the following
 restrictions for each future limitation year until the
 1.0 limitation is satisfied: (i) the Participant's
 accrued benefit shall not increase, and (ii) no
 Annual Additions may be credited to a Participant's
 account under a defined contribution plan of an
 Affiliated Company and (iii) No Employee
 contributions (voluntary or mandatory) may be made
 under any defined benefit plan or any defined
 contribution plan of an Affiliated Company.

 (b) In the case of an individual who was a
 Participant in one or more defined benefit plans of
 the Employer as of the first day of the first
 limitation year beginning after December 31, 1986, the
 application of the limits of this Article will not
 cause the maximum permissible amount for such
 individual under all such defined benefit plans to be
 less than the individual's current accrued benefit (as
 defined below).

 (1) The preceding sentence applies only if
 such defined benefit plans met the requirements
 of Code Section 415, for all limitation years
 beginning before May 6, 1986.

 (2) A Participant's current accrued benefit
 is the Participant's accrued benefit, determined
 as if the Participant had separated from service
 as of the close of the last limitation year
 beginning before January 1, 1987, when expressed
 as an annual benefit. In determining a
 Participant's current accrued benefit, the
 following shall be disregarded: (i) any change
 in the terms and conditions of the plan after
 May 5, 1986 and (ii) any cost of living
 adjustments occurring after May 5, 1986.

12.09 Top-Heavy Adjustment.09 Top-Heavy Adjustment. With
 respect to any Plan Year for which the Plan is Top-heavy as
 described in Article XIX, the definitions of Defined
 Contribution Fraction and Defined Benefit Fraction shall be
 modified by substituting 1.0 for 1.25; provided, however,
 in no event, shall the accrued benefit or account balance
 of any Participant be reduced below the amount of such
 accrued benefit or account balance immediately before the
 Plan became top-heavy.

 ARTICLE XIV

 shall not result in loss of pay.

15.02 Power.02 Power.

 (a) The Committee has full discretionary authority to
 administer and interpret the Plan, including
 discretionary authority to determine eligibility for
 participation and benefits under the Plan, to appoint
 one or more investment managers, and to correct
 errors. The Committee may delegate its discretionary

 deems appropriate to facilitate the day-to-day
 administration of the Plan. Determinations by the

 appointment or revocation of one or more
 investment managers).

 (c) All discretion conferred upon the Committee shall
 be absolute, but no discretionary power conferred on
 the Committee or in the Trustee or retained by the
 Company shall be exercised in such a manner as to
 cause or create discrimination in favor of employees
 who are officers or shareholders of the Company or
 highly compensated employees or persons whose
 principal duties consist of supervising the work of
 other employees.

 (d) The members of the Committee, the Company, and
 its officers and directors shall be entitled to rely
 conclusively upon all tables, valuations, certificates
 and reports furnished by any actuary or accountant

 ARTICLE XVIXVI

 PLAN AMENDMENTS

16.01 Power.01 Power. Subject to the limitation set forth in
 Section 16.03 hereof, this Plan may be amended at any time
 and from time to time in whole or in part by the Board of
 Directors of the Company. Additionally, the Board of
 Directors may delegate authority to amend the Plan to the
 President of the Company together with any other officer of
 the Company, for the sole purpose of amending the Plan to
 ensure that it qualifies under applicable revenue laws. Any
 amendment to this Plan adopted by these corporate officers
 shall be adopted in writing, executed by all officers to
 whom the authority to amend has been delegated. No
 amendment shall permit any part of the Trust Fund to revert
 to or be recoverable by the Company or to be used for or
 diverted to any purpose other than to provide benefits for
 Participants, joint annuitants and beneficiaries under the
 Plan and to defray the expense of administration of the
 Plan.

16.02 Limits.02 Limits. No amendment to the Plan (including a
 change in the Actuarial Equivalence for determining
 optional retirement benefits) shall be adopted to the
 extent that it has the effect of decreasing a Participant's
 accrued benefit. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a
 Participant's accrued benefit may be reduced to the extent
 permitted under Section 412(i)(8) of the Code. For purposes
 of this paragraph, a plan amendment which has the effect
 of: (i) eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit
 or a retirement-type subsidy; or (ii) eliminating an
 optional form of benefit, with respect to benefits
 attributable to service before the amendment shall be
 treated as reducing accrued benefits. In the case of a
 retirement-type subsidy, the preceding sentence shall apply
 only with respect to a Participant who satisfies (either
 before or after the amendment) the preamendment conditions
 for the subsidy. In general, a retirement-type subsidy is
 a subsidy that continues after retirement, but does not
 include a disability benefit, a medical benefit, a social
 security supplement, a death benefit (including life
 insurance) or a facility shutdown benefit (that does not
 continue after retirement age).

16.03 Limitation on Amendment or Termination of Plan.03
 Limitation on Amendment or Termination of Plan. For the
 term of the Agreement between the Company and the Union, of
 which this Plan becomes a part by incorporation, but
 without commitment or liability thereafter, the Company
 agrees not to exercise its rights to amend or terminate the
 Plan for any reason other than those particularly specified
 in this Plan or in said Agreement.

 ARTICLE XVII

 DISCONTINUANCE AND TRANSFERS

17.01 Power.01 Power. Subject to the limitations set forth in
 Section 16.03, the Company is under no obligation or
 liability to continue its contributions to, or to maintain
 the Plan for, any given length of time. The Company may,
 in its sole discretion, with respect to its Eligible
 Employees, discontinue contributions or terminate the Plan,
 in whole or in part, at any time without any liability
 whatsoever for such discontinuance or termination.

17.02 Effect of Discontinuance.02 Effect of Discontinuance. If
 the Company decides to discontinue contributions to the
 Plan, the duties of the Committee and the Trustee under the
 Plan will continue as before, and the provisions of the
 Plan (other than provisions for contributions and benefit
 accruals) will remain in force.

17.03 Effect of Termination.03 Effect of Termination. In the
 event of a termination or a partial termination of the
 Plan, the accrued benefits of all directly affected
 Participants will become vested, and the assets of the Plan
 will be allocated in accordance with Section 4044 of ERISA.
 In the event of a Plan termination, any residual assets of
 the Plan will be distributed to the Company, provided that
 all liabilities of the Plan to Participants and their
 Beneficiaries have been satisfied, and the distribution
 does not contravene applicable law.

17.04 Determination of Partial Termination.04 Determination of
 Partial Termination. For purposes of determining whether a
 partial termination has occurred, all Employees will be
 deemed employed by the same employer. A partial
 termination of the Plan will not be deemed to occur solely
 by reason of the sale or transfer of all or substantially
 all of the assets of the Company, but will be deemed to
 occur only if there is a determination, either made or
 agreed to by the Committee, or made by the Internal Revenue
 Service and upheld by a decision of a court of last resort,
 that a particular event or transaction (including the sale
 or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of
 the Company) constitutes a partial termination within the
 meaning of Code Section 411(d)(3)(A).

17.05 Mergers and Transfers.05 Mergers and Transfers.

 (a) This Plan may be merged or consolidated with
 another tax-qualified retirement Plan, and assets and
 liabilities may be transferred from this Plan to any
 other retirement plan qualified under Section 401 of
 the Code if each Participant is entitled to receive
 from the recipient plan, a benefit immediately after
 the merger, consolidation or transfer (if such plan
 were then terminated) that is equal to or greater than
 the benefit the Participant would have been entitled
 to receive under the transferring plan if the
 transferring plan had been terminated immediately
 before the merger, consolidation or transfer. If
 assets are transferred from this Plan, the Committee
 will satisfy the distribution requirements of Proposed
 Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-G-3.

 (b) In the event of termination or partial
 termination of the Plan, a Participant or Former
 Participant shall have no recourse towards
 satisfaction of his nonforfeitable benefits against
 the Company and instead may recover only from Plan
 Assets and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

 RETIREMENT PLAN

18.01 Merger of Plans.01 Merger of Plans. The Retirement Plan
 for the employees of the Campbell Water Company
 (hereinafter referred to as the "Campbell Water Plan") has
 been merged with the Plan as of July 1, 1981, and the terms
 of the Plan shall govern on and after that date for all
 purposes except as otherwise indicated in this Article
 XVIII.

18.02 Service with Campbell Water Company.02 Service with

 person who was a Participant of the Campbell Water Plan
 with vested benefits under the Campbell Water Plan on May

 benefits for his employment prior to, on and after that
 date shall be determined in accordance with the accrual,
 vesting and other provisions contained in Sections 5, 6 and
 7 of the Campbell Water Plan (with service including both
 service with the Campbell Water Company and service with
 the Company) and not in accordance with Articles IV, VI,
 VII and IX of the Plan, PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that
 such Participant's pension benefits on a late or postponed
 retirement date shall not exceed the Participant's pension
 benefits on his normal retirement date. A person who was a
 Participant of the Campbell Water Plan with no vested
 benefits-under the Campbell Water Plan on May 9, 1980 shall
 become a Participant of the Plan as of that date and his
 pension benefits shall be determined in accordance with the
 provisions of the Plan and not in accordance with the
 provisions of the Campbell Water Plan.

 ARTICLE XIX

 TOP-HEAVY PROVISIONS

This Article outlines certain Code Section 416 top-heavy
provisions. In the unlikely event that the Plan were to become
Top-Heavy, certain Employees would receive vesting credit and
special minimum allocations as described in the last sections of
this Article.

19.01 Definitions.01 Definitions. In this Article, the following
 terms have the meaning indicated:

 (a) Determination Date shall mean, for any Plan Year,
 the last day of the preceding Plan Year.

 (b) Key Employee with respect to a particular
 Affiliated Company for a particular Plan Year, a
 Participant or former Participant (or the Beneficiary
 of a deceased Participant) who, at any time during the
 Plan Year containing the Determination Date for the
 Plan Year in question or any of the four immediately
 preceding Plan Years, was:

 (1) An officer of such Affiliated Company
 having aggregate annual Remuneration from all
 such entities for a Plan Year greater than fifty
 percent (50 of the maximum dollar limitation in
 effect under Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) for the
 calendar year in which such Plan Year ended;

 (2) One of the ten employees of such
 Affiliated Company owning the largest interests
 in value of any such entity, provided that:
 (i) such employee owns more than a one-half
 percent (r interest in such entity; and
 (ii) such employee's aggregate annual
 Remuneration from all such entities exceeds the
 maximum dollar limitation under Section
 415(c)(1)(A) of the Code;

 (3) A Five-Percent Owner of such Affiliated
 Company; or

 (4) A One-Percent Owner of such Affiliated
 Company whose aggregate annual Remuneration from
 all such entities exceeds 150,000.

 The determination of Key Employee status shall be made
 pursuant to the following:

 (I) For purposes of determining ownership
 in any entity under this subsection, the
 attribution principles of Section 318 of the Code
 shall apply by substituting "5 " for "50 " in
 Section 318(a)(2)(C).

 (II) For purposes of item (I) above, the
 individuals actually considered as Key Employees
 with respect to a Affiliated Company by virtue of
 being officers: (i) shall not in number exceed
 the lesser of fifty (50) or that number not in
 excess of the greater of three (3) officers or
 ten percent (10 of the total number of
 employees of the Affiliated Company; and
 (ii) shall be those individuals belonging to the
 group of all Participants determined to be
 officers for the Plan Year containing the
 Determination Date or any of the preceding four
 (4) Plan Years, who received the highest annual
 Remuneration from such entities for any Plan Year
 during such five (5) year period.
 Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no entity
 other than a corporation shall be deemed to have
 officers for purposes of clause (1) for any Plan
 Year beginning before March 1, 1985.

 (III) For purposes of item (II) above,
 should two employees own the same percentage
 interest in an entity, then the employee having
 the greater annual Remuneration shall be deemed
 to own the larger percentage interest.

 (c) Top-Heavy Ratio of a plan or group of plans with
 respect to a particular Affiliated Company shall be a
 fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of: (i)
 the present value of all cumulative accrued benefits
 for all Key Employees under this Plan and under each
 other defined benefit plan included in the
 determination; and (ii) the account balances for all
 Key Employees under each defined contribution plan
 (including any simplified employee pension plan)
 included in the determination, and the denominator of
 which is the sum of: (A) the present value of the
 cumulative accrued benefits for all Participants under
 this Plan and each other defined benefit plan included
 in the determination; and (B) the account balances for
 all Participants under each defined contribution plan
 (including any simplified employee pension plan)
 included in the determination, disregarding any
 accrued benefits or account balances not provided with
 respect to an Employee of such Affiliated Company.

 In determining the Top-Heavy Ratio with respect
 to a particular Affiliated Company, the following
 rules apply:

 (1) In determining the accrued benefits and
 account balances of a Participant employed by a
 particular Affiliated Company, benefits
 attributable to service with an entity other than
 such Affiliated Company (including service with a
 predecessor employer) shall be excluded.

 (2) Present value of accrued benefits shall
 be calculated in accordance with the provisions
 of the Plan (or such other defined benefit plan
 to which such benefits pertain). If an
 aggregation group includes two or more defined
 benefit plans, the same actuarial assumptions
 must be used with respect to all such plans. The
 value of account balances shall be determined as
 of the most recent valuation date that falls
 within or ends with the 12-month period ending on
 the Determination Date. Amounts attributable to
 Company contributions and employee contributions
 (other than deductible contributions) shall be
 taken into account. In the event that two or
 more plans with different plan years are included
 in the determination, accrued benefits under such
 plans shall be aggregated as of the Determination
 Dates for such plans that fall within the same
 calendar year. Account balances and accrued
 benefits so determined shall be adjusted for the
 amount of any contributions: (i) made after the
 date of such valuation but on or before the
 Determination Date; or (ii) due but unpaid as of
 the Determination Date, and, except as otherwise
 provided in paragraphs (3) or (4) below, shall
 include any amount distributed during the 5-year
 period ending on the Determination Date. The
 present value of accrued benefits will be
 determined by using the mortality table based on
 the table described in Section 807(d)(5) of the
 Code that is used to determine reserves for group
 annuity contracts issued on the date as of which
 present value is being determined (without regard
 to any other subparagraph of Section 807(d)(5) of
 the Code), and a 5 interest rate.

 (3) The accrued benefit of any Participant
 in a defined benefit plan with respect to the
 Plan Year in question, will be treated as
 accruing at the slowest rate of accrual permitted
 under the fractional rule of section 411(b)(1)(C)
 of the Code.

 (4) With respect to a transfer from one
 qualified plan to another (by rollover or plan-to-
 plan transfer) which is: (i) incident to a merger
 or consolidation of two or more plans or a
 division of a single plan into two or more plans;
 (ii) made between two plans maintained by the
 same employer or by employers required to be
 aggregated under Section 414(b), (c), or (m) of
 the Code; or (iii) otherwise not initiated by the
 employee, a Participant's accrued benefit or
 account balance under a plan shall include any
 amount attributable to any such transfer received
 or accepted by such plan on or before the
 Determination Date but shall not include any
 amount transferred by such plan to any other plan
 in such a transfer on or before the Determination
 Date. With respect to any rollover or plan-to-
 plan transfer not described in the preceding
 sentence, a Participant's accrued benefit or
 account balance under a plan shall include: (A)
 any amount distributed or transferred by such
 plan, unless the distributed or transferred
 amount is excludable under paragraph (2); and (B)
 any amount attributable to assets received in any
 such transfer accepted prior to January 1, 1984,
 but such accrued benefit or account balance shall
 not include any amount attributable to assets
 received by such plan in any such transfer
 accepted after December 31, 1983.

 (5) No accrued benefit or account balance
 for any Participant shall be taken into account
 with respect to: (i) a Participant who is not a
 Key Employee with respect to the Plan Year in
 question, but who was a Key Employee with respect
 to a prior Plan Year; or (ii) for Plan Years
 commencing after December 31, 1984, an Employee
 who has not performed services for the Affiliated
 Company within the five (5)-year period ending
 with the Determination Date.

 (6) Account shall be taken of any accrued
 benefit or account balance payable to a
 beneficiary (or group of beneficiaries) after the
 death of a Participant by disregarding the death
 of such Participant.

 (d) Required Aggregation Group means a group of two
 or more plans consisting of: (i) a qualified plan of
 an Affiliated Company (including a simplified employee
 pension plan) in which at least one Key Employee
 participates (or has participated in the five (5)-year
 period ending with the Determination Date); and (ii)
 any other qualified plan or plans which enable the
 plan described in (i) to meet the requirements of
 Sections 401(a)(4) and 410 of the Code.

 (e) Permissive Aggregation Group means a group of
 plans consisting of: (i) one or more qualified plans
 of a Affiliated Company in which at least one Key
 Employee participates (or has participated in the five
 (5)-year period ending with the Determination Date) or
 one or more Required Aggregation Groups of plans; and
 (ii) any other qualified plan or plans of the
 Affiliated Company which, when considered as a group
 with the plan or plans specified in (i), would
 continue to satisfy the requirements of Sections
 401(a)(4) and 410 of the Code.

19.02 Top-Heavy Status.02 Top-Heavy Status.

 (a) Subject to subsection (b), with respect to a
 particular Affiliated Company, this Plan shall be
 considered "Top-Heavy" with respect to any Plan Year
 if, as of the Determination Date for such Plan Year,
 either:

 (1) The Top-Heavy Ratio for the Affiliated
 Company's portion of this Plan exceeds sixty
 percent (60 and the Affiliated Company's
 portion of this Plan is not part of any Required
 Aggregation Group; or

 (2) The Affiliated Company's portion of
 this Plan is part of a Required Aggregation Group
 of plans and the Top-Heavy Ratio for the Required
 Aggregation Group exceeds sixty percent (60 ).

 (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), if the Affiliated
 Company's portion of this Plan is part of one or more
 Permissive Aggregation Groups of plans for which the
 Top-Heavy Ratio does not exceed sixty percent (60 ),
 this Plan shall not be Top-Heavy with respect to such
 Affiliated Company.

19.03 Minimum Allocation.03 Minimum Allocation.

 (a) For any Plan Year in which this Plan is Top-
 Heavy, a minimum, non-integrated, vested benefit must
 be provided (i) under a defined benefit plan
 maintained by an Affiliated Company, to each Non-Key
 Employee who has completed 1,000 Hours of Service in
 the Plan Year or (ii) under a defined contribution
 plan maintained by an Affiliated Company, to the
 account of each Non-Key Employee (except those who are
 separated from service with all Affiliated Companies
 at the end of the Plan Year).

 (b) Minimum benefits for a Non-Key Employee's Year of
 Service in a defined benefit plan will be no less than
 2 of the Employee's average high 5 consecutive years
 of Remuneration.

 (c) Minimum benefits for a Non-Key Employee in a
 defined contribution plan will be no less than the
 lesser of 3 of Remuneration or the highest rate of
 contribution applicable to any Key Employee.

 (d) If both a defined contribution and a defined
 benefit plan have been or are being maintained by
 Affiliated Companies, and both plans are Top-Heavy, a
 minimum benefit of 5 of Remuneration will be provided
 for each Non-Key Employee participating in both plans.

 (e) Solely for the purposes of this section, years of
 service shall not include a particular year of service
 if: (i) the Plan was not Top-Heavy with respect to
 such Affiliated Company for any Plan Year ending
 during such year of service; or (ii) such year of
 service was completed in a Plan Year beginning before
 January 1, 1984.

 (f) Solely for the purposes of this section, the
 Participant's average Remuneration from an Affiliated
 Company shall be computed for the testing period
 consisting of the period of consecutive years (not
 exceeding five (5)) during which the Participant had
 the greatest aggregate such Remuneration, except that
 the following years shall not be taken into account:

 (1) Any year ending in a Plan Year
 beginning before January 1, 1984;

 (2) Any year beginning after the close of
 the last year in which the Plan was Top-Heavy
 with respect to such Affiliated Company; and

 (3) Any year for which the Participant did
 not earn a year of service (determined without
 regard to subsection (a) of this section) with
 such Affiliated Company.

19.04 Vesting.04 Vesting. Subject to the Plan's general
 rules regarding changes in vesting schedules, the following
 Top-Heavy vesting rules apply. If the Plan is Top-Heavy
 for any Plan Year, then the otherwise applicable Plan
 vesting schedule will be replaced, for that Plan Year, by
 the following:

 If Years of Service Percentage of
 Equal or Exceed Account Vested

 2 20 
 3 40 
 4 60 
 5 80 
 6 100 

 This revised vesting schedule will not apply to any
 Employee who does not render an Hour of Service after the
 Plan becomes Top-Heavy or to any amounts forfeited before
 the Plan becomes Top-Heavy. If, following a Plan Year in
 which this revised vesting schedule is applicable, the Plan
 ceases to be Top-Heavy, the Plan's normal vesting schedule
 will again be applicable, and the provisions in Section
 6.03 regarding amendments to the vesting schedule will
 apply.

19.05 Super Top-Heavy Adjustment.05 Super Top-Heavy Adjustment.
 Notwithstanding Section 12.09, if this Plan would not be
 deemed to be top-heavy if "ninety percent (90 )" were
 substituted for "sixty percent (60 )" each place it appears
 in Section 19.02, and if an Affiliated Company provides
 benefits and or contributions to the accounts of non-key
 employees who participate in defined benefit and or defined
 contribution plans maintained by an Affiliated Company, in
 amounts at least as equal to that which would be required
 under Section 19.03 after substituting 4 for 3 in Section
 19.03(b) and substituting 3 for 2 in Section 19.03(c),
 then the reduction in the defined benefit fraction and the
 defined contribution fraction as set forth in Section
 12.09, shall not be made.
