 PART I

Item 1. Business:

 Unifi, Inc., a New York corporation formed in 1969, together
with its subsidiaries, hereinafter set forth, (the "Company" or
"Unifi"), is engaged predominantly in the business of processing
yarns by: texturing of synthetic filament polyester and nylon
fiber; and spinning of cotton and cotton blend fibers.

 The Company's texturing operation mainly involves purchasing
partially oriented yarn (POY), which is either raw polyester or
nylon filament fiber, from chemical manufacturers and using high
speed machines to draw, heat and twist the POY to produce yarns
having various physical characteristics, depending upon its
ultimate end-use. The Company's spinning operation mainly involves
the spinning on either open-end or ring spindles of cotton, cotton
and undyed synthetic blends, and cotton and pre-dyed polyester
blends into yarns of different strengths and thickness.

 The Company currently sells textured polyester yarns, nylon
yarns, dyed yarns, covered yarns, spun yarns made of cotton, cotton
and un-dyed synthetic blends, and cotton and pre-dyed polyester
blends domestically and internationally to weavers and knitters who
produce fabrics for the apparel, industrial, hosiery, home
furnishing, auto upholstery, activewear, and underwear markets.

 The Company, internationally, has manufacturing facilities in
Letterkenny, County Donegal, Republic of Ireland, which texturizes
polyester, as well as producing its own polymer (POY).

 SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS:

 A. POY. The primary suppliers of POY to the Company are E.
I. DuPont de Nemours and Company, Hoechst Celanese Corporation, and
Wellman Industries, with the majority of the Company's POY being
supplied by DuPont. Although the Company is heavily dependent upon
a limited number of suppliers, the Company has not had and does not
anticipate any material difficulty in obtaining its raw POY.

 B. Cotton. The Company buys its cotton, which is a commodity
and is traded on established markets, from brokers such as Dunavant
Enterprises, HoHenBerg Brothers Co., Staple Cotton, and Stahel
(America). The Company has not had and does not anticipate any
material difficulty in obtaining cotton.

 PATENTS AND LICENSES: The Company currently has several
patents and registered trademarks, including the following:

 The Company does not have any patents, trademarks, licenses,
or franchises which are material to its business as a whole.

 CUSTOMERS: The Company in fiscal year ended June 25, 1995,
sold textured and spun yarns to approximately 1,000 customers, one
customer's purchases were approximately 11 of the net sales during
said period, the ten largest customers accounted for approximately 
32 of the total sales and the Company does not believe that it is
dependent on any one customer.

 BACKLOG: The Company, other than in connection with certain
foreign sales and for textured yarns that are package dyed
according to customers' specifications, does not manufacture to
order. The Company's products can be used in many ways and can be
thought of in terms of a commodity subject to the laws of supply
and demand and, therefore, does not have what is considered a
backlog of orders. In addition, the Company does not consider its
products to be seasonal ones.

 COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS: The textile industry in which the
Company currently operates is keenly competitive. The Company
processes and sells high-volume commodity products, pricing is
highly competitive with product quality and customer service being
essential for differentiating the competitors within the industry. 
Product quality insures manufacturing efficiencies for the
customer. The Company's polyester and nylon yarns, dyed yarns, 
covered yarns and cotton and cotton blend yarns compete with a
number of other domestic producers of such yarns. In the sale of
polyester filament yarns major competitors are Atlas Yarn Company,
Inc., Burlington Industries, Inc. and Milliken & Company, in the
sale of nylon yarns, dyed yarns, and covered yarns major
competitors are Glen Raven Mills, Inc., Jefferson Mills, Inc.,
Spanco Yarns, Inc., Regal Manufacturing Company and Spectrum Dyed
Yarns, Inc., and in the sale of cotton and cotton blend yarns major
competitors are Parkdale Mills, Inc., Avondale Mills, Inc.,
Harriett & Henderson, Mayo Yarns, Inc. and TNS Mills, Inc.

 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: The estimated amount spent during
each of the last three fiscal years on Company-sponsored and
Customer-sponsored research and development activities is
considered immaterial.

 COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS: Management of
the Company believes that the operation of the Company's production
facilities and the disposal of waste materials are substantially in
compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
 I-3 
 
 EMPLOYEES: The number of employees of the Company is
approximately 6,000 full-time employees.

 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS:

 On September 18, 1995, the Company announced restructuring
plans to further reduce the Company's cost structure and improve
productivity through the consolidation of certain manufacturing
operations and the disposition of underutilized assets. The
restructuring plan is focused on the consolidation of production
facilities acquired via mergers during the preceding four years and
reflects the Company's continued efforts to streamline operations.
As part of the restructuring action, the Company will close its
spun cotton manufacturing facilities in Edenton and Mount Pleasant,
North Carolina with the majority of the manufacturing production
being transferred to other facilities. Approximately 275 jobs,
primarily wage-level positions, will be affected.

 The estimated cost of restructuring will result in a first
quarter fiscal 1996 non-recurring charge to earnings of 23.8
million or an after-tax charge to earnings of 14.9 million .22
per share). The significant components of the non-recurring charge
include 2.4 million of severance and other employee-related costs
from the termination of employees and a 21.4 million write-down to
estimated fair value less the cost of disposal of underutilized
assets and consolidated facilities to be disposed. Costs associated
with the relocation of equipment or personnel will be expensed as
incurred.

 The Company anticipates that all signficant aspects of the
consolidation of spun yarn facilities would be accomplished within
a one year period. However, the ultimate disposal of the equipment
and facilities may take longer due to current market conditions and
the physical locations of the properties.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT INFORMATION

 PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and all
subsidiaries. The accounts of all foreign subsidiaries have been
included on the basis of fiscal periods ended three months or less
prior to the dates of the consolidated balance sheets. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.
 FISCAL YEAR: The Company's fiscal year is the fifty-two or
fifty-three weeks ending the last Sunday in June. All three fiscal
years presented were comprised of fifty-two weeks.
 RECLASSIFICATION: The Company has reclassified the
presentation of certain prior year information to conform with the
current presentation format.
 REVENUE RECOGNITION: Substantially all revenue from sales is
recognized at the time shipments are made.
 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: Assets and liabilities of
foreign subsidiaries are translated at year-end rates of exchange
and revenues and expenses are translated at the average rates of
exchange for the year. Gains and losses resulting from translation
are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders equity.
Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions
(transactions denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary's
functional currency) are included in net income.
 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents are defined as
short-term investments having an original maturity of three months
or less.
 SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS: Short-term investments are comprised
primarily of high-quality, highly liquid marketable securities with
original maturities greater than three months. The Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 115 Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities as of the end of
the fiscal year ended June 26, 1994. The adoption had no
significant impact on the fiscal 1994 financial statements.
Short-term investments at June 25, 1995, and June 26, 1994, are
classified as available-for-sale securities and are carried at fair
market value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax,
reported as a separate component of shareholders equity.
 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE: Certain customer accounts receivable are
factored without recourse with respect to credit risk. An allowance
for losses is provided for accounts not factored based on a
periodic review of the accounts. Reserve for such losses was 6.5
million at June 25, 1995, and 4.3 million at June 26, 1994.
 INVENTORIES: The Company utilizes the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method for valuing certain inventories representing 59 of
all inventories at June 25, 1995, and the first-in first-out
(FIFO) method for all other inventories. Inventory values computed
by the LIFO method are lower than current market values.
Inventories valued at current or replacement cost would have
been approximately 10.3 million and 5.6 million in excess of the
LIFO valuation at June 25, 1995, and June 26, 1994, respectively.
Finished goods, work in process, and raw materials and supplies at
June 25, 1995, and June 26, 1994, amounted to 66.1 million and
 57.6 million; 14.3 million and 12.9 million; and 59.0 million
and 29.8 million, respectively.
 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment
are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed for asset groups
primarily utilizing the straight-line method for financial
reporting and accelerated methods for tax reporting.
 OTHER ASSETS: Other assets consist primarily of the cash
surrender value of key executive life insurance policies,
investments in marketable equity securities, long-term notes
receivable, deferred debt expense, identifiable intangibles
associated with acquisitions and, also in the prior year,
noncompete covenants. The investments in marketable equity
securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at
a fair market value of 0.3 million and 9.5 million at June 25,
1995, and June 26, 1994, respectively. The deferred debt expense
and remaining intangible assets are being amortized on a
straight-line method over periods from three to fifteen years. The
noncompete covenants and certain intangibles associated with
acquisitions were fully amortized in fiscal 1994. Accumulated
amortization at June 25, 1995, and June 26, 1994, was 1.6 million
and 16.0 million, respectively.
 INCOME TAXES: The Company and its domestic subsidiaries file
a consolidated federal tax return. Income tax expense is computed
on the basis of transactions entering into pretax operating
results. Deferred income taxes have been provided for the tax
effect of temporary differences between financial statement
carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and
liabilities. Income taxes have not been provided on the
undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as such
earnings are deemed to be permanently invested.
 EARNINGS PER SHARE: Earnings per common and common equivalent
share are computed on the basis of the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding plus, to the extent applicable, common
stock equivalents. Average common and common equivalent shares for
primary earnings per share were 69,542,155, 71,020,075 and
70,861,463 for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Fully diluted
earnings per share amounts are based on 77,302,035, 71,026,610 and
78,640,459 shares for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The
effect of the convertible subordinated notes was antidilutive for
the fiscal year ended June 26, 1994.

2.BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

 On August 18, 1993, Pioneer Yarn Mills, Inc., Edenton Cotton
Mills, Inc., Pioneer Spinning, Inc., Pioneer Cotton Mills, Inc.,
and certain real estate (collectively the Pioneer Corporations)
were merged into Unifi Spun Yarns, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company. In order to effect the Merger, 2,745,284 shares of
the Company's common stock were issued for all of the outstanding
shares of the Pioneer Corporations. On April 23, 1993, Vintage
Yarns, Inc. (Vintage) was merged with and became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, and 7,891,800 shares of the Company's
common stock were issued in exchange for all of the outstanding
common stock of Vintage. Additionally, 496,832 shares of the
Company's common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to
outstanding options on Vintage common stock. Both mergers were
accounted for as a pooling of interests, and accordingly, the
accompanying financial statements for the year ended June 27, 1993
have been restated to include the accounts and operations of the
Pioneer Corporations and Vintage.
 Prior to the mergers, the Pioneer Corporations used a fiscal
year ending on the last Saturday in September and Vintage used a
fiscal year ending September 30. The restated 1993 financial
statements combine the June 27, 1993, financial statements of the
Company with the financial statements of the Pioneer Corporations
and Vintage for their respective twelve month periods ended
June 26, 1993, and June 30, 1993, respectively. Accordingly, to
conform the fiscal years of the Pioneer Corporations and Vintage
with the Company's, the results of operations of the Pioneer
Corporations and Vintage for the three months ended September 26,
1992, and September 30, 1992, respectively, have been included in
both fiscal 1993 and 1992. Combined net sales and net income for
the three month periods of the Pioneer Corporations and Vintage
were 60.8 million and 9.6 million, respectively. An adjustment
for the net income of the three month period has been reflected
as an adjustment to the June 29, 1992, consolidated retained
earnings and an additional adjustment of 1.9 million has been
reflected to conform the accounting policies of the previously
separate companies. Separate results of the combining entities for
the year ended June 27, 1993, are as follows:

(Amounts in thousands) June 27, 1993
______________________________________________
Net sales:
 Unifi 1,133,863
 Pioneer Corporations 73,457
 Vintage 198,331
______________________________________________
 1,405,651

Net income:
 Unifi 94,839
 Pioneer Corporations 8,591
 Vintage 33,214
______________________________________________
 136,644
______________________________________________

 For all periods prior to the merger to the date of acquisition,
the Pioneer Corporations and Vintage were taxed as S Corporations
and, therefore, federal and state taxes were assessed to the
shareholders. For purposes of the consolidated financial
statements, income taxes have been provided on the Pioneer
Corporations and Vintage's earnings at the rates which would have
been applicable had such earnings been taxed to it. Distributions
to S Corporation shareholders have been adjusted for the effects of
corporate, federal and state taxes payable on an annualized basis.

3.NON-RECURRING CHARGE

 In the fiscal 1994 fourth quarter, the Company recorded a
non-recurring charge of 13.4 million 14.1 million after-tax or
 .20 per share) related to the sale of the Company's investment in
its wholly-owned French subsidiary, Unifi Texturing, S.A. (UTSA)
and the Company's decision to exit the European nylon market. Of
the non-recurring charge, 3.1 million relates to the loss from
the sale of UTSA, 8.8 million relates to the write-off of
goodwill and other intangibles associated with the Company's
European nylon operations and 1.5 million relates to the
write-down of nylon production equipment and inventories. The sale
was consummated during the first fiscal quarter of 1995. Net cash
proceeds from the sale totaled 13.8 million, excluding 4.1
million of cash remitted to the Company from UTSA coincident with
the sale. The results of operations of UTSA were not significant to
the consolidated Company for any of the periods presented.

4.LONG-TERM DEBT

 A summary of long-term debt follows:

(Amounts in thousands) June 25, 1995 June 26, 1994
_________________________________________________________________
Convertible subordinated
 notes due March 15, 2002 230,000 230,000

There are no scheduled maturities of long-term debt in the five
years following June 25, 1995.
 The 6 convertible subordinated notes due March 15, 2002, are
convertible at any time on or before the due date, unless
previously redeemed, into common stock of the Company at a
conversion price of 29.67 per share, subject to adjustment in
certain events. The notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at
the option of the Company on or after March 27, 1995, at
redemption prices beginning at 104 of their principal amount,
declining to par on or after March 15, 2001. The Company has 7.8
million shares reserved at year end for potential conversion.
Interest is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of
each year.
 The fair value of the Company's long-term debt at June 25,
1995, is estimated at 227.7 million using quoted market prices.

5.INCOME TAXES

 Deferred income taxes of 37.7 million and 32.4 million at
June 25, 1995, and June 26, 1994, respectively, have been provided
as a result of temporary differences between financial statement
carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and
liabilities. The net deferred tax liability consists of deferred
tax liabilities resulting primarily from the temporary differences
related to property, plant and equipment of 57.7 million and 52.7
million, other assets of 1.7 million and .7 million and deferred
tax assets attributable to basis differences resulting from
mergers and valuation reserves of 21.7 million and 21.0 million,
respectively. U.S. deferred income taxes have not been recognized
on 43.0 million at June 25, 1995 35.2 million at June 26, 1994),
of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, because assets
representing those earnings are considered to be permanently
invested. The amount of foreign withholding taxes and U.S. taxes
that would be payable upon the repatriation of assets that
represent those earnings would be approximately 16.4 million at
June 25, 1995 13.6 million at June 26, 1994).

7.RETIREMENT PLANS
 
 The Company has a qualified profit-sharing plan, which provides
benefits for eligible salaried and hourly employees. The annual
contribution to the plan, which is at the discretion of the Board
of Directors, amounted to 17.0 million, 15.8 million and 13.3
million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The Company leases
its corporate office building from its profit-sharing plan through
an independent trustee.

 22
 
8.LEASES, COMMITMENTS AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

 The Company is obligated under operating leases consisting
primarily of real estate and equipment. Future obligations for
minimum rentals under the leases during fiscal years after June 
25, 1995, are 3.0 million in 1996, 2.8 million in 1997, 2.6
million in 1998, 2.5 million in 1999, and 2.5 million in 2000.
 Rental expense was 3.7 million, 3.2 million and 2.7 million
for the fiscal years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 The Company had committed approximately 99.5 million for the
purchase of equipment and facilities at June 25,1995.
 The concentration of credit risk for the Company with respect
to trade receivables is mitigated due to the large number of
customers, dispersion across different industries and its
factoring arrangements.
 The Company had sales to one customer of approximately 11 in
1995, 12 in 1994 and 12 in 1993.

9.BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS

 The Company and its subsidiaries are engaged predominantly in
the processing of yarns by: texturing of synthetic filament
polyester and nylon fiber, and spinning of cotton and cotton blend
fibers with sales domestically and internationally, mostly to
knitters and weavers for the apparel, industrial, hosiery, home
furnishing, automotive upholstery and other end-use markets.
 The Company's foreign operations are comprised primarily of its
manufacturing facility in Ireland along with its foreign sales
corporation and had net sales of 231.1 million, 178.5 million
and 199.3 million; pretax income, before non-recurring charges in
1994, of 10.4 million, 4.4 million and 7.6 million; and
identifiable assets of 129.9 million, 132.0 million and 123.4
million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

MANAGEMENT'S REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS
AND FINANCIAL POSITION

FISCAL 1995
 Net sales increased 12.3 from 1.385 billion in 1994 to 1.555
billion in 1995. The growth was accomplished by an increase in unit
volume for the consolidated domestic and international operations.
The increase in unit sales volume was predominantly in our lower
average priced, natural textured and spun yarn products. The volume
increase was supplemented by a slight increase in per unit sales
price.
 Our domestic operations experienced increased sales volume of 
approximately 12.4 during 1995 with significant gains noted in
natural polyester and spun yarn products. Domestic volume growth
was achieved primarily through capacity expansions, acquisitions
and ongoing modernization projects. Domestic polyester texturing
productive capacity will be increased throughout the 1996 fiscal
year as the Company continues with a modernization project in
process in its Reidsville, NC facility and completes construction
of a new texturing plant in Yadkinville, NC.
 The growth in sales in our international polyester operations
was accomplished through increased capacity gained from fiscal 1995
expansions at our Irish facility, higher average unit sales prices
which were raised to partially offset escalating raw material costs
and to the further weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the
prior year. Texturing capacity will be increased approximately 30 
during the upcoming fiscal year due to the installation of new
texturing equipment. Sales from foreign operations are denominated
in local currencies and are hedged in part by the purchase of raw
materials and services in those same currencies. The net asset
exposure is hedged by borrowings in local currencies which minimize
the risk of currency fluctuations.
 Cost of sales as a percentage of sales remained stable at 85.6 
for both the 1995 and 1994 fiscal years. On a consolidated basis
for fiscal 1995, slight increases in per unit raw material and
packaging costs were offset by lower manufacturing costs per unit.
Increased sales volume and a shift in product mix to higher-volume,
lower-cost items resulted in improved manufacturing costs on a per
unit basis. These improvements reflect management's continued
efforts to improve operating efficiency and reduce manufacturing
cost.
 Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
net sales decreased to 2.8 in 1995 from 2.9 in 1994 primarily as
a result of further consolidations of operations relating to the
previous mergers and an increase in the net sales base.
 Interest expense declined 2.8 million from 18.3 million in
1994 to 15.5 million in 1995. The decline was attributable to the
retirement of debt acquired in prior year mergers throughout
fiscal 1994. The only long-term debt remaining at June 25, 1995, is
the 230 million in convertible subordinate notes issued in March
1992. Interest income increased 2.1 million from 1994 to 1995 as
a result of increased short-term investment levels. Other income
increased 8.4 million from 1994 to 1995 mainly as a result of the
recognition of gains from the sale of equity affiliates and capital
assets.
 The effective income tax rate decreased from 44.1 in 1994 to
37.4 in 1995. This decrease was mainly due to the non-deductible,
non-recurring charge in the prior year while no such charge was
incurred in 1995. Also contributing to the current year's lower
effective tax rate was the increase in the earnings of foreign
operations, which are taxed at rates lower than the domestic
federal tax rate.
 Net income increased 51.9 from 76.5 million in 1994 to 116.2
million in 1995. Earnings per share increased from 1.08 per share
from fiscal 1994 to 1.67 for fiscal 1995, an increase of 54.6 .
Net income and net income per share in 1994 before the
non-recurring charge were 90.6 million or 1.28 per share.

FISCAL 1994
 Net sales decreased 1.5 from 1.406 billion in 1993 to 1.385
billion in 1994. This reduction resulted from an overall decline in
sales prices of 6.6 based on product mix offset by volume gains of
5.5 experienced for the year in our combined domestic and foreign
markets. Domestic growth was achieved through phased in production
from a new texturizing plant in Yadkinville, NC that commenced
operations in 1993, and the completion of other modernization
projects in 1994 and latter stages of the prior fiscal year. Also,
significant volume growth was noted in our spun yarn business for
the year although pressure on pricing and raw material increases
adversely impacted the margins. In the first quarter of 1994, the
Company increased its presence in the cotton and cotton blend spun
yarn business through the merger with the Pioneer Corporations.
During 1993, the Company entered this market through its merger
with Vintage Yarns.
 Our European facilities also experienced overall capacity
increases. However, sales prices in local currencies were adversely
affected due to weak economic conditions and overcapacity
throughout most of the year. Sales from foreign operations are
denominated in local currencies and are hedged in part by the
purchase of raw materials and services in those same currencies.
The net asset exposure is hedged by borrowings in local currencies
which minimize the risk of currency fluctuations.

Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased from 81.2 in
1993 to 85.6 in 1994. Impacting cost of sales in the current year
was increased fixed charges, such as depreciation, resulting from
added capacity being absorbed on a lower net sales base. Also, our
spun operations experienced significant raw material price
increases during 1994 adversely impacting cost of sales. On a
Company-wide basis, however, raw material prices per pound were
lower in the current fiscal year than in the prior year.
 Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
net sales increased from 2.7 in 1993 to 2.9 in 1994 primarily as
a result of increased fixed charges over a reduced net sales
base.
 Interest expense declined 7.6 million from 25.8 million in
1993 to 18.2 million in 1994. This decline was attributable to the
payoff of long-term debt acquired through merger activity. The
only long-term debt remaining at June 26, 1994 is the 230 million
in convertible subordinate notes issued in March 1992. Interest
income declined 5.2 million from 1993 to 1994 as a result of
decreased short-term investment levels. These investments were used
to pay off acquired debt, modernize capital equipment and for other
financing activities. Other income declined 4.5 million from 1993
to 1994 mainly as a result of the prior year gains recognized from
the sale of investment in affiliates and short-term investments
while no such activity was present in the current year.
 In connection with the planned sale of the nylon operations in
France, the Company recognized the anticipated loss on the sale of
its French subsidiary and wrote off certain intangible costs,
primarily goodwill, and other costs associated with the European
nylon business. These costs aggregated 14.1 million, or .20 per
share on an after tax basis.
 The effective income tax rate increased from 37.8 in 1993 to
44.1 in 1994. This increase was mainly due to the non-deductible,
non-recurring charge in the current year while no such charge was
incurred in 1993. Also adversely impacting the current
year'seffective tax rate was the decreased foreign earnings which
are taxed at rates lower than the federal tax rate and the increase
in the statutory federal rate from 34 to 35 for all of 1994.
 Net income declined from 136.6 million or 1.93 per share in
1993 to 76.5 million or 1.08 per share in 1994. Net income and
net income per share in 1994 before the non-recurring charge
previously discussed were 90.6 million or 1.28 per share.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 Cash generated from operations is a major source of liquidity
for the Company. During 1995, 155.3 million was generated as a
result of net income, adjusted for the effects of depreciation
and amortization and noncash expenses and increases in accounts
payable offset by increases in both receivables and inventories.
Receivables have increased in connection with increased volume for
both our domestic and export markets. Payment terms for our export
sales are typically longer than our domestic sales. The growth in
inventory was due to anticipated capacity increases and overall
higher per unit raw material prices. The growth in inventory
resulted in a corresponding increase to accounts payable.
 During 1995, the Company expended 83.8 million for the
repurchase of 3.4 million shares of the Company's common stock,
 88.9 million for additions to property and equipment and 27.7
million for cash dividend payments. Cash generated from the sale of
our French subsidiary amounted to 13.8 million.
 At June 25, 1995, the Company has working capital of 333.4
million which represents a 29.1 million increase in working
capital from June 26, 1994. Included in working capital at June
25, 1995, is cash and short-term investments of 146.2 million. In
addition, the Company has access to debt and equity markets.
 At June 25, 1995, the Company has committed approximately 99.5
million for the purchase of equipment and facilities.
 On October 21, 1993, the Board of Directors authorized
Management to repurchase up to 15 million shares of Unifi's common
stock from time to time at such prices as Management feels
advisable and in the best interest of the Company. Approximately
3.5 million shares have been repurchased as of June 25, 1995,
pursuant to this Board authorization.
 Management believes the current financial position is
sufficient to meet anticipated capital expenditures, working
capital needs, and other financial requirements.

Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits.
 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted

financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 In our opinion the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
