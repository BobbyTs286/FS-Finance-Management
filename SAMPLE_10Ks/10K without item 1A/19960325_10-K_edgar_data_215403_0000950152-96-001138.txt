 PART I
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
(a) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
 
 Central Reserve Life Corporation (the "Registrant") was incorporated in
1964 as Citation Life Insurance Company under the laws of the State of Ohio. The
present name was adopted in 1976. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the
term "Company" as herein used will refer to Central Reserve Life Corporation
only.
 
 The Company is a holding company conducting its business through several
subsidiaries. More detailed information regarding the Company's subsidiaries is
set forth below.
 
 (1) INSURANCE OPERATIONS
 
 The Company owns 100 of Central Reserve Life Insurance Company
("Central"), which is its principal operating subsidiary.
 
 Central is an Ohio domiciled Life and Accident and Health insurance
company. Central was incorporated in 1963 and commenced business in 1965. The
Company acquired Central in 1973. As of December 31, 1995, Central was licensed
to transact business in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina,
North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming
(35 states).
 
 (2) OTHER OPERATIONS
 
 In March 1983, the Company acquired Western Reserve Administrative
Services, Inc. ("Western"), an Ohio corporation which administers claims for
self-insured companies. Western also administers Central's Gemini product which
is a partially self-funded group plan for small companies.
 
(b) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
 
 Effective December 31, 1995, the Company redefined its reporting segments,
merging the group life and group accident and health segments together, as well
as combining the life and annuity segments. These alignments fit the Company's
current operating organization and produce three segments: group life and
health; life insurance and annuities; and corporate and other.
 
 The following table presents the revenues and income (loss) on a GAAP basis
for the last three years attributable to the Company's industry segments. The
Company is not able to allocate investment assets or identifiable assets by
industry segment.

(c) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
 The operational aspects of the Company's business are primarily in Central;
therefore, this section will contain information that only pertains to Central.
 
 (1) BUSINESS AND PRINCIPAL PRODUCT
 
Products
 
 Central specializes in meeting the insurance needs of small to midsized
businesses and individuals. Among the products Central offers are life
insurance, annuities, accident and health insurance, long-term disability and
short-term major medical.
 
 Central's principal product is group insurance, which accounted for about
98 of its premiums in 1995. Approximately 2 of the group premiums were for
life insurance and 98 were for accident and health insurance.
 
 Central provides for its customers a comprehensive package of more than 25
managed care controls which help (a) keep insureds' out-of-pocket expenses down,
(b) ensure affordability of the plans, and (c) keep rates attractive at renewal
time. Among these managed care controls are hospital inpatient and outpatient
billing review, independent utilization management, physician code review,
hospital audit review, premium reduction renewal options, a hospice care
program, and the National Physician Data Bank Review(SM), a refinement of
Central's former reasonable and customary charge controls.
 
 Also included as a part of Central's managed care programs are Preferred
Provider Organization (PPO) health plans which are available to both group and
individuals. Through its PPO plans, Central is able to offer customers a network
of hospitals and physicians that provide medical services at discounted rates.
PPO networks which Central contracts with are situated in 16 states. For
customers located outside the existing PPO service areas, Central offers a
supplemental hospital program, through which it offers discounted hospital rates
by contracting with national PPO networks.
 
Marketing
 
 Central's products are marketed through the establishment of general
agencies in Midwestern, Southeastern, and Southwestern states. Regional sales
managers are responsible for recruiting and training the general agents. The
general agents are required to recruit agents in their area, conduct seminars
for the agents and train them in the benefits, underwriting requirements and
general conditions under which Central's insurance plans operate.
 
 Central supports the general agents in the recruiting and training of
agents through sales brochures and literature, assistance with seminars, and a
video training program. Central enhances and enables the general agents' and
writing agents' sales efforts through its Co-op Advertising Program, sales and
promotional literature and various sales contests.
 
 Internally, Central's organization supports the agents and emphasizes
customer service with a unique "team" approach. Organized around geographically
dedicated groups of employees, each team consists of several specialists for
each region.
 
Underwriting
 
 Central controls the quality of its group accident and health business by
maintaining specific underwriting standards and guidelines. Where not restricted
by state regulatory agencies, Central medically underwrites each individual by
requiring enrollment applications, medical health history questionnaires and, in
some cases, medical records.
 
 While members of each group are individually underwritten, Central takes
into account certain group characteristics, such as size, location and industry.
For a discussion of certain business risks, other than underwriting, see Note 1
to the consolidated financial statements.

 (2) INSURANCE VOLUME, POLICIES AND CERTIFICATES
 
 Although insurance volume (amount of life insurance) is generally a guide
to statistical information for most insurance companies, policies and
certificates in force are a more informative statistic for Central due to the
large percent of business generated in the group accident and health area.
Central requires each insured to carry group life insurance, but the average
requirement is only 10,000, accordingly, it is more informative to focus on the
number of certificates in force as opposed to volume of insurance.
 
 Following are tables reflecting statistical information on Central's
business.

1995 1994 1993

 ============ ====== 

(4) AGENTS
 
 Central's insurance policies are sold by licensed agents and general agents
(brokers). Regional Sales Managers service the brokers. Central does not have
agents who sell exclusively for it. The licensed agents and brokers who produce
insurance business for Central generally have affiliations with and serve in a
similar capacity for one or more other companies which may be competitive with
Central, and a portion of their business may be written by such other companies.
Such agents and brokers are compensated by Central for business produced by them
on a cash commission basis at rates which are believed to be competitive with
those of other life insurance companies.
 
 As of December 31, 1995, Central had 81 brokers/general agents and 13,103
agents licensed.

 (5) INVESTMENTS
 
 An important earnings factor for Central, as well as all insurance
companies, is the income from the investment portfolio. The investment
objectives for insurance companies are designed to maximize yields, preserve
principal and maintain liquidity. Investments must comply with the insurance
laws of the state of domicile. These laws prescribe the kind, quality and
concentration of investments which may be made. Due to the restrictive nature of
these laws, there may be occasions when Central may be precluded from making
certain otherwise attractive investments. As of December 31, 1995, 99 of the
 80,652,527 invested in fixed maturities, was of investment grade quality.
Central and the Company do not invest in "junk" bonds or derivatives such as
futures, forwards, swaps, and option contracts, and other financial instruments
with similar characteristics. However, Central does invest in mortgage-backed
securities of which some are collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO's). These
investments, besides having a credit risk, also have the risk of prepayment,
during rising interest rates, and the risk of extension during a decline in
interest rates. Central constantly monitors these securities and has reduced its
exposure in CMO's in 1995 by selling certain securities and investing the
proceeds in short term maturities.
 
 The following tables show various aspects of the fixed maturities
investment portfolio of the Company as of December 31, 1995:

(6) RESERVES
 
 Central is required by the insurance laws of the states in which it is
licensed to set up statutory reserves to meet policy obligations on its ordinary
life policies. These reserves are amounts which, with additions from premiums to
be received and with interest on such reserves compounded annually at certain
assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet policy obligations as
they mature. The various actuarial factors are determined from mortality tables
and interest rates in effect when the policy is issued. The ordinary life
policies currently issued by Central are valued on the Commissioner's Standard
Ordinary Table of Mortality of 1980 under the Commissioners' Reserve Valuation
Method and the Net Level Premium Method. The guaranteed interest rate on
policies currently being issued is 4.5 . On policies issued previously to the
current series, guaranteed interest rates were as specified in the various
policies and range from 2.5 to 6 . Under the Commissioners' Reserve Valuation
Method, the amount of reserve provided in the first policy year is less than
under the Net Level Premium Method, but in subsequent years greater additions to
reserves are required. To the extent that the rate of income realized on
investments is greater or less than the assumed interest rate used in the
calculation of reserves, reported earnings are increased or decreased, as the
case may be.
 
 The majority of Central's reserves and liabilities for claims, however, are
for its group accident and health business. Statutory and regulatory
requirements are generally less explicit for health insurance reserves and
liabilities than for ordinary life insurance. For its group accident and health
business Central establishes an Active Life Reserve plus a liability for due and
unpaid claims, claims in course of settlement, and incurred but unreported
claims as well as a reserve for the present value of amounts not yet due on
claims. These reserves and liabilities are dependent upon many factors, such as
economic and social conditions, inflation (overall and hospital costs
specifically), changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards for
pain and suffering. Therefore, the reserves and liabilities established are
necessarily based on extensive estimates and prior years' statistics.
 
 (7) REINSURANCE
 
 As is customary among most insurance companies, Central reinsures portions
of the life insurance policies it writes, thereby providing a greater
diversification of risk and minimizing Central's exposure on major risks. While
the effect of reinsurance is to lessen risks to the writing company, it may also
lower income. Although the ceding of reinsurance does not discharge the original
insurer from its primary liability to its policyholder, the insurance company
that assumes the coverage assumes the related liability and becomes the ultimate
source of payment. The maximum amount of exposure that Central retains on any
life is 50,000 on ordinary life and 25,000 on group life on ages through 70.
No retention is maintained over age 70. Maximum retention on impaired risks is
 10,000. Central also has reinsurance on group accident and health claims.
Effective January 1, 1995, Central's reinsurance treaty provides that all
individual claims in excess of 500,000 are 100 reinsured. The overall effect
of reinsurance is not material to the Company's financial condition. Reinsurance
treaties in effect at December 31, 1995 were with The Cologne Life Reinsurance
Company, Life ReAssurance Corporation of America and Business Men's Assurance
Company.

 (8) REGULATION
 
 Central, in common with other insurance companies operating in the states
in which it is licensed, is subject to regulation and supervision by state
insurance regulatory agencies. These regulatory bodies have broad administrative
powers relating to standards of solvency, which must be met on a continuing
basis, granting and revoking of licenses, licensing of agents, approval of
policy forms, maintenance of adequate reserves, form and content of financial
statements, types of investments permitted, issuance and sale of stock and other
matters pertaining to insurance. Central is required to file detailed annual
statements with the respective state regulatory bodies and is subject to
periodic examination by the regulators. The most recent regulatory examination
for Central was made as of December 31, 1992. The next examination is for the
three year period ending December 31, 1995 and will begin in March 1996.
 
 (9) COMPETITION
 
 The insurance business is highly competitive. There are over 1,600 legal
reserve life insurance companies in the United States, of which over 650 are
operating in Ohio, Central's principal state of operation. Many of these have
been in business for long periods of time, and have substantially greater
financial resources, larger selling organizations and broader diversification of
risks than Central. Many of these companies are mutual companies, whose earnings
inure to the benefit of their policyholders. However, the Company believes that
the policies and premium rates of Central are generally competitive with those
offered by other companies selling similar types of insurance in Ohio.
 
 (10) EMPLOYEES
 
 As of December 31, 1995 Central had 510 employees. The Registrant has no
employees of its own.
 
(d) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS
 
 The Company has no foreign operations. Its domestic operations during 1995
were primarily in Ohio.
 
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
 
 The Company owns its home office building, located at 17800 Royalton Road,
Strongsville, Ohio. The building, which consists of 121,625 square feet of gross
floor area, was occupied in late 1990 by the Company and all its subsidiaries.
Central, the principal operating subsidiary, entered into a 15 year triple net
lease agreement with the Company for 100 of the space. All operations are
conducted in this building. As indicated in the Capital Resources section, of
Item 7, the Company is planning an addition to the existing building, but no
capital commitments have been made as of March 18, 1996.
 
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
 Other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is party to any material pending legal
proceeding nor is any of their property the subject thereof.
 
ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
 
 No matter was submitted during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
covered by this report to a vote of security holders through the solicitation of
proxies or otherwise.

(b) As of March 18, 1996, there were 1,687 record holders of the Common
Shares.
 
 (c) The cash dividends paid by the Company in the past two years are
indicated in the table above. The Company's present source of income, other than
a nominal amount of investment income, is dividends and rent from Central.
Central, the main operating subsidiary, is subject to certain restrictions which
are contained in the Insurance Holding Company statute (Ohio Revised Code
3901.34) which prevent Central from paying the Company, without the approval of
the Ohio Superintendent of Insurance, any dividend from other than earned
surplus (as defined in the statute) or any dividend whose value, together with
the value of other dividends paid or distributions made within the preceding 12
months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10 of Central's surplus as regards
policyholders as of the December 31 next preceding the dividend payment, or (ii)
the net income of Central for the 12-month period ended the December 31 next
preceding the dividend payment. The Company believes it will be able to continue
paying dividends. Payment, however, will be determined by the Company's Board of
Directors based on an analysis of the Company's earnings, applicable regulatory
restrictions, the competitive climate in which the Company operates, and other
relevant considerations.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
 OF OPERATION
 
LIQUIDITY:
 
 Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of
cash to meet its financial commitments. The major needs for cash for the Company
are Central Reserve Life Insurance Company's (Central) ability to pay claims and
expenses as they come due. Central's primary sources of cash are premiums and
investment income. Central's payments consist of current claim payments to
insureds, managed care expenses, operating expenses such as salaries, employee
benefits, commissions, taxes, etc., and shareholder dividends payable to the
Company. By statute, the state regulatory authorities set minimum liquidity
standards to protect both policyholders and shareholders and limit the dividends
payable by Central to the Company. See Item 5.
 
 The majority of the Company's assets are in investments which were
 91,310,781, after a net unrealized holding gain of 1,174,528, before taxes,
(see below), or 78 of the total assets at December 31, 1995. Fixed
 
 9
 11
 
maturities are the primary investment of the Company and were 81,827,055 or 90 
of total investments at December 31, 1995. The Company is carrying fixed
maturities of 11,995,728 at amortized cost (held to maturity) and fixed
maturities of 69,831,327 at fair value (available for sale) at December 31,
1995. The Company does not hold any so-called "junk" bonds or what are generally
considered high-yield type securities, and 99 of the bonds are of investment
grade quality. In accordance with SFAS 115, the Company recorded an increase in
investments of 1,174,528 to reflect the reporting of investments classified as
available for sale at fair value (estimated market value) which was higher than
amortized cost. The credit is reflected in shareholders' equity as a "net
unrealized holding gain". In addition to the fixed maturities, the Company also
had 5.2 million in unrestricted cash and 9.4 million in short term investments
at December 31, 1995. Central also has an unused 1 million line of credit with
a major bank. During 1995, total assets increased about 9.3 million, or 9 to
 117,329,038, mainly due to a positive cash flow from operations during the year
from premiums, investment income and the 1,174,528 net unrealized holding gain.
 
 Liabilities accrued for future policy benefits and policy claims payable
increased 4 , or about 2.6 million to 65,317,522 primarily because of a
strengthening of reserves and increased premiums. Shareholders' equity increased
 8,770,248 after paying dividends of 1,937,952 and an increase of 6,202,243
for a net unrealized holding gain.
 
CAPITAL RESOURCES:
 
 The only long-term debt the Company has at December 31, 1995, is
 8,599,067, which is the principal amount payable under a loan secured by a
mortgage on the Company's home office building. The Company entered into the
loan agreement in 1990 for 9 million for a term of 10 years bearing interest at
9 1/2 per annum with a 30 year amortization period payment schedule. At the
same time, the Company also entered into a 15 year lease agreement with Central
for 100 of the space. The Company will use the monthly rental payments to pay,
among other expenses, the required mortgage loan payments. In 1995, the Company
started a search for a new computer system for claims and administration which
includes, among other things, billing, rating and commission functions. The
increase in the Company's business, new state mandates and new products have
created the need for this new system. A system of this nature is expected to
cost between 5 million and 7 million, including software, hardware and
implementation, over an estimated three year period. The Company estimates these
costs could be recovered over a 4 to 5 year period, through a combination of
payroll cost savings, expense controls and new production capacity. The Company
has not entered into any contract or commitment for the purchase of such a
computer system, although such an acquisition is planned for 1996. In light of
the Company's growth over the last several years, the Company is also planning
an addition to its existing headquarters building. The addition would provide
space for training, Managed Care and computer facilities. The preliminary plans
indicate an estimated cost between 6 million and 7 million however, the
Company has not made any capital commitment with respect to the addition as of
March 18, 1996.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:
 
 1995 compared to 1994
 
 During 1995, premiums increased 4 to 233,168,529 from 223,679,071 in
1994. The increase was primarily in the group life and health division which
accounted for about 98 of total premiums. Group certificates in force increased
about 10 to 113,720 in 1995 from 102,959 in 1994. Certificates issued for new
group policies were 44,398 in 1995, up 42 , from 31,270 in 1994. The increase
came primarily from a new product, the Professional Multi-Option (PMO), which
was introduced in late 1994 and targets small businesses with 2 to 25 lives.
Total lapses (net of additions/decreases) in 1995 were 33,637, down slightly
from 33,847 in 1994. Overall, the lapse ratio was in line with the Company's
expectations and was lower than the industry average for small group business.
 
 Not included in premiums, for generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) purposes, were annuity considerations in the amounts of 3,498,442 and
 3,492,402 for 1995 and 1994.
 
 Net investment income decreased about 1 to 6,454,038 in 1995 from
 6,515,927 in 1994. The decrease was primarily due to the overall decrease in
interest rates during 1995. Also, during 1995 the Company
 
 10
 12
 
reduced its holdings in mortgage-backed securities and convertible bonds. The
proceeds were invested in short term government type securities at lower
interest rates, but produced a more liquid and stable position.
 
 Benefits and claims incurred expenses increased 7 in 1995 to 165,472,603
from 155,257,560 in 1994. This compares to a 6 increase in 1994 over 1993. The
incurred loss ratio was 71 for 1995 and 69.4 for 1994. The major increase in
claims was during the last quarter, primarily the last month. The loss ratio
increased to 73.6 for the fourth quarter of 1995 compared to 67.7 in the same
quarter in 1994. During the fourth quarter the Company experienced, as many
small group carriers did, an increase in claims due to utilization, state
mandates and accidents. This trend continued into January 1996. In response, the
Company has increased premium rates, not renewed certain blocks of business and
is updating several managed care controls.
 
 Commissions decreased slightly to 33,411,203 in 1995 from 33,573,278 in
1994 and were 14.3 of premiums in 1995 compared to 15 in 1994. The decrease is
attributed to a lower commission rate for the new product (PMO) sold in 1995 and
the growth in renewal premiums which carry a lower commission rate. Expenses,
such as salaries, premium taxes, fees, etc., increased, in total, 1 in 1995
over 1994. However, as a percentage of premiums the ratio was lower in 1995,
15.0 compared to 15.4 in 1994.
 
 Net income tax as a percentage of pretax income was 24 in 1995 compared to
30 in 1994. The current portion of the tax decreased to 1,419,026 in 1995 from
 1,535,817 in 1994. The main reason for the decrease was the decrease in pretax
income. The decrease in the deferred tax expense is primarily due to the change
in the valuation allowance due to an unrealized holding gain in 1995 compared to
an unrealized holding loss in 1994.
 
 Net income for 1995 was 4,504,607 or 1.07 per share compared to
 4,813,761 or 1.14 per share in 1994. The decrease is primarily due to the
increase in the benefit loss ratio to 71 from 69.4 and a 1 decrease in
investment income for the year. Because group accident and health represents 98 
of Central's business, a higher loss ratio from this division has a negative
effect on the Company's earnings. The statutory loss ratio in the group accident
and health division increased to 69.4 in 1995 from 67.9 in 1994.
 
 The Federal income tax returns for the Company and its subsidiaries have
been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for 1991 and 1992. During
the third quarter of 1994, the IRS issued a proposal for adjustments to the
Company's returns for 1991 and 1992. The proposed deficiencies are approximately
 2.4 million of which 215,303, pertaining to some non deductible expenses and
certain assets expensed and not capitalized, was agreed to and paid in 1994. The
balance primarily deals with whether or not the Company's subsidiary, Central,
qualified as a life company, for tax purposes. The Company is vigorously
protesting the proposed deficiency and management believes existing law supports
the Company's position. Therefore, the Company has not recorded a liability for
the difference.
 
 If the IRS were to pursue litigation and prevail in its position that
Central no longer qualifies as a life company for tax purposes, Federal income
taxes would increase in the future. Presently, as a small life company, Central
is permitted, among other things, a deduction from the first 3 million of
income of 60 or 1.8 million. As Central's income increases above 3 million,
the special deduction is reduced proportionately. Besides relying on favorable
existing case law, Central may have, under certain circumstances, the ability to
change and market policies that could insure its qualification as a life company
for tax purposes in the future, if the need arises.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:
 
 1994 compared to 1993
 
 During 1994, premiums increased 7 to 223,679,071 from 208,730,840 in
1993. The increase was primarily in the group division which accounted for about
99 of total premiums. Group certificates in force decreased to 102,959 in 1994
from 105,536 in 1993. Certificates issued for new group policies were 31,270 in
1994, down from 36,586 in 1993. Management believes that the health care reform
bill activity in 1994 caused many policyholders to remain with their existing
coverage and others not to seek new coverage. Also certain new state mandates
curtailed some sales in some states, until the Company made certain adjustments
to comply with those mandates. Total lapses (net of additions/decreases) in 1994
were 33,847 compared to
 
 11
 13
 
27,225 in 1993. The increase is due to a combination of certain groups that were
not renewed and the continued higher lapses in an association type product which
is being used as a short term policy.
 
 Not included in premiums, for generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) purposes, are annuity considerations in the amounts of 3,492,402 and
 8,728,902 for 1994 and 1993. The decrease in annuity considerations was
primarily due to increasing interest rates available in other investments.
 
 Net investment income increased 21 to 6,515,927 from 5,367,184 in 1993.
Favorable cash flows in 1994 and 1993 aided in the increase in investments,
primarily fixed maturities which generated the majority of the investment
income. Offsetting the effect of the increase in investments was the effect of
lower interest rates during the first half of 1994.
 
 Benefits and claims incurred expenses increased 6 in 1994 to 155,257,560
from 146,017,738 in 1993. This compares to a 28 increase in 1993 over 1992.
The incurred loss ratio was 69.4 in 1994 and 69.9 in 1993. The improvement can
be attributed to managed care cost controls, certain rate adjustments, reduction
in large claims and an overall moderation in the medical inflation rate for
1994.
 
 Commissions increased 5 to 33,573,278 in 1994 from 32,120,808 in 1993
and were 15 of premiums in 1994 compared to 15.4 in 1993. The decrease in the
ratio is primarily due to the increase in renewal premiums, which carry a lower
commission than new business. Expenses increased 3 in 1994 over 1993 and were
15.4 of premiums compared to 16.1 in 1993.
 
 Net income tax expense as a percentage of pretax income was 30 in 1994
compared to 23 in 1993. The current portion of the tax, increased to 1,534,817
from 769,833 in 1993. The main reason for the increase in current taxes is the
increase in pretax income. The increase in the deferred tax expense is primarily
due to the increase in the valuation allowance. Since the Company's recovery
rates for prior years were lower than current tax rates a higher valuation
allowance is required. Also in the valuation allowance is 1,845,199 recorded
directly to shareholders' equity for the net unrealized holding loss, offsetting
the same amount shown as a deferred tax asset.
 
 Net income for 1994 was 4,813,761 or 1.14 per share compared to
 2,390,349 or .57 per share in 1993. The increase is primarily due to a 21 
increase in investment income, slightly lower benefit loss ratio of 69.4 
compared to 69.9 in 1993 and a decrease in the ratio of operating expenses to
premiums from 16.1 to 15.4 . Because group accident and health represents 97 
of Central's business, investment income and a lower loss ratio from this
division has a positive effect on the Company's earnings. Along with an increase
in investment income in the group accident and health division, the statutory
loss ratio decreased to 67.9 in 1994 from 69.5 in 1993.
 
IMPACT OF INFLATION:
 
 Inflation rates impact the Company's financial condition and operating
results in several areas. Changes in inflation rates impact the market value of
the investment portfolio and yields on new investments.
 
 Inflation has had an impact on claim costs and overall operating costs and
although it has been lower in the last few years, hospital and medical costs
have still increased at a higher rate than general inflation. While to a certain
extent these increased costs are offset by interest rates (investment income),
hospital charges increased, while the rate of income from investments decreased.
The Company will continue to establish premium rates in accordance with trends
in hospital and medical costs along with concentrating on various cost
containment programs.
 
LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS:
 
 It appears that no major Federal health care reform is scheduled to take
effect in 1996. However, incremental changes such as portability and limited
pre-existing conditions, are probable and even more likely to be enacted on the
state level. The Company cannot predict the ultimate timing or effect of any
legislative efforts, and no assurance can be given that any such efforts will
not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of
operations.
 
 12
 14
 
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS:
 
 In December 1991, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 107, "Disclosures about
Fair Value of Financial Instruments". The statement requires disclosure about
the fair value of financial instruments and was adopted by the Company in 1995.
 
 In October 1994, the FASB issued SFAS 119, "Disclosure about Derivative
Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments". This statement
requires disclosure about derivative financial instruments and amends existing
requirements of SFAS Nos. 105 and 107. SFAS 119 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years ending after December 15, 1995, for entities
with less than 150 million in total assets. However, as of December 31, 1995,
the Company does not own nor has it purchased any derivatives as defined in SFAS
119.
 
 In 1995, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." The focus of SFAS 106 is
principally on postretirement health care benefits and the effect on the
consolidated financial statements is discussed in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.
 
 In March 1995, FASB issued SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of." SFAS 121
requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in
operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash
flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets'
carrying amount. SFAS 121 also addresses the accounting for long-lived assets
that are expected to be disposed of. The statement is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1995. Previously issued consolidated financial
statements will not be restated. The Company will adopt SFAS 121 in 1996 and the
impact on the consolidated financial statements of adopting SFAS 121 is not
expected to be material.
 
 In October 1995, FASB issued SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation". The Company did not grant any of its shares of stock or other
equity instruments to employees in 1995 and therefore has not adopted SFAS 123
as of December 31, 1995.

 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Central Reserve Life Corporation:
 
 We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Central Reserve
Life Corporation and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also
have audited the financial statement schedules as listed in the accompanying
index. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audits.
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Central
Reserve Life Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

 CENTRAL RESERVE LIFE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
 DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1994 AND 1993
================================================================================
 
NOTE 1 -- SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
 The significant accounting policies followed by the Company that materially
affect financial reporting are summarized below. The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) which differ from statutory accounting practices prescribed or
permitted by regulatory authorities (see Note 4).
 
 (a) CONSOLIDATION POLICY
 
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Central
Reserve Life Corporation (Company) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Central
Reserve Life Insurance Company (Central), Western Reserve Administrative
Services, Inc. (Western) and CRL Asset Management Corporation (AMC). All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
 
 (b) DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
 Central is a life and accident and health insurer licensed in 35 states.
Central principally sells group insurance, however, it offers a full range of
life, health, and annuity products through general agents and independent
writing agents and is subject to competition from other insurers throughout the
United States. Central is subject to regulation by the insurance department of
states in which it is licensed, and undergoes periodic examinations by those
departments.
 
 The following is a description of certain risks facing life and accident
and health insurers and how Central mitigates those risks:
 
 Legal/Regulatory Risk is the risk that, changes in the legal or
 regulatory environment in which an insurer operates, will create additional
 expenses not anticipated by the insurer in pricing its products. That is,
 regulatory initiatives designed to reduce insurer profits or otherwise
 affecting the industry in which the insurer operates, new legal theories or
 insurance company insolvencies through guaranty fund assessments, may
 create costs for the insurer beyond those recorded in the financial
 statements. Central attempts to mitigate this risk by offering a wide range
 of products and by operating in 35 states, thus reducing its exposure to
 any single product or non-Federal jurisdiction, and also by employing
 underwriting practices which identify and minimize the adverse impact of
 this risk.
 
 It appears that no major Federal health care reform will take place in
 1996. However, incremental changes are more probable than major changes and
 it is more likely this will be on the state level than Federal. The Federal
 government has already enacted a series of health care mandates which has
 resulted in cost shifting from the Federal government to state government
 and the private sector. The Company cannot predict the ultimate timing or
 effect of such legislative efforts, and no assurance can be given that any
 such efforts will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
 business and results of operations.
 
 Credit Risk is the risk that issuers of securities owned by Central
 will default or that other parties, including reinsurers that have
 obligations to Central, will not pay or perform. Central attempts to
 minimize this risk by adhering to a conservative investment strategy and by
 maintaining sound reinsurance and credit and collection policies.
 
 Interest Rate Risk is the risk that interest rates will change and
 cause a decrease in the value of an insurer's investments. This change in
 rates may cause certain interest-sensitive products to become uncompetitive
 or may cause disintermediation. Central attempts to mitigate this risk by
 charging fees for non-conformance with certain policy provisions and/or by
 attempting to match the maturity schedule of
 
 20

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
 
 DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1994 AND 1993
================================================================================
 
 its assets with the expected payouts of its liabilities. To the extent that
 liabilities come due more quickly than assets mature, an insurer would have
 to sell assets prior to maturity and recognize a gain or loss.
 
 In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date
of the financial statements and revenues and expenses for the reporting period.
Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
 
 The estimates susceptible to significant change are those used in
determining the liability for future policy benefits, losses and claims.
Although some variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes
the amounts provided are adequate.
 
 (c) INVESTMENTS
 
 Effective January 1, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities". SFAS 115 requires that investments in all debt
securities and those equity securities with readily determinable market values
be classified into one of three categories: held to maturity, trading or
available for sale. Classification of investments is based upon management's
current intent. Debt securities which management has a positive intent and
ability to hold until maturity are classified as securities held to maturity and
are carried at amortized cost. Unrealized holding gains and losses on securities
held to maturity are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
Debt and equity securities that are purchased for short-term resale are
classified as trading securities. Trading securities are carried at market
value, with unrealized holding gains and losses included in earnings. All other
debt and equity securities not included in the above two categories are
classified as securities available for sale. Securities available for sale are
carried at market value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a
separate component of shareholders' equity, net of tax. At December 31, 1995 the
Company did not have any investments classified as trading securities.
 
 (d) DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS
 
 Certain costs, principally commissions, which vary with and are directly
related to the production of ordinary life business, have been deferred. The
deferred costs are being amortized through the use of factors over the benefit
period of the related policies. These factors were developed using assumptions
which are consistent with those used in setting rates. Due to the nature of the
business and its persistency experience, the Company does not defer acquisition
costs for Central's group business. Deferred policy acquisition costs at
December 31, 1995 and 1994 were 209,760 and 149,926, respectively. The net
amounts amortized to income were 59,834 in 1995, 60,116 in 1994 and 16,849 in
1993.
 
 (e) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
 
 Included in the 11.6 million for property and equipment is approximately
 10 million (net of depreciation) for the home office, of which 1.4 million is
for land. Depreciation for the building is primarily over 31.5 years, except for
certain components which will be over 15 years. The straight-line method is
used.
 
 Other property and equipment, primarily furniture, fixtures and data
processing equipment, is carried at cost less allowances for depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the equipment, principally five and seven years.
 
 (f) POLICY RESERVES
 
 Liabilities for future policy benefits on ordinary life insurance have
generally been provided on a net-level premium method based upon estimates of
future investment yield, mortality and withdrawals using Central's
 
 21
 23
 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
 
 DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1994 AND 1993
================================================================================
 
experience and actuarial judgement with an allowance for possible unfavorable
deviation from the expected experience. The Company amortizes deferred costs of
all ordinary life policies for Central over the benefit period. The liability
for future policy benefit reserves has been computed using the following
assumptions:
 
 (1) The guaranteed interest rate on policies currently being issued is
 4.5 .
 
 (2) Estimates of future mortality and withdrawals are based on experience
 and established industry tables.
 
 (g) LIFE AND ACCIDENT AND HEALTH CLAIM RESERVES
 
 The liabilities for unpaid accident and health and death claims are
estimated principally based upon past experience for pending, incurred but not
reported, and reopened claims. The liability includes a provision for the
estimated cost of investigating and settling the claim liability. The liability
is particularly sensitive to recent claims frequency and severity experience of
Central. Management believes the liabilities for unpaid claims are adequate. A
consulting actuary is retained by Central to assist in the estimation process
and to certify to the statutory reserves.
 
 (h) RECOGNITION OF PREMIUM REVENUES AND BENEFITS
 
 Life premiums are recognized as revenues as they become due. Benefits and
expenses are reported in a manner which results in the recognition of profits
over the life of the policy. Such recognition is accomplished through the
provision of liabilities for future benefits over the life of the contract and
the amortization of acquisition costs over the benefit period.
 
 Accident and health insurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the
terms, principally monthly, of the policies. Policy claims are charged to
expense in the period that the claims are incurred.
 
 Contracts that do not subject Central to risks arising from policyholder
mortality or morbidity are referred to as investment contracts. Certain deferred
and flexible annuities are considered investment contracts. Amounts received as
payments for such contracts are accounted for as deposits and included in future
policy benefits, losses and claims.
 
 (i) EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
 Net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. The number of shares was increased to reflect shares
issuable on the exercise of options, reduced by the number of shares assumed to
have been purchased with the proceeds from the exercise of these common stock
equivalents. The number of shares used to calculate the earnings per share was
4,221,636 in 1995, 4,201,069 in 1994 and 4,182,384 in 1993.
 
 (j) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
 
 The Company follows SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". Under the
asset and liability method of SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under
SFAS 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

 At December 31, 1995, 27,477,972 of consolidated shareholders' equity
represents net assets of the Company's insurance subsidiary which is subject to
certain regulatory restrictions on paying dividends and making loans or advances
to the parent company. Generally, the net assets of the Company's insurance
subsidiary available for transfer to the parent company are limited to the
amounts by which the insurance subsidiary's net assets, as determined in
accordance with statutory accounting practices, exceed minimum statutory
requirements. In addition, payments of such amounts as dividends are subject to
approval by

regulatory authorities when (i) any such dividend is proposed to be paid from
other than earned surplus (as defined in the applicable statute) or (ii) the
value of any such dividend, together with the value of other dividends paid or
distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of (a)
ten percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of the 31st day

Central's statutory accounting practices are all prescribed by the Ohio
Department of Insurance.
 
 In December 1992, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(NAIC) adopted the Life Risk-Based Capital (RBC) formula. This model act
requires every life and health insurer to calculate its total adjusted capital
and RBC requirement, and provides for an insurance commissioner to intervene if
the insurer experiences financial difficulty. The formula includes components
for asset risk, liability risk, interest rate exposure and other factors. The
RBC requirement is for statutory financial statements and was effective

December 31, 1993. The model act was adopted in Ohio, Central's state of
domicile, in 1995. Based upon the December 31, 1995 statutory financial
statements, Central exceeded all the required RBC levels.
 
NOTE 5 -- FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
 
 The Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return with its
subsidiaries. The provision for Federal income tax does not bear the customary
relationship to pretax accounting income because of special tax provisions
available to life insurance companies. Central receives a benefit provided for
"small" life insurance companies.
 
 Under the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959, a portion of
insurance companies' net income, prior to 1984, is not subject to Federal income
taxes (within certain limitations) until it is distributed to stockholders, at
which time it is taxed at regular corporate rates. For Federal income tax
purposes, this untaxed income is accumulated in a memorandum account designated
"policyholders' surplus". The accumulated untaxed policyholders' surplus for
Central is 2,869,768.
 
 Federal income tax expense is composed of the following:

The Federal income tax returns for the Company and its subsidiaries have
been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for 1991 and 1992. During
the third quarter of 1994, the IRS issued a proposal for adjustments to the
Company's returns for 1991 and 1992. The proposed deficiencies are approximately
 2.4 million of which 215,303, pertaining to some non deductible expenses and
certain assets expensed and not capitalized, was agreed to and paid in 1994. The
balance primarily deals with whether or not the Company's subsidiary, Central,
qualified as a life company, for tax purposes. The Company intends to vigorously
protest
 
 28

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
 
 DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1994 AND 1993
================================================================================
 
the proposed deficiency and management believes existing law supports the
Company's position. Therefore, the Company has not recorded a liability for the
difference.
 
 If the IRS were to pursue litigation and prevail in its position that
Central no longer qualifies as a life company for tax purposes, Federal income
taxes would increase in the future. Presently, as a small life company, Central
is permitted, among other things, a deduction from the first 3 million of
income of 60 or 1.8 million. As Central's income increases above 3 million,
the special deduction is reduced proportionately. Besides relying on favorable
existing case law, Central may have, under certain circumstances, the ability to
change and market policies that could insure its qualification as a life company
for tax purposes in the future, if the need arises.
 
 The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31,
1995 and 1994 are presented below:

1995 1994

 Deferred tax assets:

The Company establishes a valuation allowance based on its analysis
(scheduling) of future deductible amounts. A valuation allowance is currently
established to the extent future deductible amounts cannot offset future taxable
amounts or recover Federal income taxes paid within the statutory carryback
period. Fluctuation in the valuation allowance is attributed to changes in the
effect of the small life insurance company deduction and to a 100 valuation
allowance on the deferred tax benefits on the net unrealized holding loss at
December 31, 1994 and no valuation allowance applicable to the deferred tax
expense on the net unrealized holding gain at December 31, 1995.
 
NOTE 6 -- MORTGAGE NOTE PAYABLE
 
 The Company executed a note payable, in December 1990, for 9,000,000
bearing interest at 9 1/2 per annum for 10 years. The Company received
 8,500,000 of the funds in December 1990 and the remaining 500,000 in December
1991. The mortgage note is collateralized by the home office building and by an
assignment of the tenant lease for the building. The Company has been required
to make monthly payments, since January 1991, based on a 30 year amortization
schedule, of 75,677 for 10 years. After five years, the

Company has the right to prepay the loan with a 3 prepayment fee. Principal
payments due in the next five years, assuming no prepayments, are 95,291 in

NOTE 8 -- EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT
 
 The Company's employment agreement with its Chief Executive Officer was
entered into in 1982 and amended in 1983. The agreement expires December 31,
2001 and calls for annual increases of 11 per year through 1996. The 1995
compensation under the agreement was 871,166. The agreement has a change of
control provision, which if exercised, upon such a change would require a lump
sum payment for the unexpired term.
 
NOTE 9 -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
 In the ordinary course of business, Central cedes reinsurance to other
insurers. These arrangements limit the maximum net policy benefit potential on
individual risks. Although the ceding of reinsurance does not discharge the
original insurer from its primary liability to its policyholders, the insurance
company that assumes the coverage also assumes the related liability.
 
 The maximum amount of exposure that Central retains on any life is 50,000
on ordinary life and 25,000 on group life on ages through 70. No retention is
maintained over age 70. Maximum retention on impaired risks is 10,000. Central
also has reinsurance on group accident and health claims. Effective January 1,
1995, Central's reinsurance treaty provides that all individual claims in excess
of 500,000 are 100 reinsured. The overall effect of reinsurance is not
material to the Company's financial condition. Reinsurance treaties in effect at
December 31, 1995 were with The Cologne Life Reinsurance Company, Life
ReAssurance Corporation of America and Business Men's Assurance Company.
 
 Central has a 1 million line of credit with a major bank, which was unused
as of December 31, 1995 and 1994.
 
 The Company is involved in litigation and may become involved in potential
litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of
management, the effects, if any, of such litigation are not expected to be
material to the Company's consolidated financial condition.

NOTE 10 -- STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK ISSUED
 
 Outstanding stock options consist of options granted by the Company at
prices equal to or above market price on the date of grant. On March 15, 1983,
an Incentive Stock Option Plan was adopted. The plan, which expired in May 1993,
provided that key full-time employees of the Company and its subsidiaries were
eligible for participation in the Plan. Also 300,000 options were granted to the
CEO in 1984, expiring in 1997, of which 255,000 at 2.83 per share remain
outstanding at December 31, 1995. No options are available for future grants.

NOTE 11 -- PREFERRED SHARES
 
 The Company has authorized 2,000,000 Non-Voting Preferred Shares, without
par value. The Company has never issued any Non-Voting Preferred Shares,
however, the Board of Directors is authorized at any time to provide for the
issuance of, such shares in one or more series, and to determine the
designations, preferences, limitations and other rights of the shares issued.
Holders of Non-Voting Preferred Shares shall have no voting rights except as
required by law. For each series, the Board of Directors shall determine, prior
to the issuance of any shares thereof, the designations, preferences,
limitations and relative or other rights thereof, including but not limited to
the dividend rate, liquidation price, redemption rights and price, sinking fund
requirements, conversion rights and restrictions on the issuance of such shares.
 
NOTE 12 -- PENSION PLAN
 
 The Company adopted a noncontributory pension plan in 1978. The plan is a
defined contribution money purchase pension plan with an outside company,
covering substantially all full-time employees of age 20 1/2 or more who have
completed six months or more of service. Participants in the plan begin vesting
after two years of service and are fully vested after seven years. The
contribution was approximately 1,137,000 for 1995, 1,013,000 for 1994 and
 1,000,000 for 1993.
 
NOTE 13 -- OTHER BENEFIT PLANS
 
 In addition to the Company's defined contribution pension plan, the
Company, beginning in 1995, sponsors a retiree health benefit program for
certain officer-class employees who meet specified age and service criteria. The
Company and, as applicable, eligible retirees, fund the payment of benefits
under the program in amounts and at such times as claims are incurred. Benefits
for under age 65 retirees are based on continuation of prevailing active
employee health coverage, and for over age 65 retirees are based on
reimbursement of expenses for Medicare Part B and a Medicare Supplement
Insurance Policy. The Company and, as applicable, eligible retirees, fund the
payment of benefits under the program in amounts and at such times as premium
payments or reimbursement of premium payments are incurred.

The assumed annual health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected
cost of benefits under the program is initially 10 , declining by approximately
1 per annum to an ultimate assumed trend rate of 5 in the year 2003.
 
 The assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on

health; life insurance and annuities; and corporate and other.
 
 The following table presents the revenues and income (loss), on a GAAP

NOTE 15 -- DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 (SFAS 107) "Disclosures
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments" requires disclosure of fair value
information about existing on and off-balance sheet financial instruments. In
cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on
estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.
 
 These techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used,
including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Although fair
value estimates are calculated using assumptions that management believes are
appropriate, changes is assumptions could cause these estimates to vary
materially. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be
substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not
be realized in the immediate settlement of the instruments. SFAS 107 excludes
certain assets and liabilities from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly,
the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value
of the Company.
 
 The tax ramifications of the related unrealized gains and losses can have a
significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the
estimates.
 
 The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in
estimating its fair value disclosures:
 
 INVESTMENT SECURITIES: Fair value for fixed maturity securities is based
on quoted market prices, where available. For fixed maturity securities not
actively traded, fair value is estimated using values obtained from independent
pricing services or, in the case of private placements, is estimated by
discounting expected future cash flows using a current market rate applicable to
the yield, credit quality and maturity of the investments.
 
 CASH, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, PREMIUMS RECEIVABLE AND POLICY LOANS: The
carrying amount reported in the balance sheets for these instruments approximate
their fair value.

 DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1994 AND 1993
================================================================================
 
 ANNUITY POLICIES: The fair value for the annuity reserves is the amount
payable on demand.
 
 OTHER POLICYHOLDERS' FUNDS: The carrying amount reported in the
consolidated balance sheets for these instruments approximate their fair value.
 
 MORTGAGE NOTE PAYABLE: The carrying amount reported in the consolidated
balance sheets for the mortgage note payable approximates its fair value.
 
 Carrying amount and estimated fair value of financial instruments subject
to SFAS 107 are as follows as of December 31:
