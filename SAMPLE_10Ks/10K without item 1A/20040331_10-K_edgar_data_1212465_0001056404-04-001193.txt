INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT ON
MANAGEMENT'S ASSERTION ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH UNIFORM SINGLE ATTESTATION PROGRAM
REQUIREMENTS

To the Board of Directors EverHome Mortgage Company:

We have examined management's assertion about EverHome Mortgage Company's (the
"Company") (formerly Alliance Mortgage Company) compliance with the minimum
servicing standards identified in the Mortgage Bankers Association of America's
Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers (USAP) as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2003 included in the accompanying management assertion.
Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with those minimum
servicing standards. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's
assertion about the entity's compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
minimum servicing standards and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
legal determination on the Company's compliance with the minimum servicing
standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned minimum servicing standards as of and for the year ended December
31, 2003 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS - USAP
DECEMBER 31, 2003

Statement of Condition:

During our testing of the Custodial Cash bank reconciliations, we noted that 1
reconciliation out of 30 reconciliations was not prepared within 45 days of the
cutoff date. Additionally, there were 2 reconciliations out of 30
reconciliations that had items outstanding greater than 90 days that could have
been cleared earlier. Each of these exceptions did not meet the minimum
servicing standards set forth in the Mortgage Banker's Association's Uniform
Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers (the USAP).

Criteria:

The Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers, Section I.1.
requirement that reconciliations are mathematically accurate and are prepared
within forty-five (45) calendar days after the cutoff date. Reconciling items
shall also be resolved within ninety (90) calendar days of their original
identification.

Recommendation:

We recommend that the Company prepare Custodial Cash bank reconciliations and
clear reconciling items within the minimum time periods specified by the USAP.

Corrective Action Plan:

Due to significant increases in volume of activity and staff turn-over, these
accounts were being handled by inexperienced staff members. The Company has
since increased the number and quality of staff in this area through additional
hiring and training. As a result, the Company is not aware of any current USAP
violations related to these accounts.
