 PART I

 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

 Krupp Realty Fund, Ltd.-III (the "Partnership") is a limited partnership
 formed on April 23, 1982 with The Krupp Company and The Krupp Corporation
 as the General Partners. The Partnership issued all of the Original
 Limited Partner Interests to The Krupp Company (See Note A to Consolidated
 Financial Statements included in Item 8 (Appendix A) of this report for
 additional information). The primary business of the Partnership is to
 invest in, operate, refinance and ultimately dispose of properties and
 related assets of the Partnership. The Partnership considers itself to be
 engaged only in the industry segment of investment in real estate.

 The Partnership's real estate investments are subject to some seasonal
 fluctuations due to changes in utility consumption and seasonal
 maintenance expenditures. However, the future performance of the
 Partnership will depend upon factors which cannot be predicted. Such
 factors include general economic and real estate market conditions, both
 on a national basis and in those areas where the Partnership's investments
 are located, real estate tax rates, operating expenses, energy costs,
 government regulations, and federal and state income tax laws. The
 requirements for compliance with federal, state and local regulations to
 date have not had an adverse effect on the Partnership's operations, and
 no adverse effect is anticipated in the future. 

 The Partnership's investments in real estate are also subject to such
 risks as (i) competition from existing and future projects held by other
 owners in the areas of the Partnership's properties, (ii) possible
 reduction in rental income due to an inability to maintain high occupancy
 levels, (iii) possible adverse changes in mortgage interest rates, (iv)
 possible adverse changes in general economic and local conditions, such as
 competitive over-building, increased unemployment or adverse changes in
 real estate zoning laws, and the possible future adoption of rent control
 legislation which would not permit the full amount of increased costs to
 be passed on to tenants in the form of rent increases, and (v) other
 circumstances over which the Partnership may have little or no control.

 As of December 31, 1995, there were 26 full and part-time on-site
 personnel employed by the Partnership.

 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

 As of December 31, 1995, the Partnership had leveraged investments in
 three apartment complexes having an aggregate of 990 units.

 A summary of the Partnership's real estate investments is presented
 below.

Average Occupancy
 Year December 31, 
 Description Acquired Total Units 1995 1994 1993 1992 1991

Brookeville Apartments

 Dorsey's Forge Apartments
 and Oakland Meadows
 Columbia, Maryland 1983 250 Units 94 95 92 93 89 
 
 In July 1993, in conjunction with the refinancing of Brookeville
 Apartments with the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"),
 the General Partners of the Partnership created Brookeville Apartments
 Limited Partnership ("Brookeville L.P."). The property was subsequently
 transferred to Brookeville L.P., with the Partnership retaining a 100 
 interest in Brookeville L.P..

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 There are no material pending legal proceedings to which the
 Partnership is a party or of which any of its property is the subject.

 ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

 None.

 PART II

 ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
 STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

 The transfer of units of Limited Partner Interest (the "Units") is
 subject to certain limitations contained in the Partnership Agreement.
 There is no public market for the Units and it is not anticipated that any
 such public market will develop.

 The number of Investor Limited Partners as of December 31, 1995 was
 approximately 1,700.

 One of the objectives of the Partnership is to generate cash
 available for distribution, however, there is no assurance that future
 operations will generate cash available for distribution. The Partnership
 discontinued distributions during 1990 because of insufficient operating
 cash flow. Subsequently, property 
 operations improved and distributions were reinstituted and paid in
 August, 1994. The Partnership anticipates that distributions will
 continue and be paid semi-annually.

 The Partnership made the following distributions to its Partners
 during the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994:

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 Liquidity and Capital Resources

 The Partnership's ability to generate cash adequate to meet its needs
 is dependent primarily upon the operations of its real estate
 investments. Such ability is also dependent upon the future availability
 of bank borrowings and the potential refinancing and sale of the
 Partnership's remaining real estate investments. These sources of
 liquidity will be used by the Partnership for payment of expenses related
 to real estate operations, capital expenditures, debt service and
 expenses. Cash Flow, if any, as calculated under Section 8.2(a) of the
 Partnership Agreement, will then be available for distribution to the
 Partners. Due to improvements in the operations of the properties and
 reduced debt service, the Partnership had sufficient cash flow in 1994 to
 reinstate distributions at a rate of 3.97 per Unit. In 1995, the
 distribution rate increased to 11.90 per Unit. In 1996, the
 distribution rate is scheduled to increase to a rate of 15.86 per Unit.

 Renovations at the Partnership's properties have resulted in higher
 occupancies and increased rental revenue through 1994 and into 1995. The
 Partnership is planning on spending approximately 467,000 on
 improvements at Brookeville in 1996 including the replacement of
 cabinets, countertops, carpeting and appliances, of which approximately
 125,000 will be funded from the replacement reserve escrow. Dorsey's
 Forge and Oakland Meadows ("Dorsey's") and Hannibal Grove ("Hannibal")
 are budgeting 260,000 and 435,000, respectively, in improvements in
 1996.

 Cash Flow

 Shown below, as required by the Partnership Agreement, is the
 calculation of Cash Flow of the Partnership for the year ended December
 31, 1995. The General Partners provide certain of the information below
 to meet requirements of the Partnership Agreement and because they
 believe that it is an appropriate supplemental measure of operating
 performance. However, Cash Flow should not be considered by the reader
 as a substitute to net income(loss), as an indicator of the Partnership's
 operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. 

Rounded to 1,000

Net loss for tax purposes (200,000) 

 Items not requiring or (requiring) the use
 of operating funds:
 Tax basis depreciation and amortization 1,391,000 
 Principal payments on mortgage notes payable (306,000) 
 Expenditures for capital improvements (1,064,000) 
 Amounts released from working capital reserves 544,000

 Cash Flow 365,000

Operations

 1995 Compared to 1994

 In comparing 1995 to 1994, cash flow improved primarily as a result of
 a reduction in capital expenditures. The increase in rental revenue
 during 1995 as compared to 1994 is due to increases in rental rates at
 all the Partnership's properties. The increase in rental rates is
 related to the capital improvement programs undertaken at the properties.
 Average occupancy at Hannibal and Dorsey's remained relatively stable
 during 1995 at 93 and 94 , respectively. Occupancy remained stable at
 Brookeville despite a fire during 1995.

 Total expenses of the Partnership, net of depreciation, have decreased
 slightly in 1995, as compared to 1994. Savings in operating expenses
 were due to management's efforts in reducing reimbursable costs. These
 savings were offset by an increase in maintenance expenses due to minor
 fire damage at Brookeville. Depreciation increased in 1995, as compared
 to 1994, as a result of capital improvement programs at the properties.

 The Partnership expects occupancy to remain stable in 1996, with the
 opportunity for a slight increase. Renovations at Brookeville will take
 place throughout the year, and the improved physical condition should
 increase the occupancy level and rental revenue at Brookeville.

 1994 Compared to 1993

 In comparing 1994 to 1993, the increase in cash flow was primarily due
 to increased rental revenue and a reduction in interest expense. The
 increase in rental revenue in 1994, as compared to 1993 is due primarily
 to an increase in rents across the Partnership's properties. Following
 the completion of renovations at Hannibal, the property was able to lower
 concessions and increase occupancy and thereby increase revenues.
 Average occupancy rates at Hannibal and Dorsey's during 1994 were 94 and
 95 , respectively, a significant increase compared to 1993 occupancy of
 88 and 92 , respectively. Vacancies have decreased during 1994 compared
 to 1993 due to improved market conditions and absorption of excess market
 supply where properties are located. 

 The refinancings of the Partnership's properties in 1993 decreased the
 effective interest rates the properties were previously paying, thereby
 decreasing interest expense for 1994 as compared to 1993.

 General

 In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting
 for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be
 Disposed Of", which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
 December 15, 1995, the Partnership has implemented policies and practices
 for assessing impairment of its real estate assets.

 The investments in properties are carried at cost less accumulated
 depreciation unless the General Partners believe there is a significant
 impairment in value, in which case a provision to write down investments
 in properties to fair value will be charged against income. At this
 time, the
 
 General Partners do not believe that any assets of the Partnership are
 significantly impaired.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Partners of Krupp Realty Fund, Ltd.-III:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements and
 financial statement schedule of Krupp Realty Fund, Ltd.-III and
 Subsidiary (the "Partnership") listed in the index on page F-2 of this
 Form 10-K . These financial statements and financial statement schedule
 are the responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our
 responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
 financial statement schedule based on our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
 auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
 audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
 statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
 examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
 disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
 assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
 by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
 presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
 our opinion.

 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
 present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
 position of Krupp Realty Fund, Ltd.-III and Subsidiary at December 31,
 1995 and 1994, and the consolidated results of their operations and their
 cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,

 1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. In
 addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule referred to
 above, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
 taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
 information required to be included therein.

KRUPP REALTY FUND, LTD.-III AND SUBSIDIARY

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A. Organization

 Krupp Realty Fund, Ltd.-III (the "Partnership") was formed on April 23,
 1982 by filing a Certificate of Limited Partnership in The Commonwealth
 of Massachusetts. The Partnership terminates on December 31, 2020,
 unless earlier terminated upon the sale of the last of the
 Partnership's properties or the occurrence of certain other events as
 set forth in the Partnership Agreement. The Partnership issued all of
 the General Partner Interests to The Krupp Company and The Krupp
 Corporation in exchange for capital contributions aggregating 1,000.
 Except under certain limited circumstances upon termination of the
 Partnership, the General Partners are not required to make any
 additional capital contributions. The Partnership has also issued all
 of the Original Limited Partner Interests to The Krupp Company in
 exchange for a capital contribution of 4,000. The Original Limited
 Partner is not required to make any additional capital contributions to
 the Partnership. The purchasers of the 25,000 units of Investor
 Limited Partner Interests ("Units"), at a price of 1,000 per Unit are
 the Investor Limited Partners.

 B. Significant Accounting Policies

 The Partnership uses the following accounting policies for financial
 reporting purposes, which may differ in certain respects from those
 used for federal income tax purposes (see Note F).

 Basis of Presentation

 The consolidated financial statements present the consolidated
 assets, liabilities and operations of the Partnership. All
 intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

 Risks and Uncertainties

 The Partnership invests its cash primarily in deposits and money
 market funds with commercial banks. The Partnership has not
 experienced any losses to date on its invested cash.

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
 accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
 and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and
 liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
 the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of
 revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
 could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents

 The Partnership includes all short-term investments with maturities
 of three months or less from the date of acquisition in cash and
 cash equivalents. The cash investments are recorded at cost, which
 approximates current market values.

 Rental Revenues

 Leases require the payment of rent monthly in advance. Rental
 revenues are recorded on the accrual basis.

 Depreciation

 Depreciation is provided for by the use of the straight-line method
 over estimated useful lives as follows:

 Buildings and improvements 5 - 25 years
 Appliances, carpeting and equipment 3-15 years

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

 In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-
 Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of", which is effective for fiscal years
 beginning after December 15, 1995, the Partnership has implemented
 policies and practices for assessing impairment of its real estate
 assets.

 The investments in properties are carried at cost less accumulated
 depreciation unless the General Partners believe there is a
 significant impairment in value, in which case a provision to write
 down investments in properties to fair value will be charged against
 income. At this time, the General Partners do not believe that any
 assets of the Partnership are significantly impaired.

 Deferred Expenses

 The Partnership amortizes costs incurred in connection with
 obtaining mortgages over the life of the related mortgage using the
 straight-line method.

 Income Taxes

 The Partnership is not liable for federal or state income taxes as
 Partnership income or loss is allocated to the Partners for income
 tax purposes. In the event the Partnership's tax returns are
 examined by the Internal Revenue Service or state taxing authority
 and the examination results in a change in Partnership taxable
 income or loss, such change will be reported to the Partners.

 Reclassifications

 Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform with
 current year financial statement presentation.
 
 C. Mortgage Notes Payable

 Mortgage notes payable collateralized by the properties of the
 Partnership consist of the following at December 31:

1995 1994 

Brookeville Apartments 8,626,055 8,682,345
 Dorsey's Forge Apartments and
 Oakland Meadows 4,745,765 4,851,414
 Hannibal Grove Apartments 6,454,241 6,597,923
 19,826,061 20,131,682
 
 Brookeville

 Non-recourse first mortgage note payable in the original amount
 of 8,755,000 to the Department of Housing and Urban Development
 ("HUD"). The mortgage note requires monthly payments of 60,600
 consisting of principal and interest at the rate of 7.75 per
 annum. In addition, the Partnership is required to pay a
 monthly deposit of 5,158 to an escrow account to be used for
 future property replacements and improvements and a mortgage
 insurance premium equal to .5 per annum of the outstanding
 principal balance. The note matures on August 1, 2028. In
 accordance with HUD regulations, distributions are limited to
 the extent of Surplus Cash, as defined. The mortgage note
 payable is collateralized by the property and may not be prepaid
 for a period of five years and, thereafter, during the next five
 years beginning August 1, 1998, may be prepaid subject to a
 declining prepayment penalty of 5 to 1 , respectively. After
 August 1, 2003, there is no prepayment penalty. 

 Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the
 Partnership for bank loans with similar terms and average
 maturities, the fair value of long-term debt is approximately
 8,400,000.

 Hannibal and Dorsey's

 Non-recourse mortgage notes payable for Hannibal and Dorsey's of
 6,800,000 and 5,000,000, respectively, at the rate of 9.25 
 per annum. Monthly principal and interest payments are 62,333
 for Hannibal and 45,833 for Dorsey's. The notes mature on May
 3, 2000 at which time all unpaid principal, 5,653,175
 (Hannibal) and 4,156,746 (Dorsey's), and any accrued interest
 are due. The mortgage notes payable are collateralized by the
 respective properties. The notes may not be prepaid prior to
 June 1, 1998 and thereafter, may be prepaid subject to a
 prepayment penalty. The prepayment penalty will be the greater
 of 1) the principal balance multiplied by the difference between
 9.4301 and the yield rate on publicly traded U.S. Treasury
 Securities having the closest matching maturity date as reported
 in the Wall Street Journal, or 2) ten percent of the then
 outstanding principal. 
 
 Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the
 Partnership for bank loans with similar terms and average
 maturities, the fair value of long-term debt for Hannibal and
 Dorsey's is approximately 6,700,000 and 4,900,000,
 respectively.

 The annual required principal payments on the mortgage notes payable
 due in the five years 1996 through 2000 are 334,208, 365,482,
 399,694, 437,124 and 10,020,473, respectively.

 During 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Partnership paid 1,719,579, 1,745,712
 and 1,819,273 of interest, respectively, on its mortgage notes.

 D. Partners' Deficit

 Under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, profits and losses from
 operations are allocated 95 to the Investor Limited Partners, 4 to
 the Original Limited Partner and 1 to the General Partners until such
 time that the Investor Limited Partners have received a return of their
 total invested capital plus a 9 per annum Cumulative Return on
 Investment thereon and thereafter, 65 to the Investor Limited
 Partners, 28 to the Original Limited Partner and 7 to the General
 Partners.

 Also, under the Partnership Agreement, cash distributions from
 operations are generally made on the same basis as the allocations of
 profits and losses described above. Net cash proceeds, as determined
 by the General Partners, resulting from transactions such as
 refinancing or sale of a property, are to be distributed as follows:
 1) to the Investor Limited Partners until they have received a return
 of their total Invested Capital; 2) to the Investor Limited Partners
 until they have received an amount equal to their Cumulative Return on
 Investment in respect of all fiscal years of the Partnership; 3) to the
 Original Limited Partner and General Partners until they have received
 a return of their total Invested Capital; 4) to an unaffiliated
 brokerage firm (the "sales agent") to the extent of any subordinated
 Financial Consulting Fee then due, and; 5) any remaining Cash Proceeds
 shall be distributed 65 to the Investor Limited Partners, 28 to the
 Original Limited Partner and 7 to the General Partners.
 Notwithstanding anything above, the General Partners shall, under all
 circumstances, receive at least 1 of all distributions of net cash
 proceeds from a capital transaction.

 In general, the allocation of profits and losses are calculated based
 on the terms of the Partnership Agreement, as described above.
 However, the Internal Revenue Code contains rules which govern the
 allocation of tax losses among partners. For 1995, the allocation of
 tax losses was calculated based on these rules. Under this code, tax
 losses are not allocated to a limited partner if a general partner
 bears the economic risk for that loss. Due to operating losses
 incurred during 1995, the General Partners undertook additional
 liabilities on behalf of the Partnership. As a result, the Partnership
 allocated additional tax losses to the General Partners. In
 conjunction with the tax election referred to above, the consolidated
 financial statements presented herein reflect the allocation of net
 loss in accordance with the rules of the Internal Revenue Code.

As of December 31, 1995 the following cumulative partner contributions
 and allocations have been made since the inception of the Partnership:

Investor Original
 Limited Limited General
 Partners Partner Partners Total 

Capital contributions 25,000,000 4,000 1,000 25,005,000

 Total (4,981,262) (871,828) (297,600) (6,150,690)
 
 E. Related Party Transactions 

 Commencing with the date of acquisition of the Partnership's properties,
 the Partnership entered into agreements under which property management
 fees are paid to an affiliate of the General Partners for services as 
 management agent. Such agreements provide for management fees payable
 monthly at a rate of 5 of the gross receipts from the properties under
 management. The Partnership also reimburses affiliates of the General
 Partners for certain expenses incurred in connection with the operation
 of the Partnership and its properties including accounting, computer,
 insurance, travel, legal and payroll; and with the preparation and
 mailing of reports and other communications to the Limited Partners.
