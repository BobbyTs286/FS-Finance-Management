Item 1. Business.

 (a) General Development of Business

 AMERICAN INCOME FUND I-C, a Massachusetts Limited Partnership, (the
"Partnership") was organized as a limited partnership under the Massachusetts
Uniform Limited Partnership Act (the "Uniform Act") on March 1, 1991 for the
purpose of acquiring and leasing to third parties a diversified portfolio of
capital equipment. Partners' capital initially consisted of contributions of
 1,000 from the General Partner (AFG Leasing VI Incorporated) and 100 from the
Initial Limited Partner (AFG Assignor Corporation). On May 31, 1991, the
Partnership issued 803,454.56 units of limited partnership interest (the
"Units") to 909 investors. Included in the 803,454.56 units are 7,293.56 bonus
units. The Partnership has one General Partner, AFG Leasing VI Incorporated, a
Massachusetts corporation formed in 1990 and an affiliate of Equis Financial
Group Limited Partnership (formerly known as American Finance Group), a
Massachusetts limited partnership ("EFG" or the "Manager"). The General Partner
is not required to make any other capital contributions except as may be
required under the Uniform Act and Section 6.1(b) of the Amended and Restated
Agreement and Certificate of Limited Partnership (the "Restated Agreement, as
amended").

 (b) Financial Information About Industry Segments

 The Partnership is engaged in only one industry segment: the business of
acquiring capital equipment and leasing the equipment to creditworthy lessees on
a full payout or operating lease basis. Full payout leases are those in which
aggregate undiscounted noncancellable rents equal or exceed the acquisition cost
of the leased equipment. Operating leases are those in which the aggregate
undiscounted noncancellable rental payments are less than the acquisition cost
of the leased equipment. Industry segment data is not applicable.

 (c) Narrative Description of Business

 The Partnership was organized to acquire a diversified portfolio of capital
equipment subject to various full payout and operating leases and to lease the
equipment to third parties as income-producing investments. More specifically,
the Partnership's primary investment objectives were to acquire and lease
equipment that would:

 1. Generate quarterly cash distributions;

 2. Preserve and protect Partnership capital; and

 3. Maintain substantial residual value for ultimate sale.

 The Partnership has the additional objective of providing certain federal
income tax benefits.

 The Closing Date of the Offering of Units of the Partnership was May 31,
1991. Significant operations commenced coincident with the Partnership's initial
purchase of equipment and the associated lease commitments on May 31, 1991. The
acquisition of the equipment and its associated leases is described in Note 3 to
the financial statements included in Item 14, herein. The Restated Agreement, as
amended, provides that the Partnership will terminate no later than December 31,
2002. However, the Partnership is a Nominal Defendant in a Class Action Lawsuit,
the outcome of which could significantly alter the nature of the Partnership's
organization and its future business operations. See Note 8 to the financial
statements in the 1999 Annual Report.

 The Partnership has no employees; however, it is managed pursuant to a
Management Agreement with EFG or one of its affiliates. The Manager's role,
among other things, is to (i) evaluate, select, negotiate, and consummate the
acquisition of equipment, (ii) manage the leasing, re-leasing, financing, and
refinancing of equipment, and (iii) arrange the resale of equipment. The Manager
is compensated for such services as provided for in the Restated Agreement, as
amended, described in Item 13 herein, and in Note 5 to the financial statements
included in Item 14, herein.

The Partnership's investment in equipment is, and will continue to be,
subject to various risks, including physical deterioration, technological
obsolescence and defaults by lessees. A principal business risk of owning and
leasing equipment is the possibility that aggregate lease revenues and equipment
sale proceeds will be insufficient to provide an acceptable rate of return on
invested capital after payment of all debt service costs and operating expenses.
In addition, the leasing industry is very competitive. The Partnership is
subject to considerable competition when equipment is re-leased or sold at the
expiration of primary lease terms. The Partnership must compete with lease
programs offered directly by manufacturers and other equipment leasing
companies, including limited partnerships and trusts organized and managed
similarly to the Partnership, and including other EFG-sponsored partnerships and
trusts, which may seek to re-lease or sell equipment within their own portfolios
to the same customers as the Partnership. Many competitors have greater
financial resources and more experience than the Partnership, the General
Partner and the Manager. In addition, default by a lessee under a lease may
cause equipment to be returned to the Partnership at a time when the General
Partner or the Manager is unable to arrange for the re-lease or sale of such
equipment. This could result in the loss of anticipated revenue.

 Revenue from major individual lessees which accounted for 10 or more of
lease revenue during the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 is
incorporated herein by reference to Note 2 to the financial statements in the
1999 Annual Report. Refer to Item 14(a)(3) for lease agreements filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

 EFG is a Massachusetts limited partnership formerly known as American Finance
Group ("AFG"). AFG was established in 1988 as a Massachusetts general
partnership and succeeded American Finance Group, Inc., a Massachusetts
corporation organized in 1980. EFG and its subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Company") are engaged in various aspects of the equipment leasing business,
including EFG's role as Manager or Advisor to the Partnership and several other
direct-participation equipment leasing programs sponsored or co-sponsored by EFG
(the "Other Investment Programs"). The Company arranges to broker or originate
equipment leases, acts as remarketing agent and asset manager, and provides
leasing support services, such as billing, collecting, and asset tracking.

 The general partner of EFG, with a 1 controlling interest, is Equis
Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation owned and controlled entirely by Gary
D. Engle, its President, Chief Executive Officer and sole Director. Equis
Corporation also owns a controlling 1 general partner interest in EFG's 99 
limited partner, GDE Acquisition Limited Partnership ("GDE LP"). Mr. Engle
established Equis Corporation and GDE LP in December 1994 for the sole purpose
of acquiring the business of AFG.

 In January 1996, the Company sold certain assets of AFG relating primarily to
the business of originating new leases, and the name "American Finance Group,"
and its acronym to a third party. AFG changed its name to Equis Financial Group
Limited Partnership after the sale was concluded. Pursuant to terms of the sale
agreements, EFG specifically reserved the rights to continue using the name
American Finance Group and its acronym in connection with the Partnership and
the Other Investment Programs and to continue managing all assets owned by the
Partnership and the Other Investment Programs.

PART II

Item 5. Market for the Partnership's Securities and Related Security Holder
 Matters.

 (a) Market Information

 There is no public market for the resale of the Units and it is not
anticipated that a public market for resale of the Units will develop.

 (b) Approximate Number of Security Holders

 At December 31, 1999, there were 865 record holders in the Partnership.

 (c) Dividend History and Restrictions

 Historically, the amount of cash distributions to be paid to the Partners has
been determined on a quarterly basis. Each quarter's distribution may have
varied in amount and was made 95 to the Limited Partners and 5 to the General
Partner. Generally, cash distributions have been paid within 15 days after the
completion of each calendar quarter.

 The Partnership is a Nominal Defendant in a Class Action Lawsuit described in
Note 8 to the financial statements. The proposed settlement to that lawsuit, if
effected, will materially change the future organizational structure and
business interests of the Partnership, as well as its cash distribution
policies. In addition, commencing with the first quarter of 2000, the General
Partner believes that it will be in the Partnership's best interests to suspend
the payment of quarterly cash distributions pending final resolution of the
Class Action Lawsuit. Accordingly, future cash distributions are not expected to
be paid until the Class Action Lawsuit is adjudicated

 Distributions in 1999 and 1998 were as follows:

 General Limited
 Total Partner Partners
 ----------- ----------- -----------

Total 1999 distributions 634,306 31,716 602,590

Total 1998 distributions 634,306 31,716 602,590
 ----------- ----------- -----------
 Total 1,268,612 63,432 1,205,180
 =========== =========== ===========

 Distributions payable were 158,577 at both December 31, 1999 and 1998.

 There are no formal restrictions under the Restated Agreement, as amended,
that materially limit the Partnership's ability to pay cash distributions,
except that the General Partner may suspend or limit cash distributions to
ensure that the Partnership maintains sufficient working capital reserves to
cover, among other things, operating costs and potential expenditures, such as
refurbishment costs to remarket equipment upon lease expiration. Liquidity is
especially important as the Partnership matures and sells equipment, because the
remaining equipment base consists of fewer revenue-producing assets that are
available to cover prospective cash disbursements. Insufficient liquidity could
inhibit the Partnership's ability to sustain its operations or maximize the
realization of proceeds from remarketing its remaining assets.

 In particular, the Partnership must contemplate the potential liquidity risks
associated with its investment in commercial jet aircraft. The management and
remarketing of aircraft can involve, among other things, significant costs and
lengthy remarketing initiatives. Although the Partnership's lessees are required
to maintain the aircraft during the period of lease contract, repair,
maintenance, and/or refurbishment costs at lease expiration can be substantial.
For example, an aircraft that is returned to the Partnership meeting minimum
airworthiness standards,

6

such as flight hours or engine cycles, nonetheless may require heavy maintenance
in order to bring its engines, airframe and other hardware up to standards that
will permit its prospective use in commercial air transportation. At December
31, 1999, the Partnership had ownership interests in six commercial jet
aircraft. Three of the aircraft are Boeing 737 aircraft formerly leased to
Southwest Airlines, Inc. The lease agreements for each of these aircraft expired
on December 31, 1999 and Southwest elected to return the aircraft. The aircraft
are Stage 2 aircraft, meaning that they are prohibited from operating in the
United States after December 31, 1999 unless they are retro-fitted with
hush-kits to meet Stage 3 noise regulations promulgated by the Federal Aviation
Administration. The cost to hush-kit an aircraft, such as the Partnership's
Boeing 737s, can approach 2 million. At this time, the General Partner is
attempting to remarket these assets without further capital investment by either
re-leasing the aircraft to a user outside of the United States or selling the
aircraft as they are without retro-fitting the aircraft to conform to Stage 3
standards. The remaining three aircraft in the Partnership's portfolio already
are Stage 3 compliant. One of these aircraft had a lease term that expired in
January 2000 and is being held in storage pending the outcome of ongoing
remarketing efforts. The final two aircraft in the Partnership's portfolio have
lease terms expiring in April 2001 and January 2003.

 Cash distributions consist of Distributable Cash From Operations and
Distributable Cash From Sales or Refinancings.

 "Distributable Cash From Operations" means the net cash provided by the
Partnership's normal operations after general expenses and current liabilities
of the Partnership are paid, reduced by any reserves for working capital and
contingent liabilities to be funded from such cash, to the extent deemed
reasonable by the General Partner, and increased by any portion of such reserves
deemed by the General Partner not to be required for Partnership operations and
reduced by all accrued and unpaid Equipment Management Fees and, after Payout,
further reduced by all accrued and unpaid Subordinated Remarketing Fees.
Distributable Cash From Operations does not include any Distributable Cash From
Sales or Refinancings.

 "Distributable Cash From Sales or Refinancings" means Cash From Sales or
Refinancings as reduced by (i)(a) amounts realized from any loss or destruction
of equipment which the General Partner determines shall be reinvested in similar
equipment for the remainder of the original lease term of the lost or destroyed
equipment, or in isolated instances, in other equipment, if the General Partner
determines that investment of such proceeds will significantly improve the
diversity of the Partnership's equipment portfolio, and subject in either case
to satisfaction of all existing indebtedness secured by such equipment to the
extent deemed necessary or appropriate by the General Partner, or (b) the
proceeds from the sale of an interest in equipment pursuant to any agreement
governing a joint venture which the General Partner determines will be invested
in additional equipment or interests in equipment and which ultimately are so
reinvested and (ii) any accrued and unpaid Equipment Management Fees and, after
Payout, any accrued and unpaid Subordinated Remarketing Fees.

 "Cash From Sales or Refinancings" means cash received by the Partnership from
sale or refinancing transactions, as reduced by (i)(a) all debts and liabilities
of the Partnership required to be paid as a result of sale or refinancing
transactions, whether or not then due and payable (including any liabilities on
an item of equipment sold which are not assumed by the buyer and any remarketing
fees required to be paid to persons not affiliated with the General Partner, but
not including any Subordinated Remarketing Fees whether or not then due and
payable) and (b) general expenses and current liabilities of the Partnership
(other than any portion of the Equipment Management Fee which is required to be
accrued and the Subordinated Remarketing Fee) and (c) any reserves for working
capital and contingent liabilities funded from such cash to the extent deemed
reasonable by the General Partner and (ii) increased by any portion of such
reserves deemed by the General Partner not to be required for Partnership
operations. In the event the Partnership accepts a note in connection with any
sale or refinancing transaction, all payments subsequently received in cash by
the Partnership with respect to such note shall be included in Cash From Sales
or Refinancings, regardless of the treatment of such payments by the Partnership
for tax or accounting purposes. If the Partnership receives purchase money
obligations in payment for equipment sold, which are secured by liens on such
equipment, the amount of such obligations shall not be included in Cash From
Sales or Refinancings until the obligations are fully satisfied.

 "Payout" is defined as the first time when the aggregate amount of all
distributions to the Limited Partners of Distributable Cash From Operations and
Distributable Cash From Sales or Refinancings equals the aggregate

7

amount of the Limited Partners' original capital contributions plus a cumulative
annual distribution of 11 (compounded quarterly and calculated beginning with
the last day of the month of the Partnership's Closing Date) on their aggregate
unreturned capital contributions. For purposes of this definition, capital
contributions shall be deemed to have been returned only to the extent that
distributions of cash to the Limited Partners exceed the amount required to
satisfy the cumulative annual distribution of 11 (compounded quarterly) on the
Limited Partners' aggregate unreturned capital contributions, such calculation
to be based on the aggregate unreturned capital contributions outstanding on the
first day of each fiscal quarter.

PLAINTIFFS' AND DEFENDANTS' JOINT MEMORANDUM IN
 SUPPORT OF JOINT MOTION TO FURTHER MODIFY ORDER
 PRELIMINARILY APPROVING SETTLEMENT, CONDITIONALLY
 CERTIFYING SETTLEMENT CLASS AND PROVIDING
 FOR NOTICE OF, AND HEARING ON, THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT

 Plaintiffs ("Plaintiffs" or "Class Counsel") and Defendants submit this
Joint Memorandum in support of their Joint Motion To Further Modify Order
Preliminarily Approving Settlement, Conditionally Certifying Settlement Class
and Providing For Notice of, And Hearing On, The Proposed Settlement.

 Background

 By Order dated August 20, 1998, this Court preliminarily approved the
original Stipulation of Settlement dated July 16, 1998, conditionally certified
the Settlement Class, and three sub-classes,(1) and provided for Notice of, and
Hearing on, the proposed Settlement (the "Settlement"). A true and complete copy
of the Court's August 20, 1998 Order (the "Preliminary Approval Order") is
attached to the Motion as Exhibit 1.

 As part of the settlement of the claims brought by the Operating
Partnership Sub-Class, the Settlement provides for Defendants to pursue and
cause the consummation of an exchange transaction (the "Exchange"), pursuant to
which eleven (11) of the limited partnerships named as Nominal Defendants (the
"Operating Partnerships") would be restructured, and converted into a
publicly-traded entity ("Newco") whose securities would be listed and traded on
the NASDAQ National Market System or other national securities exchange.

 On or about August 24, 1998, four days after the Court's entry of the
Preliminary Approval Order, Defendants filed a Consent Solicitation Statement
(Form 14A) to be used in

3

connection with the solicitation of the Operating Partnership Sub-Class' consent
to the Exchange for review with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC"). The parties had anticipated that the SEC would be able to complete the
review within several months, and thereafter the Notice of the Settlement and
fairness hearing would be sent to all Class members, with the Consent
Solicitation Statement included only with the Notice sent to the Operating
Partnership Sub-Class members.

 However, after encountering numerous unanticipated delays in the SEC
review process, the parties entered into an Amended Stipulation of Settlement
dated March 15, 1999 (the "Amended Stipulation"). On March 22, 1999, after a
hearing, this Court entered an order modifying the preliminary approval order
(the "Modified Preliminary Approval Order"). A true and complete copy of the
Modified Preliminary Approval Order is attached the Motion as Exhibit 2.
Pursuant to the Modified Preliminary Approval Order, the settlement process was
bifurcated into two phases. In the first phase, the parties asked the Court to
approve the settlement with respect to the claims brought by the so-called RSL
and Trust Sub-Classes.(2) In the second phase, the parties will seek the Court's
final approval of the settlement with respect to the claims brought by the
Operating Partnership Sub-Class.

 Due to the delays caused by the SEC review process, certain financial
information upon which the settlement was based has become outdated.
Accordingly, the parties have agreed to further modifications to the Amended
Stipulation to reflect updated valuations of

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) The three sub-classes are referred to as: (a) the "RSL Sub-Class"; (b) the
"Operating Partnership Sub-Class'; and (c) the "Trust Sub-Class".

(2) A hearing on the final approval of the settlement with respect to the RSL
and Trust Sub-Classes was held on May 21, 1999. After that hearing, on May 26,
1999, the Court entered an order approving the settlement with respect to the
RSL and Trust Sub-Classes.

4

the Operating Partnerships and Management Assets and revised allocations of
Shares in Newco based on those valuations.

 The Proposed Amendments

 The following is a description of the proposed amendments to the
Settlement that were negotiated on an arm's-length basis by Class Counsel and
the Defendants. The vast majority of the original Stipulation and the Amended
Stipulation have not been altered, and the sub-classes, which were conditionally
certified by the Court in its August 20, 1998 Order, remain the same. The
parties have agreed to the following amendments to the Amended Stipulation:

 (a) amend the 10 million cash distribution schedule (see Chart #1)
 in Section 2.2(a) to reflect the updated cash reserves held by each
 of the Operating Partnerships as of September 30, 1999;

 (b) amend the allocations of Newco Shares in Sections 2.2(c) and
 2.2(d) (see Chart #2 and #3) to reflect updated valuations of the
 Operating Partnerships and Management Assets;

 (c) amend Section 2.2(d) to increase the payment by Equis of Newco
 Shares to the Operating Partnership Sub-Class members from 8
 million to 9 million;

 (d) eliminate Section 2.2(g) which offered so-called "appraisal
 rights" for Participating Investors who did not wish to retain their
 Shares in Newco;

 (e) eliminate Section 2.2(i) which required that twenty-five percent
 (25 of the Shares of Newco allocated to the Equis Owners be placed
 in an escrow account:

 and

5

(f) amend Section 4.1(i) to clarify that the Operating Partnerships
 may invest a total of 32 million in New Investments, to be
 increased only upon the further agreement of the parties, which
 amount corresponds to forty percent (40 of the total aggregate net
 asset values of all the Operating Partnerships as of March 19, 1999.

 1. Amendments Pertaining to Updated Financial Information, Including
 Valuations and Allocations

 The information which is fundamental to the terms of the original
Stipulation and Amended Stipulation has become outdated. Specifically, the data
supporting the valuation of the Operating Partnerships and the Management Assets
was prepared as of September 1998 and now has changed. The Partnerships have
sold various of their equipment assets and, in certain instances, they have
entered into agreements to renew existing leases or otherwise to re-lease their
equipment assets. In addition, information that was used to assess the potential
market value of the common stock of Newco, and the value of the Management
Assets to be contributed by the Defendants, such as price earnings ratios and
other market multiples for companies comparable to Newco and the Management
Assets, has changed due to the passage of time and resulting changes in the
business environment and stock markets. Therefore, the parties believe that it
is in the best interests of the limited partners of the Partnerships to update
the valuation of the transaction using the same methodology employed before and
to revise the Amended Stipulation to simplify and improve upon its terms.

 The Defendants have updated and revised the valuation information as of
September 30, 1999 and based on this latest analysis and negotiations with Class
Counsel, Equis has agreed to reduce its net allocation of Newco Shares for the
Management Assets

6

to 14.72 from the prior 22.335 , representing a reduction of approximately 34 .
Accordingly, the parties have amended Sections 2.2(c) and 2.2(d) of the Amended
Stipulation to reflect the updated valuations of the Operating Partnerships and
Management Assets. Set forth below is a schedule showing the revised valuations
and allocations as of September 30, 1999 in comparison with the September 30,
1998 valuations and allocations (3):

 2. Amendments Pertaining To Increased Payment by Equis of Newco Shares
 from 8 Million to 9 Million and Elimination of Promissory Notes
 and Escrow Account Provisions

 Equis has also agreed to increase the reallocation of Newco Shares it
would have received for the Management Assets to the Partnerships from 8
million to 9 million. By increasing the payment to 9 million, Equis will give
up a much greater percentage of the estimated value of the Management Assets in
favor of the limited partners (44.6 compared to the previous 26.3 ). In
exchange for the substantial benefits to the limited partners caused by the
changes described above, the parties have agreed to eliminate the requirement
that the Defendants defer retention of 25 of the Newco Shares allocated to them
for the Management Assets in escrow pending attainment of future target net
income

- ----------
(3) The allocations above are net of the 10 million cash distribution and
reflect the re-allocation of 9 million of value from Equis' Management Assets
to the Partnerships.

7

levels. Under the prior settlement agreement, the Defendants would have received
16.75 of Newco's common stock in exchange for the Management Assets, assuming
that none of the escrow shares were retained by the Defendants, and 22.335 ,
assuming that all of the escrow shares were retained by the Defendants. Under
the revised settlement agreement, the Defendants will receive a smaller stock
allocation of 14.72 for the Management Assets and the escrow concept will be
eliminated. The elimination of the escrow shares concept will permit management
to focus on Newco's long-term success while having the added benefit of
accelerating finalization of the settlement to a date coincident to the date of
Consolidation.

 In addition, the parties have agreed to eliminate the option for the
limited partners to elect to receive promissory notes instead of common stock in
order to simplify the capital structure of Newco and eliminate any form of
"equity" debt service upon the Consolidation. This revision will cause all
limited partners of the Operating Partnerships (and the general partners) to
have uniform financial interests and will simplify the choices presented to the
limited partners to either (a) object to their Partnership participating in the
Consolidation, or (b) approve of its participation.

 3. Amendments to Clarify Maximum Amount Which May be Reinvested In New
 Investments

 In its Modified Preliminary Approval Order, this Court approved amendments
to the Settlement which permitted the Operating Partnerships, pending the
completion of the SEC review process and ultimately the Exchange, to reinvest a
certain portion of the money (40 of the total aggregate net asset value of the
Partnerships) they have received from the sales of equipment. The parties now
seek to clarify the Amended Stipulation to make clear that the Operating
Partnerships may invest a total of 32 million in New

8

Investments, to be increased only upon the further agreement of the parties,
which amount corresponds to forty percent (40 of the total aggregate net asset
values of all the Operating Partnerships as of March 19, 1999.

 Conclusion

 For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs and Defendants request that this
Court grant the Joint Motion To Further Modify Order Preliminarily Approving
Settlement, Conditionally Certifying Settlement Class and Providing For Notice
of, And Hearing On, The Proposed Settlement.

 Respectfully submitted,
 this 24 day of February 2000,

 SECOND MODIFIED ORDER PRELIMINARILY APPROVING SETTLEMENT,
 CONDITIONALLY CERTIFYING SETTLEMENT CLASS AND PROVIDING
 FOR NOTICE OF, AND HEARING ON, THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT

 WHEREAS, by Order dated August 20, 1998 (the "Preliminary Approval
Order"), this Court issued an order in the above captioned action (the "Action")
preliminarily approving the Settlement, conditionally certifying the settlement
class and providing for notice of, and hearing on the proposed settlement, and
by order dated March 22, 1999, this Court entered an order modifying the
Preliminary Approval Order ("Modified Preliminary Approval Order"), and the
parties to the Action have now agreed to further amend the Stipulation of
Settlement ("Second Amended Stipulation"), this Court having read and considered
the Second Amended Stipulation and the exhibits annexed thereto;

-3-

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT THE COURT FURTHER MODIFIES THE
ORDER INSOFAR AS SET FORTH BELOW:

 1. A hearing (the "Hearing") shall be held before this Court on Thursday,
July 27, 2000, at 701 Clematis Street, West Palm Beach, Florida, 4:00 p.m., in
Courtroom 5, to determine whether the proposed Settlement of the Action on the
terms and conditions provided for in the Second Amended Stipulation, with
respect to the Operating Partnership Sub-Class, including the issuance and
exchange of the securities in the Exchange, is fair, reasonable and adequate and
should be finally approved by the Court; whether a final judgment as provided in
the Second Amended Stipulation should be entered herein with respect to the
claims brought by the Operating Partnership Sub-Class: and whether Class
Counsels application(s) for attorneys' fees, awards to the Class Plaintiffs and
the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses should be granted. The Court may
continue the Hearing without further notice to Class Members.

 2. The Court approves, as to form and content, the Notices of Class Action
Determination, Proposed Settlement and Fairness Hearing (the "Notices"), and
finds that the mailing of the Notices substantially in the manner and form set
forth in paragraph 3 of this Order meets the requirements of Rule 23 of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Constitution of the United States and any
other applicable law, is the best notice practicable

-4-

under the circumstances, and constitutes due and sufficient notice to all
persons entitled thereto.

 3. (a) Within five (5) days following review by the SEC of the Consent
Solicitation Statement (said 5th day being referred to hereafter as the "Notice
Date), the Defendants shall cause a copy of the Notice and the Consent
Solicitation Statement to be mailed to all Operating Partnership Sub-Class
Members at their last known address as appearing in the records maintained by
the Partnerships;

 (b) At or prior to the Hearing, Defendants' counsel shall serve and
file with the Court proof, by affidavit or declaration, of such mailing to the
Operating Partnership Sub-Class; and

 (c) All reasonable costs incurred in identifying and notifying Class
Members shall be paid as set forth in the Second Amended Stipulation. In the
event that the Settlement is not approved by the Court, or otherwise fails to
become effective, Defendants shall not have any recourse against the Plaintiffs,
Class Counsel or the Claims Administrator for such costs and expenses which have
been incurred or advanced pursuant to the Second Amended Stipulation or Second
Modified Court Order.

-5-

4. Class Members may enter an appearance in the Action, at their own
expense, individually or through counsel of their own choice. If they do not
enter an appearance, they will be represented by Class Counsel.

 5. Pending final determination of whether the Settlement should be
approved, neither the Class Plaintiffs nor any Class Member, either directly,
representatively, derivatively, or in any other capacity, shall commence or
prosecute against any of the Defendants or the Released Parties, any action or
proceeding in any court or tribunal asserting any of the Settled Claims.

 6. Pending final determination of whether the Settlement should be
approved, the Class Plaintiffs and all other Class Members are barred and
permanently enjoined from (i) transferring, selling, assigning, giving,
pledging, hypothesizing or otherwise disposing of any Units of the Operating
Partnerships to any person other than a family member or in cases of divorce,
incapacity or death of the Unitholder; (ii) granting a proxy to object to the
Exchange; or (iii) commencing a tender offer for the Units. In addition, pending
final determination of whether the Settlement should be approved, the General
Partners of the Operating Partnerships are enjoined from (i) recording any
transfers made in violation of the Order and (ii) providing the list

-6-

conducting a tender offer.

 7. In addition effective March 19, 1999, the Operating Partnerships may
collectively invest up to forty percent (40 ), to be Increased only upon
agreement of the parties, of the total aggregate net asset values of all

additional equipment and other business activities, that the General Partner and
the Manager reasonably believe to be consistent with the operating objectives
and business interests of Newco after the Exchange (the New Investments"),
subject to the following limitations:

 a. Under no circumstances may the Operating Partnership reduce its cash
 balance to an amount less than the amount required to pay the
 Operating Partnership's share of the 10 Million Cash Distribution
 provided for herein, plus such additional amount as the General
 Partner reasonably believes to be necessary to meet working capital
 and other cash reserve requirements of the Operating Partnership.

 b. To the extent that New Investments are made in additional equipment,
 the Manager will (i) defer, until the earlier of the effective date
 of the Exchange or December 31, 1999, any Acquisition Fees resulting
 therefrom and (ii) limit its Management Fee on all such assets to 2 
 of rental income. In the event the

-7-

Exchange is consummated, all such Acquisition and Management Fees
 related to the New Investments will be paid to Newco.

 c. To the extent that New Investments are not represented by equipment
 (ie: business acquisitions), the Manager will forego any Acquisition
 Fees and Management Fees related to such assets.

 d. Except for permitting New Investments, or as otherwise provided for
 herein, all other provisions of the Partnership Agreements governing
 the investment objectives and policies of the Partnership shall
 remain in full force and effect.

 e. In the event that an Operating Partnership has acquired New
 Investments pursuant to Section 4.1 (i)(a) through (d) of the Second
 Amended Stipulation, and is not a party to the Exchange, Newco shall
 acquire all such New Investments from such Operating Partnership for
 an amount equal to the Operating Partnership's net equity investment

 Amended Stipulation, and the Exchange is not consummated, the
 General Partner(s) shall (i) use its (their) best efforts to divest
 all such New Investments in an orderly and timely fashion, and (ii)
 cancel or return to each Operating Partnership any accumulated or
 deferred fees on such New Investments.

 g. The parties agree the Operating Partnerships may invest a total of
 32 million in New Investments, to be increased only upon the

-8-

parties, which amount corresponds to forty percent (40 of the

as fair, reasonable and adequate, (b) the entrance of a final judgment, and/or
(c) the application(s) for attorneys' fees and expenses; provided, however, that
no Class Member or any other person shall be heard or entitled to contest the

-9-

from making any objection to the fairness or adequacy of the proposed Settlement
as incorporated in the Second Amended Stipulation and the award of attorneys'

time to time at a fixed rate equal to fourteen percent (14.0 per annum through
that date which is twenty-four (24) months from the date hereof and eighteen
percent (18 per annum thereafter. Such interest shall accrue and compound on a
monthly basis but shall not be due and payable until the Maturity Date. In the
absence of demonstrable error, the books and records of the Payee shall
constitute conclusive evidence of the unpaid principal balance hereof from time
to time.

 This Note may be prepaid, in whole or from time to time in part, at any
time, without premium or penalty. All payments shall be applied first to
collection costs, then to accrued interest and any remainder in payment of
principal. The principal amount prepaid, if any, may not at any time be
reborrowed.

 If not sooner paid, all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid
interest thereon shall be due and payable on that date which is thirty (30)
months from the date hereof (the "Maturity Date").

 All payments hereunder shall be payable in lawful money of the United
States which shall be legal tender for public and private debts at the time of
payment. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a year consisting of 360
days and payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day
but excluding the last day), including any time extended by reason of Saturdays,
Sundays and holidays.

 It is expressly agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the
following shall constitute an "Event of Default" hereunder:

 (a) any failure to pay any amount or installment of interest or principal
and interest whereon the same is payable as above expressed;

 (b) any representation or warranty made by the Maker in connection
herewith be untrue when made or not be fulfilled;

(c) failure to observe or perform any other covenant, agreement,
condition, term or provision hereof;

commencement of such a voluntary case; (2) its filing an answer or other
pleading admitting or failing to deny the material allegations of a petition
filed against it commencing an involuntary case under said Title 11, or seeking,
consenting to or acquiescing in the relief therein provided, or by its failing
to controvert timely the material allegations of any such petition; (3) the
entry of an order for relief in any involuntary case commenced under said Title
11; (4) its seeking relief as a debtor under any applicable law, other than said
Title 11, of any jurisdiction relating to the liquidation or reorganization of
debtors or to the modification or alteration of the rights of creditors, or its
consenting to or acquiescing in such relief; (5) the entry of an order by a
court of competent jurisdiction (i) finding it to be bankrupt or insolvent, (ii)
ordering or approving its liquidation, reorganization or any modification or
alteration of the rights of creditors, or (iii) assuming custody of, or
appointing a receiver or other custodian for, all or a substantial part of its
property; or (6) its making an assignment for the benefit of, or entering into a
composition with, its creditors, or appointing or consenting to the appointment

 If any such Event of Default hereunder shall occur, the Payee may declare
to be immediately due and payable the then outstanding principal balance under
this Note, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and all other
amounts payable to the Payee hereunder, whereupon all such amounts shall become
and be due and payable immediately. The failure of the Payee to exercise said
option to accelerate shall not constitute a waiver of the right to exercise the
same at any other time.

 The Maker will pay on demand all costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, incurred or paid by the Payee in enforcing or collecting any of
the obligations of the Maker hereunder. The Maker agrees that all such costs and
expenses and all other expenditures by the Payees on account hereof which are
not reimbursed by the Maker immediately upon demand, and all amounts due under
this Note after maturity and any amounts due hereunder if an Event of Default
shall occur hereunder shall bear interest at a rate equal to the lesser of
eighteen percent (18.0 per annum or the maximum rate permitted by law until
such expenditures are repaid or this Note and such amounts are paid in full to
the Payee.

 Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Maker shall not be
required to pay any amount pursuant hereto which is in excess of the maximum
amount permitted under applicable law. It is the intention of the parties hereto
to conform strictly to any applicable usury law, and it is agreed that if any
amount contracted for, chargeable or receivable under this Note shall exceed the
maximum amount permitted under any such law, any such excess shall be deemed a
mistake and cancelled automatically and, if theretofore paid, shall be refunded
to the Maker or, at the Payee's sole option, shall be applied as set forth
above.

All notices required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be given in
the writing and shall be effective when mailed, postage prepaid, by registered
or certified mail, addressed in the case of the Maker to it at the address of
the Maker set forth above and in the case of the Payee to it at the address of
the Payee set forth above or to such other address as either the Maker or the
Payee may from time to time specify by like notice.

 All of the provisions of this Note shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Maker and the Payee and their respective successors and assigns.
This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

 The Maker and every indorser and guarantor hereof hereby consents to any
extension of time of payment hereof, release of all or any part of the security
for the payment hereof, or release of any party liable for this obligation, and
waives presentment for payment, demand, protest and notice of dishonor. Any such
extension or release may be made without notice to the Maker and without
discharging their liability.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Maker has executed and delivered this Note, under
seal, on the day and year first written above.

Exhibit A, is in full force and effect and has not been amended or modified in
any respect, except for such amendments or modifications as are attached to the
copy thereof delivered herewith; (ii) it is a duly constituted and is the sole
member of Residential pursuant to the Operating Agreement, although such
membership is not evidenced by any certificate issued by Residential; (iii) the
Pledged Interest are validly issued, non-assessable and fully paid membership
interests in Residential; (iv) Pledgor has full right, power and authority to
make this Pledge Agreement (including the provisions enabling the Agent, upon
the occurrence of an Event of Default, to exercise the voting or other rights
provided for herein, under the Operating Agreement and under applicable law,
without the consent, approval or authorization of, or notice to, any other
person, including any regulatory authority or any person having any interest in
Residential, except for such consents as have been duly received; and (v) this
Pledge Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Pledgor and is the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Pledgor enforceable in accordance
with its terms.

 2. Pledgor shall protect and preserve the Pledged Interest. Pledgor will
not permit or agree to any amendment or modification of the Operating Agreement,
or waive any rights or benefits under the Operating Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the Agent. Pledgor hereby represents and warrants that
Pledgor has and will continue to have good and marketable title to the Pledged
Interest, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and security interests,
except those created hereby, and agrees to preserve such unencumbered title and
the Lenders' security interest in the Pledged Interest and to defend it against
all parties. Risk of loss of, damage to, or destruction of, the Pledged Interest
shall be the responsibility of Pledgor, although the Agent shall exercise
reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Pledged Interest in its
possession to the extent applicable. The Agent shall be deemed to have exercised
such reasonable care if it takes such action for that purpose as the Pledgor
shall reasonably request in writing, but no omission to do any act not requested
by the Pledgor shall be deemed a failure to exercise reasonable care, and no
omission to comply with any request of the Pledgor shall of itself be deemed a
failure to exercise reasonable care. The Pledgor shall execute and deliver to
the Agent and the Lenders any financing statements, continuation statements,
assignments, or other instruments, or take any other action deemed necessary by
the Agent or the Lenders to perfect or continue the perfection of its security
interest in the Pledged Interest. The Agent is hereby irrevocably appointed
attorney-in-fact of the Pledgor to do all acts and things which the Agent may
deem necessary or advisable to perfect and continue perfected their security
interest in the Pledged Interest. The address of the Pledgor is listed below the
Pledgor's signature hereto.

 3. This Pledge Agreement has been entered into under and pursuant to the
Massachusetts Uniform Commercial Code, except that perfection and the effect of
perfection of Secured Party's security interest in collateral in another
jurisdiction will be governed by the Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC") of such
other jurisdiction, and the Agent has all the rights

2

and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code or applicable
legislation of the applicable jurisdiction. If any one or more of the provisions
hereof should for any reason be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby, and such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable
provision shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to render it valid
while most nearly preserving its original intent. The Pledgor has (i) caused
Residential to duly register the security interest granted hereby on
Residential's books and has furnished the Agent with evidence thereof in form
and substance satisfactory to the Agent, (ii) has duly executed and caused any
financing statements with respect to the Pledged Interest to be filed in such a
manner and in such places as may be required by applicable law in order to fully
protect the rights of the Agent and the Lenders hereunder and (iii) will cause
any financing statements with respect to the Pledged Interest at all times to be
kept recorded and filed at the Pledgor's sole cost and expense in such a manner
and in such places as may be required by law in order to fully perfect the
interests and protect the rights of the Agent and the Lenders hereunder.

 4. Any one or more of the following events shall constitute an "Event of
Default" hereunder: (i) the Pledgor shall fail to comply with, observe or
perform any obligation hereunder or shall fail to make any payment when due
under any Note; (ii) any representation or warranty made or furnished to the
Agent or the Lenders by or on behalf of the Pledgor in connection with this
Pledge Agreement or any document or instrument furnished, or to be furnished, in
connection herewith or therewith, proves to have been untrue in any material
respect when so made or furnished; (iii) the Pledgor shall commence a voluntary
case under the federal bankruptcy laws (as now or hereafter in effect), file a
petition seeking to take advantage of any other laws relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, winding up or composition for adjustment of debts or
the marshaling of assets ("Bankruptcy Laws"), consent to or fail to contest in a
timely and appropriate manner, any petition filed against the Pledgor in any
involuntary case under any Bankruptcy Laws or other laws, apply for, consent to,
indicate its approval of, acquiesce to or fail to contest in a timely and
appropriate manner, the appointment of, or the taking of possession by, a
receiver, custodian, trustee, or liquidator for the Pledgor or of a substantial
part of the Pledgor's property, admit in writing its inability to pay debts as
they become due, make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, make a
conveyance fraudulent as to creditors under any state or federal law, or take
any action for the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing; (iv) a case or
other proceeding shall be commenced against the Pledgor in any court of
competent jurisdiction seeking relief under any Bankruptcy Laws, (v) the
appointment of a trustee, receiver, custodian, liquidator or the like for the
Pledgor, or of all or any substantial part of its assets; or (vi) the Pledgor
shall fail to perform any of its obligations under the Operating Agreement.

 5. During the continuance of an Event of Default, the Agent shall have, in
addition to the rights, powers and authorizations to collect the sums assigned
hereunder, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform
Commercial Code and under other applicable law with respect to the Pledged
Interest, including, without limitation, the following rights and remedies: (i)
the Agent may, in its sole discretion, exercise any management or voting rights
relating to the Pledged Interest (whether or not the same shall have been
transferred into its name

3

or the name of its nominee or nominees) for any lawful purpose, including for
the amendment or modification of the Operating Agreement or other governing
documents or the liquidation of the assets of Residential, give all consents,
waivers, approvals, and ratifications in respect of such Pledged Interest, and
otherwise act with respect thereto as though it were the outright owner thereof
(the Pledgor hereby irrevocably constituting and appointing the Lenders the
proxy and attorney-in-fact of the Pledgor, with full power and authority of
substitution, to do so); (ii) the Agent may, in its sole discretion, demand, sue
for, collect, compromise, or settle any rights or claims in respect of the
Pledged Interest; (iii) the Agent may, in its sole discretion, sell, resell,
assign, deliver, or otherwise dispose of any or all of the Pledged Interest, for
cash or credit or both and upon such terms, in such manner, at such place or
places, at such time or times, and to such persons or entities as the Agent
think expedient, all without demand for performance by the Pledgor or any notice
or advertisement whatsoever except as expressly provided herein or as may
otherwise be required by applicable law; and (iv) the Agent may, in its sole
discretion, cause all or any part of the Pledged Interest held by it to be
transferred into its name or the name of its nominee or nominees.

 The proceeds of any collection, sale or other disposition of the Pledged
Interest or any part thereof shall, after the Agent has made all deductions of
expenses, including but not limited to attorneys' fees and other expenses
incurred in connection with repossession, collection, sale, or disposition of
the Pledged Interest or in connection with the enforcement of Agent's rights
with respect to the Pledged Interest in any insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization proceedings, be applied against any of the Secured Liabilities,
whether or not all the same shall be then due and payable, in such manner as the
Agent and the Lenders shall in their sole discretion determine.

 No single or partial exercise by the Agent of any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or remedy. Each right, power and remedy herein
specifically granted to the Agent or otherwise available to them shall be
cumulative, and shall be in addition to every other right, power, and remedy
herein specifically given or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity, or
otherwise. Each such right, power and remedy, whether specifically granted
herein or otherwise existing, may be exercised at any time and from time to time
and as often and in such order as may be deemed expedient by the Agent in its
sole discretion. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to
require the Agent to take any action with respect to the Pledged Interest,
whether by way of foreclosure or otherwise and except as required by any
Operating Agreement, in order to permit the Agent to become a substitute member
of Residential under the Operating Agreement.

 6. If any notification of intended sale of any of the Pledged Interest is
required by law, such notification shall be deemed reasonable if mailed at least
ten (10) days before such sale, postage prepaid, (i) addressed to the Pledgor at
its notice address herein, and (ii) to any other secured party from whom the
Agent or the Lenders have received (prior to notification of the Pledgor or the
Pledgor's renunciation of his rights after default) written notice of a claim of
an interest in the Pledged Interest.

4

7. Any delay or omission by the Agent or the Lenders to exercise any
rights or powers arising from any default or any partial exercise thereof shall
not impair any such rights or powers, nor shall the same be construed to be a
waiver thereof or any acquiescence therein, nor shall any action or non-action
by the Agent or the Lenders in the event of any default alter or impair the
rights of the Agent or the Lenders in respect of any subsequent default, or
impair or affect any rights or powers resulting therefrom. This Pledge Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect until such time as all amounts due under
the Notes shall have been fully and irrevocably paid in full.

 8. All notices, statements, requests, and demands given to or made upon
the any party hereto shall be given or made to such party at the address of such
party as set forth below its signature block herein.

 9. The provisions of this Pledge Agreement shall be binding upon the
Pledgor, the Agent and the Lenders, and their respective heirs, personal
representatives, successors and assigns.

 10. The Agent is hereby appointed by the Indemnities as their collateral
agent and each of the Lenders irrevocably authorize the Agent to act as the
collateral agent of such Lender. The Agent shall not have a fiduciary
relationship in respect of any Lender by reason of this Pledge Agreement, and
the nature of Agent's duties shall be mechanical and administrative in nature
only.

 The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers hereunder as are
specifically delegated to or required by at least two-thirds of the Lenders (the
"Required Lenders") by the terms hereof or under any related document, together
with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent shall have no
implied duties to the Lenders or any obligation to the Lenders to take any
action hereunder except any action hereunder specifically provided hereunder or
under any related document to be taken by the Lenders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Agent shall receive a specific written instruction which shall
be inconsistent in any way with the foregoing, or which contradicts or
purportedly supersedes a previous instruction, the Agent agrees to honor and be
bound by such written instruction.

 Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees
shall be liable to the Lenders for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it
or them hereunder except for its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

 The Lenders agree to keep the Agent informed on a prompt and timely basis
of any information required by the Agent to perform its duties hereunder and
under any related documents.

 If the Agent shall request instructions from the Lenders with respect to
any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this Pledge
Agreement or any related documents, the Agent shall be entitled to refrain from
such act or taking such action unless and until the Agent

5

shall have received instructions from the Required Lenders, and the Agent shall
not incur liability to any person by reason of so refraining.

 The Agent may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
and any other experts selected by it. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, neither the Agent nor its directors, officers, agents or employees
shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them in
good faith reliance upon the advice of such persons.

 The Lenders severally (on the basis of the pro rata principal amounts of
each of the Notes) agree to reimburse and indemnify the Agent for and against
any expenses incurred by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders in connection with
the administration and enforcement of this Pledge Agreement and any related
documents and any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature
whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in
performing its duties hereunder or under any related documents or in any way
relating to or arising out of this Pledge Agreement or any related documents;
provided, however that the Lenders shall not be liable for any of the foregoing
to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Agent.

 This Agent may be removed by the Lenders at any time upon delivery of
written notice to the Agent and the Pledgor.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 Year ended December 31, 1999 compared to the year ended
 December 31, 1998 and the year ended December 31, 1998
 compared to the year ended December 31, 1997

 Certain statements in this annual report of American Income Fund I-C, a
Massachusetts Limited Partnership (the "Partnership") that are not historical
fact constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to a variety of risks
and uncertainties. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made
herein. These factors include, but are not limited to, the outcome of the Class
Action Lawsuit described in Note 8 to the accompanying financial statements and
the remarketing of the Partnership's equipment.

Overview

 The Partnership was organized in 1991 as a direct-participation equipment
leasing program to acquire a diversified portfolio of capital equipment subject
to lease agreements with third parties. Presently, the Partnership is a Nominal
Defendant in a Class Action Lawsuit, the outcome of which could significantly
alter the nature of the Partnership's organization and its future business
operations. See Note 8 to the accompanying financial statements. Pursuant to the
Amended and Restated Agreement and Certificate of Limited Partnership (the
"Restated Agreement, as amended"), the Partnership is scheduled to be dissolved
by December 31, 2002.

Year 2000 Issue

 The Partnership uses information systems provided by Equis Financial Group
Limited Partnership ("EFG") and has no information systems of its own. EFG
completed all Year 2000 readiness work prior to December 31, 1999 and did not
experience any significant problems. Additionally, EFG is not aware of any
outside customer or vendor that experienced a Year 2000 issue that would have a
material effect on the Partnership's results of operations, liquidity, or
financial position. However, EFG has no means of ensuring that all customers,
vendors and third-party servicers have conformed to Year 2000 standards. The
effect of this risk to the Partnership is not determinable.

Results of Operations

 For the year ended December 31, 1999, the Partnership recognized lease
revenue of 2,174,523 compared to 2,463,373 and 4,068,381 for the years ended
December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The decrease in lease revenue from
1998 to 1999 reflects the effects of lease term expirations and equipment sales.
The decrease in lease revenue from 1997 to 1998 partially resulted from the
exchange of the Partnership's interest in a vessel during 1997 (see below). In
1997, the Partnership recognized lease revenue of 534,796 related to this
vessel, including 400,631 representing a prepayment of the remaining contracted
rent due under the vessel's lease agreement. Other reductions in lease revenue
form 1997 to 1998 resulted from lease term expirations and the sale of
equipment. In the future, lease revenue will continue to decline due to lease
term expirations and equipment sales.

 The Partnership's equipment portfolio includes certain assets in which the
Partnership holds a proportionate ownership interest. In such cases, the
remaining interests are owned by an affiliated equipment leasing program
sponsored by EFG. Proportionate equipment ownership enabled the Partnership to
further diversify its equipment portfolio at inception by participating in the
ownership of selected assets, thereby reducing the general levels of risk which
could have resulted from a concentration in any single equipment type, industry
or lessee. The Partnership and each affiliate individually report, in proportion
to their respective ownership interests, their respective shares of assets,
liabilities, revenues, and expenses associated with the equipment.

Interest income for the year ended December 31, 1999 was 258,113 compared to
 195,264 and 86,836 for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. Interest income is generated principally from temporary investment
of rental receipts and equipment sale proceeds in short-term instruments.
Interest income included 45,973 in both 1999 and 1998 and 9,067 in 1997 earned
on a note receivable from Semele Group, Inc. ("Semele") (see Note 4 to the
accompanying financial statements). The note receivable from Semele is scheduled
to mature in April 2001. Interest income in 1999 also includes 32,745 related
to the National Steel Corporation settlement (see Note 8 to the accompanying
financial statements). The amount of future interest income is expected to
fluctuate as a result of changing interest rates and the amount of cash
available for investment, among other factors. See discussion below regarding on
investment made by the Partnership in 2000.

 During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Partnership sold equipment
having a net book value of 1,804 to existing lessees and third parties. These
sales resulted in a net gain, for financial statement purposes, of 508,592
compared to a net gain in 1998 of 119,724 on equipment having a net book value
of 15,660 and a net gain in 1997 of 652,413 on equipment having a net book
value of 359,061.

 In 1997, the Partnership also exchanged its interest in a vessel with an
original cost and net book value of 2,605,381 and 1,180,755, respectively (see
below and Note 4 to the accompanying financial statements). In connection with
this exchange, the Partnership realized proceeds of 802,431, which resulted in
a net loss, for financial statement purposes, of 378,324. In addition, as this
vessel was disposed of prior to the expiration of the related lease term, the
Partnership received prepayment of the remaining contracted rent due under the
vessel's lease agreement (see above).

 It cannot be determined whether future sales of equipment will result in a
net gain or a net loss to the Partnership, as such transactions will be
dependent upon the condition and type of equipment being sold and its
marketability at the time of sale. In addition, the amount of gain or loss
reported for financial statement purposes is partly a function of the amount of
accumulated depreciation associated with the equipment being sold.

 The ultimate realization of residual value for any type of equipment is
dependent upon many factors, including EFG's ability to sell and re-lease
equipment. Changing market conditions, industry trends, technological advances,
and many other events can converge to enhance or detract from asset values at
any given time. EFG attempts to monitor these changes in order to identify
opportunities which may be advantageous to the Partnership and which will
maximize total cash returns for each asset.

 The total economic value realized for each asset is comprised of all primary
lease term revenue generated from that asset, together with its residual value.
The latter consists of cash proceeds realized upon the asset's sale in addition
to all other cash receipts obtained from renting the asset on a re-lease,
renewal or month-to-month basis. The Partnership classifies such residual rental
payments as lease revenue. Consequently, the amount of gain or loss reported in
the financial statements is not necessarily indicative of the total residual
value the Partnership achieved from leasing the equipment.

 Depreciation expense was 956,631, 1,083,372 and 2,099,722 for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. For financial reporting
purposes, to the extent that an asset is held on primary lease term, the
Partnership depreciates the difference between (i) the cost of the asset and
(ii) the estimated residual value of the asset at the date of primary lease
expiration on a straight-line basis over such term. For the purposes of this
policy, estimated residual values represent estimates of equipment values at the
date of primary lease expiration. To the extent that equipment is held beyond
its primary lease term, the Partnership continues to depreciate the remaining
net book value of the asset on a straight-line basis over the asset's remaining
economic life.

 Interest expense was 222,725 or 10.2 of lease revenue in 1999, compared to
 318,530 or 12.9 of lease revenue in 1998 and 387,553 or 9.5 of lease revenue
in 1997. Interest expense in future periods will decline as the principal
balance of notes payable is reduced through the application of rent receipts to
outstanding debt.. See additional discussion below regarding the refinancing of
certain of the debt in 2000.

4

Management fees were approximately 4.7 of lease revenue for the year ended
December 31, 1999, compared to 4.6 and 4.1 of lease revenue during the years
ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Management fees are based on 5 
of gross lease revenue generated by operating leases and 2 of gross lease
revenue generated by full payout leases.

 Write-down of investment securities-affiliate was 185,281 for the year ended
December 31, 1998. The General Partner determined that the decline in market
value of its Semele common stock was other-than-temporary. As a result, the
Partnership wrote down the cost of the Semele common stock from 15 per share to
 4.125 per share (the quoted price of Semele stock on NASDAQ at December 31,
1998). See further discussion below.

 Operating expenses were 470,580, 454,908 and 200,670 for the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. During 1999, the Partnership
accrued approximately 160,300 for the completion of a D-Check incurred to
facilitate the remarketing of the Finnair Aircraft having a lease agreement
which expired in January 2000 (see Note 9 to the accompanying financial
statements). Operating expenses in 1999 also include approximately 50,000
accrued for certain legal and Consolidation expenses related to the Class Action
Lawsuit described in Note 8 to the financial statements. During 1998, the
Partnership incurred or accrued approximately 298,000 for such expenses related
to the Class Action Lawsuit. Other operating expenses consist principally of
professional service costs, such as audit and other legal fees, as well as
printing, distribution and remarketing expenses. In certain cases, equipment
storage or repairs and maintenance costs may be incurred in connection with
equipment being remarketed.

Liquidity and Capital Resources and Discussion of Cash Flows

 In connection with a preliminary settlement agreement for the Class Action
Lawsuit described in Note 8 to the accompanying financial statements, the
Partnership is permitted to invest in new equipment or other business
activities, subject to certain limitations. On March 8, 2000, the Partnership
invested 2,780,000 in a debt instrument that matures in September 2002. (See
Notes 8 and 9 to the accompanying financial statements for additional
information concerning this transaction.)

 The Partnership by its nature is a limited life entity. As an equipment
leasing program, the Partnership's principal operating activities derive from
asset rental transactions. Accordingly, the Partnership's principal source of
cash from operations is provided by the collection of periodic rents. These cash
inflows are used to satisfy debt service obligations associated with leveraged
leases, and to pay management fees and operating costs. Operating activities
generated net cash inflows of 1,946,817, 2,165,077 and 3,241,188 for the
years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 respectively. Net cash from
operating activities in 1997 included lease termination rents as described
above. Future renewal, re-lease and equipment sale activities will cause a
decline in the Partnership's lease revenues and corresponding sources of
operating cash. Overall, expenses associated with rental activities, such as
management fees, and net cash flow from operating activities will also continue
to decline as the Partnership experiences a higher frequency of remarketing
events.

 Cash realized from asset disposal transactions is reported under investing
activities on the accompanying Statement of Cash Flows. During 1999, the
Partnership realized net proceeds of 510,396, compared to 135,384 and
 1,041,030 in 1998 and 1997, respectively. Future inflows of cash from asset
disposals will vary in timing and amount and will be influenced by many factors
including, but not limited to, the frequency and timing of lease expirations,
the type of equipment being sold, its condition and age, and future market
conditions.

 At December 31, 1999, the Partnership was due aggregate future minimum lease
payments of 2,905,250 from contractual lease agreements (see Note 2 to the
financial statements), a portion of which will be used to amortize the principal
balance of notes payable of 2,363,628 (see Note 6 to the financial statements).
At the expiration of the individual primary and renewal lease terms underlying
the Partnership's future minimum lease payments, the Partnership will sell the
equipment or enter re-lease or renewal agreements when considered advantageous
by the General Partner and EFG. Such future remarketing activities will result
in the realization of additional cash inflows in the form of equipment sale
proceeds or rents from renewals and re-leases, the timing and extent of which
cannot be predicted with certainty. This is because the timing and extent of
remarketing

5

events often is dependent upon the needs and interests of the existing lessees.
Some lessees may choose to renew their lease contracts, while others may elect
to return the equipment. In the latter instances, the equipment could be
re-leased to another lessee or sold to a third party.

 In December 1998, the Partnership and certain affiliated investment programs
owning interests in two McDonnell Douglas MD-82 aircraft (collectively, the
"Programs") entered into lease extension agreements with Finnair OY. The lease
extensions, effective upon the expiration of the existing primary lease terms on
April 28, 1999, extended the leases for nine months and two years, respectively.
In aggregate, these lease extensions will provide additional lease revenue of
approximately 700,000 to the Partnership over the terms of the leases.

 The Partnership obtained long-term financing in connection with certain
equipment leases. The repayments of principal related to such indebtedness are
reported as a component of financing activities. Each note payable is recourse
only to the specific equipment financed and to the minimum rental payments
contracted to be received during the debt amortization period (which period
generally coincides with the lease rental term). As rental payments are
collected, a portion or all of the rental payment is used to repay the
associated indebtedness. In future years, the amount of cash used to repay debt
obligations is scheduled to decline as the principal balance of notes payable is
reduced through the collection and application of rents. However, the
Partnership has balloon payment obligations at the expiration of the lease terms
related to aircraft leased by Reno Air, Inc. of 679,276 and Finnair OY (see
below). On April 29, 1999, the Programs entered into agreements with a
third-party lender to extend the maturity dates of the Programs' indebtedness
related to the Finnair Aircraft. Consistent with the extension terms of the
lease agreements related to the Finnair Aircraft discussed above, the maturity
dates of the indebtedness were extended to January 2000 and April 2001,
respectively. The Partnership has balloon payment obligations of 399,502 and
 106,516 related to this indebtedness that is due on the respective maturity
dates. In February 2000, the Programs refinanced the indebtedness maturing in
January 2000 (see Note 9 to the accompanying financial statements). The Reno Air
indebtedness matures in January 2003.

 As a result of the vessel exchange in 1997 (see Results of Operations), the
Partnership became the beneficial owner of 208,764 shares of Semele common stock
(valued at 313,146 1.50 per share) at the time of the exchange transaction).
This investment was reduced by a dividend of 41,752 received in 1997
representing a return of equity to the Partnership. The Partnership also
received a beneficial interest in the Semele Note of 459,729 in connection with
the exchange. The Semele Note bears an annual interest rate of 10 and is
scheduled to mature in April 2001. The note also requires mandatory principal
reductions, if and to the extent that net proceeds are received by Semele from
the sale or refinancing of its Rancho Malibu property (see Note 4 to the
financial statements).

 On June 30, 1998, Semele effected a 1-for-300 reverse stock split followed by
a 30-for-1 forward stock split resulting in a reduction of the number of shares
of Semele common stock owned by the Partnership to 20,876 shares. During the
year ended December 31, 1998, the Partnership decreased the carrying value of
its investment in Semele common stock to 4.125 per share (the quoted price of
the Semele stock on NASDAQ at December 31, 1998) resulting in an unrealized loss
in 1998 of 70,460. In 1997, the Partnership recorded an unrealized loss of
 114,821 related to its Semele common stock. These losses were reported as
components of comprehensive income, included in partners' capital. At December
31, 1998, the General Partner determined that the decline in market value of the
Semele common stock was other-than-temporary. As a result, the Partnership wrote
down the cost of the Semele common stock to 4.125 per share for a total
realized loss of 185,281 in 1998. During the year ended December 31, 1999, the
Partnership increased the carrying value of its investment in Semele common
stock to 5.75 per share (the quoted price of the Semele stock on NASDAQ
SmallCap market at December 31, 1999), resulting in an unrealized gain of
 33,924. This gain was reported as a component of comprehensive income, included
in partners' capital.

 There are no formal restrictions under the Restated Agreement, as amended,
that materially limit the Partnership's ability to pay cash distributions,
except that the General Partner may suspend or limit cash distributions to
ensure that the Partnership maintains sufficient working capital reserves to
cover, among other things, operating costs and potential expenditures, such as
refurbishment costs to remarket equipment upon lease expiration. Liquidity is
especially important as the Partnership matures and sells equipment, because the
remaining equipment base consists of fewer revenue-producing assets that are
available to cover prospective

6

cash disbursements. Insufficient liquidity could inhibit the Partnership's
ability to sustain its operations or maximize the realization of proceeds from
remarketing its remaining assets.

 In particular, the Partnership must contemplate the potential liquidity risks
associated with its investment in commercial jet aircraft. The management and
remarketing of aircraft can involve, among other things, significant costs and
lengthy remarketing initiatives. Although the Partnership's lessees are required
to maintain the aircraft during the period of lease contract, repair,
maintenance, and/or refurbishment costs at lease expiration can be substantial.
For example, an aircraft that is returned to the Partnership meeting minimum
airworthiness standards, such as flight hours or engine cycles, nonetheless may
require heavy maintenance in order to bring its engines, airframe and other
hardware up to standards that will permit its prospective use in commercial air
transportation. At December 31, 1999, the Partnership had ownership interests in
six commercial jet aircraft. Three of the aircraft are Boeing 737 aircraft
formerly leased to Southwest Airlines, Inc. The lease agreements for each of
these aircraft expired on December 31, 1999 and Southwest elected to return the
aircraft. The aircraft are Stage 2 aircraft, meaning that they are prohibited
from operating in the United States after December 31, 1999 unless they are
retro-fitted with hush-kits to meet Stage 3 noise regulations promulgated by the
Federal Aviation Administration. The cost to hush-kit an aircraft, such as the
Partnership's Boeing 737s, can approach 2 million. At this time, the General
Partner is attempting to remarket these assets without further capital
investment by either re-leasing the aircraft to a user outside of the United
States or selling the aircraft as they are without retro-fitting the aircraft to
conform to Stage 3 standards. The remaining three aircraft in the Partnership's
portfolio already are Stage 3 compliant. One of these aircraft had a lease term
that expired in January 2000 and is being held in storage pending the outcome of
ongoing remarketing efforts. The final two aircraft in the Partnership's
portfolio have lease terms expiring in April 2001 and January 2003.

 Cash distributions to the General and Limited Partners have been declared and
generally paid within fifteen days following the end of each calendar quarter.
The payment of such distributions is presented as a component of financing
activities. For the year ended December 31, 1999, the Partnership declared total
cash distributions of Distributable Cash From Operations and Distributable Cash
From Sales and Refinancings of 634,306. In accordance with the Restated
Agreement, as amended, the Limited Partners were allocated 95 of these
distributions, or 602,590, and the General Partner was allocated 5 , or
 31,716. The fourth quarter 1999 cash distribution was paid on January 14, 2000.

 Cash distributions paid to the Limited Partners consist of both a return of
and a return on capital. Cash distributions do not represent and are not
indicative of yield on investment. Actual yield on investment cannot be
determined with any certainty until conclusion of the Partnership and will be
dependent upon the collection of all future contracted rents, the generation of
renewal and/or re-lease rents, and the residual value realized for each asset at
its disposal date.

 The Partnership's capital account balances for federal income tax and for
financial reporting purposes are different primarily due to differing treatments
of income and expense items for income tax purposes in comparison to financial
reporting purposes (generally referred to as permanent or timing differences;
see Note 7 to the financial statements). For instance, selling commissions and
organization and offering costs pertaining to syndication of the Partnership's
limited partnership units are not deductible for federal income tax purposes,
but are recorded as a reduction of partners' capital for financial reporting
purposes. Therefore, such differences are permanent differences between capital
accounts for financial reporting and federal income tax purposes. Other
differences between the bases of capital accounts for federal income tax and
financial reporting purposes occur due to timing differences. Such items consist
of the cumulative difference between income or loss for tax purposes and
financial statement income or loss, the difference between distributions
(declared vs. paid) for income tax and financial reporting purposes, and the
treatment of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities for book and
tax purposes. The principal component of the cumulative difference between
financial statement income or loss and tax income or loss results from different
depreciation policies for book and tax purposes.

 For financial reporting purposes, the General Partner has accumulated a
capital deficit at December 31, 1999. This is the result of aggregate cash
distributions to the General Partner being in excess of its capital contribution
of 1,000 and its allocation of financial statement net income or loss.
Ultimately, the existence of a capital deficit for

7

the General Partner for financial reporting purposes is not indicative of any
further capital obligations to the Partnership by the General Partner. The
Restated Agreement, as amended, requires that upon the dissolution of the
Partnership, the General Partner will be required to contribute to the
Partnership an amount equal to any negative balance which may exist in the
General Partner's tax capital account. At December 31, 1999, the General Partner
had a positive tax capital account balance.

 The outcome of the Class Action Lawsuit described in Note 8 to the
accompanying financial statements will be the principal factor in determining
the future of the Partnership's operations. The proposed settlement to that
lawsuit, if effected, will materially change the future organizational structure
and business interests of the Partnership, as well as its cash distribution
policies. In addition, commencing with the first quarter of 2000, the General
Partner believes that it will be in the Partnership's best interests to suspend
the payment of quarterly cash distributions pending final resolution of the
Class Action Lawsuit. Accordingly, future cash distributions are not expected to
be paid until the Class Action Lawsuit is adjudicated.

AMERICAN INCOME FUND I-C,
 a Massachusetts Limited Partnership
 Notes to the Financial Statements

 December 31, 1999

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND PARTNERSHIP MATTERS

 American Income Fund I-C, a Massachusetts Limited Partnership (the
"Partnership") was organized as a limited partnership under the Massachusetts
Uniform Limited Partnership Act (the "Uniform Act") on March 1, 1991, for the
purpose of acquiring and leasing to third parties a diversified portfolio of
capital equipment. Partners' capital initially consisted of contributions of
 1,000 from the General Partner (AFG Leasing VI Incorporated) and 100 from the
Initial Limited Partner (AFG Assignor Corporation). On May 31, 1991, the
Partnership issued 803,454.56 units of limited partnership interests (the
"Units") to 909 investors. Included in the 803,454.56 units were 7,293.56 bonus
units. The Partnership's General Partner, AFG Leasing VI Incorporated, is a
Massachusetts corporation formed in 1990 and an affiliate of Equis Financial
Group Limited Partnership (formerly known as American Finance Group), a
Massachusetts limited partnership ("EFG"). The General Partner is not required
to make any other capital contributions except as may be required under the
Uniform Act and Section 6.1(b) of the Amended and Restated Agreement and
Certificate of Limited Partnership (the "Restated Agreement, as amended").

 Significant operations commenced on May 31, 1991 when the Partnership made
its initial equipment acquisition. Pursuant to the Restated Agreement, as
amended, Distributable Cash From Operations and Distributable Cash From Sales or
Refinancings will be allocated 95 to the Limited Partners and 5 to the General
Partner.

 Under the terms of a Management Agreement between the Partnership and EFG,
management services are provided by EFG to the Partnership at fees, which the
General Partner believes to be competitive, for similar services (see Note 5).

 EFG is a Massachusetts limited partnership formerly known as American Finance
Group ("AFG"). AFG was established in 1988 as a Massachusetts general
partnership and succeeded American Finance Group, Inc., a Massachusetts
corporation organized in 1980. EFG and its subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Company") are engaged in various aspects of the equipment leasing business,
including EFG's role as Manager or Advisor to the Partnership and several other
direct-participation equipment leasing programs sponsored or co-sponsored by EFG
(the "Other Investment Programs"). The Company arranges to broker or originate
equipment leases, acts as remarketing agent and asset manager, and provides
leasing support services, such as billing, collecting, and asset tracking.

 The general partner of EFG, with a 1 controlling interest, is Equis
Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation owned and controlled entirely by Gary
D. Engle, its President, Chief Executive Officer and sole Director. Equis
Corporation also owns a controlling 1 general partner interest in EFG's 99 
limited partner, GDE Acquisition Limited Partnership ("GDE LP"). Equis
Corporation and GDE LP were established in December 1994 by Mr. Engle for the
sole purpose of acquiring the business of AFG.

 In January 1996, the Company sold certain assets of AFG relating primarily to
the business of originating new leases, and the name "American Finance Group,"
and its acronym to a third party. AFG changed its name to Equis Financial Group
Limited Partnership after the sale was concluded. Pursuant to terms of the sale
agreements, EFG specifically reserved the rights to continue using the name
American Finance Group and its acronym in connection with the Partnership and
the Other Investment Programs and to continue managing all assets owned by the
Partnership and the Other Investment Programs.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Statement of Cash Flows

 The Partnership considers liquid investment instruments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. From time to time, the
Partnership invests excess cash with large institutional banks in federal agency
discount notes and repurchase agreements with overnight maturities. Under the
terms of the agreements, title to the underlying securities passes to the
Partnership. The securities underlying the agreements are book entry securities.
At December 31, 1999, the Partnership had 3,857,241 invested in federal agency
discount notes, repurchase agreements secured by U.S. Treasury Bills or
interests in U.S. Government securities, or other highly liquid overnight
investments.

Revenue Recognition

 Rents are payable to the Partnership monthly, quarterly or semi-annually and
no significant amounts are calculated on factors other than the passage of time.
The leases are accounted for as operating leases and are noncancellable. Rents
received prior to their due dates are deferred. In certain instances, the
Partnership may enter renewal or re-lease agreements which expire beyond the
Partnership's anticipated dissolution date. This circumstance is not expected to
prevent the orderly wind-up of the Partnership's business activities as the
General Partner and EFG would seek to sell the then-remaining equipment assets
either to the lessee or to a third party, taking into consideration the amount
of future noncancellable rental payments associated with the attendant lease
agreements. See also Note 8 regarding the Class Action Lawsuit. Future minimum
rents of 2,905,250 are due as follows:

 For the year ending December 31, 2000 1,065,343
 2001 835,037
 2002 760,542
 2003 244,328

Use of Estimates

 The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Equipment on Lease

 All equipment was acquired from EFG, one of its Affiliates or from
third-party sellers. Equipment Cost means the actual cost paid by the
Partnership to acquire the equipment, including acquisition fees. Where
equipment was acquired from EFG or an Affiliate, Equipment Cost reflects the
actual price paid for the equipment by EFG or the Affiliate plus all actual
costs incurred by EFG or the Affiliate while carrying the equipment, including
all liens and encumbrances, less the amount of all primary term rents earned by
EFG or the Affiliate prior to selling the equipment. Where the seller of the
equipment was a third party, Equipment Cost reflects the seller's invoice price.

Depreciation

 The Partnership's depreciation policy is intended to allocate the cost of
equipment over the period during which it produces economic benefit. The
principal period of economic benefit is considered to correspond to each asset's
primary lease term, which term generally represents the period of greatest
revenue potential for each asset. Accordingly, to the extent that an asset is
held on primary lease term, the Partnership depreciates the difference between
(i) the cost of the asset and (ii) the estimated residual value of the asset on
a straight-line basis over such term. For purposes of this policy, estimated
residual values represent estimates of equipment values at the date of primary
lease expiration. To the extent that an asset is held beyond its primary lease
term, the Partnership continues to depreciate the remaining net book value of
the asset on a straight-line basis over the asset's remaining economic life.
Periodically, the General Partner evaluates the net carrying value of equipment
to determine whether it exceeds estimated net realizable value. Adjustments to
reduce the net carrying value of equipment are recorded in those instances where
estimated net realizable value is considered to be less than net carrying value.

 The ultimate realization of residual value for any type of equipment is
dependent upon many factors, including EFG's ability to sell and re-lease
equipment. Changing market conditions, industry trends, technological advances,
and many other events can converge to enhance or detract from asset values at
any given time.

Investment Securities - Affiliate

 The Partnership's investment in Semele Group, Inc. is considered to be
available-for-sale and as such is carried at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses reported as a component of comprehensive income (loss) included in
Partner's Capital. Other-than-temporary declines in market value are recorded as
write-down of investment in the Statement of Operations (see Note 4). Unrealized
gains or losses on the Partnership's available-for-sale securities, are required
to be included in comprehensive income. During the year ended December 31, 1999,
total comprehensive income amounted to 1,224,176.

Accrued Liabilities - Affiliate

 Unpaid operating expenses paid by EFG on behalf of the Partnership and
accrued but unpaid administrative charges and management fees are reported as
Accrued Liabilities - Affiliate (see Note 5).

 (Continued)

Contingencies

 It is the Partnership's policy to recognize a liability for goods and
services during the period when the goods or services are received. To the
extent that the Partnership has a contingent liability, meaning generally a
liability the payment of which is subject to the outcome of a future event, the
Partnership recognizes a liability in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 5 "Accounting for Contingencies" ("SFAS No. 5"). SFAS
No. 5 requires the recognition of contingent liabilities when the amount of
liability can be reasonably estimated and the liability is likely to be
incurred.

 The Partnership is a Nominal Defendant in a Class Action Lawsuit. In 1998, a
settlement proposal to resolve that litigation was negotiated and remains
pending (see Note 8). The Partnership's estimated exposure for costs anticipated
to be incurred in pursuing the settlement proposal is approximately 348,000
consisting principally of legal fees and other professional service costs. These
costs are expected to be incurred regardless of whether the proposed settlement
ultimately is effected and, therefore, the Partnership accrued and expensed
approximately 298,000 of these costs in 1998 following the Court's approval of
the settlement plan. The cost estimate is subject to change and is monitored by
the General Partner based upon the progress of the settlement proposal and other
pertinent information. As a result, the Partnership accrued and expensed an
additional 50,000 for such costs during 1999.

Allocation of Profits and Losses

 For financial statement purposes, net income or loss is allocated to each
Partner according to their respective ownership percentages (95 to the Limited
Partners and 5 to the General Partner). See Note 7 for allocation of income or
loss for income tax purposes.

Net Income and Cash Distributions Per Unit

 Net income and cash distributions per Unit are based on 803,454.56 Units
outstanding during each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999
and computed after allocation of the General Partner's 5 share of net income
and cash distributions.

Provision for Income Taxes

 No provision or benefit from income taxes is included in the accompanying
financial statements. The Partners are responsible for reporting their
proportionate shares of the Partnership's taxable income or loss and other tax
attributes on their tax returns.

NOTE 3 - EQUIPMENT

 The following is a summary of equipment owned by the Partnership at December
31, 1999. Remaining Lease Term (Months), as used below, represents the number of
months remaining from December 31, 1999 under contracted lease terms and is
presented as a range when more than one lease agreement is contained in the
stated equipment category. A Remaining Lease Term equal to zero reflects
equipment either held for sale or re-lease or being leased on a month-to-month
basis. In the opinion EFG, the acquisition cost of the equipment did not exceed
its fair market value.

In certain cases, the cost of the Partnership's equipment represents a
proportionate ownership interest. The remaining interests are owned by EFG or an
affiliated equipment leasing program sponsored by EFG. The Partnership and each
affiliate individually report, in proportion to their respective ownership
interests, their respective shares of assets, liabilities, revenues, and
expenses associated with the equipment. Proportionate equipment ownership
enabled the Partnership to further diversify its equipment portfolio at
inception by participating in the ownership of selected assets, thereby reducing
the general levels of risk which could have resulted from a concentration in any
single equipment type, industry or lessee. At December 31, 1999, the
Partnership's equipment portfolio included equipment having a proportionate
original cost of 10,810,044, representing approximately 78 of total equipment
cost.

 Certain of the equipment and related lease payment streams were used to
secure term loans with third-party lenders. The preceding summary of equipment
includes leveraged equipment having an original cost of approximately 6,218,000
and a net book value of approximately 4,811,000 at December 31, 1999 (see Note
6).

 Generally, the costs associated with maintaining, insuring and operating the
Partnership's equipment are incurred by the respective lessees pursuant to terms
specified in their individual lease agreements with the Partnership.

 As equipment is sold to third parties, or otherwise disposed of, the
Partnership recognizes a gain or loss equal to the difference between the net
book value of the equipment at the time of sale or disposition and the proceeds
realized upon sale or disposition. The ultimate realization of estimated
residual value in the equipment is dependent upon, among other things, EFG's
ability to maximize proceeds from selling or re-leasing the equipment upon the
expiration of the primary lease terms. The summary above includes equipment held
for re-lease or sale with an original cost of approximately 2,127,000 and a net
book value of approximately 746,000 at December 31, 1999. This equipment
includes the Partnership's interests in three Boeing 737 aircraft formerly
leased to Southwest Airlines. Each of these aircraft had an original cost of
approximately 700,350 and a net book value of approximately 248,500 at
December 31, 1999. The General Partner is actively seeking the sale or re-lease
of all equipment not on lease.

NOTE 4 - INVESTMENT SECURITIES - AFFILIATE / NOTE RECEIVABLE - AFFILIATE

 On April 30, 1997, the vessel partnerships, in which the Partnership and
certain affiliated investment programs are limited partners and through which
the Partnership and the affiliated investment programs shared economic interests
in three cargo vessels (the "Vessels") leased by Gearbulk Shipowning Ltd.
(formerly Kristian Gerhard Jebsen Skipsrederi A/S) (the "Lessee"), exchanged
their ownership interests in the Vessels for aggregate consideration of
 11,565,375, consisting of 1,987,000 newly issued shares (at 1.50 per share) of
common stock in Semele Group, Inc. ("Semele") (formerly Banyan Strategic Land
Fund II), a purchase money note of 8,219,500 (the "Note") and cash of 365,375.
Semele is a Delaware corporation organized on April 14, 1987 and has its common
stock listed on NASDAQ Small Cap Market effective January 5, 1999 (previously
NASDAQ). At the date of the exchange transaction, the common stock of Semele had
a net book value of approximately 1.50 per share and closing market value of
 1.00 per share. Semele has one principal real estate asset consisting of an
undeveloped 274 acre parcel of land near Malibu, California ("Rancho Malibu").

 The exchange was organized through an intermediary company (Equis Exchange
LLC, 99 owned by Semele and 1 owned by EFG), which was established for the
sole purpose of facilitating the exchange. There were no fees paid to EFG by
Equis Exchange LLC or Semele or by any other party that otherwise would not have
been paid to EFG had the Partnership sold its beneficial interest in the Vessels
directly to the Lessee. The Lessee prepaid all of its remaining contracted
rental obligations and purchased the Vessels in two closings occurring on May 6,
1997 and May 12, 1997. The Note was repaid with 3,800,000 of cash and delivery
of a 4,419,500 note from Semele (the "Semele Note").

 As a result of the exchange transaction and its original 33.85 beneficial
ownership interest in Dove Arrow, one of the three Vessels, the Partnership
received 430,187 in cash and became the beneficial owner of 208,764 shares of
Semele common stock (valued at 313,146 1.50 per share) at the time of the
exchange transaction) and received a beneficial interest in the Semele Note of
 459,729. The Semele Note bears an annual interest rate of 10 and is scheduled
to mature in April 2001. The note requires mandatory principal reductions, if
and to the extent that net proceeds are received by Semele from the sale or
refinancing of Rancho Malibu. The Partnership recognized interest income of
 45,973 in both 1999 and 1998 and 9,067 in 1997 related to the Semele Note. The
Partnership's interest in the vessel had an original cost and net book value of
 2,605,381 and 1,180,755, respectively. The proceeds realized by the
Partnership of 802,431 resulted in a net loss, for financial statement
purposes, of 378,324. In addition, as this vessel was disposed of prior to the
expiration of the related lease term, the Partnership received a prepayment of
the remaining contracted rent due under the vessel's lease agreement of
 400,631.

 Cash equal to the amount of the Semele Note was held in escrow for the
benefit of Semele in a segregated account pending the outcome of certain
shareholder proposals. Specifically, as part of the exchange, Semele sought
consent ("Consent") from its shareholders to: (1) amend its certificate of
incorporation and by-laws; (2) make additional amendments to restrict the
acquisition of its common stock in a way to protect Semele's net operating loss
carry-forwards, and (3) engage EFG to provide administrative services to Semele,
which services EFG will provide at cost. On October 21, 1997, such Consent was
obtained from Semele's shareholders. The Consent also allowed for (i) the
election of a new Board of Directors nominated by EFG for terms of up to three
years and an increase in size of the Board to as many as nine members, provided
a majority of the Board shall consist of members independent of Semele, EFG or
any affiliate; and (ii) an amendment extending Semele's life to perpetual and
changing its name from Banyan Strategic Land Fund II. Contemporaneously with the
Consent being obtained, Semele declared a 0.20 per share dividend to be paid on
all shares, including those beneficially owned by the Partnership. A dividend of
 41,752 was paid to the Partnership on November 17, 1997. This dividend
represented a return of equity to the Partnership, which proportionately reduced
the Partnership's investment in Semele. Subsequent to the exchange transaction,
Gary D. Engle, President and Chief Executive

AMERICAN INCOME FUND I-C,

 (Continued)

Officer of EFG, was elected to the Board of Directors and appointed Chief
Executive Officer of Semele and James A. Coyne, Executive Vice President of EFG
was appointed Semele's President and Chief Operating Officer, and was elected to
the Board of Directors.

 On June 30, 1998, Semele effected a 1-for-300 reverse stock split followed by
a 30-for-1 forward stock split resulting in a reduction of the number of shares
of Semele common stock owned by the Partnership to 20,876 shares. In accordance
with the Financial Accounting Standard Board's Statement No. 115, Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, marketable equity securities
classified as available-for-sale are required to be carried at fair value.
During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Partnership decreased the carrying
value of its investment in Semele common stock to 4.125 per share (the quoted
price of the Semele stock on NASDAQ at December 31, 1998) resulting in an
unrealized loss in 1998 of 70,460. In 1997, the Partnership recorded an
unrealized loss of 114,821 related to its Semele common stock. These losses
were reported as components of comprehensive income, included in partners'
capital. At December 31, 1998, the General Partner determined that the decline
in market value of the Semele common stock was other-than-temporary. As a
result, the Partnership wrote down the cost of the Semele common stock to 4.125
per share for a total realized loss of 185,281 in 1998. During the year ended
December 31, 1999, the Partnership increased the carrying value of its
investment in Semele common stock to 5.75 per share (the quoted price of the
Semele stock on NASDAQ SmallCap market at December 31, 1999), resulting in an
unrealized gain of 33,924. This gain was reported as a component of
comprehensive income, included in partners' capital.

NOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 All operating expenses incurred by the Partnership are paid by EFG on behalf

 All equipment was purchased from EFG, one of its Affiliates or from
third-party sellers. The Partnership's Purchase Price is determined by the
method described in Note 2, Equipment on Lease.

 All rents and proceeds from the sale of equipment are paid directly to either
EFG or to a lender. EFG temporarily deposits collected funds in a separate
interest-bearing escrow account prior to remittance to the Partnership. At
December 31, 1999, the Partnership was owed 133,950 by EFG for such funds and
the interest thereon. These funds were remitted to the Partnership in January
2000.

are owned by Semele. Gary D. Engle is Chairman and CEO of Semele.

NOTE 6 - NOTES PAYABLE

 Notes payable at December 31, 1999 consisted of installment notes of
 2,363,628 payable to banks and institutional lenders. The installment notes
bear interest rates ranging between 8.09 and 8.65 , except one note which bears
a fluctuating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a margin (6.4625 at December
31, 1999). All of the installment notes are non-recourse and are collateralized
by the equipment and assignment of the related lease payments. Generally, the
installment notes will be fully amortized by noncancellable rents. However, the
Partnership has balloon payment obligations at the expiration of the lease terms
related to aircraft leased by Reno Air, Inc. 679,276) and Finnair OY 399,502
and 106,516). The Finnair OY indebtedness matures in January 2000 and April
2001, respectively. The Reno Air indebtedness matures in January 2003. (See Note
9 regarding the refinancing of the January 2000 balloon payment in February
2000). The carrying amount of notes payable approximates fair value at December
31, 1999.

 The annual maturities of the installment notes payable are as follows:

 For the year ending December 31, 2000 908,630

NOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES

 The Partnership is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes.
Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been recorded in the accounts of
the Partnership.

 For financial statement purposes, the Partnership allocates net income or
loss to each class of partner according to their respective ownership
percentages (95 to the Limited Partners and 5 to the General Partner). This
convention differs from the income or loss allocation requirements for income
tax and Dissolution Event purposes as delineated in the Restated Agreement, as
amended. For income tax purposes, the Partnership allocates net income or net
loss in accordance with the provisions of such agreement. The Restated
Agreement, as amended, requires that upon dissolution of the Partnership, the
General Partner will be required to contribute to the Partnership an amount
equal to any negative balance which may exist in the General Partner's tax
capital account. At December 31, 1999, the General Partner had a positive tax
capital account balance.

 The following is a reconciliation between net income reported for financial
statement and federal income tax reporting purposes for the years ended December

NOTE 8 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 In January 1998, certain plaintiffs (the "Plaintiffs") filed a class and
derivative action, captioned Leonard Rosenblum, et al. v. Equis Financial Group
Limited Partnership, et al., in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Florida (the "Court") on behalf of a proposed class of
investors in 28 equipment leasing programs sponsored by EFG, including the
Partnership (collectively, the "Nominal Defendants"), against EFG and a number
of its affiliates, including the General Partner, as defendants (collectively,
the "Defendants"). Certain of the Plaintiffs, on or about June 24, 1997, had
filed an earlier derivative action, captioned Leonard Rosenblum, et al. v. Equis
Financial Group Limited Partnership, et al., in the Superior Court of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts on behalf of the Nominal Defendants against the
Defendants. Both actions are referred to herein collectively as the "Class
Action Lawsuit".

 The Plaintiffs have asserted, among other things, claims against the
Defendants on behalf of the Nominal Defendants for violations of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, common law fraud, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
duty, and violations of the partnership or trust agreements that govern each of
the Nominal Defendants. The Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, that
any of them have committed or threatened to commit any violations of law or
breached any fiduciary duties to the Plaintiffs or the Nominal Defendants.

 On July 16, 1998, counsel for the Defendants and the Plaintiffs executed a
Stipulation of Settlement setting forth terms pursuant to which a settlement of
the Class Action Lawsuit is intended to be achieved and which, among other
things, is expected to reduce the burdens and expenses attendant to continuing
litigation. The Stipulation of Settlement was preliminarily approved by the
Court on August 20, 1998 when the Court issued its "Order Preliminarily
Approving Settlement, Conditionally Certifying Settlement Class and Providing
for Notice of, and Hearing on, the Proposed Settlement" (the "August 20 Order").

 On March 12, 1999, counsel for the Plaintiffs and the Defendants entered into
an amended stipulation of settlement (the "Amended Stipulation") which was filed
with the Court on March 12, 1999. The Amended Stipulation was preliminarily
approved by the Court by its "Modified Order Preliminarily Approving Settlement,
Conditionally Certifying Settlement Class and Providing For Notice of, and
Hearing On, the Proposed Settlement" dated March 22, 1999 (the "March 22
Order"). The Amended Stipulation, among other things, divided the Class Action
Lawsuit into two separate sub-classes that could be settled individually. On May
26, 1999, the Court issued an Order and Final Judgment approving settlement of
one of the sub-classes. Settlement of the second sub-class, involving the
Partnership and 10 affiliated partnerships (collectively referred to as the
"Exchange Partnerships"), remains pending due, in part, to the complexity of the
proposed settlement pertaining to this class.

 In February 2000, counsel for the Plaintiffs and the Defendants entered into
a second amended stipulation of settlement (the "Second Amended Stipulation")
which modified certain of the settlement terms contained in the Amended
Stipulation. The Second Amended Stipulation was preliminarily approved by the
Court by its "Second Modified Order Preliminarily Approving Settlement,
Conditionally Certifying Settlement Class and Providing For Notice of, and
Hearing On, the Proposed Settlement" dated March 6, 2000 (the "March 2000
Order"). Prior to issuing a final order approving the settlement of the second
sub-class involving the Partnership, the Court will hold a fairness hearing that
will be open to all interested parties and permit any party to object to the
settlement. The investors of the Partnership and all other plaintiff sub-class
members will receive a Notice of Settlement and other information pertinent to
the settlement of their claims that will be mailed to them in advance of the
fairness hearing.

 (Continued)

 The settlement of the second sub-class is premised on the consolidation of
the Exchange Partnerships' net assets (the "Consolidation"), subject to certain
conditions, into a single successor company ("Newco"). Under the proposed
Consolidation, the partners of the Exchange Partnerships would receive both
common stock in Newco and a cash distribution; and thereupon the Exchange
Partnerships would be dissolved. In addition, EFG would contribute certain
management contracts, operations personnel, and business opportunities to Newco
and cancel its current management contracts with all of the Exchange
Partnerships. Newco would operate principally as a finance company and would use
its best efforts to list its shares on the NASDAQ National Market or another
national exchange or market as soon after the Consolidation as Newco deems that
market conditions and its business operations are suitable for listing its
shares and Newco has satisfied all necessary regulatory and listing
requirements. The potential benefits and risks of the Consolidation will be
presented in a Solicitation Statement that will be mailed to all of the partners
of the Exchange Partnerships as soon as the associated regulatory review process
is completed and at least 60 days prior to the fairness hearing. A preliminary
Solicitation Statement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
August 24, 1998 and remains pending. Class members will be notified of the
actual fairness hearing date when it is confirmed.

 One of the principal objectives of the Consolidation is to create a company
that would have the potential to generate more value for the benefit of existing
limited partners than other alternatives, including continuing the Partnership's
customary business operations until all of its assets are disposed in the
ordinary course of business. To facilitate the realization of this objective,
the Amended Stipulation provided, among other things, that commencing March 22,
1999, the Exchange Partnerships could collectively invest up to 40 of the total
aggregate net asset values of all of the Exchange Partnerships in any
investment, including additional equipment and other business activities that
the general partners of the Exchange Partnerships and EFG reasonably believed to
be consistent with the anticipated business interests and objectives of Newco,
subject to certain limitations. The Second Amended Stipulation, among other
things, quantified the 40 limitation using a whole dollar amount of 32 million
in the aggregate.

 On March 8, 2000, the Exchange Partnerships collectively invested 32
million as permitted by the Second Amended Stipulation approved by the Court.
The Partnership's portion of the aggregate investment is 2,780,000. The
investment consists of a term loan to Echelon Residential Holdings LLC, a
newly-formed real estate development company that will be owned by several
investors, including James A. Coyne, Executive Vice President of EFG. Mr.
Coyne, in his individual capacity, is the only investor in Echelon
Residential Holdings LLC who is related to EFG. The loan proceeds were used
by Echelon Residential Holdings LLC in the formation of a subsidiary, Echelon
Residential LLC, that in turn acquired various real estate assets from
Echelon International Corporation, a Florida based real estate company. The
loan has a term of 30 months maturing on September 7, 2002 and bears interest
at the annual rate of 14 for the first 24 months and 18 for the final six
months of the term. Interest accrues and compounds monthly but is not payable
until maturity. Echelon Residential Holdings LLC has pledged a security
interest in all of its right, title and interest in and to its membership
interests in Echelon Residential LLC to the Exchange Partnerships as
collateral.

 In the absence of the Court's authorization to enter into new investment
activities, the Partnership's Restated Agreement, as amended, would not permit
such activities without the approval of limited partners owning a majority of
the Partnership's outstanding Units. Consistent with the Amended Stipulation,
the Second Amended Stipulation provides terms for unwinding any new investment
transactions in the event that the Consolidation is not effected or the
Partnership objects to its participation in the Consolidation.

 The Second Amended Stipulation, as well as the Amended Stipulation and the
original Stipulation of Settlement, prescribe certain conditions necessary to
effect a final settlement, including providing the partners of the Exchange
Partnerships with the opportunity to object to the participation of their
partnership in the

24

AMERICAN INCOME FUND I-C,
 a Massachusetts Limited Partnership
 Notes to the Financial Statements

 (Continued)

Consolidation. Assuming the proposed settlement is effected according to present
terms, the Partnership's share of legal fees and expenses related to the Class
Action Lawsuit and the Consolidation is estimated to be approximately 348,000,
of which approximately 298,000 was accrued and expensed by the Partnership in
1998 and approximately 50,000 was accrued and expensed in 1999.

 While the Court's August 20 Order enjoined certain class members, including
all of the partners of the Partnership, from transferring, selling, assigning,
giving, pledging, hypothecating, or otherwise disposing of any Units pending the
Court's final determination of whether the settlement should be approved, the
March 22 Order permitted the partners to transfer Units to family members or as
a result of the divorce, disability or death of the partner. No other transfers
are permitted pending the Court's final determination of whether the settlement
should be approved. The provision of the August 20 Order which enjoined the
General Partners of the Exchange Partnerships from, among other things,
recording any transfers not in accordance with the Court's order remains
effective.

 There can be no assurance that settlement of the sub-class involving the
Exchange Partnerships will receive final Court approval and be effected. There
also can be no assurance that all or any of the Exchange Partnerships will
participate in the Consolidation because if limited partners owning more than
one-third of the outstanding Units of a partnership object to the Consolidation,
then that partnership will be excluded from the Consolidation. Notwithstanding
the extent of delays experienced thus far in achieving a final settlement of the
Class Action Lawsuit with respect to the Exchange Partnerships, the General
Partner and its affiliates, in consultation with counsel, continue to feel that
there is a reasonable basis to believe that a final settlement of the sub-class
involving the Exchange Partnerships ultimately will be achieved. However, in the
absence of a final settlement approved by the Court, the Defendants intend to
defend vigorously against the claims asserted in the Class Action Lawsuit.
Neither the General Partner nor its affiliates can predict with any degree of
certainty the cost of continuing litigation to the Partnership or the ultimate
outcome.

 In addition to the foregoing, the Partnership is a party to other lawsuits
that have arisen out of the conduct of its business, principally involving
disputes or disagreements with lessees over lease terms and conditions as
described below:

Action involving National Steel Corporation

 EFG, on behalf of the Partnership and certain affiliated investment programs
(collectively, the "Plaintiffs"), filed an action in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts Superior Court, Department of the Trial Court in and for the
County of Suffolk on July 27, 1995, for damages and declaratory relief against a
lessee of the Partnership, National Steel Corporation ("National Steel"). The
Complaint sought reimbursement from National Steel of certain sales and/or use
taxes paid to the State of Illinois in connection with equipment leased by
National Steel from the Plaintiffs and other remedies provided under the Master
Lease Agreement ("MLA"). On August 30, 1995, National Steel filed a Notice of
Removal, which removed the case to United States District Court, District of
Massachusetts. On September 7, 1995, National Steel filed its Answer to the
Plaintiff's Complaint along with Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaims and
sought declaratory relief, alleging breach of contract, implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, and specific performance. The Plaintiffs filed an Answer
to National Steel's Counterclaims on September 29, 1995. The parties discussed
settlement with respect to this matter for some time; however, the negotiations
were unsuccessful. The Plaintiffs filed an Amended and Supplemental Complaint
alleging further default under the MLA and filed a motion for Summary Judgment
on all claims and Counterclaims. The Court held a hearing on the Plaintiff's
motion in December 1997 and later entered a decision dismissing certain of
National Steel's Counterclaims, finding in favor of the Plaintiffs on certain
issues and in favor of National Steel on other issues. On May 11, 1999, the
parties executed a comprehensive settlement agreement to resolve all outstanding

issues, including reimbursement to the Partnership for the disputed sales tax
items referenced above. This matter did not have a material effect on the
Partnership's financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 9 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Refinancing of Indebtedness

 In February 2000, the Partnership and certain affiliated investment programs
(collectively, the "Programs") refinanced the indebtedness maturing in January
2000 associated with the McDonnell-Douglas MD-82 aircraft formerly leased to
Finnair OY. The Programs received debt proceeds of 4,720,000 in aggregate,
consisting of 3,370,000 to refinance the existing indebtedness and an
additional 1,350,000 required to perform a D-Check on the aircraft. The note
bears a fluctuating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a margin with interest
payments due monthly. The Partnership's share of the indebtedness is 560,358
which is due at maturity on August 9, 2000. The aircraft was returned in January
2000 upon its lease term expiration and is currently being stored in a
warehouse.

Other

 On March 8, 2000, the Exchange Partnerships (see Note 8) collectively loaned
 32 million to Echelon Residential Holdings LLC, a newly-formed real estate
development company that will be owned by several investors, including James A.
Coyne, Executive Vice President of EFG. Mr. Coyne, in his individual capacity,
is the only investor in Echelon Residential Holdings LLC who is related to EFG.

 The Partnership's participation in the loan is 2,780,000. Echelon
Residential Holdings LLC, through a subsidiary (Echelon Residential LLC),
used the loan proceeds to acquire various real estate assets from Echelon
International Corporation, a Florida based real estate company. The loan has
a term of 30 months maturing on September 7, 2002 and bears interest at the
annual rate of 14 for the first 24 months and 18 for the final six months
of the term. Interest accrues and compounds monthly but is not payable until
maturity. In connection with the transaction, Echelon Residential Holdings
LLC has pledged a security interest in all of its right, title and interest
in and to its membership interests in Echelon Residential LLC to the Exchange
Partnerships as collateral.

 SCHEDULE OF EXCESS (DEFICIENCY) OF TOTAL CASH GENERATED TO COST
 OF EQUIPMENT DISPOSED

 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

 The Partnership classifies all rents from leasing equipment as lease revenue.
Upon expiration of the primary lease terms, equipment may be sold, rented on a
month-to-month basis or re-leased for a defined period under a new or extended
lease agreement. The proceeds generated from selling or re-leasing the
equipment, in addition to any month-to-month revenue, represent the total
residual value realized for each item of equipment. Therefore, the financial
statement gain or loss, which reflects the difference between the net book value
of the equipment at the time of sale or disposition and the proceeds realized
upon sale or disposition may not reflect the aggregate residual proceeds
realized by the Partnership for such equipment.

 The following is a summary of cash excess associated with equipment
