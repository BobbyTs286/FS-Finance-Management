Competition - General. The distribution business, which includes all segments
of the Company's business, is highly competitive with the principal methods of
competition being product quality, sufficiency of inventory, price and the
ability to give the customer prompt and dependable service. The Company
anticipates no decline in competition in any of its business segments in the

 -2-
 3

foreseeable future.

Employees. As of December 31, 1995, the Company employed approximately 22,500
persons.

AUTOMOTIVE PARTS GROUP.

 The Automotive Parts Group, the largest division of the Company,
distributes automotive replacement parts and accessory items. The Company is
the largest member of the National Automotive Parts Association ("NAPA"), a
voluntary trade association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution
of automotive parts. In addition to approximately 165,000 part numbers that
are available, the Company, in conjunction with NAPA, offers complete
inventory, accounting, cataloging, marketing, training and other programs in
the automotive aftermarket.
 During 1995, the Company's Automotive Parts Group included NAPA
automotive parts distribution centers and automotive parts stores ("auto parts
stores" or "NAPA Auto Parts stores") owned in the United States by Genuine
Parts Company; automotive parts distribution centers and auto parts stores in
western Canada owned and operated by UAP/NAPA Automotive Western Partnership
("UAP/NAPA"), a general partnership in which a wholly owned subsidiary of
Genuine Parts Company owns a 49 interest; auto parts stores in the United
States operated by corporations in which Genuine Parts Company owned a 51 
interest; distribution centers owned by Balkamp, Inc., a majority-owned
subsidiary; rebuilding plants owned by the Company and operated by its Rayloc
division; and automotive parts distribution centers and auto parts stores in
Mexico, owned and operated by Grupo Auto Todo, S.A. de C.V. ("Auto Todo"), a
joint venture company in which a wholly owned subsidiary of Genuine Parts
Company owns a 49 interest.
 The Company's NAPA automotive parts distribution centers distribute
replacement parts (other than body parts) for substantially all motor vehicle
makes and models in service in the United States, including imported vehicles,
trucks, buses, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and farm vehicles. In
addition, the Company distributes small engines and replacement parts for farm
equipment and heavy duty equipment. The Company's inventories also include
accessory items for such vehicles and equipment, and supply items used by a
wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket, such as repair shops,
service stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck dealers, leasing
companies, bus and truck lines, mass merchandisers, farms, industrial concerns
and individuals who perform their own maintenance and parts installation.
Although the Company's domestic automotive operations purchase from more than
150 different suppliers, approximately 76 of 1995 automotive inventories were
purchased from 20 major suppliers. Since 1931, the Company has had return
privileges with most of its suppliers which has protected the Company from
inventory obsolescence.

Distribution System. In 1995, Genuine Parts Company operated 64 domestic NAPA
automotive parts distribution centers located in 38 states and 740 domestic
company-owned NAPA Auto Parts stores located in 43 states. In August 1995, the
Company's operations at the NAPA Normal, Illinois, Distribution Center were
consolidated into the NAPA Chicago Distribution Center in Naperville, Illinois.
The Normal facility was closed. In addition, at December 31, 1995, Genuine
Parts Company owned a 51 interest in 61 corporations which operated 83 auto
parts stores in 29 states.
 In Canada, Genuine Parts Company Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary, owns
a 49 interest in UAP/NAPA which operated 9 automotive parts distribution
centers and 115 auto parts stores located in the provinces of Alberta, British
Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan and in the Yukon Territories. In addition,
the Company has an approximate 23 interest in UAP Inc., a publicly traded
Canadian corporation, which owns the other 51 interest in UAP/NAPA and further
engages in the distribution of automotive parts primarily in eastern Canada.
In Mexico, Auto Todo owns and operates 12 distribution centers and 27 auto
parts stores. Auto Todo is not licensed to and does not use the NAPA(R) name
in Mexico. The Company's investments in UAP/NAPA and Auto Todo are accounted
for by the equity method of accounting.
 The Company's distribution centers serve approximately 5,000
independently

 -3-
 4

owned NAPA Auto Parts stores located throughout the market areas served. NAPA
Auto Parts stores, in turn, sell to a wide variety of customers in the
automotive aftermarket. Collectively, these auto parts stores account for
approximately 39 of the Company's total sales with no auto parts store or
group of auto parts stores with individual or common ownership accounting for
more than .4 of the total sales of the Company.

Products. Distribution centers carry approximately 165,000 different parts and
related supply items. Each item is cataloged and numbered for identification
and accessibility. Significant inventories are carried to provide for fast and
frequent deliveries to customers. Most orders are filled and shipped the same
day as received. The majority of sales are on terms which require payment
within 30 days of the statement date. The Company does not manufacture any of
the products it distributes. The majority of products are distributed under
the NAPA(R) name, a mark licensed to the Company by the National Automotive
Parts Association.

Related Operations. A majority-owned subsidiary of Genuine Parts Company,
Balkamp, Inc.("Balkamp"), distributes a wide variety of replacement parts and
accessory items for passenger cars, heavy duty vehicles, motorcycles and farm
equipment. In addition, Balkamp distributes service items such as testing
equipment, lubricating equipment, gauges, cleaning supplies, chemicals and
supply items used by repair shops, fleets, farms and institutions. Balkamp
packages many of the approximately 20,000 part numbers which constitute the
"Balkamp" line of products which are distributed to the members of the National
Automotive Parts Association ("NAPA"). These products are categorized in 150
different product groups purchased from more than 600 suppliers. All Balkamp
items are cataloged separately to provide single source convenience for NAPA
customers. BALKAMP(R), a federally registered trademark owned by NAPA and
licensed to Balkamp, is important to the sales and marketing promotions of the
Balkamp organization. Balkamp has three distribution centers located in
Indianapolis, Indiana, Greenwood, Mississippi, and West Jordan, Utah.
 The Company, through its Rayloc division, also operates six plants
where certain small automotive parts are rebuilt. These products are
distributed to the members of NAPA under the name Rayloc(R). Rayloc(R) is a
mark licensed to the Company by the NAPA.

Segment Data. In the year ended December 31, 1995, sales from the Automotive
Parts Group approximated 53 of the Company's net sales as compared to 56 in
1994 and 57 in 1993.

Service to NAPA Auto Parts Stores. The Company believes that the quality and
the range of services provided to its auto parts customers constitute a
significant part of its automotive parts distribution system. Such services
include fast and frequent delivery, obsolescence protection, parts cataloging
(including the use of computerized NAPA Auto Parts catalogues) and stock
adjustment through a continuing parts classification system which allows auto
parts customers to return certain merchandise on a scheduled basis. The
Company offers its NAPA Auto Parts store customers various management aids,
marketing aids and service on topics such as inventory control, cost analysis,
accounting procedures, group insurance and retirement benefit plans, marketing
conferences and seminars, sales and advertising manuals and training programs.
Point of sale/inventory management is available through TAMS(R) (Total
Automotive Management Systems), a computer system designed and developed by the
Company for the NAPA Auto Parts store.
 In association with NAPA, the Company has developed and refined an
inventory classification system to determine optimum distribution center and
auto parts store inventory levels for automotive parts stocking based on
automotive registrations, usage rates, production figures, technological
advances and other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous
analytical review, is an integral part of the Company's inventory control
procedures and comprises an important feature of the inventory management
services which the Company makes available to its NAPA Auto Parts store
customers. Over the last 10 years, losses

 -4-
 5

to the Company from obsolescence have been insignificant, and the Company
attributes this to the successful operation of its classification system which
involves product return privileges with most of its suppliers.

Competition. In the distribution of automotive parts, the Company competes
with automobile manufacturers (some of which sell replacement parts for
vehicles built by other manufacturers as well as those which they build
themselves), automobile dealers, warehouse clubs and large automotive parts
retail chains. In addition, the Company competes with the distributing outlets
of parts manufacturers, oil companies, mass merchandisers, including national
retail chains, and with other parts distributors and jobbers.

NAPA. The Company is a member of the National Automotive Parts Association, a
voluntary association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of
automotive replacement parts. NAPA, which neither buys nor sells automotive
parts, functions as a trade association whose members currently operate 72
distribution centers located throughout the United States, 63 of which are
owned and operated by the Company. NAPA develops marketing concepts and
programs which may be used by its members. It is not involved in the chain of
distribution.
 Among the automotive lines which each NAPA member purchases and
distributes are certain lines designated, cataloged, advertised and promoted as
"NAPA" lines. The members are not required to purchase any specific quantity
of parts so designated and may, and do, purchase competitive lines from other
supply sources. 
 The Company and the other NAPA members use the federally registered 
trademark NAPA(R) as part of the trade name of their distribution centers and 
jobbing stores. The Company contributes to NAPA's national advertising which 
is designed to increase public recognition of the "NAPA" name and to promote 
"NAPA" product lines.
 The Company is a party, together with other members of NAPA and NAPA
itself, to a consent decree entered by the Federal District Court in Detroit,
Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent decree enjoins certain practices under
the federal antitrust laws, including the use of exclusive agreements with
manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of territories among
several NAPA members, fixing of prices or terms of sale for such parts among
such members, and agreements to adhere to any uniform policy in selecting parts
customers or determining the number and location of, or arrangements with, auto
parts customers.

INDUSTRIAL PARTS GROUP

 The Industrial Parts Group distributes industrial replacement parts
and related supplies. This Group distributes industrial bearings and fluid
transmission equipment, including hydraulic and pneumatic products, material
handling components, agricultural and irrigation equipment and their related
supplies.
 In 1995, the Company distributed industrial parts in the United States
through Motion Industries, Inc. ("Motion"), headquartered in Birmingham,
Alabama, and Berry Bearing Company ("Berry Bearing"), headquartered in Chicago,
Illinois. Motion and Berry Bearing are wholly owned subsidiaries of the
Genuine Parts Company. In Canada, industrial parts are distributed by Oliver
Industrial Supply Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Genuine Parts Holdings
Ltd., headquartered in Lethbridge, Alberta. Genuine Parts Holdings Ltd. is a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 On June 9, 1995, September 30, 1995, and October 31, 1995 the Company
completed the acquisitions of Midcap Bearing Corporation, Power Drives &
Bearings, Inc., and Atlantic/Tracy, Inc., respectively. Midcap Bearing
Corporation is a distributor of bearings and mechanical, electrical and fluid
power components headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, and the operator of 17
branches in Texas and New Mexico. Power Drives & Bearings, Inc. is
headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, and operates 6 branches. Atlantic/Tracy,
Inc. is headquartered in Somerville, Massachusetts, and operates 11 branches.
All three companies distribute products similar to those distributed by the
Company's Industrial Parts Group and all three companies have been merged into
the

 -5-
 6

Company's Motion Industries, Inc. subsidiary.
 As of December 31, 1995, the Group served more than 150,000 customers
in all types of industries located throughout the United States, and in Canada,
principally in the Provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

Distribution System. In the United States, the Industrial Parts Group operates
5 distribution centers, two re-distribution centers, 10 service centers for
fluid power and special hose applications and over 370 branches. Distribution
centers stock and distribute more than 200,000 different items purchased from
over 250 different suppliers. The Group's re-distribution centers serve as
collection points for excess inventory collected from its branches for re-
distribution to those branches which need the inventory. Approximately 50 of
1995 total industrial purchases were made from 15 major suppliers. Sales are
generated from the Group's branches located in 43 states, each of which has
warehouse facilities, which stock significant amounts of inventory
representative of the lines of products used by customers in the respective
market area served.
 In Canada, Oliver Industrial Supply Ltd. ("Oliver") operates an
industrial parts and agricultural supply distribution center for its seven
branches serving the industrial and agricultural markets of Alberta, British
Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan in western Canada. In addition to
industrial parts and agricultural supplies, Oliver distributes irrigation
systems and related supplies.

Products. The Industrial Parts Group distributes a wide variety of products to
its customers, primarily industrial concerns, to maintain and operate plants,
machinery and equipment. Products include such items as hoses, belts,
bearings, pulleys, pumps, valves, chains, gears, sprockets, speed reducers and
electric motors. The nature of this Group's business demands the maintenance
of large inventories and the ability to provide prompt and demanding delivery
requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed are installed by the
customer. Most orders are filled immediately from existing stock and
deliveries are normally made within 24 hours of receipt of order. The majority
of all sales are on open account.

Related Information. Non-exclusive distributor agreements are in effect with
most of the Group's suppliers. The terms of these agreements vary; however, it
has been the experience of the Group that the custom of the trade is to treat
such agreements as continuing until breached by one party, or until terminated
by mutual consent.

Segment Data. In the year ended December 31, 1995, sales from the Company's
Industrial Parts Group approximated 29 of the Company's net sales as compared
to 27 in 1994 and 26 in 1993.

Competition. The Industrial Parts Group competes with other distributors
specializing in the distribution of such items, as well as with general line
distributors. To a lesser extent, the Group competes with manufacturers that
sell directly to the customer.

OFFICE PRODUCTS GROUP

 The Office Products Group, through S. P. Richards Company ("S.P.
Richards"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Genuine Parts Company headquartered in
Atlanta, Georgia, is engaged in the wholesale distribution of a broad line of
office products which are used in the daily operation of businesses, schools,
offices and institutions. Office products fall into the general categories of
computer supplies, office machines, general office supplies, janitorial
supplies, breakroom supplies, and office furniture. Lesker Office Furniture, a
furniture only wholesaler acquired in 1993, operates from 5 branches in the
Northeast. In 1995, a new Lesker branch was opened in New England. On May 22,
1995, the Company completed the acquisition of Horizon USA Data Supplies, Inc.
Horizon USA Data Supplies, Inc., is a computer supplies distributor
headquartered in Reno,

 -6-

Approximately 53 of 1995 total office products purchases were made from 14
major suppliers.
 The Office Products Group sells to qualified resellers of office
products. Customers are offered comprehensive marketing programs which include
flyers, other promotional material and personalized product catalogs. The
marketing programs are supported by all the Group's distribution centers which
stock all cataloged products and have the capability to provide overnight
delivery.
 While many recognized brand-name items are carried in inventory, S. P.
Richards Company also markets items produced for it under its own SPARCO(R)
brand name, as well as its NATURE SAVER(R) brand of recycled products.

Segment Data. In the year ended December 31, 1995, sales from the Company's
Office Products Group approximated 18 of the Company's net sales as compared
to 17 in 1994 and in 1993.

Competition. In the distribution of office supplies to retail dealers, S. P.
Richards competes with many other wholesale distributors as well as with

 W I T N E S S E T H:

 WHEREAS, the Company maintains the Genuine Parts Company Pension Plan
(the "Plan"), as amended and restated effective January 1, 1989, and such Plan
is currently in effect; and

 WHEREAS, under Section 8.06(c), the Pension Committee has the
authority to amend the Plan to comply with changes in law and to make other
amendments that do not materially increase the costs associated with the Plan;
and

 WHEREAS, under the Retirement Protection Act, the interest rate under
Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (i.e., the interest rate used to
determine a lump sum distribution) has been changed; and

 WHEREAS, the Pension Committee wishes to amend the Plan to comply with
amended Code Section 417(e)(3) and to make certain other changes;

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Plan is hereby amended as
follows:

 1.

 Section 2.03(c) is hereby deleted and a new Section 2.03(c) is
substituted therefor as follows:

 "(c) Lump Sum Distributions Before April 1, 1995. For purposes of
 computing single sum values, the interest rate shall be the
 interest rate which would be applied by the Pension Benefit
 Guaranty Corporation for purposes of determining the present
 value of the Participant's benefits under the Plan if the Plan
 had terminated on January 1 of the applicable Plan Year with
 insufficient assets to provide benefits guaranteed by the
 Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation on that date.

 Lump Sum Distributions After April 1, 1995. Notwithstanding
 the preceding paragraph, for lump sum distributions made on or
 after April 1, 1995, a lump sum distribution will be
 determined based on the Applicable Mortality Table and the
 Applicable Interest Rate as defined immediately below:

2

(1) Applicable Mortality Table. The term "Applicable Mortality
 Table" means the table prescribed by the secretary of the
 Treasury based on the prevailing Commissioner's Standard Table
 (described in Section 807(d)(6)(A) of the Internal Revenue
 Code) used to determine reserves or group annuity contracts
 issued on the date as of which present value is being
 determined (without regard to any other subparagraph of
 Section 807(d)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code).

 (2) Applicable Interest Rate. For lump sum distributions made on
 or after April 1, 1995, the term "Applicable Interest Rate"
 means the annual rate of interest on 30-year Treasury
 securities for the month of December that precedes the
 beginning of the Plan Year in which such distribution occurs.
 (Note that the December rates are published in January)."

 2.

 The phrase "The Pension Committee shall have the right to amend any
and all of the provisions of the Plan;" set forth in Section 9.01 is hereby
deleted and the following phrase is substituted therefor as follows: "The
Compensation and Stock Option Committee (or the Pension Committee to the extent
permitted by Section 8.06(c)) shall have the right, at any time, to amend any
or all of the provisions of the Plan;".

 3.

 Paragraph 1 shall be effective for lump sum distributions made on or
after April 1, 1995. The Amendment set forth in Paragraph 2 shall be effective
on January 1, 1989. Except as amended herein, the Plan shall remain in full
force and effect.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Genuine Parts Company, acting through the Pension
Committee, has caused this Amendment to the Plan to be executed on the date
shown below, but effective as of the dates indicated above.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors
Genuine Parts Company

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Genuine
Parts Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Genuine Parts
Company and subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1993
the Company changed its method of accounting for post-retirement benefits other
than pensions and income taxes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries
December 31, 1995

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Genuine Parts Company and all of its subsidiaries (the "Company").
Income applicable to minority interests is included in other expenses.
Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the 
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
may differ from those estimates.

CASH EQUIVALENTS: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

INVESTMENTS: The Company has a 23 ownership interest in UAP Inc., a Canadian 
automotive parts distributor and a 49 interest in a partnership formed by the 
Company and UAP Inc.
 On October 1, 1994, the Company paid approximately 26 million to acquire
a 49 interest in Grupo Auto Todo, a partnership formed by the Company and Auto
Todo, a Mexican automotive parts distributor.
 These investments are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and
represent less than five percent of consolidated amounts. Translation 
adjustments are not material.

INVENTORIES: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all
automotive parts, and certain industrial parts, and by the first-in, first-out
(FIFO) method for all other inventories. If the FIFO method had been used for
all inventories, cost would have been 114,381,000 and 102,077,000 higher than
reported at December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994, respectively.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated on the
basis of cost. Depreciation is determined principally on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful life of each asset.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS: In March 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of, which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived
assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than
the assets' carrying amount. Statement 121 also addresses the accounting for
long-lived assets that are expected to be disposed of. The Company will adopt
Statement 121 in the first quarter of 1996 and, based on current circumstances,
does not believe the effect of adoption will be material.

STOCK OPTIONS: Proceeds from the sale of stock under options are credited to
common stock at par value and the excess of the option price over par value is
credited to additional paid-in capital.
 The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees
with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of
grant. The Company accounts for stock option grants in accordance with APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and, accordingly,
recognizes no compensation expense for the stock option grants.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES: Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" which requires the projected
future costs of providing postretirement benefits, such as health care and life
insurance, be recognized as an expense as employees render service instead of 
when benefits are paid. The Company applied the new rules using the cumulative 
effect method, resulting in a charge of 5,055,000 (net of income taxes of 
 3,095,000) in 1993.
 Also effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". The cumulative
effect as of January 1, 1993, of adopting Statement 109 increased 1993 net
income by 4,000,000.

NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: Net income per common share is based on the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each year.
Options outstanding under the Company's stock option plan would not materially
dilute net income per share and, therefore, have not been included in the
computation.

increase in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 1995 and a
 37,400,000 decrease at December 31, 1994.
 At December 31, 1995, the plan held 534,997 shares of common stock of the
Company with a market value of 21,935,000.

8. INDUSTRY DATA
The industry data for the past five years presented in the Exhibit on page 27
is an integral part of these financial
statements.
 The Company is primarily engaged in the distribution of merchandise,
principally automotive and industrial replacement parts, and office supplies
throughout the United States. In the automotive industry, the Company
distributes replacement parts (other than body parts) for substantially all
makes and models of domestically manufactured automobiles, most domestically
manufactured trucks and buses, and most vehicles manufactured outside the
United States. In addition, this segment of the business includes the
rebuilding of some automotive parts and the distribution of replacement parts
for certain types of farm equipment, motorcycles, motorboats and small engines.
 The Company's industrial segment distributes a wide variety of industrial
bearings, mechanical and fluid power transmission equipment, including
hydraulic and pneumatic products, material handling components, and related
parts and supplies.
 The Company's office products segment distributes a wide variety of office
products, computer supplies, office furniture and business electronics.
 Intersegment sales are not significant. Operating profit for each industry
segment is calculated as net sales less operating expenses excluding general
corporate expenses, interest expense, equity in income from investees and
minority interests. Identifiable assets by industry are those assets that are
used in the Company's operations in each industry. Corporate assets are
principally cash, cash equivalents and headquarters' facilities and equipment.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Genuine Parts Company and Subsidiaries
December 31, 1995

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:
Net sales in 1995 increased for the 46th consecutive year to a record high of
 5.3 billion. This was an increase of 8 over the prior year and compares with
increases of 11 in 1994, and 9 in 1993. Sales for the Automotive Parts Group
increased 4 in 1995 versus 8 in 1994, reflecting increased market share,
aggressive advertising and redesigned stores, offset by the soft automotive
aftermarket. Price increases for the Automotive Parts Group were less than 2 
in 1995 and there were no price increases in 1994. Sales for the Industrial
Parts Group increased 15 in 1995 versus 14 in 1994 reflecting geographic
expansion and strong industrial production and factory utilization. Price
increases for the Industrial Parts Group were slightly less than 5 in 1995 and
approximately 3 in 1994. Sales for the Office Products Group increased 12 in
1995 compared with 14 in 1994 reflecting increased market share, continued
geographic expansion, and improved service level. Price increases for the 
Office Products Group were approximately 2 in 1995 and less than 1 in 1994.
 Costs of goods sold was 69.5 of net sales in 1995 compared to 68.8 in
1994 and 69.0 in 1993. While selling, administrative and other expenses
increased each year, the percentage to net sales remained approximately the
same. The effective income tax rate was 39.5 in 1995 and 39.2 in 1994 and in
1993. Net income in 1995 increased 7 over 1994 net income. Net income in
1994 increased 12 over 1993.
 Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions" which requires the projected future costs of
providing postretirement benefits, such as health care and life insurance, be
recognized as an expense as employees render service instead of when benefits
are paid. The Company has applied the new rules using the cumulative effect
method, resulting in a charge of 5,055,000 (net of income taxes of
 3,095,000). Also effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". The
cumulative effect as of January 1, 1993, of adopting Statement 109 increased
net income by 4,000,000. As permitted by the Statement, prior year financial
statements have not been restated to reflect the change in accounting method.
 Effective December 31, 1995, the Company changed the weighted average
discount rate for the Pension Plan from 8.40 to 7.40 , resulting in a net
 66,200,000 increase in the projected benefit obligation.

LIQUIDITY AND SOURCES OF CAPITAL:
The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 3.7 at the close of 1995
with current assets amounting to 78 of total assets. Trade accounts
receivable and inventories increased 16 and 12 respectively, while working
capital increased 10 . The increase in working capital has been financed
principally from the Company's cash flow generated by operations. At December
31, 1995, 45,000,000 was outstanding under an unsecured revolving line of
credit with a bank. In December 1995 the Company converted 50,000,000 of
amounts outstanding under the line of credit into an unsecured term note which
matures in December 2000 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.98 . The
amounts borrowed have principally been used to finance the Company's stock
repurchase program. At the August 16, 1994 meeting, the Board of Directors
approved a stock repurchase program which authorizes the Company to acquire up
to 10 million shares of its Common Stock. To date, approximately 3 million
shares have been repurchased. Existing credit facilities, current financial
resources and anticipated funds from operations are expected to meet
requirements for working capital in 1996. Capital expenditures during 1995
amounted to 91 million compared with 66 million in 1994 and 58 million in
1993. The increases reflect the Company's continuing geographic expansion as
well as the upgrading of existing facilities. It is anticipated that capital
expenditures in 1996 will be approximately the same as 1995.

QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:
Miscellaneous year-end adjustments resulted in increasing net income during the
fourth quarter of 1995 and 1994 by approximately 20,093,000 .16 per share)
and 18,353,000 .15 per share), respectively.
 The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the
years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994.
