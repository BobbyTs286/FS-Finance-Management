CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION 

This Annual Report on Form 10-K, the other reports, statements, and information that we have previously filed or that we may subsequently file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and public announcements that we have previously made or may subsequently make include, may include, incorporate by reference or may incorporate by reference certain statements that may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are intended to enjoy the benefits of that act. Unless the context is otherwise, the forward-looking statements included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and those reports, statements, information and announcements address activities, events or developments that First America Resources Corporation (hereinafter referred to as we, us, our, our Company or First America Resources Corporation expects or anticipates, will or may occur in the future. Any statements in this document about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as may, should, could, predict, potential, believe, will likely result, expect, will continue, anticipate, seek, estimate, intend, plan, projection, would and outlook, and similar expressions. Accordingly, these statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in them. Any forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed throughout this document. All forward-looking statements concerning economic conditions, rates of growth, rates of income or values as may be included in this document are based on information available to us on the dates noted, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. It is important to note that our actual results may differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements due to fluctuations in interest rates, inflation, government regulations, economic conditions and competitive product and pricing pressures in the geographic and business areas in which we conduct operations, including our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other factors discussed elsewhere in this Report. 

Certain risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations and cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us, and you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. The risks and uncertainties we currently face are not the only ones we face. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise. There may be additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial to our business. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. If any such risks occur, our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition could be materially affected in an adverse manner. Under such circumstances, you may lose all or part of your investment. 

The industry and market data contained in this report are based either on our management s own estimates or, where indicated, independent industry publications, reports by governmental agencies or market research firms or other published independent sources and, in each case, are believed by our management to be reasonable estimates. However, industry and market data is subject to change and cannot always be verified with complete certainty due to limits on the availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data gathering process and other limitations and uncertainties inherent in any statistical survey of market shares. We have not independently verified market and industry data from third-party sources. In addition, consumption patterns and customer preferences can and do change. As a result, you should be aware that market share, ranking and other similar data set forth herein, and estimates and beliefs based on such data, may not be verifiable or reliable.

First America Metal Corporation in Morris, IL which is an international scrap metal company specializing in recycling of Non-Ferrous material and become one of a large exporter of scrap metal in the Midwest. Management anticipates that that company after acquisition will be competitive in pricing of Copper, Brass, Stainless, Aluminum, High Temp Alloys, Zinc, Tin, Cobalt, and Tungsten Alloys.

PART II 

Item 5. Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters and Small Business Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

Trading History 

Our common stock is quoted on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol FSTJ. Our stock had not traded as of June 30, 2013. 

The quotation do not reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not represent actual transactions. 

Dividends 

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. For the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be dependent upon then existing conditions, including our financial condition and results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, business prospects and other factors that the Board of Directors considers relevant. Each holder of our Series A preferred stock is entitled to a 10 per annum cumulative dividend. 

There are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes, however, prohibit us from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend: 

we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or 

our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of stockholders who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution, unless otherwise permitted under our articles of incorporation. 

Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans 

None 

Stock Issuance in Subsequent Period 

On July 17, 2013, we issued Michael T. Williams, principal of Williams Securities Law Firm, P.A. 120,000 shares of common stock for legal services. We valued these shares at 0.10 per share for aggregate consideration of legal service fee of 12,000. 

We relied upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended for the above issuances to our SEC legal counsel. 

6 

We believed that Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 was available because: 

None of these issuances involved underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions. 

Restrictive legends were and will be placed on all certificates issued as described above. 

The distribution did not involve general solicitation or advertising. 

The distributions were made only to investors who were sophisticated enough to evaluate the risks of the investment. 

The investor is the principal of our legal counsel. 

Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data 

Not required. 

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation 

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes, and other financial information included in this Form 10-K. 

Our Management s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rate; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Although the forward-looking statements in this Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.

The Company had cash and cash equivalents of 28,924 at June 30, 2012 and working capital of 18,448. There were total liabilities of 24,307 at June 30, 2013. 

Until we generate more operating revenues or receive other financing, all our costs, which we will incur irrespective of our business development activities, including bank service fees and those costs associated with SEC requirements associated with staying public, will be funded by Jian Li, our president and Director. Mr. Li is not obligated to pay these costs and any costs advanced will be treated as a demand loan with to be agreed interest. These costs are estimated to be less than 25,000 annually until we close our potential acquisition. If we fail to meet these requirements, we will be unable to secure a qualification for quotation of our securities on the over the counter bulletin board, or if we have secured a qualification, may lose the qualification and our securities would no longer trade on the over the counter bulletin board. Further, if we fail to meet these obligations and as a consequence we fail to satisfy our SEC reporting obligations, investors will now own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in yearly and annual reports filed with the SEC and investors may have increased difficulty in selling their stock as we will be non-reporting. 

10 

After our potential acquisition, we may still need to secure additional debt or equity funding. We do not have any plans or specific agreements for new sources of funding, except for the anticipated loans from management as described above. 

Our lack of revenues and cash raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations. 

The Company s lack of operating history and financial resources raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of First America Resources Corporation formerly Golden Oasis New Energy Group Inc as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, and the related statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2013, June 30, 2012, and the cumulative period May 10, 2010 (date of inception) through June 30, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of First America Resources Corporation. as of June 30, 2013 and 2012, and the results of its operations, shareholders equity, and their cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2013, June 30, 2012, and the cumulative period from May 10, 2010 (date of inception) through June 30, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

As discussed in Note F Going Concern, the Company s lack of operating history and financial resources raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if the Company is unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing, then the Company may be required to cease or curtail its operation.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company s Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2013. Based upon such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer has concluded that, as of June 30, 2013, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. This conclusion by the Company s Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer does not relate to reporting periods after June 30, 2013. 

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2013 based on the framework stated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Furthermore, due to our financial situation, we will be implementing further internal controls as we become operative so as to fully comply with the standards set by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Based on its evaluation as of June 30, 2013, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of June 30, 2013. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

The material weakness relates to the following: 

1. Accounting and Finance Personnel Weaknesses Our current accounting staff is relatively small and we do not have the required infrastructure of meeting the higher demands of being a U.S. public company. This material weakness also relates to a lack of personnel with expertise in preparing financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, in addition to the small size of the staff. 

2. Lack of Internal Audit Function We lack sufficient resources to perform the internal audit function. 

In order to mitigate these material weaknesses to the fullest extent possible, the Company continues to study the implementation of additional internal controls over accounting and financial reporting. 

This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

No change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2013, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters 

The following tables set forth the ownership, as of the date of this prospectus, of our common stock by each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our outstanding common stock, our directors, and our executive officers and directors as a group. To the best of our knowledge, the persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares, except as otherwise noted. There are not any pending or anticipated arrangements that may cause a change in control. 

17 

The information presented below regarding beneficial ownership of our voting securities has been presented in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules, a person is deemed to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of the security or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security. A person is deemed to own beneficially any security as to which such person has the right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within 60 days through the conversion or exercise of any convertible security, warrant, option or other right. More than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities. The percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially owned by such person, which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days, by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date plus the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days.

Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services 

Enterprise CPA was our independent auditors for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 and 2011. 

The following table shows the fees paid or accrued by us for the audit and other services provided by our auditor for fiscal 2012 and 2013.

As defined by the SEC, (i) audit fees are fees for professional services rendered by our principal accountant for the audit of our annual financial statements and review of financial statements included in our Form 10-Q, or for services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years; (ii) audit-related fees are fees for assurance and related services by our principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under audit fees; (iii) tax fees are fees for professional services rendered by our principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning; and (iv) all other fees are fees for products and services provided by our principal accountant, other than the services reported under audit fees, audit-related fees, and tax fees. 

Under applicable SEC rules, the Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditors in order to ensure that they do not impair the auditors independence. The SEC s rules specify the types of non-audit services that an independent auditor may not provide to its audit client and establish the Audit Committee s responsibility for administration of the engagement of the independent auditors. Until such time as we have an Audit Committee in place, the Board of Directors will pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditors. 

Consistent with the SEC s rules, the Audit Committee Charter requires that the Audit Committee review and pre-approve all audit services and permitted non-audit services provided by the independent auditors to us or any of our subsidiaries. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to a member of the Audit Committee and if it does, the decisions of that member must be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.
