Exhibit 99.3 

[LETTERHEAD OF DELOITTE TOUCHE] 

INDEPENDENT
ACCOUNTANTS REPORT 

Board of Directors and
StockholderWashington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp. 

We have examined management s
assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion Concerning Compliance
with Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp. s Minimum Servicing Standards, that
Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp. (WMMSC) complied with the minimum servicing
standards in its role as Master Servicer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002.
Such assertions were examined relating to those series of certificates included in the
attached Exhibit 1. Management is responsible for WMMSC s compliance with those
minimum servicing standards. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management s assertion about WMMSC s compliance based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in
accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about
WMMSC s compliance with its minimum servicing standards and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Series of certificates subject
to such procedures were selected using sampling methods, and accordingly, we make no
representations that our examination procedures were performed on a specific series of
certificates as listed in the attached Exhibit I. We believe that our examination provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination
on WMMSC s compliance with its minimum servicing standards. 

In our opinion, management s
assertion that WMMSC complied with the aforementioned minimum servicing standards as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2002, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

For the year ended December 31, 2002,
Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp. (WMMSC) has complied in all material respects
with our minimum servicing standards set forth below under master servicing arrangements.
Primary servicing functions are performed by various subservicers. 

Our minimum standards are:

 original identification.

 and servicing agreements. 

Exception During the
year, certain reconciliations were not completed within our minimum servicing standards
and contained items that were not resolved within 90 calendar days of their original
identification. These occurrences did not adversely impact trustees, paying agents, or

respects.

 maintained by WMMSC during the appropriate accounting cycle. 

C. 
 Reconciliations shall be performed monthly for each subservicer remittance.
 These reconciliations shall: 

1) 
 Be mathematically accurate. 

2) 
 Be prepared within thirty (30) calendar days after the cutoff date.

VI. 
 DELIQUENCIES 

A. 
 Reports from subservicers identifying delinquent loans shall be received and
