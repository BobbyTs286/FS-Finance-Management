General

Lillian Vernon Corporation (the "Company") is a direct mail specialty
catalog company concentrating on the marketing of gift, household, gardening,
kitchen, Christmas and children's products. The Company, a predecessor of which
was founded in 1951, seeks to provide customers with reasonably priced products
that can be differentiated from competitive products either by design, price or
personalization. In fiscal 1997, the Company published 29 catalog editions, and
mailed over 175,000,000 catalogs to past and prospective customers.

 The Company has developed a proprietary customer data base containing
information about its customers, including such data as order frequency, size
and date of last order, and type of items purchased. These and other factors are
analyzed by computer to rank and segment customers to determine those most
likely to purchase products offered in the Company's catalogs. The data base
contains information with respect to approximately 19,400,000 people,
approximately 3,200,000 of whom have placed orders with the Company during the
last fiscal year. The Company derives a small portion of its revenue from the
rental of its customer list to direct mail marketers and other organizations.
The Company also has a Special Markets division, which makes sales of premium
and incentive products, and sells to the wholesale market. The Company also
operates a chain of outlet stores which offers Lillian Vernon merchandise.

 The following table reflects the Company's history in the areas of
circulation of its catalogs, number of orders received and average revenue per
order received, over the last five fiscal years.

Catalogs and Products

 The Company's catalogs are designed to capture the reader's interest
through the use of distinctive covers, colorful product presentations and
product descriptions that highlight significant features. The catalogs are
created and produced by the Company's in-house creative staff, which includes
designers, writers and production assistants. The Company also hires free-lance
designers and photographers, as needed. The combination of in-house and
free-lance staff enables the Company to maintain both quality control and
flexibility in the production of its catalogs.

 The Company varies the quantity of its catalog mailings based on the
selling season, anticipated revenue per catalog, the price of paper and its
capacity to process and fill orders. In the first half of fiscal 1997, the
Company reduced catalog circulation due to substantially higher paper costs.
During the second half of fiscal 1997 the Company experienced lower paper prices
and increased catalog circulation for its busy fall selling season. In fiscal
1997, the Company produced 29 different catalog editions.

- --------------------

(1) "Number of catalogs mailed" includes catalog circulation to the extent
 that related orders are received in that fiscal year.

(2) "Average revenue per order received" is not reduced for
 refunds, nor does it include shipping and handling or
 applicable state sales tax remittance.

Merchandise offered by the Company includes gifts, holiday products,
toys and children's products, personal and home accessories, kitchen and
houseware products, gardening and outdoor products. The Company employs a staff
of experienced buyers, who seek reliable sources for what the Company believes
to be unique, quality merchandise. The buyers attend numerous domestic and
international trade and merchandise shows, study merchandising trends and review
the performance of merchandise previously offered. The Company also uses both
its creative staff and free-lance artists to develop distinctive designs for
many of its products, which the Company copyrights and has manufactured to its
specifications. The Company provides free monogramming and full name
personalization on many of the products it sells. In the past fiscal year,
products which can be personalized or which were manufactured to the Company's
exclusive design specifications accounted for about half of the products offered
by the Company.

 Private Sale catalogs are primarily used to sell merchandise
overstocks and deleted products, and are generally mailed only to customers in
the Company's data base.

 The Company's Lilly's Kids catalogs feature toys, games, baby
products, room decor and fashion accessories for children.

3

The Company's Christmas Memories catalogs are targeted to the
Christmas season and offer ornaments, holiday decor, gifts, cards and many
unique and exclusive products.

 The Company's Welcome to an Organized Home and its recently introduced
Neat Ideas catalogs, offer a variety of home decor, organizational products and
housewares.

 The Company's Personalized Gift catalogs primarily feature gift items,
all offered with available personalization.

 Lillian Vernon's Kitchen catalogs offer products which include
cookware, dinnerware, gourmet accessories, cutlery, glassware, flatware and
gifts, many of them exclusive to this catalog.

 The Company has conducted limited test marketing of certain of its
catalogs in Japan. The Company is presently evaluating the results of the tests,
and is formulating further test market plans for the Japanese market.

 The Company offers a deferred billing program to its customers, in
which it agrees to charge the customers' credit cards for the full amount of
their purchase at a future date specified in each catalog. The Company does not
charge interest to the customers who participate in the deferred billing
program.

 All products sold, including personalized products, are
unconditionally guaranteed. An unsatisfied customer may return any product, even
if personalized, for any reason. The dollar value of refunds requested by
customers under the guarantee in fiscal 1997 was approximately 4.3 of revenues.

 The Company purchases its products from approximately 1,000 suppliers.
Approximately 78 of the items sold by the Company are purchased abroad,
predominantly from manufacturers located in Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Peoples'
Republic of China, Italy, India and Germany. Most purchase orders are
denominated in U.S. dollars. Although no manufacturer is individually material
to the Company's operations, the Company buys significant quantities through
several Far East trading companies which utilize multiple manufacturers. Also,
the Company buys approximately 7 of its purchases through one Far Eastern
buying agent, which acts as the Company's representative in its dealings with
many different manufacturers in the Peoples' Republic of China and Hong Kong. As
a result of its reliance upon foreign suppliers, the Company is subject to the
risks of doing business abroad. To date, the Company has experienced no material
disruptions.

Marketing

 The Company maintains a proprietary customer data base containing
information with respect to approximately 19,400,000 customers, gift recipients
and people who have requested its catalogs, approximately 3,200,000 of whom have
placed orders with the Company during the last fiscal year. In addition, the
Company rents from and exchanges lists or specific portions of lists with direct
marketers and other organizations in an attempt to gain new customers. Over
175,000,000 catalogs were mailed in fiscal 1997, of which approximately 82 were
mailed to people whose names were in the Company's proprietary data base and
approximately 18 were mailed to prospects derived from rented lists.

 The Company believes that its ability to analyze its computerized data
base, as well as rented lists, and to select recipients for a particular mailing
are significant factors in its growth. The Company analyzes various factors
(e.g., frequency of order, date of last order, order size, type of products
purchased and demographic data) to rank its customer and prospect groups in
order to target its catalog mailings to those most likely to purchase its
merchandise. The Company updates its data base to include new customers and
eliminate non-responders. The Company does not engage in unresearched,
speculative mailings.

List Rental

 The Company derives a small portion of its revenue from the rental of
its data base to direct mail marketers and other organizations, and from the
placement of advertisements for other companies' products in its outgoing
packages.

Order Fulfillment and Distribution

 Orders for merchandise are received by mail, telephone, fax, and via
the Internet. Orders are received and processed at the Company's National
Distribution Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Customer Service operations are
also conducted at this facility. The Company also operated a temporary telephone
order call center in New Rochelle, New York during its peak selling season. The
Company receives telephone orders on a 24-hour basis, seven days a week, with
orders generally entered directly into the computer. Mail orders are opened,
compared to payments, batched and entered into computer terminals. The Company
uses its own data processing personnel to enter mail and telephone orders, as
well as service bureaus to enter telephone orders on an as-needed basis. During
fiscal 1997, the Company continued upgrading its computer capacity to enable it
to handle an increase in telephone orders.

 All orders are processed, packed and shipped at the Company's National
Distribution Center. Approximately 52 of customer orders are shipped by United
Parcel Service, with nearly all other orders

 5

being sent by the U.S. Postal Service. The Company also offers Federal Express 
delivery as an option to its customers, for an extra charge.

 The Company's newly expanded National Distribution Center, an 821,000
square foot facility located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, is owned and operated
by the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Lillian Vernon Fulfillment Services,
Inc. All of the Company's distribution, and a majority of its warehousing
activities, are conducted at this facility. The National Distribution Center is
generally operated on a five-day-a-week basis, except during the Holiday season,
when, depending upon demand, it may operate on a six or seven-day-a-week,
three-shift basis. Personalization of products is done at the Company's National
Distribution Center. The Company also owns a 154,000 square foot building in
Virginia Beach used for additional distribution and warehousing space.

 The Company continually assesses the need to upgrade the capacity of 
its distribution facilities. (See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.")

Paper and Mailing Costs

 The Company expends significant amounts on paper in the production of
its catalogs. The Company also uses substantial amounts of packing supplies and
corrugated paper for boxes in which it ships its products. In fiscal 1997, the
Company spent approximately 31.2 million in total paper costs and
approximately 53.3 million in mailing catalogs and packages to its customers.
In recent years, the U.S. Postal Service has increased its rates for both the
mailing of catalogs and packages. The last postage increase in January 1995,
increased the postage rate paid by the Company by 14 . In July 1996, Postal
Classification Reform was implemented, which resulted in the Company paying
approximately 4 lower postal rates in fiscal 1997 as compared with the previous
fiscal year. No assurance can be given that postal rates will not increase in
the future. United Parcel Service has also increased its rates, with increases
occurring in February of 1995, 1996 and 1997. The price of paper is dependent
upon supply and demand in the marketplace. In fiscal 1996, the supply was
extremely tight, and the price of paper rose significantly. The Company began
fiscal 1997 with an inventory of paper which it had purchased earlier, at prices
substantially higher than the then prevailing rate. This increased the Company's
cost of doing business and caused the Company to strategically reduce catalog
circulation in the first half of fiscal 1997. The Company experienced lower
paper prices in the second half of the fiscal year and increased catalog
circulation for its busy fall selling season. While the Company has been able to
recover a portion of these cost increases through an increase in shipping and
handling charges, a reduction in the dimensions and weight of the catalogs,
circulation adjustments and improved efficiencies in shipping, the Company's
fiscal 1996 and 1997 earnings have been negatively affected by the higher costs
of

 6

paper. While the Company cannot estimate the magnitude of future paper and 
postage increases or decreases, such changes may impact the Company's future 
earnings. (See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations.")

Merchandise Overstocks

 The Company sells its overstocks to its customers at reduced prices,
primarily through its Private Sale catalogs, its outlet stores and through
special offers made to customers placing orders by telephone and online.

Seasonality

 The Company's business is seasonal. Historically, a substantial
portion of the Company's revenues and net income have been realized during its
third and fourth fiscal quarters, which encompass the period September through
February. Revenues and net income have been lower during its first and second
fiscal quarters, comprising the period March through August. The Company
believes this is the general pattern associated with the mail order and retail
industries. Further discussion of the effect of seasonality upon revenues and
income is contained in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations".

Government Regulations

 The Company must comply with Federal, state and local laws affecting
its business. In particular, the Company is subject to Federal Trade Commission
regulations governing the Company's advertising and trade practices and Consumer
Product Safety Commission regulations governing the standards its products,
particularly toys, must meet. While the Company believes it is presently in
compliance with such regulations, in the event of noncompliance, the Company may
be subject to cease and desist orders, injunctive proceedings, civil fines and
other penalties. To date, such governmental regulations have not had a material
adverse effect on the Company. On occasion, products offered by the Company have
been subject to voluntary recall; however, no such recall has had a material
adverse effect on the Company.

 The United States and the other countries in which the Company's
products are manufactured may, from time to time, impose new or adjust existing
quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions, with the result that the
Company's operations and its ability to continue to import merchandise at
required levels could be adversely affected. The Company cannot now predict the
likelihood of any such events occurring or the effect on its business of any
such event.

 A number of the Company's products are purchased from sources located
in Hong Kong. On July 1, 1997, Hong Kong's status as a

 7

British Crown Colony will end, with its rule reverting to the Peoples' Republic
of China. After assessing the situation, the Company does not anticipate any
disruptions in its sourcing of merchandise; however, no assurance can be given
that such change will not adversely affect the Company.

 In the past, various states had taken action to require mail order
retailers to collect sales tax from residents in their states, even if the only
contact with such states is the mailing of catalogs into the states. On May 26,
1992, the Supreme Court ruled that state governments could not require out of
state mail order companies to collect and remit sales and use taxes without
Congressional authorization. Since that time, bills have periodically been
introduced in Congress which would allow states to impose sales tax collection
responsibility upon mail order companies. Management is unable to predict the
likelihood of Congress passing such legislation, and whether the Company will,
in the future, be required to collect sales and use taxes in the various states.
The collection of sales tax by mail order companies could have an adverse effect
on the Company's competitive position by increasing both its cost of doing
business and the effective price of its products to its customers. Although the
Company believes the aforementioned adverse effect will not be of a material
nature, the Company is unable, at this time, to predict the impact of the
collection of sales tax on its financial position and results of operations. The
Company does not expect that the collection of sales tax would have a material
effect on its liquidity.

Trademarks and Copyrights

 The Company has federally registered service marks and/or logos for
"Lillian Vernon" and many of its catalog titles. In the opinion of the
management of the Company, the service mark "Lillian Vernon" is of significant
value because of its market recognition as a result of many years of use and the
significant quantity of catalogs circulated.

 The Company also possesses numerous copyrights and/or trademarks on
its products, none of which individually is material to the Company.

Employees

 As of February 22, 1997, the Company and its subsidiaries employed
approximately 1,350 employees. During the peak Holiday season, the Company
employs approximately 4,000 employees including seasonal employees working in
the telephone order, order processing and distribution areas. Employees are not
covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company considers its employee
relations to be satisfactory.

8

Competition

 The retail business in general, and mail order in particular, is
highly competitive. The Company competes primarily with other mail order
catalogs and secondarily with retail stores, including specialty shops and
department stores, many of which have substantially greater financial resources
than the Company. The Company competes on the basis of its product selection,
personalization, its proprietary customer list, the quality of its customer
service and its unconditional guarantee. Although the Company attempts to market
products not available elsewhere, many products similar to those marketed by the
Company can be purchased through other mail order catalogs or in retail stores.

Item 2. Properties

 The Company's corporate headquarters and administrative offices are
located in a 41,000 square foot building in New Rochelle, New York. This
facility is leased from David C. and Fred P. Hochberg, under a net sub-lease
expiring on July 30, 1998, with a present annual net rental of 429,788. David
C. Hochberg is an officer, director and a principal stockholder of the Company.
Fred P. Hochberg, a former officer and director, is a significant stockholder of
the Company. The terms of such net lease provide that the Company is also
responsible for the payment of all real estate taxes, insurance and other
expenses associated with the operation and maintenance of the premises,
including structural repairs.

 In fiscal 1997, the Company expanded its National Distribution Center
by an additional 335,000 square feet to 821,000 square feet. The facility is
located on approximately 62 acres in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The facility,
which became fully operational during the summer of 1988, is owned and operated
by the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Lillian Vernon Fulfillment Services,
Inc. The Company financed the construction and equipping of this expansion
primarily through internally generated cash. (See "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations").

 All distribution and the majority of its warehousing
activities, as well as mail order processing, customer service and telemarketing
activities, are conducted at the Virginia Beach facility.

 The Company also owns a 154,000 square foot building in Virginia Beach
which it utilizes for additional distribution and warehousing space.

 The Company leases, on a year-to-year basis, 11,000 square feet in an
office building in New Rochelle, New York, which provides additional telephone
order facilities for its peak selling season and administrative office space.

 9

The Company leases twelve retail locations, which serve as outlet
stores, in the states of Virginia, New York and Delaware. The typical retail
store is approximately 3,000 square feet, with leases expiring from fiscal 1998
through fiscal 2003, and various renewal options through fiscal 2008.

 The Company leases additional outlet store locations on a short-term
basis, particularly during the holiday season.

 The Company believes that its facilities are adequate and that its
properties are in good condition.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

 Other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business, no
legal proceedings to which the Company is a party, or to which any of its
properties are subject, are pending or are known to be contemplated, and the
Company knows of no material legal proceedings, pending or threatened, or
judgments entered against any Director or Officer of the Company in his or her
capacity as such. See "Government Regulations" for additional discussion.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

 None.

May of 1992. Since September 1, 1994, a quarterly dividend of seven cents .07)
per share has been paid to stockholders. The Board of Directors intends to
continue to declare and pay a quarterly cash dividend. The amount of any such
dividends will depend on the Company's earnings, financial position, capital
requirements and other relevant factors.

 On October 10, 1995, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to
purchase up to 1 million shares of its common stock in the open market from time
to time, subject to market conditions. As of May 15, 1997, the Company has
purchased 385,100 shares at a total cost of approximately 5.1 million.

Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal 1996

 Revenues for fiscal 1997 were 240.1 million, an increase of 1.9
million, or 0.8 over fiscal 1996. Sales grew marginally, principally because
catalog circulation for the year was reduced by about 2 compared to fiscal
1996. Circulation was reduced in the first half of the fiscal year because
higher paper costs required the Company to more closely target its circulation
to those customers whose purchases were expected to cover the higher costs of
the catalogs. Average revenue per catalog rose by approximately 3 , driven by an
increase in average order value of almost 7 . The volume of orders shipped
decreased by approximately 5 .

 Product and delivery costs include the cost of merchandise sold, the
cost of receiving, filling and shipping orders, reduced by shipping and handling
revenue collected from customers. These costs of 110.4 million increased .5
million, or 0.4 in fiscal 1997 as compared to fiscal 1996. As a percentage of
revenues, product and delivery costs decreased slightly from 46.1 in fiscal
1996 to 46.0 in fiscal 1997. Product profit margin improved significantly,
principally because less inventory liquidation was needed. The Company's postage
expense to customers was positively impacted by the expansion of the Company's
National Distribution Center, which eliminated some capacity constraints of the
prior year. These cost reductions were partially offset by less shipping and
handling revenue, which was lower because less orders were shipped, and because
of certain marketing promotions run by the Company.

 Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were 121.5
million in fiscal 1997, compared to 119.6 million in fiscal

 13

1996, an increase of 1.9 million, or 1.6 . The largest component of these
expenses are the costs of producing, printing and distributing the Company's
catalogs. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses increased from 50.3 in
fiscal 1996 to 50.6 in fiscal 1997.

 The ratio of catalog costs to revenues improved in fiscal 1997, even
though the cost of producing an average catalog was slightly higher. The ratio
improved because of a rise in average revenue per catalog. High paper costs
continued to be reflected in the Company's catalog expense, particularly in the
core catalogs, while the prices of its specialty catalog paper improved during
the latter part of the fiscal year.

 Paper prices have declined, and the Company has future commitments for
paper at favorable prices. Postal costs to mail the Company's catalogs also
declined in the second half of fiscal 1997 because of Postal Classification
Reform regulations. The Company does not expect that any postal rate increases
will have a significant impact on fiscal 1998 earnings. Lower paper and postage
costs will enable the Company to reduce its cost structure, and to expand
circulation in fiscal 1998.

 Other elements of SG&A expense besides catalog costs rose, principally
because the Company made investments in staff in the executive, merchandising
and creative areas. In addition, growth in the Company's Special Markets
division, which sells to other businesses, and an increase in the number of
outlet stores, were major factors affecting this increase.

 Interest income in fiscal 1997 was .6 million, as compared to 1.3
million in fiscal 1996. The decrease of .7 million was the result of a lower
average investment balance, because of higher expenditures required for
expansion of the Company's National Distribution Center. Interest expense
increased by .1 million in fiscal 1997 as compared to fiscal 1996 because of
short term borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility during
fiscal 1997.

 The Company's effective income tax rate in fiscal 1997 was 34.0 as
compared to 32.0 in fiscal 1996, principally due to higher tax deductions for
charitable contributions in fiscal 1996.

Fiscal 1996 and Fiscal 1995

 Revenues for fiscal 1996 were 238.2 million, an increase of 16.0
million, or 7.2 , over fiscal 1995. The increase in revenues was primarily
attributable to an increase of approximately 10.5 in the average revenue per
order. The volume of orders shipped decreased by approximately 1 . Catalog
circulation was approximately 1 higher than in fiscal 1995.

 14

Product and delivery costs of 109.9 million increased 11.6 million,
or 11.8 in fiscal 1996 as compared to fiscal 1995. As a percentage of revenues,
these costs increased from 44.2 in fiscal 1995 to 46.1 in fiscal 1996. Gross
margin percentage on products sold declined because a greater portion of sales
came from lower margin sources. Also, the Company expanded its free gift
promotion in fiscal 1996, which contributed to an increase in the cost of goods
sold, and the decline in gross margin. Gross margin also declined in the
Company's outlet stores due to more in-store promotions, and in the Special
Markets division, which primarily sells to other businesses. The Company's cost
of order fulfillment rose in fiscal 1996 principally because of increases in the
costs of packaging materials, postal and UPS rates, as well as additional costs
caused by physical constraints of the Company's Distribution Center. A backlog
of unshipped orders resulted in additional costs for expedited delivery before
Christmas, and for related customer service inquiries. An expansion of the
Company's Distribution Center, which commenced in fiscal 1996, was completed in
fiscal 1997. The increase in fulfillment costs was largely offset by an increase
in the shipping and handling fees charged to customers. After the effect of
these product and delivery cost increases, higher sales contributed 4.4 million
more toward catalog costs and overhead, as compared to fiscal 1995.

 Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were 119.6
million in fiscal 1996, compared to 105.2 million in fiscal 1995, an increase
of 14.4 million, or 13.7 . The largest component of these expenses are the
costs of producing, printing and distributing the Company's catalogs. As a
percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses increased from 47.4 in fiscal 1995 to
50.3 in fiscal 1996, driven by a rise in the ratio of catalog costs to
revenues. Both the dollars and percentage of revenues rose principally because
of higher paper prices and U.S. Postal rates. Although the Company employed a
variety of techniques to reduce its costs, such as changes in circulation, page
counts, and paper weight, higher paper and postal costs negatively impacted
fiscal 1996 pretax earnings by approximately 12 million. The Company achieved
higher revenue per catalog in fiscal 1996, which offset a portion of the
increase as a percentage of revenues. Other elements of SG&A besides catalog
costs declined as a percentage of revenues.

 Interest income in fiscal 1996 was 1.3 million, as compared to 1.2
million in fiscal 1995. The increase of .1 million was the result of higher
interest rates. The average investment balance declined in fiscal 1996
principally because of higher expenditures required for catalog costs. Interest
expense declined by .1 million in fiscal 1996 as compared to fiscal 1995
because of scheduled debt repayments.

 Fiscal 1996 earnings reflect a non-recurring pretax charge of
 921,000 for the costs of a terminated merger agreement. See Note
11 to Financial Statements.
 15

The Company's effective income tax rate in fiscal 1996 was 32.0 as
compared to 28.8 in fiscal 1995. The fiscal 1995 effective tax rate was reduced
by a favorable settlement of an outstanding tax matter, and the related reversal
of tax reserves not ultimately needed. See Note 2 to Financial Statements.

Seasonality

 The Company's business is seasonal. Historically, a substantial portion
of the Company's revenue and net income has been realized during the third and
fourth fiscal quarters, which encompass the period September through February.
Revenue and net income have been lower during the first and second fiscal
quarters, comprising the period March through August. The Company believes this
is the general pattern associated with the mail order and retail industries.

 Because of slower demand for its products in the first half of its
fiscal year, the Company incurred a cumulative net loss during the first six
months of fiscal 1997, 1996, and 1995. Due to these seasonal factors, management
expects to incur a loss for the first half of fiscal 1998 as well.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

 The Company's balance sheet and liquidity are strong. At the end of
fiscal 1997, cash and cash equivalents totalled 22.7 million; the current ratio
was 4.7:1; stockholders' equity totalled 114.3 million; and debt obligations
(including current maturities) represented 2.5 of equity.

 In fiscal 1997, the Company generated 13.0 million of cash from
operating activities. A significant contributing factor to the Company's
positive operating cash flow was the utilization of the large, higher-priced
paper inventory from the prior year. The Company used 1.5 million of funds for
long-term debt repayments, and generated 1.1 million from the sale of common
stock through its employee stock option and purchase plans.

 Capital spending in fiscal 1997 totalled 10.3 million. Expenditures of
 8.5 million were made as part of the expansion of the Company's National
Distribution Center. The expansion project, consisting principally of a 335,000
square foot addition to the building, and related warehousing, shipping and
computer equipment, cost approximately 14 million (including the fiscal 1996
expenditures), and was completed in August of 1996. Although the Company may
find it necessary to expand the capacity of the National Distribution Center in
the future, the Company has made no significant commitments for capital spending
in fiscal 1998. The other major capital expenditures in fiscal 1997 were made to
upgrade the Company's computer equipment, and its distribution center machinery
and equipment.

 16

The Company entered into a 42 million four-year revolving credit
facility in August 1996, which can be used to finance working capital needs,
fixed assets, and up to 12 million of inventory letters of credit. At the
Company's option, up to 20 million of the facility can be converted into term
loans, with maturity dates no later than 2003. Interest is payable at LIBOR plus
50 basis points, prime rate, bankers' acceptance rate plus 50 basis points, or a
fixed rate, at the Company's option. The credit facility is unsecured, and the
Company is subject to financial covenants principally relating to its working
capital, net worth, interest coverage ratio and capital spending restrictions.
The new credit facility replaced previous facilities totaling 15 million which
the Company had maintained with two banks.

 The Company has paid quarterly cash dividends since May 1992, increased
its quarterly dividend from .05 to .07 per share in September 1994, and
anticipates continuing to pay cash dividends to its stockholders in the future.
The amount of any such dividends will depend on the Company's earnings,
financial position, capital requirements, and other relevant factors. Dividends
in fiscal 1997 totalled 2.7 million, or .28 per share.

 On October 10, 1995, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to
purchase up to 1 million shares of its common stock in the open market from time
to time, subject to market conditions. During the fiscal year ended February 22,
1997, the Company purchased 259,700 shares at a total cost of 3.3 million.
Shares repurchased under the plan from inception through February 22, 1997
total 384,500, at a cost of 5.1 million.

 The Company believes that its cash flow from operations, current
investment balance, and credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its
operating needs.

Effects of Inflation and Foreign Exchange

 The Company is generally able to reflect cost increases and decreases
resulting from the effects of inflation and foreign currency fluctuations in its
selling prices. In addition, most foreign purchase orders are denominated in
U.S. dollars. Accordingly, the results of operations for the periods discussed
have not been significantly affected by these factors.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

 The Company follows the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees", in accounting for stock-based compensation
arrangements. Under the guidelines of Opinion 25, compensation cost for
stock-based employee compensation plans is recognized based on the difference,
if any, between the quoted market price of the stock on the date of grant and
the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The Company has

 17

implemented the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" in fiscal 
1997, but has retained its current accounting method.

 In the first quarter of fiscal 1996, the Company adopted Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 - "Disclosures about Fair Value of 
Financial Instruments". The fair value of the Company's financial instruments 
does not materially differ from their carrying values.

 Effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company will be
required to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings
Per Share", which will require the Company to state a dual presentation of basic
and diluted earnings per share on its Statements of Income. The basic
calculation replaces the calculation of primary earnings per share, and is not
expected to have a material impact on reported earnings per share.

LILLIAN VERNON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 General
 Lillian Vernon Corporation is a direct mail specialty catalog company,
concentrating on the marketing of gift, household, gardening, kitchen, Christmas
and children's products.

 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lillian
Vernon Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Lillian Vernon Fulfillment
Services, Inc., Lillian Vernon International, Ltd., and LVC Retail Corporation
(the "Company"). All material intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated.

 The Company has a fiscal year consisting of 52 or 53 weeks ending on
the last Saturday in February. Under this policy, fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995
consisted of 52 weeks.

 Cash Equivalents
 Cash equivalents, for purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, consist
principally of municipal securities, U.S. Treasury securities and commercial
paper, with remaining maturities at acquisition of less than three months. In
the first quarter of fiscal 1995, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115 - "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities". Under SFAS No. 115, the Company's investments,
totalling 23.3 million as of February 22, 1997, are classified as
held-to-maturity securities, and as such, are stated at amortized cost, which
approximates market value. The adoption of SFAS No. 115 did not have a material
effect on the Company's financial statements.

 Merchandise Inventories
 Merchandise inventories are principally stated at the lower of average
cost or market, determined by the retail inventory method.

 Catalog Costs
 Catalog costs are deferred and amortized over the estimated productive
life of the catalog, generally three months. Such deferred costs are considered
direct-response advertising in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position No.
93-7, "Reporting on Advertising Costs", and are reflected as long-term assets in
the accompanying Balance Sheets.

 Capitalized Software Costs
 Direct costs of developing new software applications are capitalized
and are being amortized over five years. Amortization of capitalized software
costs totalled 320,000 in fiscal 1997, 378,000 in fiscal 1996, and 435,000 in
fiscal 1995.

F-6

Capitalized software costs, net of accumulated amortization, are included in
other assets, and amounted to 429,000 and 681,000 at February 22, 1997 and
February 24, 1996, respectively.

 Depreciation and Amortization
 Depreciation is provided on the straight line method for assets placed
in service over estimated useful lives of approximately 30 and 8 years for
buildings and building improvements, respectively, and for other property, over
estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements and
assets under capital leases are amortized over approximately 15 years.

 Income Taxes
 Deferred income taxes arise from differences in the timing of income
and expense recognition for financial and income tax reporting purposes.
Deferred income taxes are computed on the differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of the assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.

 Per Share Data
 Net income per common share is computed by dividing the net income for
the period by the sum of the weighted average number of outstanding shares and
share equivalents (if the addition of such share equivalents has a materially
dilutive effect). The Company's common share equivalents consist of stock
options issued to key employees and directors. For the years ended February 22,
1997 and February 24, 1996, the number of common share equivalents outstanding
did not result in a materially dilutive effect on the net income per share
computation. For fiscal 1995, however, such common share equivalents did result
in material dilution, and therefore were reflected in the net income per share
calculation on the Statement of Income.

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 In the first quarter of fiscal 1996, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 107 "Disclosures about Fair Value of
Financial Instruments." The fair value of the Company's financial instruments
does not materially differ from their carrying values.

 Use of Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

F-7

Stock-Based Employee Compensation
 The Company follows the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees," in accounting for stock-based compensation
arrangements. Under these guidelines, compensation cost for stock-based employee
compensation plans is recognized based on the difference, if any, between the
quoted market price of the stock on the date of grant and the amount an employee
must pay to acquire the stock. The Company implemented the disclosure
requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation," in fiscal 1997, but will continue its current
accounting method for stock-based employee compensation, as permitted by the
Statement. See Note 9.

 Reclassifications
 Certain reclassifications have been made in the prior year financial
statements to conform with the fiscal 1997 presentation.

 New Accounting Standards
 In fiscal 1997, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of." The adoption of SFAS 121 did not
have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

 In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share." The
standard revises the computation and presentation of earnings per share and will
be adopted by the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998. The Company does
not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on reported
earnings per share.

 F-8

The exercise of non-qualified stock options and the vesting of restricted stock
(see Note 9) result in a tax deduction to the Company equivalent to the taxable
compensation recognized by the individuals. For accounting purposes, the tax
benefit of these deductions is credited directly to additional paid-in capital.
These amounts totalled 656,000, 367,000, and 171,000 for fiscal 1997, 1996,
and 1995, respectively.

The Company's effective income tax rate is reconciled to the U.S.
federal statutory tax rate as follows:

During fiscal 1996, expired charitable contribution carryforwards of 1,079,000
resulted in a reduction in deferred tax assets of 416,000. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1995, the Company favorably settled an outstanding tax matter
that resulted in a one-time reduction in income tax expense of 740,000,
including the reversal of excess tax reserves.

The deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities recorded on the balance
sheets are as follows (dollars in thousands):

carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes, which expire from fiscal 1999 to
2002.

3. CREDIT FACILITIES

 The Company entered into a 42 million four-year revolving credit
facility in August 1996 with two banks. This credit facility can be used for
general corporate purposes, including working capital needs, capital
expenditures, and up to 12 million of inventory letters of credit. At the
Company's option, up to 20 million of the facility can be converted into term
loans, with maturity dates no later than 2003. Interest is payable at LIBOR plus
50 basis points, prime rate, bankers' acceptance rate plus 50 basis points, or a
fixed rate, at the Company's option. The credit facility is unsecured, and the
Company is subject to various financial covenants principally relating to its
working capital, net worth, interest coverage ratio and capital spending
restrictions. The new credit facility replaced previous unused credit facilities
totalling 15 million, which were in effect in fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1995,
bearing interest at the prime rate.

 In fiscal 1997, the Company incurred commitment fees on the new credit
facility ranging from 5 basis points on the letters of credit to 20 basis points
on the available revolving credit line. In fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1995, the
Company incurred commitment fees of approximately 20 and 25 basis points,
respectively. During the year, the maximum amount outstanding under the new
revolving credit agreement was 12.5 million (excluding letters of credit).
Interest expense related to these borrowings was approximately 143,000. No
amounts were outstanding under the Company's credit facilities as of February
22, 1997 and February 24, 1996.

 The Company had outstanding letters of credit approximating 4,773,000
and 5,227,000 as of February 22, 1997 and February 24, 1996, respectively, for
the purchase of inventory in the normal course of business.

 The Company leases its New Rochelle, New York corporate headquarters

the partners of which are stockholders of the Company. The leased asset consists
of land and a building with a cost of 1,262,000 and accumulated

 F-11

amortization of 1,144,000 as of February 22, 1997. The lease expires July 30,

and all real estate taxes, insurance, and certain other costs.

 The Company has operating lease agreements for certain computer and
other equipment used in its operations and for its outlet store locations, with
existing lease terms ranging from fiscal 1998 through fiscal 2003, and various
renewal options through fiscal 2008. Most of the store leases also provide for
payment of common charges such as maintenance and real estate taxes. Seven
stores require the payment of additional rent based upon a percentage of sales.
Minimum rental payments required under these agreements are as follows (dollars
in thousands):

 11,000 in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively, for contingent rentals
based upon a percentage of outlet store sales.

8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

 The Company maintains a profit sharing plan for the benefit of all
employees who meet certain minimum service requirements. The Company's profit
sharing contribution is discretionary, as determined by the Board of Directors.
Employees fully vest in their profit sharing account balance after seven years.
The authorized profit sharing contributions for fiscal 1997, 1996, and 1995 were
 500,000, 450,000, and 500,000, respectively.

 The Company's profit sharing plan includes an employee contribution and
employer matching contribution (401k) feature. Under the 401k feature of the
plan, eligible employees may make pre-tax contributions up to 10 of their
annual compensation. Employee contributions of up to 6 of compensation are
currently matched by the Company at a rate of 50 . The matching contribution is
made with Company stock. Employees are 100 vested in their pre-tax
contributions at all times, and become fully vested in the employer matching
contribution after two years of service. The Company's matching contributions to
the plan for fiscal 1997, 1996, and 1995 were 425,000, 398,000, and 355,000
respectively.

 F-12

The Company has deferred compensation agreements to provide additional
retirement benefits for certain principal stockholders of the Company. The
deferred compensation agreements also provide for death benefits to be paid to
each party's beneficiary. The Company has purchased life insurance policies to
fund, in part, the payment of these benefits. Amounts expensed in connection
with these agreements were 366,000 in fiscal 1997, 150,000 in fiscal 1996 and
 600,000 in fiscal 1995.

9. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS

 At February 22, 1997, the Company had three stock-based compensation
plans, which are described below. The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related
Interpretations in accounting for its stock compensation plans. Accordingly, no
compensation cost has been recognized for its non-qualified stock options
granted and for shares issued through its employee stock purchase plan.
Compensation cost has been charged against income for the issuance of restricted
stock during Fiscal 1997; net income was reduced by approximately 68,000. If
compensation cost for the Company's non-qualified stock options issued and
shares purchased through its stock purchase plan had been determined based on
the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with
the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, the
Company's net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the
proforma amounts indicated below:

 The Company has a Performance Unit, Restricted Stock,
Non-Qualified Option and Incentive Stock Option Plan, and a total of 2,000,000
shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance thereunder. The Company
has granted and sold shares of restricted stock to certain executives at a
nominal price per share. In connection with the issuance of restricted stock,
unearned compensation is recorded 197,400 in fiscal 1997) and amortized over
the respective vesting periods. In fiscal 1997, restricted shares were granted,
and vest as follows:

The Company has also granted non-qualified stock options to employees. Such
options have been granted at market value, vest within three years from the date
of grant and expire within ten years from the date of grant. The fair value of
each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 2.0 ,
expected volatility of 29.1 , risk-free interest rate of 6.3 , expected option
term of five years, and a forfeiture rate of 25 .

11. TERMINATED MERGER AGREEMENT

 On June 13, 1995, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with an
affiliate of Freeman Spogli & Co., Incorporated. Pursuant to the Agreement, the
Company would have been recapitalized through a merger transaction in which all
of the shares of common stock of the Company, other than certain shares held by
Lillian Vernon and David Hochberg, would have been converted into the right to
receive 19 per share in cash. The Merger Agreement was terminated on September
18, 1995 when it was determined that financing for the transaction at the 19
per share price could not be obtained. The costs of the terminated merger of
 921,000 have been recorded in the fiscal 1996 financial statements. These costs
consisted principally of legal, accounting and filing fees.

12. STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

 On October 10, 1995, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to
purchase up to 1 million shares of its common stock in the open market from time
to time, subject to market conditions. As of February 22, 1997, the Company had
purchased 384,500 shares at a total cost of 5,065,000.

 F-16

13. NONCASH FINANCING ACTIVITIES

During fiscal 1995, 1996, and 1997, certain non-qualified stock options were
exercised by stock plan participants using non-cash consideration. The Company
has received shares of its Common Stock in consideration for the exercise price
and for income taxes required to be withheld. Such stock is reported as Treasury
Stock on the Balance Sheets. The number of Treasury Stock shares accepted as
consideration for such stock option exercises was determined by the market price
of the Company's common stock on the exercise dates. These transactions, for
purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, are deemed to be non-cash financing
activities and, as such, have not been reflected on the Statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors of
 Lillian Vernon Corporation:

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lillian
Vernon Corporation and Subsidiaries as of February 22, 1997 and February 24,
1996, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
February 22, 1997. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Lillian
Vernon Corporation and Subsidiaries as of February 22, 1997 and February 24,
1996 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended February 22, 1997 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
