PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

KEMET Corporation and its subsidiaries ("KEMET" or the "Company")is the 
largest manufacturer of solid tantalum ("tantalum") capacitors in the world 
and the second largest manufacturer of multilayer ceramic ("ceramic") 
capacitors in the United States. According to industry sources, tantalum and 
ceramic capacitors are the two fastest growing segments of the United States 
capacitor industry. During fiscal year 1998,KEMET shipped approximately 21.4 
billion capacitors and approximately 35,000 different types of capacitors; 
with "types" being distinguished by dielectric material, configuration, 
encapsulation, capacitance level and tolerance, performance characteristics, 
marking and packaging. Capacitors store, filter and regulate electrical 
energy and current flow and are found in virtually all electronic applications 
and products. The Company's capacitors are used in a wide variety of 
electronic applications, including communication systems, data processing 
equipment, personal computers, automotive electronic systems, and military and 
aerospace systems. KEMET markets its capacitors to a diverse and growing 
number of original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") as well as a worldwide 
network of distributors. KEMET's largest customers include Alcatel; Arrow; 
Compaq Computer; Ford Motor Company; General Motors Corporation; Hewlett- 
Packard Company; Lucent Technologies (formerly American Telephone & Telegraph 
Company); Motorola Inc.; SCI Systems, Inc.; Siemens; and TTI, Inc.

Since its divestiture from Union Carbide ("UCC") in December 1990, the Company 
has pursued one distinct vision: To establish a distinctive competence which 
differentiates KEMET as the unquestioned Best-In-Class supplier. The core 
values that support this vision are: Best Trained and Motivated People, 
Company-Wide Quality Concept (as evidenced by ISO 9000 and QS-9000 
registration at all of KEMET's manufacturing plants), an "Easy To Buy From" 
philosophy (supported by the Company's direct sales force and executed by 
KEMET's Key Account Teams), Lowest Cost Producer (by achieving significant 
production cost savings through the focused plant concept and the transfer to 
and expansion of manufacturing operations in Mexico where the Company can take 
advantage of 
lower overall costs) and Leading Edge of Technology (as evidenced by the 
Company's continued increase in expenditures for new product development and 
the design and development of new machinery and equipment).

Background of Company 

KEMET's operations began in 1926 as a business of Union Carbide Corporation 
("UCC") to manufacture component parts for vacuum tubes. As vacuum tubes were 
gradually replaced by solid-state transistors, the Company changed its 
manufacturing focus from vacuum tube parts to tantalum capacitors, and later 
added ceramic capacitors, to meet the expected need for capacitors in 
electronic circuit boards. The Company entered the market for tantalum 
capacitors in 1958 as one of approximately 25 United States manufacturers. By 
1966, the Company was the United States' market leader in tantalum 
capacitors, 
a position which it still holds in an industry consisting of four major 
tantalum capacitor manufacturers. In 1969, the Company began production of 
ceramic capacitors as one of approximately 35 United States manufacturers. 
Within five years, the Company was the second largest United States 
manufacturer of ceramic capacitors, a position which it still holds in a 
market consisting of five major capacitor manufacturers.

 3
The Company was formed in 1990 by certain members of the Company's current 
management, Citicorp Venture Capital, Ltd. ("CVC"), and other investors to 
acquire the outstanding common stock of KEMET Electronics Corporation from 
Union Carbide Corporation. 

Public Offerings and Recapitalization 

In October 1992, the Company completed an initial public offering of its 
Common Stock and a related recapitalization to simplify its capital 
structure. In
June 1993, the Company completed an additional public offering of Common
Stock and used the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness.

Stock Split

On September 6, 1995, the Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock 
split whereby one additional Common Share, par value .01, was issued for each 
common share outstanding to shareholders of record on September 13, 1995. All 
share and per share data appearing in the consolidated financial statements 
and notes thereto have been restated to reflect the stock split.

Refinancing of Outstanding Senior Debt

On October 18, 1996, the Company refinanced the entire balance of its 
outstanding revolving credit facility and swingline credit facility with new 
credit facilities totaling 175.0 million. These new credit facilities, each 
of which has a term of five years, include a 165.0 million revolving credit 
facility and a 10.0 million swingline credit facility. In May 1998, the 
Company sold 100 million of its Senior Notes due May 4, 2010.

Industry Description 

The Company estimates that worldwide capacitor consumption was approximately 
 14.9 billion in 1997, with tantalum and ceramic capacitors comprising 
approximately 35 . According to industry sources, in 1997 tantalum and 
ceramic capacitors accounted for approximately 65 of the 2.7 billion market 
for capacitors consumed in the United States and constitute the two fastest 
growing segments of the United States capacitor market. Capacitors store, 
filter and regulate electrical energy and current flow, and are one of the 
essential passive components used on circuit boards. Capacitors are found in 
virtually all electronic applications and products. Capacitors are used to 
alter the relationship of currents and voltages in a given electrical system, 
to filter 
or smooth out electrical signals where required, and to retard signals of low 
frequencies while permitting signals of higher frequencies to pass with 
minimal attenuation. Because of their fundamental nature and widespread 
application, demand for capacitors tends to reflect the general demand for 
electronic products, which has been growing over the past several years. 

Growth in the electronics market and corresponding growth in the capacitor 
market has been fueled by both the development of new electronic products, 
such as cellular phones, personal computers and electronic controls for 
engines and machinery, and increases in the electronic content of existing 
products, such 
as appliances, medical equipment and automobiles. For example, electronic 
circuit boards, and therefore capacitors, are now routinely integrated into 
automotive systems that until recently had been mainly mechanical in nature, 
including transmissions, brakes, ignitions and electronic fuel injection 
systems. Fluid monitors, pollution control systems and anti-theft devices 
also add to the electronic content and capacitor use in automobiles. 

 4
In response to the needs of OEMs to increase circuit board densities, decrease 
the size of electronic components and shift to more highly automated 
production techniques, the capacitor industry in general and KEMET in 
particular has increasingly shifted its manufacturing focus from traditional 
leaded capacitors toward surface-mount capacitors. In order to meet the 
increased demand for surface-mount capacitors the Company has invested 391.8 
million in capital expenditures during the past five fiscal years, a 
substantial portion of which was spent to expand surface-mount manufacturing 
capacity. Surface-mounting allows capacitors and other electronic components 
to be soldered directly to a circuit board, rather than having lead wires 
passed through holes to be 
soldered on the reverse side of a board. This results in greater 
manufacturing efficiency by allowing capacitors to be mounted on both sides of 
a circuit board. In addition, surface-mount capacitors are generally smaller 
than 
similar leaded capacitors and allow for higher circuit board density. 

Capacitors 

Capacitors are electronic components consisting of conducting materials 
separated by a dielectric or insulating material (such as tantalum, ceramic, 
aluminum, film, paper and mica), which allows a capacitor to interrupt the 
flow of electrical current. They are divided between leaded and surface-mount 
capacitors, describing the method by which the capacitors are attached to the 
circuit board. 

KEMET manufactures a full line of capacitors using two types of dielectrics, 
solid tantalum and multilayer ceramic. Most customers buy both tantalum and 
ceramic capacitors from the Company. The Company manufactures these types of 
capacitors in many different sizes and configurations. The Company produces 
leaded capacitors, which are attached to a circuit board using lead wires, and 
surface-mount capacitors, which are attached directly to the circuit board 
without lead wires. The Company is currently shipping approximately 88 
million capacitors each business day.

The choice of capacitor dielectric is driven by the engineering specifications 
and application of the component product into which the capacitor is 
incorporated. Product design engineers in the electronics industry typically 
select capacitors on the basis of capacitance levels, size and cost. Tantalum 
and ceramic capacitors continue to be the preferred dielectrics in new design 
applications, as compared to capacitors made of aluminum, film, mica, paper or 
ceramic disks. Tantalum and ceramic capacitors are commonly used in 
conjunction with integrated circuits, and are best suited for applications 
requiring lower to medium capacitance values. Generally, ceramic capacitors 
are more cost-effective at lower capacitance values, and tantalum capacitors 
are more cost-effective at higher capacitance values. 

Management believes that sales of tantalum and ceramic capacitors will 
continue to grow more rapidly than other types of capacitors in both the 
United States and worldwide markets because technological breakthroughs in 
electronics are regularly expanding the number and type of applications for 
these products. Both tantalum and ceramic capacitors each have special 
properties valuable for surface-mount applications. 

Leaded and Surface-Mount Capacitors 

The Company's capacitors can be divided into two general groups, leaded and 
surface-mount, based on the method by which the capacitor is attached to the 
circuit board. Despite the differences in configuration between leaded and 
surface-mount capacitors, both types of capacitors rely on similar technology. 

 5
The manufacture of the internal capacitor element is the same whether it is 
ultimately incorporated into a leaded or surface-mount capacitor. 
Consequently, much of the know-how and some of the capital equipment required 
to produce 
these products is common. The primary distinction between leaded and surface-
mount capacitors occurs in the assembly, testing and finishing stages, which 
utilize different equipment and processes. Surface-mount capacitors must be 
able to withstand temperatures up to 260 degrees C during circuit board 
assembly and are placed on circuit boards using high-speed automatic placement 
equipment. These requirements result in quality and process standards greater 
than those demanded for leaded components. 

The Company believes it has taken advantage of the growth of the surface-mount 
capacitor market and is an industry leader in designing and marketing surface-
mount capacitors. Demand has been gradually shifting from leaded to surface-
mount capacitors because surface-mount capacitors are more commonly 
incorporated in new product designs which rely on higher density circuit 
boards. As a result, worldwide sales of leaded capacitors have been declining 
over the past five years and have been offset by an increase in worldwide 
sales of surface-mount capacitors. Consequently, although KEMET intends to 
make further capital investments in surface-mount manufacturing capacity to 
serve 
the growing needs of its customers, the Company's results of operations and 
growth prospects could be adversely affected in the event that the Company 
does not continue to increase its sales and production of surface-mount 
capacitors. 

The following table shows the respective percentages of the Company's sales of 
surface-mount capacitors and leaded capacitors for the fiscal years ended 
March 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998.

Markets and Customers 

KEMET's products are sold to a variety of OEMs in a broad range of industries 
including the computer, communications, automotive, military and aerospace 
industries. Because of their fundamental nature and widespread application, 
demand for capacitors tends to reflect the demand for electronic products. The 
Company is not dependent on any one customer or group of related customers. 
Only a single customer has accounted for over 10 of the Company's net sales 
during fiscal year 1996, two customers in fiscal year 1997, and one customer
in fiscal year 1998. The Company's top 50 customers accounted for 
approximately 85 of the Company's net sales during fiscal year 1998. 
Preferred supplier and similar long-term relationships with OEMs accounted for 
approximately 56 of the Company's net sales in fiscal year 1996, fiscal year 
1997 and fiscal year 1988. 

 6
KEMET produced approximately 8 of its capacitors under military 
specification 
standards sold for both military and commercial uses during fiscal year 1998. 
The Company does not sell any of its capacitors directly to the U.S. 
government. Although the Company does not track sales of capacitors by 
industry, the Company estimates that sales of its capacitors to OEMs which 
produce products principally for the military and aerospace industries 
accounted for less than 3 of its net sales during fiscal year 1998. Certain 
of the Company's other customers may also purchase capacitors for products in 
the military and aerospace industries. 

Sales and Distribution 

KEMET's domestic sales, and most of its foreign sales, are made through the 
Company's approximately 140 direct sales employees. The Company's domestic 
sales staff is located in five regional offices, thirteen local offices and 
eight satellite offices. A substantial majority of the Company's 
international sales are made through local sales offices in four European 
locations, six Far East locations, and two Canadian locations. There are also 
ten satellite offices in Europe, and one in Asia. The Company also has 
independent sales representatives located in Australia, Argentina, Brazil, 
India, Israel, Mexico, South Africa, and South Korea. 

KEMET markets and sells its products in its major markets with a direct sales 
force in contrast to its competitors which generally utilize independent 
commissioned representatives or a combination of representatives and direct 
sales employees. The Company believes its direct sales force creates a 
distinctive competence in the market place and has established an enviable 
relationship with its customers. With a global sales organization that is 
customer based and geographically independent, KEMET's direct sales personnel 
from around the world serve on KEMET Key Account Teams. These teams are 
committed to serving any customer location in the world with a dedicated KEMET 
representative. This approach requires a unique blend of accountability and 
responsibility to specific customer locations, guided by an overall account 
strategy for each key customer.

Electronic distributors are an important distribution channel in the 
electronics industry and accounted for approximately 33 , 29 and 32 of the 
Company's net sales in fiscal years 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. In 
fiscal years 1996, 1997 and 1998, TTI, Inc., a distributor of passive 
components, accounted for more than 10 of net sales. 

The Company's distributor policy includes the inventory price protection and 
"ship from stock and debit" programs common in the industry. The price 
protection policy protects the value of the distributors' inventory in the 
event the Company reduces its published selling price to distributors. The 
Company has established a rolling 12-month financial reserve for this 
program. The ship from stock and debit program provides a mechanism for the 
distributor to meet a competitive price after obtaining authorization from the 
local 
Company sales office. This program allows the distributor to ship its higher 
priced inventory and debit the Company for the difference between KEMET's list 
price and the lower authorized price for that specific transaction. Each sale 
under this program requires specific authorization. The Company expenses 
these authorized discounts on a monthly basis and the expense is included in 
calculating net sales. 

7
Foreign Sales 

During fiscal year 1998, the Company exported approximately 293.2 million of 
capacitors representing approximately 44 of the Company's net sales. Although 
management believes that the Company is able to provide a level of delivery 
and service that is competitive with local suppliers, the Company's capacitor 
market shares in European and Asian markets tend to be significantly lower 
than in the United States because some foreign electronics manufacturers 
prefer to purchase components from local producers. As a result, a large 
percentage of the Company's export sales are made to foreign operations of 
United States manufacturers. The Company's European sales are denominated in 
local currencies and therefore a significant appreciation of the United States 
dollar against such foreign currencies would reduce the gross profit realized 
by the Company 
on its European sales as measured in United States dollars. Substantially all 
of the Company's European export shipments are made duty-paid, free delivery 
as required by local market conditions (see note 9 to Consolidated Financial 
Statements).

Inventory and Backlog

Although the Company manufactures and inventories standardized products, a 
portion of its products are produced to meet specific customer requirements. 
Cancellations by customers of orders already in production could have an 
impact on inventories; however, to date cancellations have not been 
significant.

The backlog of outstanding orders for the Company's products was 74.1 
million, 
and 62.0 million, at March 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively. The decrease was 
primarily a result of the additional manufacturing capacity brought on-stream 
by the Company and reduced industry lead times as well as the industry-wide 
inventory correction experienced in fiscal year 1998. The current backlog is 
expected to be filled during the next 12 months. Most of the orders in the 
Company's backlog may be canceled by its customers, in whole or in part, 
although sometimes subject to penalty.

Competition 

The market for tantalum and ceramic capacitors is highly competitive 
worldwide. The capacitor industry is characterized by, among other factors, a 
long-term trend toward lower prices for capacitors, low transportation costs 
and few import barriers. Competitive factors that influence the market for 
the Company's products include product quality, customer service, technical 
innovation, pricing and timely delivery. The Company believes that it 
competes favorably on the basis of each of these factors. 

The Company's major domestic competitors include AVX Corporation in the 
production of tantalum and ceramic capacitors and Vishay Intertechnology, 
Inc., in the production of tantalum and surface-mount ceramic capacitors. The 
Company's major foreign competitors include AVX Corporation in the production 
of tantalum and ceramic capacitors, Murata Manufacturing Company Ltd. and TDK 
Corporation in the production of ceramic capacitors, and NEC Corporation in 
the production of tantalum capacitors. 

Cyclicality of Demand for Electronic Components 

Capacitors are essential electronic components used on circuit boards in
virtually all electronic products and applications and the demand for 
capacitors tends to reflect the demand for products in the electronics 
market. 
 8
During the second half of fiscal year 1998, the growth rate for personal 
computers and cellular phones slowed and the slower end-use growth rate 
resulted in a slower growth for capacitors. This slower growth rate of 
electronic equipment resulted in excess inventory in the equipment distributor 
channel. Future changes in business cycles could adversely affect the 
Company's results. 

Raw Materials 

The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company's products 
are tantalum powder, palladium and silver. These materials are considered 
commodities and are subject to price volatility. Tantalum powder is primarily 
purchased under annual contracts, while palladium and silver are primarily 
purchased on the spot and forward markets, depending on market conditions. For 
example, if the Company believes that prices are likely to rise, it may 
purchase a significant amount of its annual requirements on a forward delivery 
basis.

There are presently three suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor- 
grade tantalum powder. Management believes tantalum required by the Company 
has generally been available in sufficient quantities to meet requirements and 
that there are a sufficient number of tantalum processors relative to 
foreseeable demand; however, the limited number of tantalum powder suppliers 
could lead to increases in tantalum prices that the Company may not be able to 
pass on to its customers.

Although palladium is presently found primarily in South Africa and Russia, 
the Company believes that there are a sufficient number of domestic and 
foreign suppliers from which the Company can purchase its palladium 
requirements. Although the palladium required by the Company has generally 
been available in sufficient quantities, the limited number of palladium 
suppliers could lead to higher prices and the inability of the Company to pass 
any increase on to its customers could have an adverse effect on the margin of 
those products in which the metal is used. In particular, beginning in the 
3rd and 4th quarters of fiscal year 1998, the Company saw a dramatic increase 
in 
the price of palladium due to delays from the Russian supplies, which is 
expected to continue into fiscal year 1999. The Company is taking corrective 
action to minimize the impact of this increase on its profit margins.

Silver has generally been available in sufficient quantities, and the Company 
believes there are a number of suppliers from which the Company can purchase 
its silver requirements.

Patents and Trademarks

At March 31, 1998, the Company held 27 United States and 87 foreign patents 
and four United States and 62 foreign trademarks. The Company does not 
generally engage in licensing technology or products, whether as licensor or 
licensee. The Company believes that the success of its business is not 
materially dependent on the existence or duration of any patent, license or 
trademark, other than the name "KEMET." The Company's engineering and 
research and development staffs have developed and continue to develop 
proprietary manufacturing processes and equipment designed to enhance the 
Company's manufacturing facilities and reduce costs.

9
Research and Development 

Research and Development expenses were 23.8 million for fiscal year 1998 
compared to 20.8 million for fiscal year 1997. These amounts include 
expenditures for product development and the design and development of 
machinery and equipment for new processes and cost reduction efforts. The 
increase in research and development expense was primarily related to the 
continuing improvements in surface-mount production processes. Most of the 
Company's products and manufacturing processes have been designed and 
developed by Company engineers. The Company continues to invest in new 
technology to improve product performance and production efficiencies.

Environmental

The Company is subject to various Mexican and United States federal, state and 
local environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the 
environment, including those governing the handling and management of certain 
chemicals used and generated in manufacturing electronic components. Based on 
the annual costs incurred by the Company over the past several years, 
management does not believe that compliance with these laws and regulations 
will have a material adverse effect upon the Company's capital expenditures, 
earnings or competitive position. The Company believes, however, that it is 
reasonably likely that the trend in environmental litigation and laws and 
regulations will continue to be toward stricter standards. Such changes in 
the law and regulations may require the Company to make additional capital 
expenditures which, while not currently estimable with certainty, are not 
presently expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's 
financial condition. See "Legal Proceedings" for a discussion of certain 
other environmental matters.

Employees 

As of March 31, 1998, KEMET had approximately 11,300 employees, of whom 
approximately 3,900 were located in the United States, approximately 7,300 
were located in Mexico, and the remainder were located in the Company's foreign 

sales offices. The Company believes that its future success will depend in 
part on its ability to recruit, retain and motivate qualified personnel at 
all 
levels of the Company. While none of its United States employees are 
unionized, the Company has approximately 5,600 hourly employees in Mexico 
represented by labor unions as required by Mexican law. In addition, the 
Company's labor 
costs in Mexico are denominated in pesos, and Mexican inflation or a 
significant depreciation of the United States dollar against the Mexican peso 
would increase the Company's labor costs in Mexico. The Company has not 
experienced any major work stoppages and considers its relations with its 
employees to be good. 

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

KEMET is headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina, and has a total of 12 
manufacturing plants located in the southeastern United States and Mexico. The 
manufacturing operations are in Greenville, Mauldin, Fountain Inn (which is 
being expanded by 70,000 square feet) and Greenwood, South Carolina; Shelby, 
North Carolina; and Matamoros and Monterrey, Mexico. The Company's existing 
manufacturing and assembly facilities have approximately 1.5 million square 
feet of floor space and are highly automated with proprietary manufacturing 
processes and equipment. 

10
The Mexican facilities operate under the Maquiladora Program. In general, a 
company that operates under the program is afforded certain duty and tax 
preferences and incentives on products brought back into the United States.

The Company has operated in Mexico since 1969 and approximately 54 of its 
employees are located in Mexico. The Company's Mexican facilities in Matamoros 
are located within five miles of Brownsville, Texas, with easy access for 
daily shipments of work-in-process and finished products. The Company also 
has 
manufacturing facilities in Monterrey which commenced operations in 1991, and 
were expanded by 130,000 square feet in fiscal year 1997. In addition, the 
Company constructed a new manufacturing plant in Monterrey which comprises 
240,000 square feet and was put in production in fiscal year 1997. The 
Company's manufacturing processes and standards, including compliance with 
applicable environmental and worker safety laws and regulations, are 
essentially identical in the United States and Mexico. The Company's Mexican 
operations, like its United States operations, have won numerous quality 
awards from their customers. 

Each of the Company's manufacturing and assembly facilities produces one 
product or a family of closely related products. Management believes that this 
focused approach to manufacturing allows each facility to shorten 
manufacturing time, optimize product flow, and avoid long and costly equipment 
retooling and employee training time, all of which lead to overall reduced 
costs. 

The Company has developed just-in-time manufacturing and sourcing systems. 
These systems enable the Company to meet customer requirements for faster 
deliveries while minimizing the need to carry significant inventory levels. 
The Company continues to emphasize flexibility in all of its manufacturing 
operations to improve product delivery response times. 

Management believes that substantially all of its property and equipment is 
in 
good condition and that it has sufficient capacity to meet its current and 
projected manufacturing and distribution needs for leaded capacitors. The 
Company continues to add capacity to meet its projected manufacturing and 
distribution needs for surface-mount capacitors.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 
1980, as amended (CERCLA) and certain analogous state laws, impose 
retroactive, strict liability upon certain defined classes of persons 
associated with releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Among 
those liable 
under CERCLA (known collectively as "potentially responsible parties" or 
"PRPs") is any person who "arranged for disposal" of hazardous substances at 
a site requiring response action under the statute. While a company's 
liability under CERCLA is often based upon its proportionate share of overall 
waste volume or other equitable factors, CERCLA has been widely held to permit 
imposition of joint and several liability on each PRP. The Company has 
periodically incurred, and may continue to incur, liability under CERCLA and 
analogous state laws with respect to sites used for off-site management or 
disposal of Company-derived wastes. The Company has been named as a PRP at the 
Seaboard Chemical Site in Jamestown, North Carolina. The Company is 
participating in the clean-up as a "de minimis" party and does not expect its 
total exposure to be material. In addition, Union Carbide Corporation (Union 
Carbide), the former owner of the Company, is a PRP at certain sites relating 
to the off-site disposal of wastes from properties presently owned by the 
Company. The Company is participating in coordination with Union Carbide in 
certain PRP-initiated activities related to these sites. The Company expects 
that it will bear some portion of the liability with respect to these sites; 
however, any such share is not presently expected to be material to the 
Company's financial condition. In connection with the acquisition in 1990, 
Union Carbide agreed, subject to certain limitations, to indemnify the Company 
with respect to the foregoing sites.

The Company or its subsidiaries are at any one time parties to a number of 
lawsuits arising out of their respective operations, including workers 
compensation or work place safety cases, some of which involve claims of 
substantial damages. Although there can be no assurance, based upon 
information known to the Company, the Company does not believe that any 
liability which might result from an adverse determination of such lawsuits 
would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or res
ults of operations.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Comparison of Fiscal Year 1998 to Fiscal Year 1997

Net sales for the fiscal year 1998 were 667.7 million, an increase of 112.4 
million or 20 from fiscal year 1997. The growth in net sales reflects the 
Company's continued investment in production capacity to support the demand 
for surface-mount capacitors worldwide. Sales of surface-mount capacitors for 
fiscal year 1998 were 517.4 million, an increase of 117.6 million or 29 as 
compared to fiscal year 1997, and sales of leaded capacitors declined 3 to 
 150.3 million. The Company experienced growth in both the domestic and export 
markets with increases of 15 and 27 , respectively, over the prior years.

Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation for the year ended March 31, 1998, 
was 463.6 million as compared to 377.5 million, for the year ended March 
31, 
1997. As a percentage of net sales, cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation, 
for fiscal year 1998 was 69 as compared to 68 for fiscal year 1997. The 
increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was attributable to the 
decline 
in average selling prices from fiscal year 1997 to fiscal year 1998 combined 
with higher palladium prices experienced by the industry during the last 
quarter of fiscal year 1998. The Company continues to address this negative 
impact on cost of sales through cost reduction activities as evidenced by the 
announced restructuring during the third quarter of fiscal year 1998.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 
1998, were 48.8 million, or 7 of net sales as compared to 45.7 million, or 
8 
for the year ended March 31, 1997. The decrease in selling, general, and 
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily due to 
efficiencies resulting from increased sales volume.

Research, development and engineering expenses were 23.8 million for fiscal 
year 1998 compared to 20.8 million for fiscal year 1997. The increase 
reflects the Company's commitment to the development and introduction of new 
products, and to support and enhance the growth of its surface-mount capacitor 
manufacturing capacity. The Company also continued to invest to improve 
product performance and production efficiencies.

Depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 1998 was 38.9 million, an 
increase of 5.4 million, or 16 , from 33.5 million for fiscal year 1997. 
The increase resulted primarily from depreciation expense associated with 
increased capital expenditures during the current and prior fiscal years.

The Company recorded a pretax charge of 10.5 million 7.3 million after tax) 
in the quarter ended December 31, 1997, in conjunction with a plan to 
restructure the manufacturing and support operations between its U.S. 
facilities in North and South Carolina and its Mexican operations in 
Monterrey, Mexico. The restructuring plan is expected to reduce the Company's 
U.S. work force by approximately 1,000 employees and result in an annualized 
pretax cost savings of approximately 18.0 million. During the quarter ended 
March 31, 1998, the Company charged 4.8 million against the liability. The 
Company expects the remaining costs to be incurred and charged against the 
liability during the next 5 to 7 months.

Operating income was 82.2 million for fiscal year 1998 compared to 62.4 
million for fiscal year 1997. The increase resulted primarily from increased 
sales and improved operating efficiencies as discussed above.

 16
Income tax expense for fiscal year 1998 was 31 of net earnings before income 
taxes. The decrease from the federal statutory rate of 35 is primarily the 
result of increased foreign sales corporation benefits and lower state tax 
expense.

Comparison of Fiscal Year 1997 to Fiscal Year 1996

Net sales for the fiscal year 1997 were 555.3 million, a decrease of 78.9 
million or 12 from fiscal year 1996. The decreases in net sales was 
primarily attributable to the favorable average selling prices experienced in 
fiscal year 1996 as compared to fiscal year 1997 during which prices returned 
to the historical rate of decline, reduced sales volumes due to the 
industry-wide inventory correction and the decline in demand for electronic 
components by personal computer and telecommunication manufacturers in the 
first half of fiscal year 1997. Sales of surface-mount capacitors for the 
fiscal year 1997 were 399.8 million, a decline of 44.7 million or 10 as 
compared to fiscal year 1996, and sales of leaded capacitors declined 18 to 
 155.5 million. The sales decline was experienced in both domestic and export 
markets with domestic sales declining 12 to 324.7 million and export sales 
declining 14 to 230.6 million.

Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation for the year ended March 31, 1997, 
was 377.5 million as compared to 415.6 million, for the year ended March 31, 
1996. As a percentage of net sales, cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation, 
for fiscal year 1997 was 68 as compared to 66 for fiscal year 1996. The 
increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was attributable to a 
decline in average selling prices from fiscal year 1996 to fiscal year 1997 as 
discussed above and less favorable production efficiencies associated with 
reduced capacity utilization rates. The effect of the decline in prices and 
less favorable production efficiencies was partially offset by the benefits 
realized from the movement of certain production operations to lower cost 
manufacturing facilities in Mexico and cost containment actions implemented in 
the prior quarters, including the savings associated with the early retirement 
incentive program which was effective August 1, 1996.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 
1997, were 45.7 million as compared to 42.1 million for the year ended March 
31, 1996. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was 
primarily due to an increase in marketing expenses and the expense associated 
with the installation of a world-wide "intranet" communications system. The 
Company's marketing philosophy is unique among capacitor manufacturers. KEMET 
employs a direct sales force to sell its products versus exclusive use of 
independent manufacturers representatives. This results in sales force expense 
being relatively constant over time, and in a period of declining sales will 
tend to increase selling expense as a percentage of sales.

Research, development and engineering expenses were 20.8 million for fiscal 
year 1997 compared to 18.4 million for fiscal year 1996. The increase 
reflects the Company's continued commitment to supporting and enhancing the 
growth of its surface-mount capacitor manufacturing capacity. The Company 
also continued to invest to improve product performance and production 
efficiencies.

Depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 1997 was 33.5 million, a 
decrease of 4.1 million, or 11 , from 37.6 million for fiscal year 1996. 
During fiscal year 1996 the Company reviewed the estimated useful lives of 
certain of the Company's older fixed assets. This resulted in an adjustment 
of 6.0 million of depreciation expense due to reducing certain older assets 
to salvage value and shortening the useful lives on certain assets. This was 
 17
partially offset by depreciation expenses associated with increased capital 
expenditures.

The Company recorded a pretax charge of 15.4 million 9.9 million after 
tax) 
in the quarter ended September 30, 1996, in connection with an early 
retirement 
incentive program. The program reduced the U.S. hourly and salaried workforce 
by 409 people, which is expected to result in an annualized cost savings of 
approximately 15.0 million.

Operating income was 62.4 million for fiscal year 1997 compared to 120.4 
million for fiscal year 1996. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease 
in net sales as discussed above.

Income tax expense for fiscal year 1997 was 32 of net earnings. The decrease 
from the federal statutory rate of 35 is primarily the result of increased 
foreign sales corporation benefits and lower state tax expense.

distributors and original equipment manufacturers.

19
Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's liquidity needs arise from working capital requirements, capital 
expenditures and 
principal and interest payments on its indebtedness. The Company intends to 
satisfy its liquidity requirements primarily with funds provided by operations 
and borrowings under its bank credit 
facilities. 

During fiscal year 1998, the Company generated 88.2 million in net cash from 
operating activities as compared to 55.8 million in fiscal year 1997. The 
increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily a result of the 
increase in net income and the timing of cash flows from current assets and 
liabilities, such as accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, accrued 
liabilities and income taxes payable.

The Company incurred a pretax restructuring charge of 10.5 million during the 
quarter ended 
December 31, 1997. For the quarter ended March 31, 1998 the Company expended 
4.8 million in charges 
to the liability (including approximately 3.3 million in cash expenditures). 
The Company expects the remaining 5.7 million in charges to be incurred and 
completed by the third quarter of fiscal year 1999.

Management has initiated an aggressive enterprise wide program to prepare the 
Company's computer systems and applications for the year 2000. The program 
is 
a combination of remediation efforts both internally and with the Company's 
suppliers and the implementation of client server applications. The 
acquisition
costs of the new software and equipment has and continues to be capitalized 
and all other expenses have been charged against operating income. Amounts 
incurred
for the twelve months ended March 31, 1998 were not material and the company 
does not expect the amounts required to be expensed for the remaining 
activities to have a material effect on its financial position or results of 
operations. The Company expects its year 2000 date conversion projects to be 
completed on a timely basis. However, there can be no assurance that other 
companies' systems will be converted on a timely basis or that any such 
failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse effect on the 
Company's systems.

The Company invested 114.5 million in capital expenditures in fiscal year 
1998, and expects to invest 60.0 million in fiscal year 1999. The fiscal year 
1998 capital was primarily invested in surface-mount manufacturing capacity. 
During fiscal year 1998, the company completed a 70,000 square foot expansion 
of its Fountain Inn, South Carolina plant. In April 1998, the company 
announced
plans to build a new tantalum manufacturing facility in Ciudad Victoria, 
Mexico. The new facility will initially produce tantalum leaded products; 
however, this expansion is a direct result of the ever growing demand for the 
Company's tantalum surface-mount products.

The Company is subject to restrictive covenants which, among others, restrict 
its ability to make loans or advances or to make investments, and require it 
to meet financial tests related principally to funded debt, cash flows, and 
net worth. At March 31, 1998, the Company was in compliance with such 
covenants. Borrowings are secured by guarantees of certain of the Company's 
wholly-owned 
subsidiaries.

20
During fiscal year 1998, the Company's long-term debt increased 1.1 
million. At March 31, 1998, the Company had unused availability under its 
revolving credit facility and its swingline credit facility of 61.0 million 
and 10.0 million, respectively. 

On November 12, 1997, the Company entered into an agreement with SunTrust 
Bank, Atlanta, whereby SunTrust Bank, Atlanta has offered to extend unsecured 
short-
term loans to the Company of which the aggregate principal amount of all loans 
outstanding may not exceed 20.0 million. The term of each loan may have a 
maturity of not more than 90 days and the interest rate on each loan will be 
negotiated and determined at the time of each borrowing. During the quarter 
ended March 31, 1998, the Company initiated short-term borrowings with an 
average effective interest rate of 5.841 . SunTrust Bank, Atlanta does not 
have any commitment to lend any funds in the future, and may cease to consider 
loan requests from the Company at any time.

Additional liquidity is generated by the Company through its accounts 
receivable discounting arrangements. On November 18, 1997, KEMET Electronics, 
S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, renewed its discounting 
agreement with Swiss Bank Corporation. The agreement has been amended to 
decrease the maximum amount of purchased receivables from 50.0 million to 
 30.0 million through June 1998 at which time the maximum will be reduced to 
 20.0 million for the duration of the agreement. In addition, the discount 
has been increased from a rate per annum equal to .50 above LIBOR to a rate 
per annum equal to .65 above LIBOR. The above amendments were effective as 
of December 9, 1997. All other terms and conditions remain in full force and 
effect until November 30, 1998.

In May 1998, the Company sold 100.0 million of its Senior Notes pursuant to 
the terms of a Note Purchase Agreement dated as of May 1, 1998, between the 
Company and the eleven purchasers of the Senior Notes named therein. These 
Senior Notes have a final maturity date of May 4, 2010, with required 
principal repayments beginning on May 4, 2006. The Senior Notes bear interest 
at a fixed rate of 6.66 , with interest payable semiannually beginning 
November 4, 1998. The terms of the Note Purchase Agreements include various 
restrictive covenants typical of transactions of this type, and require the 
Company to meet certain financial tests including a minimum net worth test and 
a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization. The net proceeds from the 
sale of the Notes will be used to repay existing indebtedness and for general 
corporate purposes.

The Company presently has a total of seven manufacturing facilities in 
Matamoros and Monterrey, Mexico with approximately 60 of the Company's 
employees located there. In fiscal year 1998, the devaluation of the Mexican 
peso proved favorable, but did not have a material impact on the Company's 
performance. There is no assurance that the devaluation will continue and any 
effect this might have on the future performance of the Company cannot be 
determined.

As discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company 
or its subsidiaries are at any one time parties to a number of lawsuits 
arising out of their respective operations, including workers' compensation or 
work place safety cases and environmental issues, some of which involve claims 
of substantial damages. Although there can be no assurance, based upon 
information known to the Company, the Company does not believe that any 
liability which might result from an adverse determination of such lawsuits 
would have a material adverse effect on the Company.

21
The Company believes its strong financial position will permit the financing 
of its business needs and opportunities. It is anticipated that ongoing 
operations will be financed primarily by internally-generated funds. In 
addition, the Company has the flexibility to meet short-term working capital 
and other temporary requirements through utilization of its borrowings under 
its bank credit facilities.

Safe Harbor Statement

The Company desires to take advantage of the new "safe harbor" provisions of 
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1996. Many of the following 
important factors discussed below have been discussed in the Company's prior 
SEC filings.

The Company wishes to caution readers that the following important factors, 
among others, in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, 
KEMET's actual results and could cause KEMET's actual consolidated results for 
the first quarter of fiscal year 1999 and beyond to differ materially from 
those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, 
the Company whether contained herein, in other documents subsequently filed by 
the Company with the SEC, or in oral statements:

A moderating growth rate in end-use products which incorporate the Company's 
products and the effects of a down-turn in the general economy or in general 
business conditions;

Underutilization of KEMET's plants and factories, or of any plant expansion or 
new plants, including, but not limited to, those in Mexico, resulting in 
production inefficiencies and higher costs; start-up expenses, 
inefficiencies, and delays, and increased depreciation costs in connection 
with the start of production in new plants and expansions; capacity 
constraints that could limit the ability to continue to meet rising demand for 
surface-mount capacitors;

Occurrences affecting the slope or speed of decline of the pricing curve for 
the Company's products, or affecting KEMET's ability to reduce product and 
other costs and to increase productivity; the effect of changes in the mix of 
products sold and the resulting effects on gross margins;

Difficulties in obtaining raw materials, supplies, power, natural resources, 
and any other items needed for the production of capacitors; the effects of 
quality deviations in raw materials, particularly tantalum powder and ceramic 
dielectric materials; the effects of significant price increases for tantalum 
or palladium, or an inability to obtain adequate supplies of tantalum from the 
limited number of suppliers;

The amount and rate of growth in the Company's selling, general and 
administrative expenses, and the impact of unusual items resulting from 
KEMET's ongoing evaluation of its business strategies, assets valuations and 
organizational structure;

The acquisition of fixed assets and other assets, including inventories and 
receivables; the making or incurring of any expenditures and expenses 
including, but not limited to, depreciation and research and development 
expenses; any revaluation of assets or related expenses; and the amount of 
and any changes to tax rates;

The effect of and changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and 
regulations; other activities of governments, agencies and similar 
 22
organizations; social and economic conditions, such as trade restrictions or 
prohibitions, inflation and monetary fluctuations; import and other charges or 
taxes; the ability or inability of KEMET to obtain, or hedge against, foreign 
currency; foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, 
particularly 
a strengthening of the U.S. dollar; nationalization; and unstable governments 
and legal systems, and intergovernmental disputes; The costs and other effects 
of legal and administrative cases and proceedings (whether civil, such as 
environmental and product-related, or criminal); settlements, investigations, 
claims, and changes in those items; developments or assertions by or against 
the Company relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property 
licenses; adoptions of new or changes in accounting policies and practices and 
the application of such policies and practices;
The effects of changes within KEMET's organization, particularly at the 
executive officer level, or in compensation and benefit plans; the amount, 
type and cost of the financing which the Company has, and any changes to that 
financing; and

The effects of severe weather on KEMET's operations, including disruptions at 
manufacturing facilities; the effects of a disruption in KEMET's computerized 
ordering systems; and the effects of a disruption in KEMET's communications 
systems.

Effect of Inflation

Inflation generally affects the Company by increasing the cost of labor, 
equipment, and raw materials. The Company does not believe that inflation has 
had any material effect on the Company's business over the past three years.

Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors
KEMET Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of KEMET 
Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1997 and 1998 and the related 
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for 
each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 1998. These 
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated 
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of KEMET 
Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1997 and 1998, and the results of 
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year 
period ended March 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles.

(1) Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business and Organization
KEMET Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) is engaged in the manufacture 
and sale of solid tantalum and multilayer ceramic capacitors in the worldwide 
market under the KEMET brand name. The Company is headquartered in 
Greenville, South Carolina, and has twelve manufacturing plants located in 
South Carolina, North Carolina and Mexico. Additionally, the Company has 
wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries which primarily market KEMET's products in 
foreign markets.

Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company include the 
accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and 
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized from sales when a product is shipped. A portion of 
sales is made to distributors under agreements allowing certain rights of 
return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by distributors (See 
note 10).

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of most 
inventories is determined by the "first-in, first-out"(FIFO) method. 
Approximately 4 and 3 of inventory costs of certain raw materials at 
March 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively, have been determined on the "last-in, 
first-out"(LIFO) basis. It is estimated that if all inventories had been 
costed using the FIFO method, they would have been approximately 914 and 
 1,039 higher than reported at March 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively.

Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is calculated 
principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 
the respective assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the 
straight-
line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the 
terms of the respective leases. Expenditures for maintenance are expensed; 
expenditures for renewals and improvements are generally capitalized. Upon 
sale or retirement of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated 
depreciation are removed and any gain or loss is recognized.

Intangible Assets
Values assigned to patents and technology are based on management estimates 
and are amortized using the straight-line method over twenty-five years. 
Goodwill and trademarks are amortized using the straight-line method over a 
forty year period. The Company assesses the recoverability of its intangible 
assets by determining whether the amortization of the intangibles balance over 
its remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating 
cash 
flows of the acquired operation. The amount of intangible impairment, if any, 
is measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows. The 
assessment of the recoverability of intangibles will be impacted if estimated 
future operating cash flows are not achieved.

Other Assets
Other assets consist principally of the cash surrender value of life 
insurance.

Accounts Payable, Trade
Included in accounts payable, trade, are outstanding checks, net in the 
amounts of 7,171 and 12,625 at March 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively.

 36
Deferred Income Taxes
Under the asset and liability method of Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes," deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to 
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing 
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and 
tax 
credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which 
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under 
Statement 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change 
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment 
date.

Stock-based Compensation
In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based 
Compensation" (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123 established financial accounting 
and reporting standards for stock-based compensation plans and transactions in 
which an entity issues its equity instruments to acquire goods and services 
from nonemployees. The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of 
SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the 
stock option plans. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk
The Company sells to customers located throughout the United States and the 
world. Credit evaluations of its customers' financial conditions are 
performed periodically, and the Company generally does not require collateral 
from its customers. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997, two customers 
accounted 
for more than 10 of net sales and in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998, 
one customer accounted for more than 10 of net sales.

Foreign Currency Translations
The Company translated foreign currencies using year-end exchange rates to 
translate most foreign assets and liabilities and weighted average rates for 
the period to translate foreign income and expenses. Translation gains and 
losses arising from the conversion of the balance sheets of foreign entities 
into U.S. dollars are deferred as adjustments to stockholders' equity. With 
respect to operations in Mexico, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, 
and any gains or losses from translating foreign denominated balances are 
included directly in income. Gains and losses arising from foreign currency 
transactions are also included directly in income.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company's Financial Instruments include accounts receivable, accounts 
payable, long-term debt and other financing commitments. The carrying values 
of such financial instruments approximates the fair market value determined as 
of March 31, 1998.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. 
These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the 
date of the financial statements. In addition, they affect the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results 
could differ from these estimates and assumptions.

Long-term debt, excluding current installments 102,900 104,000
 ========= =========

On October 18, 1996, the Company refinanced the entire balance of its 
outstanding revolving credit facility and swingline credit facility with new 
credit facilities totaling 175.0 million. These new unsecured credit 
facilities, each of which has a term of five years, include a 165.0 million 
revolving credit facility and a 10.0 million swingline credit facility.

On November 12, 1997, the Company entered into an agreement with SunTrust 
Bank,
Atlanta, whereby SunTrust Bank, Atlanta has offered to extend unsecured short-

term loans to the Company of which the aggregate principal amount of all loans 
outstanding may not exceed 20,000. The term of each loan may have a maturity 
of not more than 90 days and the interest rate on each loan will be negotiated 
and determined at the time of each borrowing. SunTrust Bank, Atlanta does not 
have any commitment to lend any funds in the future, and may cease to consider 
loan requests from the Company at any time.

The Company is subject to restrictive covenants which, among others, restrict 
its ability to make loans or advances or to make investments, and require it 
to meet financial tests related principally to funded debt, cash flows, and 
net worth. At March 31, 1998, the Company was in compliance with such 
covenants. Borrowings are secured by guarantees of certain of the Company's 
wholly-owned subsidiaries.

The aggregate maturities of long-term debt subsequent to March 31, 1998, 
follow: 1999, 20,000, and 2002, 104,000.

In May 1998, the Company sold 100,000 of its Senior Notes pursuant to the 
terms of a Note Purchase Agreement dated as of May 1, 1998, between the 
Company and the eleven purchasers of the Senior Notes named therein. These 
Senior 
Notes have a final maturity date of May 4, 2010, and begin amortizing on May 
4,
2006. The Senior Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.66 , with interest 
payable semiannually beginning November 4, 1998. The terms of the Note 
Purchase Agreement include various restrictive covenants typical of 
transactions of this type, and require the Company to meet certain financial 
tests including a minimum net worth test and a maximum ratio debt to total 
capitalization. The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be used to 
repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.

(4)Other Non-Current Obligations
Non-current obligations are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):

On June 5, 1996, the Company announced an early retirement incentive program 
for its U.S. hourly and salaried employees. The Company reduced the U.S. 
hourly and salaried workforce by 409 people with annualized cost savings of 
approximately 415,000 (unaudited). The total cost of the program was 15,407 9,900 after tax). The Senior Management of the Company was not eligible for 
the early retirement incentive.

Included as a part of other non-current obligations is the Company's accrual 
for environmental liabilities. The Company's policy is to accrue remediation 
costs when it is probable that such efforts will be required and the related 
costs can be reasonably estimated. 
 39
(5) Employee Pension and Savings Plans
The Company has a non-contributory pension plan (Plan) which covers 
substantially all employees in the United States who meet age and service 
requirements. The Plan provides defined benefits that are based on years of 
credited service, average compensation (as defined) and the primary social 
security benefit. The effective date of the Plan is April 1, 1987.

The cost of pension benefits under the Plan is determined by an independent 
actuarial firm using the "projected unit credit" actuarial cost method. 
Currently payable contributions to the Plan are limited to amounts that are 
currently deductible for income tax reporting purposes, and are included in 
accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets.

Net pension expense included the following components (dollars in thousands):

The Company sponsors an unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan for key managers. 
This plan is non-qualified and provides
certain key employees defined pension benefits which would equal those 
provided 
by the Company's non-contributory pension plan if the plan was not limited by 
the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. 

Net pension expense included the following components (dollars in thousands):

respectively, and a rate of increase in future compensation levels of 5.0 in 
both 1997 and 1998, were used in determining the actuarial present value of 
the projected benefit obligation of each of the above plans. The expected 
long-
term rate of return on assets was 8.5 in 1997 and 1998. A weighted-average 
discount rate of 7.5 and 7.75 was used to determine the pension expense for 
1997 and 1998, respectively.

In addition, the Company has a defined contribution plan (Savings Plan) in 
which all U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility requirements may 
participate. participant may direct the Company to contribute amounts, based 
on a percentage of the participant's compensation, to the Savings Plan through 
the execution of salary reduction agreements. In addition, the participants 
may elect to make after-tax contributions. The Company will make annual 
matching contributions to the Savings Plan of 30 to 50 of salary reduction

Net deferred income tax liability (189) (2,875)
 ======= =======

The net deferred income tax liability is reflected in the accompanying 1997 
and 1998 balance sheets as a 12,552 and 13,581 current asset and a 12,741 
and 16,456 non-current liability, respectively.

The Company anticipates that the reversal of existing taxable temporary 
differences will provide sufficient taxable income to realize the remaining 
deferred tax assets. Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided 
for in 1997 or 1998.

On October 7, 1997, the Company and the Internal Revenue Service finalized a 
settlement involving adjustments on the Company's consolidated income tax 
returns for fiscal years 1994 and 1995. The adjustments to the consolidated 
income tax return primarily involved the partial disallowance of amortization 
of a non-compete agreement. The total tax including interest associated with 
the settlement amounted to approximately 1,050. 

On November 6, 1996, the Company and the Internal Revenue Service finalized a 
settlement involving adjustments on the Company's consolidated income tax 
returns for fiscal years 1989 through 1992. The adjustments to the 
consolidated income tax return primarily involved the partial disallowance of 
amortization of a non-compete agreement. The total tax including interest 
associated with the settlement amounted to approximately 1,700. Also, in 
relation to the final settlement with the IRS, the Company reduced goodwill 
and tax liabilities by approximately 13,390 for income taxes it had 
established at the date of acquisition pending resolution of the audit.

(8) Stock Option Plans
The Company has two option plans which reserve shares of common stock for 
issuance to executives and key employees. The Company has adopted the 
disclosure-only provisions of statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 
123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." Accordingly, no compensation 
cost has been recognized for the stock option plans. Had compensation costs 
for the Company's two stock option plans been determined based on the fair 
value at the grant date for awards in fiscal year 1997 and 1998, consistent 
with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company's net earnings and earnings 
per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below 
(dollars in thousands except per share data):

Years ended March 31,
 -------------------------------------------

 ------------------- --------------------
 As As 
 Reported Pro forma Reported Pro forma

Net earnings 37,169 36,146 49,190 47,554

Earnings per share 
 Basic .96 .93 1.26 1.22
 Diluted .95 .92 1.25 1.21
 
The pro forma amounts indicated above recognize compensation expense on a 
straight line basis over the vesting period of the grant. The pro forma effect 
on net income for fiscal year 1998 is not representative of the pro forma 
effects on net income in future years because it does not take into 
consideration pro forma compensation expense related to grants made prior to 
fiscal year 1997.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using 
the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average 
assumptions:

Years ended March 31,
 ------------------------
 1997 1998
 -------- --------
 
Expected life (years) 5 5 
Interest rate 6.1 5.7 
Volatility 23.8 42.6 
Dividend yield 0.0 0.0 

Under the 1992 Executive Stock Option Plan approved by the Company in April 
1992, 952,560 options were granted to certain executives. In May 1992, the 
Company also approved the 1992 Key Employee Stock Option Plan, which 
authorizes the granting of options to purchase 1,155,000 shares of Common 
Stock. In addition, stockholders approved the 1995 Executive Stock Option 
Plan at the 
1996 Annual Meeting. This plan provides for the issuance of options to 
purchase 1,900,000 shares of common stock to certain executives.
 46
These plans provide that shares granted come from the Company's authorized but 
unissued common stock. The price of the options granted thus far pursuant to 
these plans are no less than 100 of the fair market value of the shares on 
the date of grant. Also, the options may not be exercised within two 
years from the date of grant and no options will be exercisable after ten 
years from the date of grant.

A summary of the status of the Company's three stock option plans as of March 
31, 1996, 1997, and 1998, and changes during the years ended on those dates is

(12) Legal Proceedings

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 
1980, as amended (CERCLA) and certain analogous state laws, impose 
retroactive,
strict liability upon certain defined classes of persons associated with 
releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Among those liable 
under CERCLA (known collectively as "potentially responsible parties" or 
"PRPs") is any person who "arranged for disposal" of hazardous substances at 
a site requiring response action under the statute. While a company's 
liability under CERCLA is often based upon its proportionate share of overall 
waste volume or other equitable factors, CERCLA has been widely held to permit 
imposition of joint and several liability on each PRP. The Company has 
periodically incurred, and may continue to incur, liability under CERCLA, and 
analogous state laws, with respect to sites used for off-site management or 
disposal of Company-derived wastes. The Company has been named as a PRP at 
the Seaboard Chemical Site in Jamestown, North Carolina. The Company is 
 51
participating in the clean-up as a "de minimis" party and does not expect its 
total exposure to be material. In addition, Union Carbide Corporation (Union 
Carbide), the former owner of the Company, is a PRP at certain sites relating 
to the off-site disposal of wastes from properties presently owned by the 
Company. The Company is participating in coordination with Union Carbide in 
certain PRP initiated activities related to these sites. The Company expects 
that it will bear some portion of the liability with respect to these sites; 
however, any such share is not presently expected to be material to the 
Company's financial condition, or results of operations. In connection with 
the acquisition in 1990, Union Carbide agreed, subject to certain limitations, 
to indemnify the Company with respect to the foregoing sites.

The Company or its subsidiaries are at any one time parties to a number of 
lawsuits arising out of their respective operations, including workers' 
compensation or work place safety cases, some of which involve claims of 
substantial damages. Although there can be no assurance, based upon 
information known to the Company, the Company does not believe that any 
liability which might result from an adverse determination of such lawsuits 
would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or 
results of operations.

(13) Earnings Per Share (dollars in thousands except per share data)

Basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) are calculated as follows:

Diluted EPS 1.67 0.95 1.25

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 (FAS 
128), Earnings Per Share, for fiscal year 1998. All prior period earnings per 
common share data have been restated to conform to the provisions of FAS 128. 
Basic earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number 
of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share is computed using 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding adjusted for the incremental 
shares attributed to outstanding options to purchase common stock.

(14) Restructuring Charge
 52
The Company recorded a pretax charge of 10.5 million 7.3 million after tax) 
in the quarter ended December 31, 1997, in conjunction with a plan to 
restructure the manufacturing and support operations between its U.S. 
facilities in North and South Carolina and its Mexican operations in 
Monterrey, Mexico. The restructuring plan is expected to reduce the Company's 
U.S. work force by approximately 1,000 employees and result in an annualized 
pretax cost savings of approximately 18.0 million. During the quarter ended 
March 31, 1998, the Company charged 4.8 million against the liability. The 
Company expects the remaining costs to be incurred and charged against the 
liability during the next 5-7 months.

 6.66 Senior Notes due May 4, 2010
 Dated as of May 1, 1998
To the Purchaser listed in the attached
 Schedule A who is a signatory hereto:
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 KEMET Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
agrees with you as follows:
 .c.Section 1. Authorization of Notes;.
 The Company will authorize the issue and sale of 100,000,000
aggregate principal amount of its 6.66 Senior Notes due May 4,
2010 (the "Notes", such term to include any such notes issued in
substitution therefor pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement or
the Other Agreements (as hereinafter defined)). The Notes shall be
substantially in the form set out in Exhibit 1, with such changes
therefrom, if any, as may be approved by you and the Company. 
Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in
Schedule B; references to a "Schedule" or an "Exhibit" are, unless
otherwise specified, to a Schedule or an Exhibit attached to this
Agreement.
 .c.Section 2. Sale and Purchase of Notes;.
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Company will issue and sell to you and you will purchase from the
Company, at the Closing provided for in Section 3, Notes in the

purchase price of 100 of the principal amount thereof. 
Contemporaneously with entering into this Agreement, the Company is
entering into separate Note Purchase Agreements (the "Other
Agreements") identical with this Agreement with each of the other

nonperformance by any Other Purchaser thereunder.
 .c.Section 3. Closing;.
 The sale and purchase of the Notes to be purchased by you and

standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and
is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by
law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be
so qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the

Effect. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own
or hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under
lease, to transact the business it transacts and proposes to
transact, to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Other

 .c2.Section 5.2. Authorization, Etc;. This Agreement, the Other
Agreements and the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary 

 10

corporate action on the part of the Company, and this Agreement
constitutes, and upon execution and delivery thereof each Note will
constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
except that equitable remedies lie in the discretion of a court and
may be unenforceable.
 .c2.Section 5.3. Disclosure;. The Company, through its agent, First
Union Capital Markets, has delivered to you and each Other
Purchaser a copy of a Private Placement Memorandum, dated March
1998 (the "Memorandum"), relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Memorandum fairly describes, in all material respects,
the general nature of the business and principal properties of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. This Agreement, the Memorandum, the
documents, certificates or other written information delivered to
you by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and the financial statements
listed in Schedule 5.5, taken as a whole, do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of
the circumstances under which they were made. Except as disclosed
in the Memorandum, since March 31, 1997, there has been no change
in the financial condition, operations, business or properties of
the Company or any Subsidiary except changes that individually or
in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. There is no fact known to the Company
that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
that has not been set forth herein or in the Memorandum or in the
other documents, certificates and other written information
delivered to you by or on behalf of the Company specifically for
use in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 (b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or similar
equity interests of each Significant Subsidiary shown in Schedule
5.4 as being owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries have been
validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by 

 11

the Company or another Subsidiary free and clear of any Lien
(except as otherwise disclosed in Schedule 5.4).
 (c) Each Significant Subsidiary identified in Schedule 5.4 is
a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or
other legal entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which such qualification is required by law, other than those
jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each such Significant
Subsidiary has the corporate or other power and authority to own or
hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under
lease and to transact the business it transacts and proposes to
transact.
 (d) No Significant Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise
subject to, any legal restriction or any agreement (other than this
Agreement, the agreements listed on Schedule 5.4 and customary
limitations imposed by corporate law statutes) restricting the
ability of such Significant Subsidiary to pay dividends out of
profits or make any other similar distributions of profits to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that owns outstanding shares of
capital stock or similar equity interests of such Significant
Subsidiary.

to each Purchaser copies of the financial statements of the Company

position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates specified in such financial statements and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the respective
periods so specified and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied throughout the periods involved except as set
forth in the notes thereto (subject, in the case of any interim
financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).
 .c2.Section 5.6. Compliance with Laws, Other Instruments, Etc;. The
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the Notes will not (a) contravene, result in any
breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation
of any Lien in respect of any property of the Company or any
Subsidiary under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan,
purchase or credit agreement, lease, corporate charter or by-laws,
or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is bound or by which the Company or any Subsidiary or
any of their respective properties may be bound or affected, (b)
conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions
or provisions of any order, judgment, decree, or ruling of any 

 12

Company or any Subsidiary or (c), assuming the representations of
the Purchasers, with respect to the Securities Act, contained in
Section 6 are true and correct on the date of Closing, violate any
provision of any statute or other rule or regulation of any
Governmental Authority applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary.
 .c2.Section 5.7. Governmental Authorizations, Etc;. Assuming the
representations of the Purchasers, with respect to the Securities
Act, contained in Section 6 are true and correct on the date of
Closing, no consent, approval or authorization of, or registration,
filing or declaration with, any Governmental Authority is required
in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the
Company of this Agreement or the Notes.
 .c2.'Section 5.8. Litigation; Observance of Agreements, Statutes and
Orders';. (a) There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or
affecting the Company or any Subsidiary or any property of the 
Company or any Subsidiary in any court or before any arbitrator of
any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.
 (b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default
under any term of any agreement or instrument to which it is a
party or by which it is bound, or any order, judgment, decree or
ruling of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority or is in
violation of any applicable law, ordinance, rule or regulation
(including without limitation Environmental Laws) of any
Governmental Authority, which default or violation, individually or
in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.
 .c2.Section 5.9. Taxes;. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
filed all tax returns that are required to have been filed in any
jurisdiction, and have paid all taxes shown to be due and payable
on such returns and all other taxes and assessments levied upon
them or their properties, assets, income or franchises, to the
extent such taxes and assessments have become due and payable and
before they have become delinquent, except for any taxes and
assessments (a) the amount of which is not individually or in the
aggregate Material or (b) the amount, applicability or validity of
which is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and with respect to which the Company or a Subsidiary,
as the case may be, has established adequate reserves in accordance
with GAAP. The Company knows of no basis for any other tax or
assessment that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of Federal, state or
other taxes for all fiscal periods are adequate. The Federal
income tax liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries have 

 13
been determined by the Internal Revenue Service and paid for all
fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended March 31,
1997.
 .c2.'Section 5.10. Title to Property; Leases';. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have good and sufficient title to their respective
properties that individually or in the aggregate are Material,
including all such properties reflected in the most recent audited
balance sheet referred to in Section 5.5 or purported to have been
acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary after said date (except
as sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of
business), in each case free and clear of Liens prohibited by this
Agreement. All leases that individually or in the aggregate are
Material are valid and subsisting and are in full force and effect
in all material respects.
 .c2.Section 5.11. Licenses, Permits, Etc;. (a) The Company and its
Subsidiaries own or possess all licenses, permits, franchises,
authorizations, patents, copyrights, service marks, trademarks and
trade names, or rights thereto, that individually or in the
aggregate are Material, without known conflict with the rights of
others;
 (b) To the best knowledge of the Company, no product of the
Company infringes in any material respect any license, permit,
franchise, authorization, patent, copyright, service mark,
trademark, trade name or other right owned by any other Person; and
 (c) To the best knowledge of the Company, there is no
material violation by any Person of any right of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries with respect to any patent, copyright, service
mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned or used by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
 .c2.Section 5.12. Compliance with ERISA;. (a) The Company and each
ERISA Affiliate have operated and administered each Plan in
compliance with all applicable laws except for such instances of
noncompliance as have not resulted in and could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability pursuant
to Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty or excise tax provisions
of the Code relating to employee benefit plans (as defined in
Section 3 of ERISA), and no event, transaction or condition has
occurred or exists that could reasonably be expected to result in
the incurrence of any such liability by the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate, or in the imposition of any Lien on any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, in
either case pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or to such penalty
or excise tax provisions or to Section 401(a)(29) or 412 of the
Code, other than such liabilities or Liens as would not be
individually or in the aggregate Material.
 (b) The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities
under each of the Plans (other than Multiemployer Plans),
determined as of the end of such Plan's most recently ended plan 

 14
year on the basis of the actuarial assumptions specified for
funding purposes in such Plan's most recent actuarial valuation
report, did not exceed the aggregate current value of the assets of
such Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities by more than
 1,000,000 in the case of any single Plan and by more than
 1,000,000 in the aggregate for all Plans. The term "benefit
liabilities" has the meaning specified in Section 4001 of ERISA and
the terms "current value" and "present value" have the meaning
specified in section 3 of ERISA.
 (c) The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have not incurred
withdrawal liabilities (and are not subject to contingent
withdrawal liabilities) under Section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA in

(determined as of the last day of the Company's most recently ended
fiscal year in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement No. 106, without regard to liabilities attributable to
continuation coverage mandated by Section 4980B of the Code) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is not Material.
 (e) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
issuance and sale of the Notes hereunder will not involve any
transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of Section 406 of
ERISA or in connection with which a tax could be imposed pursuant
to Section 4975(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the Code. The representation by
the Company in the first sentence of this Section 5.12(e) is made
in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of your representation
in Section 6.2 as to the sources of the funds used to pay the
purchase price of the Notes to be purchased by you.
 .c2.Section 5.13. Private Offering by the Company;. Neither the
Company nor First Union Capital Markets, a division of Wheat First
Securities (the only Person authorized to act on the Company's
behalf), has offered the Notes or any similar securities for sale
to, or solicited any offer to buy any of the same from, or
otherwise approached or negotiated in respect thereof with, any
Person other than you, the Other Purchasers and not more than
sixty-one other Institutional Investors, each of which has been
offered the Notes at a private sale for investment. Neither the
Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has taken, or will take,
any action that would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes to
the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act.
 .c2.'Section 5.14. Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations';. The Company
will apply the proceeds of the sale of the Notes as set forth in
Schedule 5.14. No part of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes
hereunder will be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of
buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of
Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (12 CFR 207), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or
trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve 

 15
the Company in a violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR
224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of
Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Margin stock does not
constitute more than 3 of the value of the consolidated assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company does not have any
present intention that margin stock (other than a repurchase of
common stock of the Company publicly traded on a nationally
recognized exchange) will constitute more than 3 of the value of
such assets. As used in this Section, the terms "margin stock" and
"purpose of buying or carrying" shall have the meanings assigned to
them in said Regulation U.
 .c2.'Section 5.15. Existing Debt; Future Liens';. (a) Schedule 5.15
sets forth a complete and correct list of all outstanding Debt of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of the Closing. 
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default and no waiver
of default is currently in effect, in the payment of any principal
or interest on any Debt of the Company or such Subsidiary and no
event or condition exists with respect to any Debt of the Company
or any Subsidiary that would permit (or that with notice or the
lapse of time, or both, would permit) one or more Persons to cause
such Debt to become due and payable before its stated maturity or
before its regularly scheduled dates of payment.
 (b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has agreed or
consented to cause or permit in the future (upon the happening of
a contingency or otherwise) any of its property, whether now owned
or hereafter acquired, to be subject to a Lien not permitted by
Section 10.3.
 .c2.Section 5.16. Foreign Assets Control Regulations, Etc;. Neither
the sale of the Notes by the Company hereunder nor its use of the
proceeds thereof will violate the Trading with the Enemy Act, as
amended, or any of the foreign assets control regulations of the

as amended) or any enabling legislation or executive order relating
thereto.
 .c2.Section 5.17. Status under Certain Statutes;. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary is an "investment company" registered or
required to be registered or subject to regulation under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or is subject to

hereto.

any Subsidiary has knowledge of any claim or has received any
notice of any claim, and no proceeding has been instituted raising 

 16
any claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective real properties now or formerly owned, leased or
operated by any of them or other assets, alleging any damage to the
environment or violation of any Environmental Laws, except, in each
case, such as could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Except as otherwise disclosed to you in
writing:
 (a) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
 knowledge of any facts which would give rise to any claim,
 public or private, of violation of Environmental Laws or
 damage to the environment emanating from, occurring on or in
 any way related to real properties now or formerly owned,
 leased or operated by any of them or to other assets or their
 use, except, in each case, such as could not reasonably be

 reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;
 and
 (c) all buildings on all real properties now owned,

 are in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws, except
 where failure to comply could not reasonably be expected to
 result in a Material Adverse Effect.

Subsidiaries are in the process of taking steps to address the
impact of the occurrence of the year 2000 on their internal

on said internal computer systems is not expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 .c2.Section 6.1. Purchase for Investment;. You represent that you
are purchasing the Notes for your own account or for one or more

 any of its Subsidiaries or to the ability of the Company to
 perform its obligations hereunder and under the Notes.
 .c2.Section 7.2. Officer's Certificate;. Each set of financial
statements delivered to a holder of Notes pursuant to Section
7.1(a) or Section 7.1(b) hereof shall be accompanied by a

 Company's officers, and (with the consent of the Company,
 which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) its

 Company, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) to

 .c.Section 8. Prepayment of the Notes;.
 .c2.Section 8.1. Required Prepayments;. On May 4, 2006 and on each
May 4 thereafter to and including May 4, 2009 the Company will
prepay 20,000,000 principal amount (or such lesser principal
amount as shall then be outstanding) of the Notes at par and
without payment of the Make-Whole Amount or any premium; provided
that upon any partial prepayment of the Notes pursuant to Section
8.2 or Section 8.3 the principal amount of each required prepayment
of the Notes becoming due under this Section 8.1 on and after the
date of such prepayment or purchase shall be reduced in the same
proportion as the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes is
reduced as a result of such prepayment or purchase.
 .c2.Section 8.2. Optional Prepayments with Make-Whole Amount;. The
Company may, at its option, upon notice as provided below, prepay
at any time all, or from time to time any part of, the Notes, in an
amount not less than 10 of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding in the case of a partial prepayment, at 100 
of the principal amount so prepaid, together with interest accrued
thereon to the date of such prepayment, plus the Make-Whole Amount
determined for the prepayment date with respect to such principal
amount. The Company will give each holder of Notes written notice 

 23
of each optional prepayment under this Section 8.2 not less than 30
days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such
prepayment. Each such notice shall specify such date, the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid on such date,
the principal amount of each Note held by such holder to be prepaid
(determined in accordance with Section 8.4), and the interest to be
paid on the prepayment date with respect to such principal amount
being prepaid, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of a
Senior Financial Officer as to the estimated Make-Whole Amount due
in connection with such prepayment (calculated as if the date of
such notice were the date of the prepayment), setting forth the
details of such computation. Two Business Days prior to such
prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each holder of Notes a
certificate of a Senior Financial Officer specifying the
calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as of the specified
prepayment date.
 .c2.Section 8.3. Prepayment of Notes upon Change of Control;. (a)
(i) In the event that any Change of Control shall occur or any
Responsible Officer of the Company shall have knowledge of any
Control Event, the Company will give written notice (the "Company 
Notice") of such fact in the manner provided in Section 18 hereof
to the holders of the Notes. The Company Notice shall be delivered
promptly upon receipt of such knowledge by the Company and in any
event no later than three Business Days following the occurrence of
any Change of Control or Control Event, as the case may be. If a
Change in Control has occurred, the Company Notice shall also (1)
describe the facts and circumstances of such Change of Control in
reasonable detail, (2) make reference to this Section 8.3(a) and
the right of the holders of the Notes to require prepayment of the
Notes on the terms and conditions provided for in this Section
8.3(a), (3) offer in writing to prepay the outstanding Notes,
together with accrued interest to the date of prepayment, but
without premium, and (4) specify a date for such prepayment (the
"Change of Control Prepayment Date"), which Change of Control
Prepayment Date shall be not more than 90 days nor less than 30
days following the date of such Company Notice. Each holder of the
then outstanding Notes shall have the right to accept such offer
and require prepayment of the Notes held by such holder in full by
written notice to the Company (a "Noteholder Notice") given not
later than 20 days after receipt of the Company Notice. The
Company shall on the Change of Control Prepayment Date prepay in
full all of the Notes held by holders which have so accepted such
offer of prepayment. It is understood and agreed that the failure
of any holder of the Notes to accept or decline an offer of
prepayment pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall be deemed to be an
election by such holder to decline such prepayment. The prepayment
price of the Notes payable upon the occurrence of any Change of
Control shall be an amount equal to 100 of the outstanding
principal amount of the Notes so to be prepaid and accrued interest 

 24
thereon to the date of such prepayment, but without premium.
 (ii) The Company will not take any action that consummates or
finalizes a Change of Control unless at least ten days prior to
such action it shall have given to each holder of Notes written
notice containing and constituting an offer to prepay Notes as
described in subparagraph (a)(i) of this Section 8.3 and
contemporaneously with such action it prepays all Notes required to
be prepaid in accordance with subparagraph (a)(i) of this Section
8.3 as a result of such Change of Control having been consummated.
 (iii) The obligation of the Company to prepay Notes pursuant to
the offer required and accepted in accordance with subparagraph(a)
(i) of this Section 8.3 is subject to the occurrence of the Change
in Control in respect of which such offers and acceptances shall
have been made. In the event that such Change in Control does not
occur on the Change of Control Prepayment Date, the prepayment
shall be deferred until and shall be made on the date on which such
Change in Control occurs. The Company shall keep each holder of
Notes reasonably and timely informed of (1) any such deferral of
the date of prepayment, (2) the date on which such Change in
Control and the prepayment are expected to occur, and (3) any
determination by the Company that efforts to effect such Change in
Control have ceased or been abandoned (in which case the offers and
acceptances made pursuant to this Section 8.3 in respect of such
Change in Control shall be deemed rescinded).
 (b)(i) Without limiting the foregoing, notwithstanding any
failure on the part of the Company to give the Company Notice
herein required as a result of the occurrence of a Change of
Control, each holder of the Notes shall have the right by delivery
of written notice to the Company to require the Company to prepay,
and the Company will prepay, such holder's Notes in full, together
with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment, but
without premium. Notice of any required prepayment pursuant to
this Section 8.3(b)(i) may be delivered by any holder of the Notes
which was entitled to, but did not receive, such Company Notice to
the Company after such holder has actual knowledge of such Change
of Control. On the date (the "Change of Control Delayed Prepayment
Date") designated in such holder's notice (which shall be on or
after the date of the Change of Control and shall be not more than
90 days nor less than 30 days following the date of such holder's
notice), the Company shall prepay in full all of the Notes held by
such holder, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of
prepayment, but without premium. If the holder of any Note gives
any notice pursuant to this Section 8.3(b)(i), the Company shall
give a Company Notice within three Business Days of receipt of such
notice and identify the Change of Control Delayed Prepayment Date
to all other holders of the Notes and each of such other holders
shall then and thereupon have the right to accept the Company's
offer to prepay the Notes held by such holder in full and require
prepayment of such Notes by delivery of a Noteholder Notice within 

 25
20 days following receipt of such Company Notice; provided only
that any date for prepayment of such holder's Notes shall be the
Change of Control Delayed Prepayment Date. On the Change of
Control Delayed Prepayment Date, the Company shall prepay in full
the Notes of each holder thereof which has accepted such offer of
prepayment at a prepayment price equal to 100 of the outstanding
principal amount of the Notes so to be prepaid and accrued interest
thereon to the date of such prepayment, but without premium.
 (ii) Compliance with the provisions of this Section 8.3(b)
shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of, or consent to, any
Default or Event of Default caused by any violation of the
provisions of Section 8.3(a).
 .c2.Section 8.4. Allocation of Partial Prepayments;. In the case
of each partial prepayment of the Notes pursuant to Section 8.2,
the principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid shall be allocated
among all of the Notes at the time outstanding in proportion, as
nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amounts
thereof not theretofore called for prepayment. All partial
prepayments made pursuant to Section 8.3 shall be applied only to
the Notes of the holders who have elected to participate in such
prepayment.
 .c2.'Section 8.5. Maturity; Surrender, Etc';. In the case of each
prepayment of Notes pursuant to this Section 8, the principal
amount of each Note to be prepaid shall mature and become due and
payable on the date fixed for such prepayment, together with
interest on such principal amount accrued to such date and the
applicable Make-Whole Amount, if any. From and after such date,
unless the Company shall fail to pay such principal amount when so
due and payable, together with the interest and Make-Whole Amount,
if any, as aforesaid, interest on such principal amount shall cease
to accrue. Any Note paid or prepaid in full shall be surrendered
to the Company and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and no Note 
shall be issued in lieu of any prepaid principal amount of any
Note.
 .c2.Section 8.6. Purchase of Notes;. The Company will not and will
not permit any Affiliate to purchase, redeem, prepay or otherwise
acquire, directly or indirectly, any of the outstanding Notes
except upon the payment or prepayment of the Notes in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Notes. The Company will
promptly cancel all Notes acquired by it or any Affiliate pursuant
to any payment, prepayment or purchase of Notes pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement and no Notes may be issued in
substitution or exchange for any such Notes.
 .c2.Section 8.7. Make-Whole Amount;. The term "Make-Whole Amount"
means, with respect to any Note, an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments
with respect to the Called Principal of such Note over the amount
of such Called Principal; provided that the Make-Whole Amount may
in no event be less than zero. For the purposes of determining the 

 26
Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following meanings:
 "Called Principal" means, with respect to any Note, the
 principal of such Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to
 Section 8.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately due
 and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.
 "Discounted Value" means, with respect to the Called
 Principal of any Note, the amount obtained by discounting all
 Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called
 Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the
 Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in
 accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount
 factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which
 interest on the Notes is payable) equal to the Reinvestment
 Yield with respect to such Called Principal.
 "Reinvestment Yield" means, with respect to the Called
 Principal of any Note, 0.5 over the yield to maturity implied
 by (a) the yields reported, as of 10:00 A.M. (New York City
 time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date
 with respect to such Called Principal, on the display
 designated as "Page USD" of the Bloomberg Financial Markets
 Services Screen (or, if not available, any other national
 recognized trading screen reporting on-line intraday trading
 in the U.S. Treasury securities) for actively traded U.S.
 Treasury securities having a maturity equal to the Remaining
 Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement
 Date, or (b) if such yields are not reported as of such time
 or the yields reported as of such time are not ascertainable,
 the Treasury Constant Maturity Series Yields reported, for the
 latest day for which such yields have been so reported as of
 the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with
 respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve
 Statistical Release H.15 (519) (or any comparable successor
 publication) for actively traded U.S. Treasury securities
 having a constant maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life
 of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. Such
 implied yield will be determined, if necessary, by (i)
 converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond-equivalent
 yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (ii)
 interpolating linearly between (1) the actively traded U.S.
 Treasury security with the maturity closest to and greater
 than the Remaining Average Life and (2) the actively traded
 U.S. Treasury security with the maturity closest to and less
 than the Remaining Average Life.
 "Remaining Average Life" means, with respect to any
 Called Principal, the number of years (calculated to the
 nearest one-twelfth year) obtained by dividing (a) such Called
 Principal into (b) the sum of the products obtained by
 multiplying (i) the principal component of each Remaining
 Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by 
 
 27
 (ii) the number of years (calculated to the nearest
 one-twelfth year) that will elapse between the Settlement Date
 with respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due
 date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment.
 "Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to the
 Called Principal of any Note, all payments of such Called
 Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the
 Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no
 payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its
 scheduled due date; provided that if such Settlement Date is
 not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under
 the terms of the Notes, then the amount of the next succeeding
 scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of
 interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be
 paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to Section 8.2 or 12.1.
 "Settlement Date" means, with respect to the Called
 Principal of any Note, the date on which such Called Principal
 is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or is
 declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section
 12.1, as the context requires.
 .c.Section 9. Affirmative Covenants;.

cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, ordinances

will obtain and maintain in effect all licenses, certificates,
permits, franchises and other governmental authorizations necessary
to the ownership of their respective properties or to the conduct
of their respective businesses, in each case to the extent
necessary to ensure that non-compliance with such laws, ordinances
or governmental rules or regulations or failures to obtain or
maintain in effect such licenses, certificates, permits, franchises
and other governmental authorizations could not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.
 .c2.Section 9.2. Insurance;. The Company will, and will cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, maintain, with financially sound and
reputable insurers, insurance with respect to their respective
properties and businesses against such casualties and
contingencies, of such types, on such terms and in such amounts
(including deductibles, co-insurance and self-insurance, if
adequate reserves are maintained with respect thereto) as is
customary in the case of entities of established reputations
engaged in the same or a similar business and similarly situated.
 .c2.Section 9.3. Maintenance of Properties;. The Company will, and
will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain and keep, or cause 

 28
to be maintained and kept, their respective properties in good
repair, working order and condition (other than ordinary wear and
tear), so that the business carried on in connection therewith may
be properly conducted at all times; provided that this Section
shall not prevent the Company or any Subsidiary from discontinuing
the operation and the maintenance of any of its properties if such
discontinuance is desirable in the conduct of its business and the
Company has concluded that such discontinuance could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.
 .c2.Section 9.4. Payment of Taxes and Claims;. The Company will,
and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, file all tax returns
required to be filed in any jurisdiction and to pay and discharge
all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other
taxes, assessments, governmental charges, or levies imposed on them
or any of their properties, assets, income or franchises, to the
extent such taxes and assessments have become due and payable and
before they have become delinquent and all claim for which sums
have become due and payable that have or might become a Lien on
properties or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary; provided
that neither the Company nor any Subsidiary need pay any such tax
or assessment or claims if (a) the amount, applicability or
validity thereof is contested by the Company or such Subsidiary on
a timely basis in good faith and in appropriate proceedings, and
the Company or a Subsidiary has established adequate reserves
therefor in accordance with GAAP on the books of the Company or
such Subsidiary or (b) the nonpayment of all such taxes and
assessments in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.
 .c2.Section 9.5. Corporate Existence, Etc;. The Company will at all
times preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate
existence. Subject to Sections 10.4 and 10.5, the Company will at
all times preserve and keep in full force and effect the corporate
existence of each of its Subsidiaries (unless merged into the
Company or a Subsidiary) and all rights and franchises of the
Company and its Subsidiaries unless, in the good faith judgment of
the Company, the termination of or failure to preserve and keep in
full force and effect such corporate existence, right or franchise
could not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect.
 .c2.Section 9.6. Nature of Business;. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary will engage in any business other than (a) any business
conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries on the date of this
Agreement (an "Existing Business"), (b) any business related,
ancillary or complementary to an Existing Business, (c) any
business reasonably developed, derived or extended from an Existing

11 (other than an Event of Default described in clause (i) of
paragraph (g) or described in clause (vi) of paragraph (g) by
virtue of the fact that such clause encompasses clause (i) of
paragraph (g)) has occurred, all the Notes then outstanding shall
automatically become immediately due and payable.
 (b) If any other Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, any holder or holders of more than 50 in principal
amount of the Notes at the time outstanding may at any time at its
or their option, by notice or notices to the Company, declare all
the Notes then outstanding to be immediately due and payable.

 39
hereby waived. The Company acknowledges, and the parties hereto
agree, that each holder of a Note has the right to maintain its
investment in the Notes free from repayment by the Company (except
as herein specifically provided for), and that the provision for
payment of a Make-Whole Amount by the Company in the event that the
Notes are prepaid or are accelerated as a result of an Event of
Default, is intended to provide compensation for the deprivation of
such right under such circumstances.
 .c2.Section 12.2. Other Remedies;. If any Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, and irrespective of whether
any Notes have become or have been declared immediately due and
payable under Section 12.1, the holder of any Note at the time
outstanding may proceed to protect and enforce the rights of such
holder by an action at law, suit in equity or other appropriate
proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any agreement
contained herein or in any Note, or for an injunction against a
violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or
otherwise.
 .c2.Section 12.3. Rescission;. At any time after any Notes have been
declared due and payable pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of Section
12.1, the holders of not less than 66-2/3 in principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company, may
rescind and annul any such declaration and its consequences (a) if
the Company has paid all overdue interest on the Notes, all
principal of and Make-Whole Amount, if any, on any Notes that are
due and payable and are unpaid other than by reason of such
declaration, and all interest on such overdue principal and
Make-Whole Amount, if any, and (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) any overdue interest in respect of the Notes, at
the Default Rate, (b) if all Events of Default and Defaults, other
than non-payment of amounts that have become due solely by reason
of such declaration, have been cured or have been waived pursuant
to Section 17, (c) if no judgment or decree has been entered for
the payment of any monies due pursuant hereto or to the Notes and
(d) if any Note has been declared due and payable pursuant to
clause (c) of Section 12.1, then each holder which has so declared
the Notes held by it to be due and payable shall have concurred in
such decision to so rescind and annul such declaration and its
consequences and if any such holder which has so declared its Notes
to be due and payable has not so concurred in such rescission and 
annulment, then the Notes held by such holder shall,
notwithstanding such rescission and annulment, remain due and
payable. No rescission and annulment under this Section 12.3 will
extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default or
impair any right consequent thereon.
 .c2.Section 12.4. No Waivers or Election of Remedies, Expenses, Etc;. 
No course of dealing and no delay on the part of any holder of any
Note in exercising any right, power or remedy shall operate as a 

 40
waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers
or remedies. No right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement
or by any Note upon any holder thereof shall be exclusive of any
other right, power or remedy referred to herein or therein or now
or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. 
Without limiting the obligations of the Company under Section 15,
the Company will pay to the holder of each Note on demand such
further amount as shall be sufficient to cover all costs and
expenses of such holder incurred in any enforcement or collection
under this Section 12, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements.
 .c.'Section 13. Registration; Exchange; Substitution of Notes';.
 .c2.Section 13.1. Registration of Notes;. The Company shall keep at
its principal executive office a register for the registration and
registration of transfers of Notes. The name and address of each
holder of one or more Notes, each transfer thereof and the name and
address of each transferee of one or more Notes shall be registered
in such register. Prior to due presentment for registration of
transfer, the Person in whose name any Note shall be registered
shall be deemed and treated as the owner and holder thereof for all
purposes hereof, and the Company shall not be affected by any
notice or knowledge to the contrary. The Company shall give to any
holder of a Note that is an Institutional Investor promptly upon
request therefor, a complete and correct copy of the names and
addresses of all registered holders of Notes.
 .c2.Section 13.2. Transfer and Exchange of Notes;. Upon surrender
of any Note at the principal executive office of the Company for
registration of transfer or exchange (and in the case of a
surrender for registration of transfer, duly endorsed or
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly executed by
the registered holder of such Note or its attorney duly authorized
in writing and accompanied by the address for notices of each
transferee of such Note or part thereof), the Company shall execute
and deliver, at the Company's expense (except as provided below),
one or more new Notes (as requested by the holder thereof) in
exchange therefor, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unpaid principal amount of the surrendered Note. Each such new
Note shall be payable to such Person as such holder may request and
shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit 1. Each such new
Note shall be dated and bear interest from the date to which
interest shall have been paid on the surrendered Note or dated the
date of the surrendered Note if no interest shall have been paid
thereon. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any stamp tax or governmental charge imposed in respect of
any such transfer of Notes. Notes shall not be transferred in
denominations of less than 100,000; provided that if necessary to
enable the registration of transfer by a holder of its entire
holding of Notes, one Note may be in a denomination of less than
 100,000. Any transferee, by its acceptance of a Note registered 

 41
in its name (or the name of its nominee), shall be deemed to have
made the representation set forth in Section 6.2.
 .c2.Section 13.3. Replacement of Notes;. Upon receipt by the Company
of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the ownership of and
the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note (which
evidence shall be, in the case of an Institutional Investor, notice
from such Institutional Investor of such ownership and such loss,
theft, destruction or mutilation), and
 (a) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of
 indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it (provided that if the
 holder of such Note is, or is a nominee for, an original
 Purchaser or another holder of a Note with a minimum net worth
 of at least 50,000,000, such Person's own unsecured agreement
 of indemnity shall be deemed to be satisfactory), or
 (b) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and
 cancellation thereof,
 the Company at its own expense shall execute and deliver, in lieu
thereof, a new Note, dated and bearing interest from the date to
which interest shall have been paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed
or mutilated Note or dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed
or mutilated Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon.
 .c.Section 14. Payments on Notes;.
 .c2.Section 14.1. Place of Payment;. Subject to Section 14.2,
payments of principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest
becoming due and payable on the Notes shall be made at the
principal office of the Company in Simpsonville, South Carolina. 
The Company may at any time, by notice to each holder of a Note,
change the place of payment of the Notes so long as such place of
payment shall be either the principal office of the Company in such
jurisdiction or the principal office of a bank or trust company in
such jurisdiction.
 .c2.Section 14.2. Home Office Payment;. So long as you or your
nominee shall be the holder of any Note, and notwithstanding
anything contained in Section 14.1 or in such Note to the contrary,
the Company will pay all sums becoming due on such Note for
principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest by the method
and at the address specified for such purpose below your name in
Schedule A, or by such other method or at such other address as you
shall have from time to time specified to the Company in writing
for such purpose, without the presentation or surrender of such
Note or the making of any notation thereon, except that upon
written request of the Company made concurrently with or reasonably
promptly after payment or prepayment in full of any Note, you shall
surrender such Note for cancellation, reasonably promptly after any
such request, to the Company at its principal executive office or
at the place of payment most recently designated by the Company
pursuant to Section 14.1. Prior to any sale or other disposition
of any Note held by you or your nominee you will, at your election,
either endorse thereon the amount of principal paid thereon and the 

 42
last date to which interest has been paid thereon or surrender such
Note to the Company in exchange for a new Note or Notes pursuant to
Section 13.2. The Company will afford the benefits of this Section
14.2 to any Institutional Investor that is the direct or indirect
transferee of any Note purchased by you under this Agreement and
that has made the same agreement relating to such Note as you have
made in this Section 14.2.
 .c.Section 15. Expenses, Etc;.
 .c2.Section 15.1. Transaction Expenses;. Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Company will
pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees of
a special counsel and, if reasonably required, local or other
counsel) incurred by you and each Other Purchaser or holder of a
Note in connection with such transactions and in connection with
any amendments, waivers or consents under or in respect of this
Agreement, the Notes, the Subsidiary Guaranty or the Bank Credit
Agreement (whether or not such amendment, waiver or consent becomes
effective), including, without limitation: (a) the costs and
expenses incurred in enforcing or defending (or determining whether
or how to enforce or defend) any rights under this Agreement, the
Notes or the Subsidiary Guaranty or in responding to any subpoena
or other legal process or informal investigative demand issued in
connection with this Agreement, the Notes or the Subsidiary
Guaranty, or by reason of being a holder of any Note, and (b) the
costs and expenses, including financial advisors' fees, incurred in
connection with the insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or any
Subsidiary or in connection with any work-out or restructuring of
the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Subsidiary Guaranty
or the Notes at any time after a Default or Event of Default has
occurred or is continuing or at any other time at the request of
the Company. The Company will pay, and will save you and each
other holder of a Note harmless from, all claims in respect of any
fees, costs or expenses, if any, of brokers and finders (other than
those retained by you).
 .c2.Section 15.2. Survival;. The obligations of the Company under
this Section 15 will survive the payment or transfer of any Note,
the enforcement, amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or the Notes, and the termination of this Agreement.
 .c.'Section 16. Survival of Representations and Warranties; Entire
 Agreement';.
 All representations and warranties contained herein shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes,
the purchase or transfer by you of any Note or portion thereof or
interest therein and the payment of any Note, and may be relied
upon by any subsequent holder of a Note, regardless of any
investigation made at any time by or on behalf of you or any other
holder of a Note. All statements contained in any certificate or
other instrument delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant
to this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties of 

 43
the Company under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement and the Notes embody the entire agreement
and understanding between you and the Company and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter
hereof.
 .c.Section 17. Amendment and Waiver;.
 .c2.Section 17.1. Requirements;. This Agreement and the Notes may
be amended, and the observance of any term hereof or of the Notes
may be waived (either retroactively or prospectively), with (and
only with) the written consent of the Company and the Required
Holders, except that (a) no amendment or waiver of any of the
provisions of Section 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 21 hereof, or any defined
term (as it is used therein), will be effective as to you unless
consented to by you in writing, and (b) no such amendment or waiver
may, without the written consent of the holder of each Note at the
time outstanding affected thereby, (i) subject to the provisions of
Section 12 relating to acceleration or rescission, change the
amount or time of any prepayment or payment of principal of, or
reduce the rate or change the time of payment or method of
computation of interest or of the Make-Whole Amount on, the Notes,
(ii) change the percentage of the principal amount of the Notes the
holders of which are required to consent to any such amendment or
waiver, or (iii) amend any of Sections 8, 11(a), 11(b), 12, 17 or
20.
 .c2.Section 17.2. Solicitation of Holders of Notes;.
 (a) Solicitation. The Company will provide each holder of
the Notes (irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it)
with sufficient information, sufficiently far in advance of the
date a decision is required, to enable such holder to make an
informed and considered decision with respect to any proposed
amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the provisions
hereof or of the Notes. The Company will deliver executed or true
and correct copies of each amendment, waiver or consent effected
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 17 to each holder of
outstanding Notes promptly following the date on which it is
executed and delivered by, or receives the consent or approval of,
the requisite holders of Notes.
 (b) Payment. The Company will not directly or indirectly pay
or cause to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of
supplemental or additional interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any
security, to any holder of Notes as consideration for or as an
inducement to the entering into by any holder of Notes of any
waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions hereof
unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or security is
concurrently granted, on the same terms, ratably to each holder of
Notes then outstanding even if such holder did not consent to such
waiver or amendment.
 .c2.Section 17.3. Binding Effect, Etc;. Any amendment or waiver
consented to as provided in this Section 17 applies equally to all 

 44
holders of Notes and is binding upon them and upon each future
holder of any Note and upon the Company without regard to whether
such Note has been marked to indicate such amendment or waiver. No
such amendment or waiver will extend to or affect any obligation,
covenant, agreement, Default or Event of Default not expressly
amended or waived or impair any right consequent thereon. No
course of dealing between the Company and the holder of any Note
nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note
shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder of such Note. 
As used herein, the term "this Agreement" and references thereto
shall mean this Agreement as it may from time to time be amended or
supplemented.
 .c2.Section 17.4. Notes Held by Company, Etc;. Solely for the
purpose of determining whether the holders of the requisite
percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then
outstanding approved or consented to any amendment, waiver or
consent to be given under this Agreement or the Notes, or have
directed the taking of any action provided herein or in the Notes
to be taken upon the direction of the holders of a specified
percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then
outstanding, Notes directly or indirectly owned by the Company or
any of its Affiliates shall be deemed not to be outstanding.
 .c.Section 18. Notices;.
 All notices and communications provided for hereunder shall be
in writing and sent (a) by telefacsimile if the sender on the same
day sends a confirming copy of such notice by a recognized
overnight delivery service (charges prepaid), or (b) by registered
or certified mail with return receipt requested (postage prepaid),
or (c) by a recognized overnight delivery service (with charges
prepaid). Any such notice must be sent:
 (i) if to you or your nominee, to you or it at the
 address specified for such communications in Schedule A, or at
 such other address as you or it shall have specified to the
 Company in writing,
 (ii) if to any other holder of any Note, to such holder
 at such address as such other holder shall have specified to
 the Company in writing, or
 (iii) if to the Company, to the Company at its address set
 forth at the beginning hereof to the attention of D. Ray Cash,
 or at such other address as the Company shall have specified
 to the holder of each Note in writing.
 Notices under this Section 18 will be deemed given only when
actually received.
 .c.Section 19. Reproduction of Documents;.
 This Agreement and all documents relating thereto, including,
without limitation, (a) consents, waivers and modifications that
may hereafter be executed, (b) documents received by you at the
Closing (except the Notes themselves), and (c) financial
statements, certificates and other information previously or 

 45
hereafter furnished to you, may be reproduced by you by any
photographic, photostatic, microfilm, microcard, miniature
photographic or other similar process and you may destroy any
original document so reproduced. The Company agrees and stipulates
that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any such
reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself
in any judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the
original is in existence and whether or not such reproduction was
made by you in the regular course of business) and any enlargement,
facsimile or further reproduction of such reproduction shall
likewise be admissible in evidence. This Section 19 shall not
prohibit the Company or any other holder of Notes from contesting
any such reproduction to the same extent that it could contest the
original, or from introducing evidence to demonstrate the
inaccuracy of any such reproduction.
 .c.Section 20. Confidential Information;.
 For the purposes of this Section 20, "Confidential
Information" means information delivered to you by or on behalf of
the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the transactions
contemplated by or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement that is
proprietary in nature and that was clearly marked or labeled or
otherwise adequately identified in writing when received by you as
being confidential information of the Company or such Subsidiary;
provided that such term does not include information that (a) was
publicly known or otherwise known to you prior to the time of such
disclosure, (b) subsequently becomes publicly known through no act
or omission by you or any Person acting on your behalf, (c)
otherwise becomes known to you other than through disclosure by the
Company or any Subsidiary or by any other Person of which you have
actual knowledge is subject to a confidentiality agreement with the
Company, or (d) constitutes financial statements delivered to you
under Section 7.1 that are otherwise publicly available. You will
maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information in
accordance with procedures adopted by you in good faith to protect
confidential information of third parties delivered to you;
provided that you may deliver or disclose Confidential Information
to (i) your directors, trustees, officers, employees, attorneys and
affiliates (to the extent such disclosure reasonably relates to the
administration of the investment represented by your Notes), (ii)
your financial advisors, other professional advisors or agents who
agree to hold confidential the Confidential Information
substantially in accordance with the terms of this Section 20,
(iii) any other holder of any Note, (iv) any Institutional Investor
to which you sell or offer to sell such Note or any part thereof or
any participation therein (if such Person has agreed in writing
prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound
by the provisions of this Section 20), (v) any Person from which
you offer to purchase any security of the Company (if such Person
has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential 

 46
Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (vi)
any federal or state regulatory authority having jurisdiction over
you, (vii) the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or
any similar organization, or any nationally recognized rating
agency that requires access to information about your investment
portfolio or (viii) any other Person to which such delivery or
disclosure may be necessary or appropriate (w) to effect compliance
with any law, rule, regulation or order applicable to you, (x) in
response to any subpoena or other legal process, (y) in connection
with any litigation to which you are a party or (z) if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent you may
reasonably determine such delivery and disclosure to be necessary
or appropriate in the enforcement or for the protection of the
rights and remedies under your Notes and this Agreement. Each
holder of a Note, by its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to
have agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of
this Section 20 as though it were a party to this Agreement. On
reasonable request by the Company in connection with the delivery
to any holder of a Note of information required to be delivered to
such holder under this Agreement or requested by such holder (other
than a holder that is a party to this Agreement or its nominee),
such holder will enter into an agreement with the Company embodying
the provisions of this Section 20.
 .c.Section 21. Substitution of Purchaser;.
 You shall have the right to substitute any one of your
Affiliates as the purchaser of the Notes that you have agreed to
purchase hereunder, by written notice to the Company, which notice
shall be signed by both you and such Affiliate, shall contain such
Affiliate's agreement to be bound by this Agreement and shall
contain a confirmation by such Affiliate of the accuracy with
respect to it of the representations set forth in Section 6. Upon
receipt of such notice, wherever the word "you" is used in this
Agreement (other than in this Section 21), such word shall be
deemed to refer to such Affiliate in lieu of you. In the event
that such Affiliate is so substituted as a purchaser hereunder and
such Affiliate thereafter transfers to you all of the Notes then
held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by the Company of notice of
such transfer, wherever the word "you" is used in this Agreement
(other than in this Section 21), such word shall no longer be
deemed to refer to such Affiliate, but shall refer to you, and you
shall have all the rights of an original holder of the Notes under
this Agreement.
 .c.Section 22. Miscellaneous;.
 .c2.Section 22.1. Successors and Assigns;. All covenants and other
agreements contained in this Agreement by or on behalf of any of
the parties hereto bind and inure to the benefit of their
respective successors and assigns (including, without limitation,
any subsequent holder of a Note) whether so expressed or not.
 .c2.Section 22.2. Payments Due on Non-Business Days;. Anything in 

 47
this Agreement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding, any
payment of principal of or Make-Whole Amount or interest on any
Note that is due on a date other than a Business Day shall be made
on the next succeeding Business Day without including the
additional days elapsed in the computation of the interest payable
on such next succeeding Business Day.
 .c2.Section 22.3. Severability;. Any provision of this Agreement
that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as
to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in
any jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by law) not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction.
 .c2.Section 22.4. Construction;. Each covenant contained herein
shall be construed (absent express provision to the contrary) as
being independent of each other covenant contained herein, so that
compliance with any one covenant shall not (absent such an express
contrary provision) be deemed to excuse compliance with any other
covenant. Where any provision herein refers to action to be taken
by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such
provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly
or indirectly by such Person.
 .c2.Section 22.5. Counterparts;. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but
all of which together shall constitute one instrument. Each
counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof, each signed
by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties
hereto.
 .c2.Section 22.6. Governing Law;. This Agreement shall be construed
and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties
shall be governed by, the law of the State of New York, excluding
choice-of-law principles of the law of such State that would
require the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than
such State.

48
 If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign the
form of agreement on the accompanying counterpart of this Agreement
and return it to the Company, whereupon the foregoing shall become
a binding agreement between you and the Company.
 .c4.Signature;
 Very truly yours,
