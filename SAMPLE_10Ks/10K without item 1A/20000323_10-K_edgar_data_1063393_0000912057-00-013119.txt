 PART I

ITEM 1--BUSINESS

GENERAL

 Great Lakes REIT, a Maryland real estate investment trust that is the
successor to a business that began operations in 1992 (the "Company"), is a
fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate company. As of
December 31, 1999, the Company owned and operated 36 properties (the
"Properties") in the Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Detroit, Columbus, Denver
and Cincinnati areas (the "Current Markets"). The Properties contain
approximately 5.2 million rentable square feet leased to more than 500 tenants
with a weighted average occupancy rate of approximately 94 as of January 1,
2000. The Company has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a
real estate investment trust ("REIT"). The Company conducts substantially all of
its operations through Great Lakes REIT, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), of
which the Company is the sole general partner. All references to the "Company"
in this Form 10-K include the Company and the Operating Partnership unless the
context otherwise requires.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

 The Company's primary business strategy is to acquire, own and operate
well-located, underperforming suburban office properties generally located in
the Current Markets at attractive yields and to increase cash flow and property
value by implementing a comprehensive operating strategy. The Company's
operating strategy includes: (i) investment in value-enhancing renovation and
refurbishment programs; (ii) aggressive leasing efforts; (iii) reduction and
containment of operating costs; and (iv) a strong emphasis on tenant services
and satisfaction. The Company seeks to establish itself as one of the suburban
office property owner/operators of choice in the markets it serves and to
maximize tenant retention.

 The Company continues to evaluate certain markets outside the Current
Markets. In the event an appropriate acquisition opportunity is identified that
is consistent with the other elements of the Company's primary business
strategy, the Company may acquire properties in markets outside the Current
Markets. In addition, the Company may from time to time consider acquiring
properties located in select urban or central business district areas. In 1998,
the Company purchased assets in suburban Denver and in the central business
districts of Milwaukee and Columbus.

 The Company also intends to pursue limited new property development
opportunities that are otherwise consistent with the Company's overall business
strategy. In 1999, the Company completed the acquisition of a newly developed
96,700 square foot property in suburban Milwaukee which the Company had caused
to be built. The Company also intends to enhance its leasing flexibility by
offering build-to-suit development options to current and prospective tenants
who require space that is otherwise unavailable in a particular market. In
addition, the Company will continue to pursue the redevelopment of older
properties in attractive locations.

 As part of its goal of maximizing shareholder value, the Company will engage
in strategic dispositions of select Properties. The Company typically will seek
to dispose of Properties when one or more of the following conditions is
present: (i) market prices at or near replacement cost; (ii) high occupancy and
limited potential to increase cash flow and property value within a reasonable
period; (iii) the Company believes that its capital can be redeployed more
efficiently; and (iv) ownership of the Property is no longer consistent with the
Company's business strategy. The Company sold five properties in 1999
aggregating 345,000 square feet or 6.6 of its portfolio as of the beginning of
the year resulting in net sales proceeds of 22.7 million. Subsequent to
December 31, 1999, the Company signed a contract to sell its Downers Grove,
Illinois property for 12.7 million.

 3
 
FINANCING STRATEGY

 The Company seeks to maintain a well-balanced, conservative and flexible
capital structure by: (i) currently targeting a ratio of long-term debt to total
market capitalization in the range of 40 to 50 ; (ii) extending and sequencing
the maturity dates of its debt; (iii) focusing on borrowing at fixed rates;
(iv) pursuing debt financings and refinancings on an unsecured basis; and
(v) maintaining relatively conservative debt service and fixed charge coverage
ratios. In addition, as discussed under Item 7, "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," the Company has a
 150 million unsecured credit facility that is generally used for short-term
funding of acquisition of additional properties and for working capital
requirements. The Company's debt to total market capitalization ratio (total
market capitalization is defined as the total market value of all outstanding
Common and Preferred Shares and units of limited partnership interest in the
Operating Partnership plus outstanding indebtedness) at March 2, 2000 was 42.5 .

COMPETITION

 All of the Properties are located in competitive markets. The properties
with which the Company competes for tenants are generally owned by institutional
investors, other REITs or local real estate operators, however, no single
competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in any of the Current
Markets. An increase in the supply and a decrease in the demand for rental
properties with characteristics similar to those of the Properties may adversely
affect rental rates or the Company's ability to lease space at the Properties or
other newly acquired properties. During 1999, vacancy rates in the Current
Markets trended upward modestly, however the effect of the increase is not
anticipated to be material to the Company. In addition, the Company may be
competing with other owners and operators that have greater financial resources
and more experience than the Company.

INSURANCE

 The Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and
rental loss insurance covering all of the Properties, with policy specifications
and insured limits that the Company believes are adequate and appropriate under
the circumstances. There are, however, certain types of losses that are not
generally insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically
feasible to insure. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured
limits occur, the Company could lose its capital invested in any of the
Properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from such Property and,
in the case of recourse debt, the Company would remain obligated for any
mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to such Property. Any such
loss would adversely affect the Company. Moreover, as the general partner of the
Operating Partnership, the Company will generally be liable for any of the
Operating Partnership's unsatisfied obligations other than non-recourse
obligations. The Company believes that the Properties are adequately insured;
however, no assurance can be given that material losses in excess of insurance
proceeds will not occur in the future.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

 Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be
required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum
product releases at such property and may be held liable to a governmental
entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and
clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination.
Such laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard
to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants, and the
liability under such laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless
the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of
responsibility. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of such
substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the
failure to properly remediate the contamination on such property, may adversely
affect the owner's ability to sell or rent such property or to

 4
 
borrow using such property as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal
or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment
facility also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of a release
of hazardous or toxic substances at such disposal or treatment facility, whether
or not such facility is owned or operated by such person. In addition, some
environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the
government for damages and costs incurred in connection with the contamination.
Finally, the owner of a site may be subject to common law claims by third
parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination
emanating from such site.

 During the last four years, independent environmental consultants have
conducted or updated Phase I Environmental Assessments ("Phase I Assessments")
at each of the Properties. In addition, a limited-scope Phase II Assessment
("Phase II Assessment") has been conducted at the property located at
2221 University Ave. SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota (the Phase I Assessments and the
Phase II Assessment are collectively referred to as the "Environmental
Assessments"). The Phase I Assessments have included, among other things, a
visual inspection of the Properties and the surrounding area and a review of
relevant state, federal and historical documents. Except for the Phase II
Assessment and certain limited sampling in connection with underground tank
and/or piping removals at the properties located at 601 Campus Dr., Arlington
Heights, Illinois and 11270 W. Park Place, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, no invasive
techniques such as soil or groundwater sampling were performed at any of the
Properties. The Company's Environmental Assessments of the Properties have not
revealed any condition giving rise to an environmental liability that the
Company believes would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
assets or results of operations, taken as a whole, nor is the Company otherwise
aware of any such condition. There can be no assurance, however, that the
Company's Environmental Assessments would reveal all conditions giving rise to
environmental liabilities. Moreover, there can be no assurance that (i) future
laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental
liability or (ii) the current environmental condition of the Properties will not
be affected by tenants, by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity
of the Properties (such as the presence of underground storage tanks), or by
third parties unrelated to the Company.

OTHER MATTERS

 The Company's operations are not dependent on a single or few customers; no
single customer accounts for more than 5 of the Company's total revenue. The
Company's operations are not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. As of
December 31, 1999, the Company employed 85 persons, none of whom is represented
by a collective bargaining unit.

 For additional information about the Company's investments and operations,
see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations," and Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data." For additional information about the Company's business segments, see
Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

ITEM 2--PROPERTIES

GENERAL

 As of December 31, 1999, the Company owned 36 Properties containing
approximately 5.2 million square feet. The Properties consist primarily of
Class A and Class B suburban office properties, which range in size from
approximately 36,000 to 375,000 rentable square feet. The Properties consist of
29 suburban office properties, two central business district office buildings,
and 5 office/service centers (generally single-story buildings with both
finished office and unfinished storage area). The 36 Properties are located
primarily in the suburban areas of Chicago (14), Milwaukee (7), Minneapolis (2),
Detroit (6), Columbus (4), Denver (2) and Cincinnati (1). Many of the Properties
offer amenities, including indoor and outdoor parking, loading dock facilities,
on-site property management, in-house conference facilities and providers of
food and beverage service.

 5
 
 Management believes that the location and quality of construction of the
Properties, as well as the Company's reputation for providing superior tenant
service, enable the Company to attract and retain a diverse tenant base. As of
December 31, 1999, the Properties were leased to more than 500 tenants, no
single tenant accounted for more than 5 of the aggregate annualized base rent
of the Company's portfolio and only 20 tenants individually represented more
than 1 of such aggregate annualized base rent.

LEASES

 The Company's leases are structured for terms which range from one to ten
years but which average five years. The Company's leases are a mixture of net
leases (whereby tenants pay their pro rata share of real estate tax and
operating expenses), and gross leases (under which tenants typically pay for all
real estate tax and operating expenses above those for an established base year
or agreed expense floor). Leases on a significant portion of the rentable square
feet in the Company's portfolio are net leases that were in existence upon the
Company's acquisition of the Properties. However, whether structured as net
leases or gross leases, virtually all leases entered into by the Company require
tenants to reimburse the Company for the tenant's pro-rata share of real estate
tax and operating expense increases.

 Leases often contain provisions permitting tenants to renew at prevailing
market rates. Under the Company's leases, the Company is generally responsible
for structural repairs. Certain leases contain provisions, which permit the
tenant to terminate its lease upon written notice to the Company, subject to the
tenant's obligation to pay a termination penalty. Such termination penalties are
generally negotiated with a tenant when a lease is executed and are usually
calculated to compensate the Company for unamortized tenant improvements and
leasing commissions at the termination date, and, in certain instances, for rent
on the space for a period of months after the termination date.

 Lease Distributions. The following table sets forth information relating to
the distribution of the Company's leases based on rentable square feet under
lease, as of January 1, 2000.

ITEM 5-- MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS

 The Company's common shares of beneficial interest (the "Common Shares") are
listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the symbol "GL."

 As of March 2, 2000, there were approximately 340 holders of record of the
Common Shares, which excludes beneficial owners of shares registered in nominee
or street name.

 The table below sets forth for the periods indicated, the reported high and
low sale prices of the Common Shares on the NYSE Composite Tape and the
quarterly dividends per share paid by the Company on such shares.

Dividend... .30 .30 .32 .32 Dividend... .32 .34 .34 .34

The Company, in order to qualify as a REIT under the Code, is required to
make distributions (other than capital gain distributions) to its shareholders
with respect to each taxable year in amounts at least equal to (i) the sum of
(A) 95 of its "REIT taxable income" (computed without regard to the dividends
paid deduction and its net capital gain) and (B) 95 of the net income (after
tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (ii) the sum of certain items of
non-cash income. The Company's distribution strategy is to distribute what it
believes is a conservative percentage of its cash flow, permitting the Company
to retain funds for capital improvements and other investments while funding its
distributions.

 For federal income tax purposes, distributions may consist of ordinary
income dividends, nontaxable return of capital, capital gains or a combination
thereof. Distributions in excess of the Company's current and accumulated
earnings and profits (calculated for tax purposes) will constitute a nontaxable
return of capital rather than a dividend and will reduce the shareholder's basis
in his or her Common Shares for tax purposes. To the extent that a distribution
exceeds both the Company's current and accumulated earnings and profits and the
shareholder's basis in his or her shares, the amount of such excess will
generally be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of that shareholder's
shares. The Company annually notifies shareholders of the taxability of
distributions paid during the preceding year. The following table sets forth the
taxability of distributions paid in 1999, 1998 and 1997:

1999 1998 1997
 -------- -------- --------
 
Ordinary income........................................... 81.2 87.1 88.4 
Unrecaptured Section 1250 gains........................... 2.4

- ------------------------

(1) EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, gain on sale of properties,
 taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses. Because of the Company's REIT
 status, the Company does not pay income taxes. EBITDA should not be
 considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with
 GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or to cash flow
 from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure
 of the Company's liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund
 the Company's cash needs, including its ability to make distributions.

(2) The White Paper on Funds From Operations approved by the Board of Governors
 of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") in
 October 1999 (the "White Paper") defines Funds from Operations as net income
 (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from
 debt restructuring and sales of property, plus real estate related
 depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated
 partnerships and joint ventures. Management considers Funds from Operations
 an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT because it is
 predicated on cash flow analyses. The Company computes Funds from Operations
 in accordance with standards established by the White Paper which may differ
 from the methodology for calculating Funds from Operations utilized by other
 equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.
 Funds from Operations should not be considered as an alternative to net
 income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's
 financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (determined
 in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company's liquidity, nor is it
 indicative of funds available to fund the Company's cash needs, including
 its ability to make distributions.

During 1999, the Company acquired two properties. The operating results of
these properties have been included in the Company's financial statements from
the dates of their respective acquisitions. In addition, the Company sold five
properties in 1999. In 1998, the Company acquired six properties, and in 1999 a
full year of operations of these properties has been included in the Company's
financial statements. In analyzing the 1999 operating results of the Company,
the changes in rental and reimbursement income, real estate taxes, and other
property operating expenses from 1999 are due principally to: (i) the addition
of operating results from properties acquired in 1999 from the dates of their
respective acquisitions; (ii) the addition of a full year's operating results in
1999 of properties acquired in 1998 compared to the partial year's operating
results from the dates of their respective acquisitions in 1998; (iii) the
effect of property dispositions in 1999 and (iv) improved operations of
properties during 1999 compared to 1998. A summary of these changes as they
impact rental and reimbursement income, real estate taxes and other property
operating expenses for 1999 follows:

 Interest expense increased by 1,670 in 1999 as compared to 1998 as the
Company had increased amounts of outstanding indebtedness during 1999 compared
with 1998. This indebtedness was used to finance the acquisitions of properties
and the repurchase of common shares in 1999.

 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 2,809 in 1999 as
compared to 1998 as the Company had a gross book value of depreciable assets of
 410,878 at December 31, 1999 as compared to 388,068 at December 31, 1998.

 Gain on sale of properties increased by 8,076 in 1999 as compared to 1998
as the Company sold five properties in 1999 compared to none in 1998.

During 1998, the Company acquired six properties. The operating results of
these properties have been included in the Company's financial statements from
the dates of their respective acquisitions. In 1997, the Company acquired nine
properties, and in 1998 a full year of operations of these properties has been
included in the Company's financial statements. In analyzing the 1998 operating
results of the Company, the changes in rental and reimbursement income, real
estate taxes, and other property operating expenses from 1997 are due
principally to: (i) the addition of operating results from properties acquired
in 1998 from the dates of their respective acquisitions; (ii) the addition of a
full year's operating results in 1998 of properties acquired in 1997 compared to
the partial year's operating results from the dates of their respective
acquisitions in 1997 and (iii) improved operations of properties during 1998
compared to 1997. A summary of these changes as they impact rental and
reimbursement income, real estate taxes and other property operating expenses
for 1998 follows:

 Interest expense increased by 8,031 in 1998 compared to 1997 as the Company
had increased amounts of outstanding indebtedness during 1998 compared with
1997. This indebtedness was incurred to finance the acquisition of properties
during 1998.

 General and administrative expenses increased by 1,579 in 1998 as compared
to 1997 due to one-time costs associated with the conversion to a trust 307),
non-recurring costs associated with acquisitions not completed 56), legal fees
associated with acquisitions not completed 51), increased compensation costs
in 1998 820), increases in costs associated with shareholder relations 150)
and increases in other costs due to the increased size of the company 195).

 Depreciation and amortization increased in 1998 by 4,892 as the Company
incurred these expenses on 40 properties as of December 31, 1998 as compared to

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 Certain statements in this document constitute "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Company intends that such
"forward-looking statements" be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. The
words "believe", "expect" and "anticipate" and similar expressions identify
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the
Company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance,
but are subject to many uncertainties and factors relating to the Company's
operations and business environment that may cause the actual results of the
Company to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied
by such forward-looking statements. Examples of such uncertainties include, but
are not limited to, changes in interest rates, increased competition for
acquisition of new properties, unanticipated expenses and delays in acquiring
properties or increasing occupancy rates and regional economic and business
conditions.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements
principally through its working capital and net cash provided by operating
activities. The Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to
be adequate to meet operating requirements and to fund the payment of dividends
in order to comply with certain federal income tax requirements applicable to
real estate investment trusts ("REITs").

 The Company expects to meet its liquidity requirements for property
acquisitions and significant capital improvements through property dispositions
and additional borrowings on its existing 150,000 unsecured line of credit that
matures in April 2001. The Company had 43,000 available for future borrowings
under its unsecured line of credit at December 31, 1999.

 The Company expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements (such as
scheduled mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, and significant
capital improvements) through long-term collateralized and uncollateralized
borrowings, the issuance of debt or equity securities and targeted property
dispositions.

 During 1999, the Company repurchased 778,601 of its common shares for an
aggregate purchase price of 12,157. Funds for the share repurchases came from
borrowings under the Company's unsecured line of credit, property dispositions
and working capital.

 17
 
STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

 1999 COMPARED TO 1998

 Cash provided by operating activities increased by 5,792 as the Company
acquired two properties in 1999 and recorded a full-year of operations in 1999
for properties acquired in 1998 as compared to a partial year in 1998.

 Cash used by investing activities declined by 120,091 primarily due to a
smaller amount of property acquisitions in 1999 as compared to 1998 and
increased proceeds from property sales in 1999.

 Cash provided by financing activities declined by 127,860 as there were no
proceeds from the issuance of equity securities in 1999 as compared to 60,000
in 1998; and the net proceeds from bank and mortgage loan activity declined by
 65,971 in 1999 as compared to 1998.

 1998 COMPARED TO 1997

 Cash provided by operating activities increased by 8,903, as the Company
owned 40 properties during 1998 as compared to 34 properties during 1997.

 Cash used by investing activities increased by 34,995 primarily as
properties purchased increased by 31,165 and property additions increased by
 5,440.

 Cash provided by financing activities increased by 27,372 primarily as net
proceeds from share sales decreased by 36,275, distributions increased by
 4,235, purchase of treasury shares increased by 10,931, and the proceeds from
bank and mortgage loans (net of repayments) increased by 80,093.

ITEM 7(A)--MARKET RISK (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)

 The Company's interest income is sensitive to changes in the general levels
of U.S. short-term interest rates.

 The Company's interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level
of U.S. short-term and long-term interest rates as the Company has outstanding
indebtedness at fixed and variable rates.

 The Company's variable rate debt bears interest at LIBOR plus 1 to 1.3 per
annum depending on overall Company leverage. Increases in LIBOR rates would
increase the Company's interest expense and reduce its cash flow. Conversely,
declines in LIBOR rates would decrease its interest expense and increase its
cash flow. In 1999, the Company entered into an interest rate cap agreement
whereby the LIBOR rate on 50,000 of its variable rate debt is limited to a
maximum of 6 until June 2001, thereby limiting the interest rate on that
portion of the Company's line of credit to 7.0 to 7.3 .

 At December 31, 1999, the Company had 100,113 of fixed rate debt
outstanding at an average rate of 6.88 . If the general level of interest rates
in the United States were to fall, the Company would not likely have the
opportunity to refinance this fixed rate debt at lower interest rates due to
prepayment restrictions and penalties on its fixed rate debt.

 In general, the Company believes long-term fixed rate debt is preferable as
a financing vehicle for its operations due to the long-term fixed contractual
rental income the Company receives from its tenants. As a result, the Company
has 71 of its long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 1999 at fixed rates
(including the debt affected by the interest rate cap agreement). The Company
may, as market conditions warrant, enter into additional fixed rate long-term
debt instruments on either a secured or unsecured basis.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Trustees and Shareholders
Great Lakes REIT

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Great Lakes
REIT as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 and the related consolidated statements of
income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1999. Our audit also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 14(a). These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Great Lakes
REIT at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 NATURE OF ACTIVITIES

 Great Lakes REIT, a Maryland real estate investment trust, (the "Company"),
was formed in 1992 to invest in income-producing real property. The principal
business of the Company is the ownership, management, leasing, renovation and
acquisition of suburban office and light industrial properties primarily located
in the Midwest. At December 31, 1999, the Company owned and operated 36
properties primarily located in suburban areas of Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee,
Denver, Cincinnati, Columbus and Minneapolis. The Company leases office and
light industrial space to over 500 tenants in a variety of businesses.

 PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries and controlled partnership. Intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 PROPERTIES

 Costs incurred for the acquisition, development, construction and
improvement of properties are capitalized. Certain costs of yet-to-be acquired
properties, including deposits and professional fees, are capitalized as other
assets. These costs are subsequently capitalized as property acquisition costs
or charged to expense when it becomes apparent that acquisition of a particular
property is not probable. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when
incurred.

 Depreciation of buildings is computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 40 years. Depreciation of
tenant improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter
of the lease term or useful life. For the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998
and 1997, depreciation expense amounted to 13,877, 11,453 and 6,463,
respectively.

 The Company recognizes impairment losses for its properties when indicators
of impairment are present and a property's expected undiscounted cash flows are
not sufficient to recover the property's carrying amount.

 DEFERRED COSTS

 Deferred costs consist principally of financing fees and leasing commissions
that are amortized over the terms of the respective agreements.

 REVENUE RECOGNITION

 Minimum rentals are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
related leases. Deferred rents receivable at December 31, 1999 and 1998 were
 4,917 and 4,437, respectively. Additional rents from expense reimbursements
for common area maintenance expenses and real estate taxes are recognized in the
period in which the related expenses are incurred.

 F-7
 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
 CASH EQUIVALENTS

 The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 1999
and 1998, the Company had 1,336 and 2,449, respectively, in a money market
fund.

 INCOME TAXES

 The Company has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust
("REIT") under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended. In order to qualify as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute
to shareholders at least 95 of its taxable income and to meet certain asset and
income tests as well as certain other requirements. Accordingly, no provision
for income taxes has been reflected in the consolidated financial statements.

 As of December 31, 1999, properties, rents receivable, goodwill and prepaid
rent have a federal income tax basis of approximately 438,981, 1,358, -0- and
 -0-, respectively.

 SHARE OPTIONS

 The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25), in accounting for
its options on common shares. Under APB 25, no compensation expense is
recognized because the exercise price of the Company's employee share options
equals or exceeds the market price of the underlying shares at the date of
grant.

 INTEREST RATE CAP AGREEMENT

 The Company purchased an interest rate cap agreement to hedge its exposure
to increases in interest costs under its variable rate debt. The one-time
premium paid by the Company is included in deferred financing costs and is
amortized over the term of the agreement using the straight-line method. Net
amounts paid or received under the agreement are recognized as an adjustment to
interest expense when such amounts are incurred or earned. The Company is
exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties under
the agreement, but the Company does not expect non-performance by any of these
counterparties. The amount of such exposure is generally limited to the amount
of any payments due but not yet received from the counterparty.

 USE OF ESTIMATES

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

 RECLASSIFICATIONS

 Certain accounts in 1998 and 1997 have been reclassified to conform with the
1999 presentation. Such reclassifications did not effect the results of
operations.

2. DEFERRED COSTS

 Deferred costs consisted of the following at December 31, 1999 and 1998:

1999 1998
 -------- --------
 
Deferred financing costs.................................... 2,990 3,017

 10,649 9,516
Less accumulated amortization............................... 4,580 3,449
 ------ ------
 6,069 6,067
 ====== ======

During the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, amortization of
financing costs was 526, 574 and 1,099, respectively, and amortization of
leasing costs was 1,424, 990 and 563, respectively.

3. LONG-TERM DEBT

 Mortgage loans payable aggregated 100,113 and 104,532 at December 31, 1999
and 1998, respectively. The mortgage loans payable require monthly payments of
principal and interest. Interest rates at December 31, 1999, ranged from 6.83 
to 8.95 .

 The Company has obtained a bank letter of credit to secure repayment of the
bonds payable in a face amount of approximately 4,600. The Company has
guaranteed repayment of the letter of credit to the issuing bank as well as
granted the issuing bank a first mortgage on the property. The interest rate on
the bonds (5.4 per annum at December 31, 1999) is reset weekly by the bond
placement agent.

 The Company has a 150,000 unsecured bank credit facility with a maturity
date of April 2001. The unsecured credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus
1.0 to 1.3 depending on overall company leverage (7.4875 at December 31,
1999).

 In June 1999, the Company entered into an interest rate cap agreement with a
major financial institution whereby the Company has limited the LIBOR interest
rate on 50,000 of its variable rate debt to no more than 6 per annum until
June 2001. The cost of this agreement to the Company was 209 and is being
amortized to expense over the period of the agreement (24 months).

 The following is a summary of principal maturities of mortgage loans, bank
loan and bonds payable:

4. SHARE OPTIONS

 The Company has a share option plan that provides for the granting of
options on common shares to non-employee trustees. At December 31, 1999, options
on 80,590 shares were available for future grant.

 In 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan
(the "1997 Plan") which superseded the Company's prior plan. The 1997 Plan
provides that 2,250,000 common shares of beneficial interest were reserved for
issuance to Company employees. At December 31, 1999, options on 296,700 shares
were available for future grant under the 1997 Plan.

 For options granted in 1999, 1998 and 1997, the exercise prices at the dates
of grant were equal to or greater than the fair value of the Company's shares.

 A summary of the Company's share option activity and related information for
the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 is as follows:

these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

RISK-FREE DIVIDEND VOLATILITY WEIGHTED AVERAGE
 INTEREST RATE YIELDS FACTORS EXPECTED LIFE
 ------------- ------------ ---------- ----------------
 
1999....................................... 6.50 9.1 -9.4 0.212 5 years
1998....................................... 5.00 7.88 -8.11 0.394 5 years
1997....................................... 5.75 6.17 -7.5 0.341 3 years

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company's employee share options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee share options.

 The effects on 1999 and 1998 pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per
common share, both basic and diluted, of amortizing to expense the estimated
fair value of share options are not necessarily representative of the effects on
net income to be reported in future years due to such things as the vesting
period of the share options, and the potential for issuance of additional share
options in future years.

 For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The Company's
unaudited pro forma information follows for the years ended December 31, 1999
and 1998:

1999 1998
 -------- --------
 
Pro forma net income...................................... 24,447 15,902
Pro forma basic earnings per common share................. 1.48 .95
Pro forma diluted earnings per common share............... 1.48 .94

The Company has a limited purpose employee loan program whereby employees
may borrow a portion of the cost of exercising options on common shares held by
the employee. Such loans bear interest at the Company's cost of funds which is
payable quarterly, are recourse to the employees, have a term of five years
provided the employee remains employed by the Company, and are secured by a
pledge of the common shares acquired by the employee through this program. As of
December 31, 1999, employees had acquired approximately 1,119,000 common shares
through this program with outstanding loan amounts of 16,335 due the Company.
Such amount is reflected as a reduction of shareholders' equity until the loans
are repaid.

5. SHARE OFFERINGS

 In December 1998, the Company sold 1.5 million shares of 9 3/4 Series A
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest. Net proceeds of
approximately 36,200 were used to repay a portion of its unsecured credit
facility.

 In April 1998, the Company sold 1,184,211 common shares to a newly formed
unit investment trust. Net proceeds of approximately 21,000 were used to repay
a portion of its unsecured credit facility.

option. Net proceeds to the Company were approximately 93,000, substantially
all of which was used to repay its bank lines of credit and other indebtedness
including certain mortgage debt on the Company's properties.

 In February 1997, the Company issued 118,134 common shares with a total
value at issuance of 1,536 in connection with the acquisition of the Markham,
Illinois and Elgin, Illinois properties.

6. LEASES

10. SEGMENT INFORMATION

 The Company has three reportable segments distinguished by property type.
The property types are office, with 89 (as measured by square feet at
December 31, 1999) of the Company's overall portfolio, office/service center
(11 ), and industrial (0 , the Company sold its only industrial property in
1999), and are principally located in the Midwest. As of December 31, 1999, the
properties were leased to more than 500 tenants, no single tenant accounted for
more than 5 of the aggregate annualized base rent of the Company's portfolio
and only 20 tenants individually represented more than 1 of such aggregate
annualized base rent.

 The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on property
revenues (rental and reimbursement income) less property operating expenses and
real estate taxes to arrive at net operating income--a widely recognized
industry measure of a property's performance.

Exhibit 10.14

 GREAT LAKES REIT
 LIMITED PURPOSE EMPLOYEE LOAN PROGRAM

 LOAN SECURITY AGREEMENT

 This Agreement is made as of ________________, 2000 between EMPLOYEE
NAME, residing at __________________ ___________ ("Employee"), and Great Lakes
REIT, a Maryland real estate investment trust, having its principal office at
823 Commerce Drive, Oak Brook, Illinois 60523 ("GLR").

 WHEREAS, Employee has executed a notice of option exercise for the
purchase of _____________ shares of GLR Common Shares of Beneficial Interest
(the "Shares") pursuant to stock options that GLR has previously granted
Employee (the "Options"). The purchase price is _______, [and income taxes
related to the exercise of ___________] together totaling ___________ which
Employee desires to finance by a loan from GLR.

 AND WHEREAS, Employee desires to borrow from GLR, and GLR is willing to
lend the sum of ____________ to Employee as permitted under the Great Lakes
REIT Limited Purpose Employee Loan Program (the "Loan Program"), subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 NOW THEREFORE in consideration of their mutual promises, the parties
agree as follows:

 1. AGREEMENT TO BORROW AND LEND. Employee agrees to borrow from GLR,
and GLR agrees to lend to Employee, the sum of __________ under the general
terms specified in the promissory note (the "Note") in the form attached hereto
as EXHIBIT A. The sum borrowed by Employee will be paid to GLR on behalf of and
for the account of Employee.

 2. DOCUMENTS TO BE DELIVERED TO GLR. Concurrently with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, Employee shall execute and deliver to GLR:

 (a) the Note; and

 (b) stock powers for collateral assignment only (the "Stock Power"),
 substantially in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT B, executed
 in blank by Employee.

 Employee covenants to GLR that, when GLR's share transfer agent issues
any certificate or certificates evidencing any Collateral (as defined herein),
Employee will promptly deliver, or cause to be promptly delivered, such
certificate(s) to the then-serving Secretary of GLR. Employee covenants that
Employee will cause GLR's share transfer agent to deliver such certificate(s)

directly to the then-serving Secretary of GLR upon GLR's written notice to
Employee that GLR requires such delivery of the certificate(s).

 3. SECURITY INTEREST. Employee grants GLR, as collateral security for
Employee's Obligations (as defined herein), a continuing security interest in
Employee's right, title, and interest in the Collateral and any proceeds
thereof. On Employee's performance in full of the Obligations secured in this
Agreement, the Collateral and the other documents referred to in Paragraph 2 of
this Agreement will be returned to Employee and the security interest created by
this Agreement, as well as this Agreement, will terminate, without further
liability on the part of either party.

 (a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Collateral" means all
 of the Shares, together with all stock and other non-cash
 dividends paid and non-cash distributions made upon the Shares,
 all securities and other property received in addition to or in
 exchange for the Shares, all rights to subscribe for securities
 incident to the Shares, all other proceeds of any of the
 foregoing, and any certificate(s) evidencing any of the
 foregoing.

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Obligations" means all
 of Employee's indebtedness, obligations and/or liabilities (i)
 under the Note and (ii) under this Agreement.

 4. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. If any one or more of the events set forth below
occurs (each an "Event of Default"), then, GLR shall, subject to Paragraph 5 of
this Agreement, have such rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral or
any part thereof and the proceeds thereof as are provided by the Uniform
Commercial Code and such other rights and remedies with respect thereto which it
may have at law or in equity or under this Agreement:

 (a) NONPAYMENT OF THE NOTE. Employee is in default of any payment of
 interest and/or principal due on the Note if such default shall
 not be cured within 10 business days following written notice of
 such default to Employee;

 (b) ASSIGNMENT OF THE COLLATERAL. Employee transfers, sells or
 grants a security interest in the Collateral during the term of
 this Agreement; or

 (c) BREACH OF OBLIGATIONS. Employee breaches his material
 obligations, covenants, or undertakings under this Agreement if
 such breach shall not be cured within 10 business days following
 written notice of such breach to Employee.

 5. NOTICE OF DEFAULT AND POWER TO SELL. If an Event of Default occurs,
GLR will give written notice of such Event of Default to Employee. Such notice
will specify the amount of principal and accrued interest due under the Note. If
Employee fails to pay such principal and accrued interest within ________ days
of Employee's receipt of such notice, then GLR may (but

is not obligated to) execute a market sale of the Shares and deliver the
Collateral to settle any such sale.

 In case of any sale, GLR may first deduct all expenses of the sale, and
delivery of the Collateral, and any incidental expenses, including reasonable
attorney's fees and brokerage commissions. GLR will then apply the residue to
any amounts due and unpaid on the Obligations, and will return the surplus, if
any, to Employee. Any sale conducted pursuant to this Paragraph 5 will be deemed
commercially reasonable.

 If GLR does not start to sell the Collateral within ninety (90) days
after GLR's right to sell it accrues, as per this Paragraph 5, then Employee
will have the right to request that GLR sell the Collateral or that Employee, at
his own expense, be allowed to sell it. If Employee requests that GLR sell the
Collateral, GLR will not be obligated to do so unless the net proceeds to be
received from such disposition will be sufficient to fully satisfy the
Obligations of Employee to GLR. If Employee requests that he be allowed to sell
the Collateral, any disposition must be on terms and conditions approved by GLR,
in its sole discretion; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that GLR is obligated to give such
approval if the disposition fully satisfies the Obligations of Employee to GLR.
GLR will not be liable to Employee for any agents' or brokers' fees in the event
Employee sells the Collateral. In connection with any sale or disposition of the
Collateral, GLR will have the absolute right to present the Stock Power for the
purpose of effecting the transfer of the Collateral.

 6. EMPLOYEE'S REMEDIES AGAINST GLR. Employee agrees that he will not
assert, against GLR or the Collateral, any claim or demand arising out of his
option exercise.

 7. TRANSFER AGENT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO EMPLOYEE. Employee agrees that
GLR's transfer agent, its officers, agents, servants, employees, and/or
attorneys, will have no responsibility to him under this Agreement other than to
deliver the Collateral to GLR, or to return it to Employee, in accordance with
this Agreement.

 8. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall be binding on the
parties hereto, their respective legal representatives, heirs, administrators,
executors, successors and permitted assigns, as the case may be.

 9. JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY. In the event any of the Collateral is
titled in joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the term "Employee" encompasses
all Collateral owners, and in such event, the Obligations of Employee and the
other joint owners of such Collateral will be joint and several.

 10. ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS. Employee may not assign his rights or
obligations under this Agreement without GLR's prior written consent. Any
assignment in contravention of this Agreement shall be null and void. GLR may
assign this Agreement and all of its rights, title, and interest in the
Collateral without Employee's consent.

11. WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. Except as prohibited by statute, the
parties to this Agreement waive trial by jury in any action brought by any of
the parties against the other, on any matter whatsoever, arising out of this
Agreement. With respect to any matter for which a jury trial cannot be waived,
the parties agree not to assert any counterclaims nor move to consolidate any
claim with any action in which a jury trial is waived.

 12. RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEE AS TO COLLATERAL. Subject to any limitations
under GLR's compensation or benefits plans pursuant to which the Options were
granted and until GLR makes a demand for payment pursuant to Paragraph 5
following an Event of Default, Employee shall have the right to exercise all
voting rights with respect to the Collateral and to receive and retain all cash
dividends paid upon any of the Collateral.

 13. MERGER AND MODIFICATIONS. This Agreement, the Note, and the Loan
Program contain the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and no representations, promises,
agreements or understandings, written or oral, not contained herein shall be of
any force or effect. No change, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid or binding unless it is in writing dated subsequent to
the date hereof and signed by the parties; provided, however, that GLR may, in
its sole discretion, modify this Agreement so that the Agreement complies with
the terms and conditions of the Loan Program.

 14. WAIVER. No failure or delay on the part of GLR in exercising any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof or
of any other right, remedy, power or privilege of GLR hereunder, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right, remedy, power or privilege
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights and remedies of GLR under this
Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies that it may
otherwise have.

 15. NOTICES. All consents, notices, or other communications required
under this Agreement shall be in writing. Any notice, if mailed, shall be deemed

and will, within a reasonable time after a request by GLR, execute and deliver
all such other documents and instruments, including without limitation further
pledges and assignments with respect to the Collateral consistent with the terms
of this Agreement, as GLR reasonably may deem necessary or advisable from time
to time in order to preserve, perfect and protect said security interest.

 17. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Illinois without reference to its choice of law or
conflict of laws rules.

 18. INVALIDITY OF PROVISIONS. If any provision of this Agreement shall
be held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder nevertheless shall remain in
full force and effect. If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable with
respect to particular circumstances, it nevertheless shall remain in full force
and effect in all other circumstances.

 19. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which shall
constitute one and the same instrument.
