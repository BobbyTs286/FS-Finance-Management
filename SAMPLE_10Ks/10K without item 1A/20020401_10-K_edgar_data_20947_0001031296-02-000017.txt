The Company

 FirstEnergy Corp. was organized under the laws of the State of Ohio
in 1996. On November 7, 2001, FirstEnergy merged with GPU, Inc., a Pennsylvania
corporation, with FirstEnergy being the surviving company. FirstEnergy's
application to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (1935 Act) to acquire all of the outstanding
shares of GPU's common stock and to become a registered holding company under
the 1935 Act, was approved on October 29, 2001. FirstEnergy's principal business
is the holding, directly or indirectly, of all of the outstanding common stock
of its principal electric utility operating subsidiaries, Ohio Edison Company
(OE), The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (CEI), Pennsylvania Power
Company (Penn), The Toledo Edison Company (TE), American Transmission Systems,
Incorporated (ATSI), Jersey Central Power & Light Company (JCP&L), Metropolitan
Edison Company (Met-Ed) and Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec). These

consolidated revenues are primarily derived from electric service provided by
its utility operating subsidiaries and the revenues of its other principal
subsidiaries: FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. (FES); FirstEnergy Facilities Services
Group, LLC (FEFSG); MYR Group Inc. (MYR); MARBEL Energy Corporation (MARBEL);

companies.

Merger

 On November 7, 2001, the merger of FirstEnergy and GPU became
effective pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 8, 2000
(Merger Agreement). As a result of the merger, GPU's former wholly owned
subsidiaries, including JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec (collectively, the "Former GPU
Companies"), became wholly owned subsidiaries of FirstEnergy.

 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, GPU shareholders received
the equivalent of 36.50 for each share of GPU common stock they owned, payable
in cash and/or FirstEnergy common stock. GPU shareholders receiving FirstEnergy
shares received 1.2318 shares of FirstEnergy common stock for each share of GPU
common stock that they exchanged. The elections by GPU shareholders were subject
to proration since the total elections received would have resulted in more than
one-half of the GPU common stock being exchanged for FirstEnergy shares.
FirstEnergy borrowed the funds for the cash portion of the merger consideration,
approximately 2.2 billion, through a credit agreement dated as of October 2,
2001 from a group of banks led by Barclay's Bank Plc, as administrative agent;
the borrowings were refinanced with long-term debt on November 15, 2001.
FirstEnergy issued nearly 73.7 million shares of its common stock to GPU
shareholders for the share portion of the transaction consideration.

 The merger was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting
and, accordingly, the Consolidated Statements of Income include the results of
the Former GPU Companies beginning November 7, 2001. The assets acquired and
liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair values as determined by
FirstEnergy's management based on information currently available and on current
assumptions as to future operations. The merger purchase accounting adjustments,
which were recorded in the records of GPU's direct subsidiaries, primarily
consisted of: (1) revaluation of GPU's international operations to fair value;
(2) revaluation of property, plant and equipment; (3) adjusting preferred stock
subject to mandatory redemption and long-term debt to estimated fair value; (4)
recognizing additional obligations related to retirement benefits; and (5)
recognizing estimated severance and other compensation liabilities. Assets and
liabilities remaining subject to rate regulation on a historical cost basis were
not adjusted.

 International Operations

 Prior to consummation of the GPU merger, FirstEnergy identified
certain GPU international operations for divestiture within twelve months of the
merger date. These operations constitute individual "lines of business" as
defined in Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 30, "Reporting the
Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions" with physically and operationally separable activities.
Application of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 87-11, "Allocation of
Purchase Price to Assets to Be Sold," required that expected, pre-sale cash
flows, including incremental interest expense on related acquisition debt, of
these operations be considered part of the purchase price allocation.
Accordingly, subsequent to the merger date, results of operations and
incremental interest costs that are related to these international subsidiaries
have not been included in FirstEnergy's Consolidated Statement of Income.
Additionally, assets and liabilities of these international operations have been
segregated under separate captions on the Consolidated Balance Sheet - "Assets
Pending Sale" and "Liabilities Related to Assets Pending Sale." The entities
identified for divestiture prior to the merger date are discussed below.

 In December 2001, FirstEnergy divested its Australian gas
transmission companies through an initial public offering of GasNet's common
stock. The IPO provided net proceeds of 125 million to FirstEnergy and
immediately removed from FirstEnergy's consolidated debt 290 million of
GasNet-related debt.

 On March 15, 2002, FirstEnergy finalized the terms of a previously
announced agreement through which Aquila, Inc. (formerly UtiliCorp United) will
acquire a 79.9 percent interest in FirstEnergy's wholly owned Avon Energy
Partners Holdings subsidiary, the holding company for Midlands Electricity plc,
for a purchase price of 264 million. As a result of this transaction, Avon's
debt of approximately 1.7 billion, which is non-recourse to FirstEnergy, would
no longer be included on FirstEnergy's consolidated balance sheet. The
transaction is subject to the receipt of all applicable regulatory approvals.

GPU's former Argentina operations, including GPU Empresa
Distribuidora Electrica Regional S.A., were identified by FirstEnergy for
divestiture within twelve months of the merger. FirstEnergy is actively pursuing
the sale of these operations. Other international companies are being considered
for sale; however, as of the merger date those sales were not judged to be
probable of occurring within twelve months.

 Generating Assets

 On November 29, 2001, FirstEnergy reached an agreement to sell four
coal-fired power plants (with an aggregate net book value of 539 million as of
December 31, 2001) totaling 2,535 megawatts (MW) to NRG Energy Inc. for 1.5
billion 1.355 billion in cash and 145 million in debt assumption). The net,
after-tax gain from the sale, based on the difference between the sale price of
the plants and their market price used in our Ohio restructuring transition
plan, will be credited to customers by reducing the transition cost recovery
period. FirstEnergy also entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with NRG.
Under the terms of the PPA, NRG is obligated to sell up to 10.5 billion
kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, similar to the average annual output of
the plants, through 2005. The sale is expected to close in mid-2002.

Utility Regulation

 As a registered public utility holding company, FirstEnergy is
subject to regulation by the SEC under the 1935 Act. The SEC has determined that
the electric facilities of the FirstEnergy Companies constitute a single
integrated public utility system under the standards of the 1935 Act. The 1935
Act regulates FirstEnergy with respect to accounting, the issuance of
securities, the acquisition and sale of utility assets, securities or any other
interest in any business, and entering into, and performance of, service, sales
and construction contracts among its subsidiaries, and certain other matters.
The 1935 Act also limits the extent to which FirstEnergy may engage in
nonutility businesses or acquire additional utility businesses. Each of the
FirstEnergy Companies' retail rates, conditions of service, issuance of
securities and other matters are subject to regulation in the state in which
each operates - in Ohio by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), in
New Jersey by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) and in
Pennsylvania by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC). With respect
to their wholesale and interstate electric operations and rates, FirstEnergy
Companies are subject to regulation, including regulation of their accounting
policies and practices, by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
Under Ohio law, municipalities may regulate rates, subject to appeal to the PUCO
if not acceptable to the utility.

 PUCO Rate Matters

 Ohio's 1999 electric utility restructuring law allowed Ohio electric
customers to select their generation suppliers beginning January 1, 2001,
provided for a five percent reduction on the generation portion of residential
customers' bills and the opportunity for utilities to recover transition costs,
including regulatory assets. Under this law, the PUCO approved FirstEnergy's
transition plan in 2000 as modified by a settlement agreement with major parties
to the transition plan, which it filed on behalf of OE, CEI and TE (Ohio
Companies). The settlement agreement included approval for recovery of the
amounts of transition costs filed in the transition plan through no later than
2006 for OE, mid-2007 for TE and 2008 for CEI, except where a longer period of
recovery is provided for in the settlement agreement. The settlement also
granted preferred access over FirstEnergy's subsidiaries to nonaffiliated
marketers, brokers and aggregators to 1,120 MW of generation capacity through
2005 at established prices for sales to the Ohio Companies' retail customers.
The Ohio Companies' base electric rates for distribution service under their
prior respective regulatory plans were extended from December 31, 2005 to
December 31, 2007. The transition rate credits for customers under their prior
regulatory plans were also extended through the Ohio Companies' respective
transition cost recovery periods.

 The transition plan itemized, or unbundled, the current price of
electricity into its component elements -- including generation, transmission,
distribution and transition charges. As required by the PUCO's rules,
FirstEnergy's transition plan also resulted in the corporate separation of its
regulated and unregulated operations, operational and technical support changes
needed to accommodate customer choice, an education program to inform customers
of their options under the law, and planned changes in how FirstEnergy's
transmission system will be operated to ensure access to all users. Customer
prices are frozen through a five-year market development period (2001-2005),
except for certain limited statutory exceptions including a 5 reduction in the
price of generation for residential customers.

 FirstEnergy's Ohio customers choosing alternative suppliers receive
an additional incentive applied to the shopping credit (generation component) of
45 for residential customers, 30 for commercial customers and 15 for
industrial customers. The amount of the incentive serves to reduce the
amortization of transition costs during the market development period and will
be recovered through the extension of the transition cost recovery periods. If
the customer shopping goals established in the agreement are not achieved by the
end of 2005, the transition cost recovery periods could be shortened for OE, CEI
and TE to reduce recovery by as much as 500 million (OE- 250 million, CEI- 170
million and TE- 80 million), but any such adjustment would be computed on a
class-by-class and pro-rata

basis. Based on annualized shopping levels as of December 31, 2001, FirstEnergy
believes the maximum potential recovery reductions are approximately 174
million (OE - 87 million, CEI - 52 million and TE - 35 million).

 NJBPU Rate Matters

 In March 2001, the NJBPU issued a Final Decision and Order (Final
Order) with respect to JCP&L's rate unbundling, stranded cost and restructuring
filings, which superseded its 1999 Summary Order. The Final Order confirms rate
reductions set forth in the Summary Order, which remain in effect at increasing
levels through July 2003 with rates after July 31, 2003 to be determined in a
rate case commencing in 2002. The Final Order also includes the right of
customers to select their generation suppliers effective August 1, 1999, and
includes the deregulation of electric generation service. The Final Order
confirms the establishment of a non-bypassable societal benefits charge to
recover costs which include nuclear plant decommissioning and manufactured gas
plant remediation, as well as a non-bypassable market transition charge (MTC)
primarily to recover stranded costs. However, the NJBPU deferred making a final
determination of the net proceeds and stranded costs related to prior generating
asset divestitures until JCP&L's request for an Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
ruling regarding the treatment of associated federal income tax benefits is
acted upon. Should the IRS ruling support the return of the tax benefits to
ratepayers, JCP&L would need to record a corresponding charge to income of
approximately 25 million; there would be no effect to FirstEnergy's net income
as the contingency existed prior to the merger.

 JCP&L has an obligation to provide basic generation service (BGS),
that is, it must act as provider of last resort (PLR) to non-shopping customers
as a result of the NJBPU's restructuring plans. JCP&L obtains its supply of
electricity to meet its BGS obligation to non-shopping customers almost entirely
from contracted and open market purchases. JCP&L is permitted to defer for
future collection from customers the amounts by which its costs of supplying BGS
to non-shopping customers and costs incurred under nonutility generation (NUG)
agreements exceed amounts collected through BGS and MTC rates. As of December
31, 2001, the accumulated deferred cost balance totaled approximately 300
million, after giving effect to the reduction discussed below. The Final Order
provided for the ability to securitize stranded costs associated with the
divested Oyster Creek Nuclear Generation Station. In February 2002, JCP&L
received NJBPU authorization to issue 320 million of transition bonds to
securitize the recovery of these costs. The NJBPU order also provides for a
usage-based non-bypassable transition bond charge and for the transfer of the
bondable transition property to another entity. JCP&L plans to sell transition
bonds in the second quarter of 2002 which will be recognized on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The Final Order also allows for additional securitization of
JCP&L's deferred balance to the extent permitted by law upon application by
JCP&L and a determination by the NJBPU that the conditions of the New Jersey
restructuring legislation are met. There can be no assurance as to the extent,
if any, that the NJBPU will permit such securitization.

 In June 2001, the four incumbent New Jersey electric distribution
companies, including JCP&L, filed a joint proposal seeking NJBPU approval of a
competitive bidding process to procure supply for the provision of BGS from
August 1, 2002 through July 31, 2003. In December 2001, the NJBPU authorized the
auctioning of BGS to meet the electric demands of all customers who have not
selected an alternative supplier. BGS for all four companies, for August 1, 2002
through July 31, 2003, was simultaneously put out for bid. The auction, which
ended on February 13, 2002 and was approved by the NJBPU on February 15, 2002,
removed JCP&L's BGS obligation of 5,100 MW for the period August 1, 2002 through
July 31, 2003. The auction provides a transitional mechanism and a different
model for the procurement of BGS commencing August 1, 2003 may be adopted.

 On September 26, 2001, the NJBPU approved the merger between
FirstEnergy and GPU (see "Merger") subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in a Stipulation of Settlement which had been signed by the major parties in the
merger discussions. Under this Stipulation of Settlement, FirstEnergy agreed to
reduce JCP&L's regulatory assets by 300 million, in order to ensure that
customers receive the benefit of future merger savings. JCP&L wrote off 300
million of its deferred costs upon receipt on October 29, 2001 of the final
regulatory approval for the merger.

 PPUC Rate Matters

 In December 1996, Pennsylvania enacted "The Electricity Generation
Customer Choice and Competition Act," which permitted customers, including
Penn's, Met-Ed's and Penelec's customers, to choose their electric generation
supplier, while transmission and distribution services will continue to be
supplied by their current providers. The PPUC authorized 1998 rate restructuring
plans for Penn, Met-Ed and Penelec, which essentially resulted in the
deregulation of their respective generation businesses. Met-Ed and Penelec
subsequently divested substantially all of their generating assets.

 The phase in of customer choice was completed on January 1, 2001.
Under their respective plans, Penn, Met-Ed and Penelec continue to deliver power
to homes and businesses through their distribution systems, which remain
regulated by the PPUC. Their rates have been restructured to establish separate
charges for transmission and distribution; generation, which is subject to
competition, and stranded cost recovery. In the event customers obtain power
from an alternative source, the generation portion of their rates will be
excluded from their bills and the customers will receive a generation charge
from the alternative supplier. The stranded cost recovery portion of rates
provides for recovery of certain amounts not otherwise considered recoverable in
a competitive generation market, including

regulatory assets. Penn is entitled to recover 236 million of stranded costs
through a competitive transition charge (CTC) that started in 1999 and ends in
2006.

 In 2000, the PPUC disallowed a portion of the requested additional
stranded costs above those amounts granted in Met-Ed's and Penelec's 1998 rate
restructuring plan orders. The PPUC required Met-Ed and Penelec to seek an IRS
ruling regarding the return of certain unamortized investment tax credits and
excess deferred income tax benefits to ratepayers. Similar to JCP&L's situation,
if the IRS ruling ultimately supports returning these tax benefits to
ratepayers, Met-Ed and Penelec would then reduce stranded costs by 12 million
and 25 million, respectively, plus interest and record a corresponding charge
to income; similar to JCP&L, there would be no effect to FirstEnergy's net
income.

 As a result of their generating asset divestitures, Met-Ed and
Penelec obtain their supply of electricity to meet their PLR obligations almost
entirely from contracted and open market purchases. During 2000, their purchased
power costs substantially exceeded the amounts they could recover under their
capped generation rates which are in effect for varying periods, pursuant to
their 1998 rate restructuring plans. In November 2000, Met-Ed and Penelec filed
a petition with the PPUC seeking permission to defer for future recovery their
energy costs in excess of amounts reflected in their capped generation rates. In
January 2001, the PPUC consolidated this petition with the FirstEnergy/GPU
merger proceeding (see "Merger") for consideration and resolution in accordance
with the merger procedural schedule.

 In June 2001, Met-Ed, Penelec and FirstEnergy entered into a
Settlement Stipulation with all of the major parties in the combined merger and
rate relief proceedings, that, in addition to resolving certain issues
concerning the PPUC's approval of the FirstEnergy/GPU merger, also addressed
Met-Ed's and Penelec's request for PLR rate relief. On June 20, 2001, the PPUC
entered orders approving the Settlement Stipulation, which approved the merger
and provided Met-Ed and Penelec PLR rate relief. Met-Ed and Penelec were
permitted to defer for future recovery the difference between their actual
energy costs and those reflected in their capped generation rates, retroactive
to January 1, 2001. Deferral accounting will continue for such cost differences
through December 31, 2005. Should energy costs incurred by Met-Ed and Penelec
during that period be below their respective capped generation rates, the
difference would be used to reduce their recoverable deferred costs. Met-Ed's
and Penelec's PLR obligations have been extended through December 31, 2010.
Met-Ed's and Penelec's CTC revenues will be applied first to PLR costs, then to
non-NUG stranded costs and finally to NUG stranded costs through December 31,
2010. Met-Ed and Penelec would be permitted to recover any remaining stranded
costs through a continuation of the CTC after December 31, 2010; however, such
recovery would extend to no later than December 31, 2015. Any amounts not
expected to be recovered by December 31, 2015 would be written off at the time
such nonrecovery becomes probable.

 Several parties had filed Petitions for Review with the Commonwealth
Court of Pennsylvania regarding the PPUC's order that approved a settlement of
the FirstEnergy/GPU merger case and granted certain relief to Met-Ed and Penelec
concerning their PLR obligations to retail customers. On February 21, 2002, the
Court affirmed the PPUC decision regarding the FirstEnergy/GPU merger, remanding
the decision to the PPUC only with respect to the issue of merger savings. The
Court reversed the PPUC's decision regarding the PLR obligations of Met-Ed and
Penelec, and rejected those parts of the settlement that permitted the companies
to defer for accounting purposes the difference between their wholesale power
costs and the amount that they collect from retail customers. FirstEnergy filed
a Petition for Allowance of Appeal with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on March
25, 2002, asking it to review the Commonwealth Court decision. FirstEnergy is
unable to predict the outcome of these matters.

 FERC Rate Matters

 The Companies provide wholesale power and transmission service
subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC.

 On November 9, 2000, FirstEnergy and GPU filed an application for
approval of their merger under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act. The FERC
approved the merger on March 15, 2001. Following the FirstEnergy/GPU merger the
transmission facilities of JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec continue to be operated by
PJM Interconnection, Inc. PJM was approved by the FERC as a regional
transmission organization (RTO) on July 12, 2001. Transmission service over the
facilities of FirstEnergy's PJM operating companies is provided under the PJM
Open Access Tariff.

 ATSI, which owns and operates FirstEnergy's transmission facilities
within the Ohio Companies' and Penn's service areas, proposed to transfer its
transmission facilities in the East Central Area Reliability Agreement (ECAR)
area to the Alliance RTO. ATSI, along with other members of the Alliance
Companies (Ameren Services Company, American Electric Power Service Corporation
(AEP), Consumers Energy Company, The Dayton Power and Light Company (DPL),
Exelon Corporation, Illinois Power Company, Northern Indiana Public Service
Company and Virginia Electric and Power Company) made a series of filings during
2001, and received conditional approval from the FERC to act as an RTO on May 8,
2001. Operations were projected to begin in March 2002.

 On December 20, 2001, the FERC issued an order that reversed prior
findings that the Alliance RTO had adequate scope and concluded that there
should be only one RTO in the Midwest. While favoring the Midwest ISO as the
preferred platform for a single RTO in the Midwest, the FERC stated that it was
confident that the Alliance business plan for an independent transmission
company could be successfully accommodated within the Midwest ISO. As directed
by the FERC, the Alliance Companies are in negotiations with the Midwest ISO, as
well as PJM, to develop an

arrangement for the Alliance business organization to operate under an RTO
umbrella. A revised date for operation of ATSI's transmission assets in an RTO
has not been determined.

 Regulatory Accounting

 All of the Companies' regulatory assets (deferred costs) are expected
to continue to be recovered under provisions of the Ohio transition plan and the
respective Pennsylvania and New Jersey regulatory plans. Under prior regulatory
plans, the PUCO had authorized OE to recognize additional capital recovery
related to its generating assets (which was reflected as additional depreciation
expense) and additional amortization of regulatory assets of at least 2
billion, and the PPUC had authorized Penn to accelerate at least 358 million,
more than the amounts that would have been recognized if the prior regulatory
plans were not in effect. These additional amounts were being recovered through
rates. Under OE's prior regulatory plan, which was terminated at the end of
2000, and Penn's rate restructuring plan, OE's and Penn's cumulative additional
capital recovery and regulatory asset amortization amounted to 1.424 billion.

 The application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS 71),
was discontinued in 1997 with respect to CEI's and TE's nuclear operations; in
1998 with respect to Penn's, Met-Ed's and Penelec's generation operations; in
1999 with respect to JCP&L's generation operations; and in 2000 with respect to
OE's generation business and the nonnuclear generation businesses of CEI and TE.
JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec subsequently divested substantially all of their
generating assets. The SEC issued interpretive guidance regarding asset
impairment measurement, concluding that any supplemental regulated cash flows
such as a CTC should be excluded from the cash flows of assets in a portion of
the business not subject to regulatory accounting practices. If those assets are
impaired, a regulatory asset should be established if the costs are recoverable
through regulatory cash flows. Consistent with the SEC guidance, 1.6 billion of
impaired plant investments 1.2 billion, 304 million and 53 million for OE,
CEI and TE, respectively) were recognized as regulatory assets recoverable as
transition costs through future regulatory cash flows.

Capital Requirements

 Capital expenditures for the FirstEnergy Companies for the years 2001
through 2006, excluding nuclear fuel, are shown in the following table. Such
costs include expenditures for the betterment of existing facilities and for the
construction of generating capacity, facilities for environmental compliance,
transmission lines, distribution lines, substations and other additions. See
"Environmental Matters" below with regard to possible environment-related

OE's and Penn's nuclear fuel purchases had been financed through OES
Fuel (a wholly owned subsidiary of OE) commercial paper and loans, both of which
were supported by a 141.5 million long-term bank credit agreement which is
expiring on March 31, 2002. FirstEnergy is not extending the credit agreement
and OE and Penn will directly purchase, own and finance their nuclear fuel
requirements. CEI and TE also replaced their prior leasing arrangements with
direct ownership of nuclear fuel in 2001. The Companies' respective investments
for additional nuclear fuel, and nuclear fuel investment reductions as the fuel
is consumed, during the 2002-2006 period are presented in the following table.

Short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2001, consisted
of 688.3 million of bank borrowings (FirstEnergy- 385.0 million, OE- 60.0
million, FEFSG- 9.5 million and 233.8 million related to the pending
divestitures) and 159.8 million of OES Capital, Incorporated commercial paper.
OES Capital is a wholly owned subsidiary of OE whose borrowings are secured by
customer accounts receivable. OES Capital can borrow up to 170 million under a
receivables financing agreement at rates based on certain bank commercial paper.
FirstEnergy and OE also had 865 million and 250 million, respectively,
available under revolving lines of credit as of December 31, 2001. FirstEnergy
may borrow under its facility and could transfer any of its borrowings to
affiliated companies. OE and MYR had 34 million and 50 million, respectively,
of unused bank facilities as of December 31, 2001. In addition, OE and Penn had
bank facilities of 30 million and 2 million, respectively, available that
provide for borrowings on a short-term basis at the bank's discretion.

 Based on their present plans, the Companies could provide for their
cash requirements in 2002 from the following sources: funds to be received from
operations; available cash and temporary cash investments as of December 31,
2001 (Company's nonutility subsidiaries- 120 million, OE- 5 million; JCP&L- 31
million, Met-Ed- 25 million and Penelec- 39 million); the issuance of long-term
debt (for refunding purposes); net proceeds from the sale of assets; and funds
available under revolving credit arrangements.

 The extent and type of future financings will depend on the need for
external funds as well as market conditions, the maintenance of an appropriate
capital structure and the ability of the Companies to comply with coverage
requirements in order to issue first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. The
Companies will continue to monitor financial market conditions and, where
appropriate, may take advantage of economic opportunities to refund debt and
preferred stock to the extent that their financial resources permit.

 The coverage requirements contained in the first mortgage indentures
under which the Companies issue first mortgage bonds provide that, except for
certain refunding purposes, the Companies may not issue first mortgage bonds
unless applicable net earnings (before income taxes), calculated as provided in
the indentures, for any period of twelve consecutive months within the fifteen
calendar months preceding the month in which such additional bonds are issued,

are at least twice annual interest requirements on outstanding first mortgage
bonds, including those being issued. Under OE's first mortgage indenture, the
availability of property additions is more restrictive than the earnings test at
the present time and would limit the amount of first mortgage bonds issuable
against property additions to 133 million. OE is currently able to issue 915
million principal amount of first mortgage bonds against previously retired
bonds without the need to meet the above restrictions. Under Penn's first
mortgage indenture, other requirements also apply and are more restrictive than
the earnings test at the present time. Penn is currently able to issue 293
million principal amount of first mortgage bonds, with up to 134 million of
such amount issuable against property additions; the remainder could be issued
against previously retired bonds. CEI and TE can issue 476 million and 415
million, respectively, principal amount of first mortgage bonds against a
combination of previously retired bonds and property additions. JCP&L, Met-Ed
and Penelec are able to issue 257 million, 88 million and 450 million,
respectively, principal amount of first mortgage bonds against previously
retired bonds.

 OE's, Penn's, TE's and JCP&L's respective articles of incorporation
prohibit the sale of preferred stock unless applicable gross income, calculated
as provided in the articles of incorporation, is equal to at least 1-1/2 times
the aggregate of the annual interest requirements on indebtedness and annual
dividend requirements on preferred stock outstanding immediately thereafter.
Based upon earnings for 2001, an assumed dividend rate of 9.00 , and no
additional indebtedness, OE, Penn, TE and JCP&L would be permitted, under the
earnings coverage test contained in their respective charters, to issue at least
 2.1 billion, 195 million, 102 million and 4.6 billion of preferred stock,
respectively. There are no restrictions on the ability of CEI, Met-Ed and
Penelec to issue preferred stock.

 To the extent that coverage requirements or market conditions
restrict the Companies' abilities to issue desired amounts of first mortgage
bonds or preferred stock, the Companies may seek other methods of financing.
Such financings could include the sale of preferred and/or preference stock or
of such other types of securities as might be authorized by applicable
regulatory authorities which would not otherwise be sold and could result in
annual interest charges and/or dividend requirements in excess of those that
would otherwise be incurred.

 Met-Ed Capital Trust and Penelec Capital Trust

 In 1999, Met-Ed Capital Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of Met-Ed,
issued 100 million of trust preferred securities (Met-Ed Trust Preferred
Securities) at 7.35 , due 2039. The sole assets of Met-Ed Capital Trust are the
7.35 Cumulative Preferred Securities of Met-Ed Capital II, L.P. (Met-Ed
Partnership Preferred Securities) and its only revenues are the quarterly cash
distributions it receives on the Met-Ed Partnership Preferred Securities. Each
Met-Ed Trust Preferred Security represents a Met-Ed Partnership Preferred
Security. Met-Ed Capital II, L.P. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Met-Ed and the
sponsor of Met-Ed Capital Trust. The sole assets of Met-Ed Capital II, L.P. are
Met-Ed's 7.35 Subordinated Debentures, Series A, due 2039, which have an
aggregate principal amount of 103.1 million. Distributions were made on the
Trust Preferred Securities during 2001 in the aggregate amount of 7,350,000.
Expenses of Met-Ed Trust for 2001 were approximately 17,000, all of which were
paid by Met-Ed Preferred Capital II, Inc., the general partner of Met-Ed Capital
II, L.P. The Trust Preferred Securities are issued in book-entry form only so
that there is only one holder of record. Met-Ed has fully and unconditionally
guaranteed the Met-Ed Partnership Preferred Securities, and, therefore, the
Met-Ed Trust Preferred Securities.

 In 1999, Penelec Capital Trust, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Penelec,
issued 100 million of trust preferred securities (Penelec Trust Preferred
Securities) at 7.34 , due 2039. The sole assets of Penelec Capital Trust are the
7.34 Cumulative Preferred Securities of Penelec Capital II, L.P. (Penelec
Partnership Preferred Securities) and its only revenues are the quarterly cash
distributions it receives on the Penelec Partnership Preferred Securities. Each
Penelec Trust Preferred Security represents a Penelec Partnership Preferred
Security. Penelec Capital II, L.P. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Penelec and
the sponsor of Penelec Capital Trust. The sole assets of Penelec Capital II,
L.P. are Penelec's 7.34 Subordinated Debentures, Series A, due 2039, which have
an aggregate principal amount of 103.1 million. Distributions were made on the
Trust Preferred Securities during 2001 in the aggregate amount of 7,340,000.
Expenses of Penelec Trust for 2001 were approximately 15,000, all of which were
paid by Penelec Preferred Capital II, Inc., the general partner of Penelec
Capital II, L.P. The Trust Preferred Securities are issued in book-entry form
only so that there is only one holder of record. Penelec has fully and
unconditionally guaranteed the Penelec Partnership Preferred Securities, and,
therefore, the Penelec Trust Preferred Securities.

Nuclear Regulation

 The construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear generating
units are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) including the issuance by it of construction permits, operating
licenses, and possession only licenses for decommissioning reactors. The NRC's
procedures with respect to the amendment of nuclear reactor operating licenses
afford opportunities for interested parties to request adjudicatory hearings on
health, safety and environmental issues subject to meeting NRC "standing"
requirements. In this connection,

the NRC may require substantial changes in operation or the installation of
additional equipment to meet safety or environmental standards, subject to the
backfit rule requiring the NRC to justify such new requirements as necessary for
the overall protection of public health and safety. The possibility also exists
for modification, denial or revocation of licenses in the event of substantial
safety concerns at the nuclear facility. Beaver Valley Unit 1 was placed in
commercial operation in 1976, and its operating license expires in 2016.
Davis-Besse was placed in commercial operation in 1977, and its operating
license expires in 2017. Perry Unit 1 and Beaver Valley Unit 2 were placed in
commercial operation in 1987, and their operating licenses expire in 2026 and
2027, respectively.

 Davis-Besse, which is operated by FENOC, began its scheduled
refueling outage on February 16, 2002. The plant was originally scheduled to
return to service by the end of March. During the refueling outage, visual and
ultrasonic testings were conducted on all 69 of the Control Rod Drive Mechanism
penetration nozzles. This testing was performed to check for the kind of
circular or circumferential cracking in these nozzles that had been found at
some other plants similar in design and vintage to Davis-Besse. Based on the
inspection and test results, five nozzles were scheduled for repair during the
refueling outage.

 As repair work began on one of the nozzles, FENOC found a small area
of corrosion in the reactor vessel head near the penetration hole, apparently
created by boric acid deposits. The corrosion will have to be repaired and is
expected to extend the planned refueling outage. On March 12, 2002, the NRC sent
a team of engineers and metallurgists to inspect corrosion on the reactor head
of Davis-Besse.

 Although the exact length of the outage has not been determined,
FENOC expects the outage to be extended by 60 to 90 days and expects additional
nuclear-related operation and maintenance costs of approximately 5-10 million.
In addition, the loss of generation output from Davis-Besse during the extended
outage period could increase energy costs between 10 million to 15 million per
month.

 As a result of the merger with GPU, FirstEnergy now owns the Three
Mile Island Unit 2 (TMI-2) and the Saxton Nuclear Experimental Facility. Both
facilities are in various stages of decommissioning. TMI-2 is in a
post-defueling monitored storage condition, with decommissioning planned in
2014. Saxton is in the final stages of decommissioning, with license termination
scheduled for the end of 2002 and final site restoration scheduled for the
second quarter of 2003.

 The NRC has promulgated and continues to promulgate regulations
related to the safe operation of nuclear power plants and standards for
decommissioning clean-up and final license termination. The Companies cannot
predict what additional regulations (including post-September 11, 2001 security
enhancements) may be promulgated, design changes required or the effect that any
such regulations or design changes or additional clean-up standards for final
site release, or the consideration thereof, may have upon their nuclear plants.
Although the Companies have no reason to anticipate an accident at any of their
nuclear plants, if such an accident did happen, it could have a material but
currently undeterminable adverse effect on FirstEnergy's consolidated financial
position. In addition, such an accident at any operating nuclear plant, whether
or not owned by the Companies, could result in regulations or requirements that
could affect the operation, licensing, or decommissioning of plants that the
Companies do own with a consequent but currently undeterminable adverse impact,
and could affect the Companies' abilities to raise funds in the capital markets.

Nuclear Insurance

 The Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability which can be
assessed with respect to a nuclear power plant to 9.5 billion (assuming 106
units licensed to operate) for a single nuclear incident, which amount is
covered by: (i) private insurance amounting to 200 million; and (ii) 9.3
billion provided by an industry retrospective rating plan required by the NRC
pursuant thereto. Under such retrospective rating plan, in the event of a
nuclear incident at any unit in the United States resulting in losses in excess
of private insurance, up to 88.1 million (but not more than 10 million per
unit per year in the event of more than one incident) must be contributed for
each nuclear unit licensed to operate in the country by the licensees thereof to
cover liabilities arising out of the incident. Based on their present nuclear
ownership and leasehold interests, the Companies' maximum potential assessment
under these provisions would be 352.4 million (OE- 94.2 million, Penn- 74.0
million, CEI- 106.3 million and TE- 77.9 million) per incident but not more than
 40.0 million (OE- 10.7 million, Penn- 8.4 million, CEI- 12.1 million and
TE- 8.8 million) in any one year for each incident.

 In addition to the public liability insurance provided pursuant to
the Price-Anderson Act, the Companies have also obtained insurance coverage in
limited amounts for economic loss and property damage arising out of nuclear
incidents. The Companies are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited
(NEIL) which provides coverage (NEIL I) for the extra expense of replacement
power incurred due to prolonged accidental outages of nuclear units. Under NEIL
I, the Companies have policies, renewable yearly, corresponding to their
respective nuclear interests, which provide an aggregate indemnity of up to
approximately 1.182 billion (OE- 315 million, Penn- 222 million, CEI- 382
million and TE- 263 million) for replacement power costs incurred during an
outage after an initial 12-week waiting period. Members of NEIL I pay annual
premiums and are subject to assessments if losses exceed the accumulated funds
available to the insurer. The Companies' present maximum aggregate assessment
for incidents at any covered nuclear facility occurring

during a policy year would be approximately 11.3 million (OE- 3.1 million,
Penn- 2.3 million, CEI- 3.5 million and TE- 2.4 million).

 The Companies are insured as to their respective nuclear interests
under property damage insurance provided by NEIL to the operating company for
each plant. Under these arrangements, 2.75 billion of coverage for
decontamination costs, decommissioning costs, debris removal and repair and/or
replacement of property is provided. The Companies pay annual premiums for this
coverage and are liable for retrospective assessments of up to approximately
 59.7 million (OE- 16.1 million, Penn- 11.6 million, CEI- 18.5 million, TE- 12.7
million, JCP&L- 0.2 million, Met-Ed- 0.4 million and Penelec- 0.2 million)
during a policy year.

 The Companies intend to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as
described above as long as it is available. To the extent that replacement
power, property damage, decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement
costs and other such costs arising from a nuclear incident at any of the
Companies' plants exceed the policy limits of the insurance in effect with
respect to that plant, to the extent a nuclear incident is determined not to be
covered by the Companies' insurance policies, or to the extent such insurance
becomes unavailable in the future, the Companies would remain at risk for such
costs.

 The NRC requires nuclear power plant licensees to obtain minimum
property insurance coverage of 1.06 billion or the amount generally available
from private sources, whichever is less. The proceeds of this insurance are
required to be used first to ensure that the licensed reactor is in a safe and
stable condition and can be maintained in that condition so as to prevent any
significant risk to the public health and safety. Within 30 days of
stabilization, the licensee is required to prepare and submit to the NRC a
cleanup plan for approval. The plan is required to identify all cleanup
operations necessary to decontaminate the reactor sufficiently to permit the
resumption of operations or to commence decommissioning. Any property insurance
proceeds not already expended to place the reactor in a safe and stable
condition must be used first to complete those decontamination operations that
are ordered by the NRC. The Companies are unable to predict what effect these
requirements may have on the availability of insurance proceeds to the Companies
for the Companies' bondholders.

Environmental Matters

 Various federal, state and local authorities regulate the Companies
with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters.
FirstEnergy estimates additional capital expenditures for environmental
compliance of approximately 225 million, which is included in the construction
forecast provided under "Capital Requirements" for 2002 through 2006.

 Air Regulation

 Under the provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1970, the States of Ohio
and New Jersey and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have adopted ambient air
quality standards, and related emission limits, including limits for sulfur
dioxide (SO2) and particulates. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) promulgated an SO2 regulatory plan for Ohio which became effective
for OE's, CEI's and TE's plants in 1977. Generating plants to be constructed in
the future and some future modifications of existing facilities will be covered
not only by the applicable state standards but also by EPA emission performance
standards for new sources. In Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania the construction
or certain modifications of emission sources requires approval from appropriate
environmental authorities, and the facilities involved may not be operated
unless a permit or variance to do so has been issued by those same authorities.

 The Companies are required to meet federally approved SO2
regulations. Violations of such regulations can result in shutdown of the
generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of up to 27,500 for
each day the unit is in violation. The EPA has an interim enforcement policy for
SO2 regulations in Ohio that allows for compliance based on a 30-day averaging
period. The Companies cannot predict what action the EPA may take in the future
with respect to the interim enforcement policy.

 The Companies are in compliance with the current SO2 and nitrogen
oxides (NOx) reduction requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
SO2 reductions are being achieved by burning lower-sulfur fuel, generating more
electricity from lower-emitting plants, and/or using emission allowances. NOx
reductions are being achieved through combustion controls and the generation of
more electricity at lower-emitting plants. In September 1998, the EPA finalized
regulations requiring additional NOx reductions from the Companies' Ohio, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania facilities. The EPA's NOx Transport Rule imposes uniform
reductions of NOx emissions (an approximate 85 reduction in utility plant NOx
emissions from projected 2007 emissions) across a region of nineteen states and
the District of Columbia, including New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania, based on
a conclusion that such NOx emissions are contributing significantly to ozone
pollution in the eastern United States. State Implementation Plans (SIP) must
comply by May 31, 2004 with individual state NOx budgets established by the EPA.
Pennsylvania submitted a SIP that requires compliance with the NOx budgets at
the Companies' Pennsylvania facilities by May 1, 2003 and Ohio submitted a
"draft" SIP that requires compliance with the NOx budgets at the Companies' Ohio
facilities by May 31, 2004. The Companies continue to evaluate their compliance
plans and other compliance options.

 In July 1997, the EPA promulgated changes in the National Ambient Air
Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone emissions and proposed a new NAAQS for
previously unregulated ultra-fine particulate matter. In May 1999, the U.S.
Court of Appeals found constitutional and other defects in the new NAAQS rules.
In February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the new NAAQS rules regulating
ultra-fine particulates but found defects in the new NAAQS rules for ozone and
decided that the EPA must revise those rules. The future cost of compliance with
these regulations may be substantial and will depend if and how they are
ultimately implemented by the states in which the Companies operate affected
facilities.

 In 1999 and 2000, the EPA issued Notices of Violation (NOV) or a
Compliance Order to nine utilities covering 44 power plants, including the W. H.
Sammis Plant. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice filed eight civil
complaints against various investor-owned utilities, which included a complaint
against OE and Penn in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Ohio. The NOV and complaint allege violations of the Clean Air Act based on
operation and maintenance of the Sammis Plant dating back to 1984. The complaint
requests permanent injunctive relief to require the installation of "best
available control technology" and civil penalties of up to 27,500 per day of
violation. Although unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings,
FirstEnergy believes the Sammis Plant is in full compliance with the Clean Air
Act and the NOV and complaint are without merit. Penalties could be imposed if
the Sammis Plant continues to operate without correcting the alleged violations
and a court determines that the allegations are valid. The Sammis Plant
continues to operate while these proceedings are pending.

 In December 2000, the EPA announced it would proceed with the
development of regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants from electric
power plants. The EPA identified mercury as the hazardous air pollutant of
greatest concern. The EPA established a schedule to propose regulations by
December 2003 and issue final regulations by December 2004. The future cost of
compliance with these regulations may be substantial.

Water Regulation

 Various water quality regulations, the majority of which are the
result of the federal Clean Water Act and its amendments, apply to the
Companies' plants. In addition, Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have water
quality standards applicable to the Companies' operations. As provided in the
Clean Water Act, authority to grant federal National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System water discharge permits can be assumed by a state. Ohio, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania have assumed such authority.

 Waste Disposal

 As a result of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as
amended, and the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state
hazardous waste regulations have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel
combustion waste products, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste
disposal requirements pending the EPA's evaluation of the need for future
regulation. The EPA has issued its final regulatory determination that
regulation of coal ash as a hazardous waste is unnecessary. In April 2000, the
EPA announced that it will develop national standards regulating disposal of
coal ash under its authority to regulate nonhazardous waste.

 Various environmental liabilities have been recognized on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2001, based on estimates of the
total costs of cleanup, the Companies' proportionate responsibility for such
costs and the financial ability of other nonaffiliated entities to pay. The
Companies have been named as "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste
disposal sites which may require cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of disposal of
hazardous substances at historical sites and the liability involved, are often
unsubstantiated and subject to dispute. Federal law provides that all PRPs for a
particular site be held liable on a joint and several basis. In addition, JCP&L
has accrued liabilities for environmental remediation of former manufactured gas
plants in New Jersey. The Companies have total accrued liabilities aggregating
approximately 60 million as of December 31, 2001. FirstEnergy does not believe
environmental remediation costs will have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

 In 1980, Congress passed the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act
which provides that the disposal of low-level radioactive waste is the
responsibility of the state where such waste is generated. The Act encourages
states to form compacts among themselves to develop regional disposal
facilities. Failure by a state or compact to begin implementation of a program
could result in access denial to the two facilities currently accepting
low-level radioactive waste. Ohio is part of the Midwest Compact and has
responsibility for siting and constructing a disposal facility. On June 26,
1997, the Midwest Compact Commission (Compact) voted to cease all siting
activities in the host state of Ohio and to dismantle the Ohio Low-Level
Radioactive Waste Facility Development Authority, the statutory agency charged
with siting and constructing the low-level radioactive waste disposal facility.
While the Compact remains intact, it has no plans to site or construct a
low-level radioactive waste disposal facility in the Midwest. The Companies
continue to ship low-level radioactive waste from their nuclear facilities to
the Barnwell, South Carolina waste disposal facility.

 Summary

 Environmental controls are still developing and require, in many
instances, balancing the needs for additional quantities of energy in future
years and the need to protect the environment. As a result, the Companies cannot
now estimate the precise effect of existing and potential regulations and
legislation upon any of their existing and proposed facilities and operations or
upon their ability to issue additional first mortgage bonds under their
respective mortgages. These mortgages contain covenants by the Companies to
observe and conform to all valid governmental requirements at the time
applicable unless in course of contest, and provisions which, in effect, prevent
the issuance of additional bonds if there is a completed default under the
mortgage. The provisions of each of the mortgages, in effect, also require, in
the opinion of counsel for the respective Companies, that certification of
property additions as the basis for the issuance of bonds or other action under
the mortgages be accompanied by an opinion of counsel that the company
certifying such property additions has all governmental permissions at the time
necessary for its then current ownership and operation of such property
additions. The Companies intend to contest any requirements they deem
unreasonable or impossible for compliance or otherwise contrary to the public
interest. Developments in these and other areas of regulation may require the
Companies to modify, supplement or replace equipment and facilities, and may
delay or impede the construction and operation of new facilities, at costs which
could be substantial.

Fuel Supply

 The Companies' sources of generation during 2001 were:

 Coal Nuclear
 ---- -------

 OE.................... 72.8 27.2 
 Penn.................. 37.5 62.5 
 CEI................... 53.8 46.2 
 TE.................... 42.3 57.7 
 Total FirstEnergy..... 57.5 42.5 

 Generation from JCP&L's and Met-Ed's hydro and combustion turbine
generation facilities was minimal in 2001.

 FirstEnergy currently has long-term coal contracts which will provide
approximately 13,500,000 tons for the year 2002. The contracts are shared among
the Companies based on various economic considerations. This contract coal is
produced primarily from mines located in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West
Virginia. The contracts expire at various times through December 31, 2007.

 The Companies estimate their 2002 coal requirements to be
approximately 15,190,000 tons (OE - 6,770,000, Penn - 6,110,000, CEI -
1,590,000, and TE - 720,000). These requirements assume that the sale of the
Lake Plants (Ashtabula, Bay Shore, Eastlake and Lakeshore) to NRG will be
completed by June 1, 2002. See "Environmental Matters" for factors pertaining to
meeting environmental regulations affecting coal-fired generating units.

 OES Fuel was the sole lessor for OE's and Penn's nuclear fuel
requirements (see "Capital Requirements," Note 4G of Notes to FirstEnergy's
Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 3G of Notes to OE's Consolidated
Financial Statements). OES Fuel credit agreements expire as of March 31, 2002.
OE and Penn have arranged for other financing for their nuclear fuel
requirements. Nuclear fuel is currently financed for CEI and TE through a
revolving line of credit.

 FirstEnergy has contracts for uranium material and conversion
services through 2006. The enrichment services are contracted for the majority
of the enrichment requirements for nuclear fuel through 2006. Fabrication
services for fuel assemblies are contracted for the next two reloads for Beaver
Valley Unit 1, three reloads for Beaver Valley Unit 2 (through approximately
2004 and 2005, respectively), the next two reloads for Davis-Besse (through
approximately 2005) and through the life of the plant for Perry (through
approximately 2026). In addition to the existing commitments, FirstEnergy
intends to make additional arrangements for the supply of uranium and for the
subsequent conversion, enrichment, fabrication, and waste disposal services.

 On-site spent fuel storage facilities are expected to be adequate for
Perry through 2011; facilities at Beaver Valley Units 1 and 2 are expected to be
adequate through 2018 and 2009, respectively. After scheduled plant
modifications are completed in 2002, Davis-Besse will have adequate storage
through the remainder of its operating license period. After current on-site
storage capacity is exhausted, additional storage capacity will have to be
obtained either through plant modifications, interim off-site disposal, or
permanent waste disposal facilities. The Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
1982 provides for the construction of facilities for the permanent disposal of
high-level nuclear wastes, including spent fuel from nuclear power plants
operated by electric utilities; however, the selection of a suitable site is
embroiled in the political process. FirstEnergy has contracts with the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) for the disposal of spent fuel for Beaver Valley,
Davis-Besse and Perry. On February 15, 2002, President Bush approved the DOE's
recommendation of Yucca Mountain for underground disposal of spent nuclear fuel
from nuclear power plants and high level waste from U.S. defense programs. Those
who oppose this recommendation have filed to overturn this decision and both
houses of Congress have 90 consecutive days of session from the filing date to
override this opposition. The recommendation by President Bush enables the
process to proceed to the licensing phase. Based on the DOE schedule published
in the July 1999 Draft Environmental Impact Statement, the Yucca Mountain
Repository is currently projected to start receiving spent fuel in 2010.
FirstEnergy intends to make additional arrangements for storage capacity as a
contingency for further delays with the DOE acceptance of spent fuel for
disposal past 2010.

System Capacity and Reserves

 The 2001 net maximum hourly demand for each of the Companies was:
OE-6,253 MW (including an additional 387 MW of firm power sales under a contract
which extends through 2005) on August 8, 2001; Penn-1,011MW (including an
additional 63 MW of firm power sales under a contract which extends through
2005) on August 8, 2001; CEI-4,446 MW on August 7, 2001; TE-2,047 MW on July 23,
2001; JCP&L-5,592 MW on August 9, 2001; Met-Ed-2,567 MW on August 9, 2001; and
Penelec-2,654 MW on August 9, 2001. JCP&L's load was auctioned off in the New
Jersey BGS Auction, transferring the full 5,100 MW load obligation to other
parties for the period August 1, 2002 to July 31, 2003. FES participated in the
auction and won a segment of that load.

Based on existing capacity plans, ongoing arrangements for firm
purchase contracts, and anticipated term power sales and purchases, FirstEnergy
has sufficient supply resources to meet load obligations. The current
FirstEnergy capacity portfolio contains 13,285 MW of owned generation and
approximately 1,600 MW of long-term purchases from non-utility generators. An
additional 340 MW of peaking capacity will be added around mid-2002.

 The sale of four power plants expected to close in mid-2002 will have
little impact on the supply plan. As part of the asset sale, FirstEnergy's PPA
will provide a similar amount of electricity from the purchaser as would have
been expected prior to the sale. The PPA runs from the close of the sale
transaction, expected mid year 2002, through December 31, 2005 which is the end
of the transition period for the Ohio operating companies.

 Any remaining load obligations will be met through a mix of
multi-year forward purchases, short-term forward purchases (less than one year)
and spot market purchases.

Regional Reliability

 The Companies participate with 24 other electric companies operating
in nine states in ECAR, which was organized for the purpose of furthering the
reliability of bulk power supply in the area through coordination of the
planning and operation by the ECAR members of their bulk power supply
facilities. The ECAR members have established principles and procedures
regarding matters affecting the reliability of the bulk power supply within the
ECAR region. Procedures have been adopted regarding: i) the evaluation and
simulated testing of systems' performance; ii) the establishment of minimum
levels of daily operating reserves; iii) the development of a program regarding
emergency procedures during conditions of declining system frequency; and iv)
the basis for uniform rating of generating equipment.

 Following the FirstEnergy/GPU merger the transmission facilities of
JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec continue to be operated by PJM. PJM is the
organization responsible for the operation and control of the bulk electric
power system throughout major portions of five Mid-Atlantic states and the
District of Columbia. PJM is dedicated to meeting the reliability criteria and
standards of the North American Reliability Council and the Mid-Atlantic Area
Council.

Competition

 The Companies had traditionally competed with other utilities for
intersystem bulk power sales and for sales to municipalities and cooperatives.
The Companies compete with suppliers of natural gas and other forms of energy in
connection with their industrial and commercial sales and in the home climate
control market, both with respect to new customers and conversions, and with all
other suppliers of electricity. To date, there has been no substantial
cogeneration by the Companies' customers.

 As a result of the actions taken by state legislative bodies over the
last few years, major changes in the electric utility business are occurring in
parts of the United States, including Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania where
FirstEnergy's utility subsidiaries operate. These changes have resulted in
fundamental alterations in the way traditional integrated utilities and holding
company systems, like FirstEnergy, conduct their business. In accordance with
the Ohio electric utility restructuring law under which Ohio electric customers
could begin choosing their electric generation suppliers starting in January
2001, FirstEnergy has further aligned its business units to accommodate its
retail strategy and participate in the competitive electricity marketplace in
Ohio. The organizational changes are intended to deal with the unbundling of
electric utility services and new ways of conducting business.

 Sales of electricity in deregulated markets are diversifying
FirstEnergy's revenue sources through its competitive subsidiaries in areas
outside of the Companies' franchise areas. This strategy has positioned
FirstEnergy to compete in the northeast quadrant of the United States - the
region targeted by the Company for growth. FirstEnergy's competitive
subsidiaries are actively participating in deregulated energy markets in Ohio,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland. Currently, FES is providing
electric generation to customers within those states. As additional states
within the northeast region of the United States become deregulated, FES is
preparing to enter these markets.

 Competition in Ohio's electric generation began on January 1, 2001.
FirstEnergy moved the operation of the generation portion of its business to the
competitive business unit as reflected in its approved Ohio transition plan. The
Companies will continue to provide generation services to regulated franchise
customers who have not chosen an alternative, competitive generation supplier,
except in New Jersey where JCP&L's obligation to provide BGS has been removed
through a transitional mechanism of auctioning the obligation (see "NJBPU Rate
Matters"). The Ohio Companies and Penn obtain their generation through power
supply agreements with FES. In addition to electric generation, FES is also
competing in deregulated natural gas markets as well as offering other
energy-related products and services.

Research and Development

 The Companies participate in funding the Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI), which was formed for the purpose of expanding electric
research and development under the voluntary sponsorship of the nation's
electric utility

industry - public, private and cooperative. Its goal is to mutually benefit
utilities and their customers by promoting the development of new and improved
technologies to help the utility industry meet present and future electric
energy needs in environmentally and economically acceptable ways. EPRI conducts
research on all aspects of electric power production and use, including fuels,
generation, delivery, energy management and conservation, environmental effects
and energy analysis. The major portion of EPRI research and development projects
is directed toward practical solutions and their applications to problems
currently facing the electric utility industry. In 2001, approximately 69 of
the Companies' research and development expenditures were related to EPRI.

Executive Officers

 The executive officers are elected at the annual organization meeting
of the Board of Directors, held immediately after the annual meeting of
stockholders, and hold office until the next such organization meeting, unless
the Board of Directors shall otherwise determine, or unless a resignation is
submitted.

Prolonged outages of existing generating units might make it
necessary for the Companies, depending upon the demand for electric service upon
their system, to use to a greater extent than otherwise, less efficient and less
economic generating units, or purchased power, and in some cases may require the
reduction of load during peak periods under the Companies' interruptible
programs, all to an extent not presently determinable.

 The Companies' generating plants and load centers are connected by a
transmission system consisting of elements having various voltage ratings
ranging from 23 kilovolts (kV) to 345 kV. The Companies' overhead and
underground transmission lines aggregate 14,952 pole miles.

 The Companies' electric distribution systems include 110,548 miles of
overhead pole line and underground conduit carrying primary, secondary and
street lighting circuits. They own substations with a total installed
transformer capacity of 86,566,000 kilovolt-amperes.

FirstEnergy's transmission facilities that are owned and operated by
ATSI also interconnect with those of AEP, DPL, Duquesne Light Company, Allegheny
Energy, Inc., Michigan Electric Coordination Systems and Penelec. The
transmission facilities of JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec are physically
interconnected and are operated on an integrated basis as part of the PJM RTO.

In our opinion, the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2000 and the
related consolidated statements of income, and cash flows for each of the two
years in the period ended December 31, 2000 (appearing on the accompanying index
of the Jersey Central Power & Light Company 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders

Central Power & Light Company and Subsidiary Company at December 31, 2000 and

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

years in the period ended December 31, 2000 (appearing on the accompanying index
of the Metropolitan Edison Company 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders
incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K) present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of
Metropolitan Edison Company and Subsidiary Companies at December 31, 2000 and
for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States, the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2001 and

Report to Stockholders incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and have
issued our report thereon dated March 18, 2002. Our audit was made for the
purpose of forming an opinion on those statements taken as a whole. The schedule
of consolidated valuation and qualifying accounts listed in Item 14 is the
responsibility of the Company's management and is presented for the purpose of
complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of
the basic consolidated financial statements. The information included in this

procedures applied in the audit of the basic consolidated financial statements
and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole. The consolidated financial statements as of
December 31, 2000 and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31,
2000, together with the related information included in this schedule, were
audited by other auditors whose report dated January 31, 2001, expressed an

 and Directors that will link their personal interests to the long-term
 financial success of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and to growth in

 special effort the successful conduct of their operations is largely

 2.1.30 "Voting Stock" shall mean securities of any class or classes of
 stock of a corporation, the holders of which are ordinarily, in the
 absence of contingencies, entitled to elect a majority of the
 corporate directors.

2.2 GENDER AND NUMBER. Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any
 masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine, the plural

 or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect
 the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and
 enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.

ARTICLE 3 ADMINISTRATION
 --------------

3.1 THE COMMITTEE. The Plan shall be administered by the Committee, which
 consists of not less than three Directors who shall be appointed from time
 to time by, and shall serve at the discretion of, the Board of Directors.
 To the extent required to comply with Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act,
 each member of the Committee shall qualify as a "Non-Employee Director" as
 defined in Rule 16b-3 or any successor definition adopted by the Securities
 and Exchange Commission. To the extent required to comply with Code Section
 162(m), each member of the Committee shall also be an Outside Director.

 5

3.2 AUTHORITY OF THE COMMITTEE. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the
 Committee shall have full power to construe and interpret the Plan; to
 establish, amend or waive rules and regulations for its administration; to
 accelerate the exercisability of any Award or the end of a performance
 period or the termination of any Period of Restriction or any award
 agreement, or any other instrument relating to an Award under the Plan; and
 (subject to the provisions of Article 15 herein) to amend the terms and
 conditions of any outstanding Option, Stock Appreciation Right or other
 Award to the extent such terms and conditions are within the discretion of
 the Committee as provided in the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
 Committee shall have no authority to adjust upwards the amount payable to a
 Covered Employee with respect to a particular Award, to take any of the
 foregoing actions, or to take any other action to the extent that such
 action or the Committee's ability to take such action would cause any Award
 under the Plan to any Covered Employee to fail to qualify as
 "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Code Section
 162(m)(4) and the regulations issued thereunder. Subject to section 4.3, in
 no event shall the Committee have the right to i) cancel outstanding
 Options or SARs for the purpose of replacing or regranting such Options or
 SARs with an exercise price that is less than the original exercise price
 of the Option or SAR, or ii) change the Option Price of an Option or SAR to
 an exercise price that is less than the original Option or SAR exercise
 price, without first obtaining the approval of shareholders. Also
 notwithstanding the foregoing, no action of the Committee (other than
 pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof or Section 9.4 hereof) may, without the
 consent of the person or persons entitled to exercise any outstanding
 Option or Stock Appreciation Right or to receive payment of any other
 outstanding Award, adversely affect the rights of such person or persons.

3.3 SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS. The Committee shall have the authority to grant
 Awards under the Plan, from time to time, to such Key Employees and
 Directors as may be selected by it. The Committee shall select Participants
 from among those who they have identified as being Key Employees or
 Directors.

3.4 DECISIONS BINDING. All determinations and decisions made by the Committee
 pursuant to the provisions of the Plan and all related orders or
 resolutions of the Board of Directors shall be final, conclusive and
 binding on all persons, including the Company and its Subsidiaries, its
 stockholders, employees, and Participants and their estates and
 beneficiaries, and such determinations and decisions shall not be
 reviewable.

3.5 DELEGATION OF CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES. The Committee may, in its sole
 discretion, delegate to an officer or officers of the Company the
 administration of the Plan under this Article 3; provided, however, that no
 such delegation by the Committee shall be made with respect to the
 administration of the Plan as it affects Directors of the Company or
 Covered Employees and provided further that the Committee may not delegate
 its authority to correct errors, omissions or inconsistencies in the Plan.
 The Committee may delegate to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company
 its authority under this Article 3 to grant Awards to Key Employees who are
 not Covered Employees. All authority delegated by the Committee under this
 Section 3.5 shall be exercised in accordance with the provisions of the
 Plan and any guidelines for the exercise of such authority that may from
 time to time be established by the Committee.

 6

3.6 PROCEDURES OF THE COMMITTEE. All determinations of the Committee shall be
 made by not less than a majority of its members present at the meeting (in
 person or otherwise) at which a quorum is present. A majority of the entire
 Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Any
 action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Committee may
 be taken without a meeting if a unanimous written consent, which sets forth
 the action, is signed by each member of the Committee and filed with the
 minutes for proceedings of the Committee. Service on the Committee shall
 constitute service as a director of the Company so that members of the
 Committee shall be entitled to indemnification, limitation of liability and
 reimbursement of expenses with respect to their services as members of the
 Committee to the same extent that they are entitled under the Company's
 Articles of Incorporation and Ohio law for their services as directors of
 the Company.

3.7 AWARD AGREEMENTS. Stock-based Awards under the Plan shall be evidenced by
 an award agreement, which shall be signed by an authorized officer of the
 Company or delegate and by the Participant, and shall contain such terms
 and conditions as may be approved by the Committee. Such terms and
 conditions need not be the same in all cases.

3.8 CONDITIONS ON AWARDS. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the
 Board or the Committee may impose such conditions on any Award (including,
 without limitation, the right of the Board or the Committee to limit the
 time of exercise to specified periods).

 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, all Awards under this
 Plan shall be subject to the following conditions:

 (i) Except in the case of death, no SAR, ISO, NSO or other option granted
 pursuant to Article 6 shall be exercisable for at least six months
 after its grant; and

 (ii) Except in the case of death, no Restricted Stock or Performance Share
 (or a Share issued in payment thereof) shall be sold for at least six
 months after its grant.

3.9 SATURDAYS, SUNDAYS AND HOLIDAYS. When a date referenced in an award
 Agreement falls on a Saturday, Sunday or other day when the FirstEnergy
 General Office is closed, the date reference will revert back to the day
 prior to such date.

ARTICLE 4 STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN
 -------------------------

4.1 NUMBER OF SHARES. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.3 herein,
 the aggregate number of Shares that may be delivered under the Plan at any
 time shall not exceed 15,000,000 Shares of common stock of the Company. No
 more than three-quarters of such aggregate number of such Shares shall be
 issued as Restricted Stock under Article 8 of the Plan or as Performance
 Shares under Article 9. Stock delivered under the Plan may consist, in
 whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares, treasury shares or
 shares purchased on the open market. The exercise of a Stock Appreciation
 Right, whether paid in cash or Stock, shall be deemed to be an issuance of
 Stock under the Plan.

 7

4.2 LAPSED AWARDS. If any Award granted under this Plan terminates, expires, or
 lapses for any reason, any Stock subject to such Award again shall be
 available for the grant of an Award under the Plan, subject to Section 7.2
 herein. If the value of any Performance Shares issued under Article 9 are
 paid in cash after a Performance Period has ended, such stock subject to
 such award shall again be available for the grant of an award under the
 Plan.

4.3 ADJUSTMENTS IN AUTHORIZED SHARES. In the event of any merger,
 reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, separation, liquidation,
 stock dividend, split-up, share combination, or other change in the
 corporate structure of the Company affecting the Stock, such adjustment
 shall be made in the number and class of shares which may be delivered
 under the Plan, and in the number and class of and/or price of shares
 subject to outstanding Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock
 Awards and Performance Shares, granted under the Plan, as may be determined
 to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee, in its sole discretion,
 to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights; and provided that the number
 of shares subject to any Award shall always be a whole number. Any
 adjustment of an Incentive Stock Option under this paragraph shall be made
 in such a manner so as not to constitute a modification within the meaning
 of Section 425(h)(3) of the Code.

ARTICLE 5 ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION
 -----------------------------

5.1 ELIGIBILITY. Persons eligible to receive Awards under all Articles of this
 Plan except Article 11 include all employees of the Company and its
 Subsidiaries who, in the opinion of the Committee, are Key Employees. Key
 Employees may include employees who are members of the Board, but may not
 include Directors who are not employees. Directors who are not employees
 may receive Awards under this Plan exclusively under Articles 6 and 8,
 subject to Article 11.

5.2 ACTUAL PARTICIPATION. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee
 may from time to time select those Key Employees to whom Awards shall be
 granted and determine the nature and amount of each Award. No employee
 shall have any right to be granted an Award under this Plan even if
 previously granted an Award.

ARTICLE 6 STOCK OPTIONS
 -------------

6.1 GRANT OF OPTIONS. Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, Options
 may be granted to Participants at any time and from time to time as shall
 be determined by the Committee. The maximum number of Shares subject to
 Options granted to any individual Participant in any calendar year shall be
 five hundred thousand (500,000) Shares. The Committee shall have the sole
 discretion, subject to the requirements of the Plan, to determine the
 actual number of Shares subject to Options granted to any Participant. The
 Committee may grant any type of Option to purchase Stock that is permitted
 by law at the time of grant, including, but not limited to, ISO's and
 NSO's. However, no employee may receive an Award of Incentive Stock Options
 that are first exercisable during any calendar year to the extent that the

 8

aggregate Fair Market Value of the Stock(determined at the time the options
 are granted) exceeds 100,000. Nothing in this Article 6 shall be deemed to
 prevent the grant of NSO's in excess of the maximum established by Section
 422 of the Code. Unless otherwise expressly provided at the time of grant,
 Options granted under the Plan will be NSO's. Notwithstanding any other
 provision of the Plan, no ISO shall be granted after May 1, 2008.

6.2 OPTION AGREEMENT. Each Option grant shall be evidenced by an Option
 agreement that shall specify the type of Option granted, the Option price,
 the duration of the Option, the number of Shares to which the Option
 pertains, and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine. The
 Option agreement shall specify whether the Option is intended to be an
 Incentive Stock Option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, or a
 Nonqualified Stock Option whose grant is not intended to be subject to the
 provisions of Code Section 422.

6.3 OPTION PRICE. The purchase price per share of Stock covered by an Option
 shall be determined by the Committee but shall not be less than 100 of the
 Fair Market Value of such Stock on the date the Option is granted.

 An Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who, at the time of grant,
 owns (within the meaning of Section 425(d) of the Code) Stock possessing
 more than 10 of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of
 the Company, shall have an exercise price which is at least 110 of the
 Fair Market Value of the Stock subject to the Option.

6.4 DURATION OF OPTIONS. Each Option shall expire at such time as the Committee
 shall determine at the time of grant; provided, however, that no Option
 shall be exercisable later than the tenth (10th) anniversary date of its
 grant.

6.5 EXERCISE OF OPTIONS. Subject to Section 3.8 herein, Options granted under
 the Plan shall be exercisable at such times and be subject to such
 restrictions and conditions as the Committee shall in each instance
 approve, which need not be the same for all Participants. All options
 within a single grant need not be exercised at one time.

6.6 PAYMENT. Options shall be exercised by the delivery of a written notice to
 the Company setting forth the number of Shares with respect to which the
 Option is to be exercised, accompanied by full payment for the Shares. The
 Option price upon exercise of any Option shall be payable to the Company
 in full either:

 (a) in cash or its equivalent;

 (b) by tendering Shares of previously acquired Stock having a Fair Market
 Value at the time of exercise equal to the total Option price,

 (c) by foregoing compensation under rules established by the Committee,

 (d) by delivery by the Participant of irrevocable instructions to an
 approved broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of the
 sale or loan proceeds to pay the exercise price, or

 (e) such other consideration as the Committee may deem appropriate.

 9

The proceeds from such a payment shall be added to the general funds of the
 Company and shall be used for general corporate purposes. As soon as
 practicable, after the Company's receipt of written notification and
 payment, the Participant shall receive either:

 (i) stock certificates in an appropriate amount based upon the number of
 Options exercised, issued in the Participant's name:

 (ii) cash in an amount equal to the difference between the sale price of
 such Shares and the Option price less taxes and administrative
 expenses; or

 (iii)a combination of the foregoing.

6.7 RESTRICTIONS ON STOCK TRANSFERABILITY. The Committee shall impose such
 restrictions on any Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option
 under the Plan as it may deem advisable, including, without limitation,
 restrictions under applicable Federal securities law, under the
 requirements of any stock exchange upon which such Shares are then listed
 and under any blue sky or state securities laws applicable to such Shares.

6.8 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT DUE TO DEATH, DISABILITY, OR RETIREMENT. In the
 event the employment of a Participant is terminated by reason of death, any
 of such Participant's outstanding Options shall become immediately
 exercisable at any time prior to the expiration date of the Options or
 within one year after such date of termination of employment, whichever
 period is shorter, by such person or persons as shall have acquired the
 Participant's rights under the Option pursuant to Article 12 hereof or by
 will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

 In the event the employment of a Participant is terminated by reason of
 disability or retirement, including early retirement, (as defined under the
 then established rules of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the
 case may be), any of such Participant's outstanding Options shall continue
 to vest per the vesting schedule of the Participant's Option Agreement;
 provided, however, that if the Participant subsequently dies with
 unexercised options, the vesting and exercisaeability will be governed by
 the first sentence of 6.8.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, the Committee may, in its
 sole discretion, lengthen the exercise period up to the expiration date for
 an individual participant if it deems this is in the best interest of the
 Company. In the case of Incentive Stock Options, the favorable tax
 treatment prescribed under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of
 l986, as amended, may not be available if the Options are not exercised
 within the Code Section 422 prescribed time period after termination of
 employment for death, disability, or retirement.

6.9 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT FOR OTHER REASONS. If the employment of a
 Participant shall terminate for any reason other than death, disability,
 retirement (including early retirement) or for Cause, the Participant shall
 have the right to exercise such Participant's outstanding Options within 90
 days after the date of his termination, but in no event beyond the
 expiration of the term of the Options and only to the extent that the
 Participant was entitled to exercise the Options at the date of his
 termination of employment. In its sole discretion, the Committee may extend
 the 90 days to up to one year but, however, in no event beyond the
 expiration date of the Option.

 If the employment of the Participant shall terminate for Cause, all of the
 Participant's outstanding Options shall be immediately forfeited back to
 the Company.

 10

6.10 NONTRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS. No Option granted under the Plan may be
 sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or
 hypothecated, otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and
 distribution. Further, all Options granted to a Participant under the Plan
 shall be exercisable during his lifetime only by such Participant.

ARTICLE 7 STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
 -------------------------

7.1 GRANT OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 the Plan, Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted to Participants, at the
 discretion of the Committee, in any of the following forms:

 (a) in lieu of Options;

 (b) in addition to Options;

 (c) independent of Options; or

 (d) in any combination of (a), (b), or (c).

 The maximum numbers of Shares subject to SARs granted to any individual
 Participant in any calendar year shall be five hundred thousand (500,000)
 Shares. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, the Committee shall
 have the sole discretion, subject to the requirements of the Plan, to
 determine the actual number of Shares subject to SARs granted to any
 Participant.

7.2 EXERCISE OF SARS IN LIEU OF OPTIONS. SARs granted in lieu of Options may be
 exercised for all or part of the Shares subject to the related Option upon
 the surrender of the related Options representing the right to purchase an
 equivalent number of Shares. The SAR may be exercised only with respect to
 the Shares of Stock for which its related Option is then exercisable.
 Option Stock with respect to which the SAR shall have been exercised may
 not be subject again to an Award under the Plan.

 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, with
 respect to a SAR granted in lieu of an Incentive Stock Option:

 (i) the SAR will expire no later than the expiration of the underlying
 Incentive Stock Option;

 (ii) the SAR amount may be forno more than one hundred percent (100 of
 the difference between the exercise price of the underlying Incentive
 Stock Option and the Fair Market Value of the Stock subject to the
 underlying Incentive Stock Option at the time the SAR is exercised;
 and

 (iii) the SAR may be exercised only when the Fair Market Value of the Stock
 subject to the Incentive Stock Option exceeds the exercise price of
 the Incentive Stock Option.

7.3 EXERCISE OF SARS IN ADDITION TO OPTIONS. SARs granted in addition to
 Options shall be deemed to be exercised upon the exercise of the related
 Options. The deemed exercise of SARs granted in addition to Options shall
 not necessitate a reduction in the number of related Options.

 11

7.4 EXERCISE OF SARS INDEPENDENT OF OPTIONS. Subject to Section 3.8 herein and
 Section 7.5 herein, SARs granted independently of Options may be exercised
 upon whatever terms and conditions the Committee, in its sole discretion,
 imposes upon the SARs, including, but not limited to, a corresponding
 proportional reduction in previously granted Options.

7.5 PAYMENT OF SAR AMOUNT. Upon exercise of the SAR, the holder shall be
 entitled to receive payment of an amount determined by multiplying:

 (a) The difference between the market price of a Share on the date of
 exercise over the price fixed by the Committee at the date of grant
 (which price shall not be less than 100 of the market price of a
 Share on the date of grant) (the Exercise Price); by

 (b) The number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.

7.6 FORM AND TIMING OF PAYMENT. Payment to a Participant, upon SAR exercise,
 will be made in cash or stock, at the discretion of the Committee, as soon
 as administratively possible after exercise.

7.7 TERM OF SAR. The term of an SAR granted under the Plan shall not exceed ten
 years.

7.8 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. In the event the employment of a Participant is
 terminated by reason of death, disability, retirement (including early
 retirement), or any other reason, the exercisability of any outstanding SAR
 granted in lieu of or in addition to an Option shall terminate in the same
 manner as its related Option as specified under Sections 6.8 and 6.9
 herein. The exercisability of any outstanding SARs granted independent of
 Options also shall terminate in the manner provided under Sections 6.8 and
 6.9 hereof.

7.9 NONTRANSFERABILITY OF SARS. No SAR granted under the Plan may be sold,
 transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated,
 other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Further, all
 SARs granted to a Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable during
 his lifetime only by such Participant.

ARTICLE 8 RESTRICTED STOCK
 ----------------

8.1 GRANT OF RESTRICTED STOCK. Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan,
 the Committee, at any time and from time to time, may grant Shares of
 Restricted Stock under the Plan to such Participants and in such amounts,
 as it shall determine. The Committee may condition the vesting or lapse of
 the Period of Restriction established pursuant to Section 8.3 upon the
 attainment of one or more of the performance goals utilized for purposes of
 Performance Shares pursuant to Article 9 hereof. As required for valuation
 of grants under the Plan, Restricted Stock will be valued at its Fair
 Market Value. The maximum number of Shares subject to issuance as
 Restricted Stock granted to any individual Participant in any calendar year
 is two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) Shares.

8.2 RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT. Each Restricted Stock grant shall be evidenced
 by a Restricted Stock agreement that shall specify the Period of
 Restriction, or periods, the number of Shares of Restricted Stock granted,
 and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine.

 12

8.3 TRANSFERABILITY. Except as provided in this Article 8 or in Section 3.8
 herein, the Shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder may not be sold,
 transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated
 until the termination of the applicable Period of Restriction or for such
 period of time as shall be established by the Committee and as shall be
 specified in the Restricted Stock agreement, or upon earlier satisfaction
 of other conditions (including any performance goals) as specified by the
 Committee in its sole discretion and set forth in the Restricted Stock
 agreement. All rights with respect to the Restricted Stock granted to a
 Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable during his lifetime only by
 such Participant.

8.4 OTHER RESTRICTIONS. The Committee shall impose such other restrictions on
 any Shares of Restricted Stock granted pursuant to the Plan as it may deem
 advisable including, without limitation, vesting or forfeiture restrictions
 under applicable Federal or state securities laws, and the Committee may
 legend certificates representing Restricted Stock to give appropriate
 notice of such restrictions.

8.5 CERTIFICATE LEGEND. In addition to any legends placed on certificates
 pursuant to Section 8.4 herein, each certificate representing Shares of
 Restricted Stock granted pursuant to the Plan shall bear the following
 legend:

 "The sale or other transfer of the shares of stock represented by this
 certificate, whether voluntary, involuntary, or by operation of law,
 is subject to certain restrictions on transfer set forth in the
 Executive and Director Incentive Compensation Plan of FirstEnergy
 Corp., in the rules and administrative procedures adopted pursuant to
 such Plan, and in a Restricted Stock Agreement dated __________. A
 copy of the Plan, such rules and procedures, and such Restricted Stock
 agreement may be obtained from the Secretary of FirstEnergy Corp."

8.6 REMOVAL OF RESTRICTIONS. Except as otherwise provided in this Article,
 Shares of Restricted Stock covered by each Restricted Stock grant made
 under the Plan shall become freely transferable by the Participant after
 the last day of the Period of Restriction. Once the Shares are released
 from the restrictions, the Participant shall be entitled to have the legend
 required by Section 8.5 removed from his Stock certificate.

8.7 VOTING RIGHTS. During the Period of Restriction, Participants holding
 Shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder may exercise full voting
 rights with respect to those Shares.

8.8 DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS. During the Period of Restriction,
 Participants holding Shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder shall be
 entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect
 to those Shares while they are so held. If any such dividends or
 distributions are paid in Shares, the Shares shall be subject to the same
 restrictions on transferability as the Shares of Restricted Stock with
 respect to which they were paid.

8.9 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT DUE TO RETIREMENT (including early retirement).
 In the event that a Participant terminates his employment with the Company
 or any of its Subsidiaries because of retirement (as defined under the then
 established rules of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case
 may be), the Committee in its sole discretion (subject to Section 3.8
 herein) may waive or modify the restrictions remaining on any or all Shares
 of Restricted Stock as it deems appropriate.

 13

8.10 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT DUE TO DEATH OR DISABILITY. In the event a
 Participant's employment is terminated because of death or disability (as
 defined under the then established rules of the Company or any of its
 Subsidiaries, as the case may be) during the Period of Restriction, any
 remaining Period of Restriction applicable to the Restricted Stock shall
 automatically terminate and, except as otherwise provided in Section 8.4.
 herein, the Shares of Restricted Stock shall thereby be free of
 restrictions and be fully transferable.

8.11 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT FOR OTHER REASONS. In the event that a
 Participant terminates his employment with the Company or any of its
 Subsidiaries for any reason other than for death, disability, or retirement
 (including early retirement), as set forth in Sections 8.9 and 8.10 herein,
 during the Period of Restriction, then any Shares of Restricted Stock still
 subject to restrictions as of the date of such termination shall
 automatically be forfeited and returned to the Company; provided, however,
 that in the event of a termination of the employment of a Participant by
 the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than for Cause, the Committee,
 in its sole discretion (subject to Section 3.8 herein), may waive or modify
 the automatic forfeiture of any or all such Shares as it deems appropriate.

ARTICLE 9 PERFORMANCE SHARES
 ------------------

9.1 GRANT OF PERFORMANCE SHARES. Subject to the terms and provisions of the
 Plan, Performance Shares may be granted to Participants at any time and
 from time to time as shall be determined by the Committee. The maximum
 number of Shares that may be issued to any Participant in a calendar year
 shall not exceed two hundred fifty thousand (250,000), subject to
 adjustment as provided in Section 4.3.

9.2 VALUE OF PERFORMANCE SHARES. The Committee shall set performance goals over
 certain periods to be determined in advance by the Committee ("Performance
 Periods"). Prior to each grant of Performance Shares, the Committee shall
 establish an initial number of Shares for each Performance Share granted to
 each Participant for that Performance Period. Prior to each grant of
 Performance Shares, the Committee also shall set the performance goals that
 will be used to determine the extent to which the Participant receives a
 payment of the number of Shares for the Performance Shares awarded for such
 Performance Period. These goals will be based on the attainment by the
 Company or its Subsidiaries of certain objective performance measures,
 which may include, but are not limited to one or more of the following:
 total shareholder return, return on equity, return on capital, earnings per
 share, market share, stock price, sales, costs, net income, cash flow,
 retained earnings, results of customer satisfaction surveys, aggregate
 product price and other product price measures, safety record, service
 reliability, demand-side management (including conservation and load
 management), operating and maintenance cost management, and energy
 production availability performance measures. Such performance goals also
 may be based upon the attainment of specified levels of performance of the
 Company or one or more Subsidiaries under one or more of the measures
 described above, relative to the performance of other corporations. The
 Committee may provide for the crediting of dividend equivalents during the
 performance period. With respect to each such performance measure utilized

 14

during a Performance Period, the Committee shall assign percentages to
 various levels of performance which shall be applied to determine the
 extent to which the Participant shall receive a payout of the number of
 Performance Shares awarded. With respect to Covered Employees, all
 performance goals shall be objective performance goals satisfying the
 requirements for "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of
 Section 162(m)(4) of the Code, and shall be set by the Committee within the
 time period prescribed by Section 162(m) of the Code and related
 regulations.

9.3 PAYMENT OF PERFORMANCE SHARES. After a Performance Period has ended, the
 holder of a Performance Share shall be entitled to receive the value
 thereof as determined by the Committee. The Committee shall make this
 determination by first determining the extent to which the performance
 goals set pursuant to Section 9.2 have been met. It will then determine the
 applicable percentage (which may exceed 100 to be applied to, and will
 apply such percentage to, the number of Performance Shares to determine the
 payout to be received by the Participant. In addition, with respect to
 Performance Shares granted to any Covered Employee, no payout shall be made
 hereunder except upon written certification by the Committee that the
 applicable performance goal or goals have been satisfied to a particular
 extent. The amount payable in cash in a calendar year to any Participant
 with respect to any Performance Period pursuant to any Performance Share
 award shall not exceed 2,000,000.

9.4 COMMITTEE DISCRETION TO ADJUST AWARDS. Subject to Section 3.2 regarding
 Awards to Covered Employees, the Committee shall have the authority to
 modify, amend or adjust the terms and conditions of any Performance Share
 award, at any time or from time to time, including but not limited to the
 performance goals.

9.5 FORM AND TIMING OF PAYMENT. The payment described in Section 9.3 herein
 shall be made in cash, Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the
 Committee. Payment may be made in a lump sum or installments as prescribed
 by the Committee. If any payment is to be made on a deferred basis, the
 Committee may provide for the payment of dividend equivalents or interest
 during the deferral period. Any stock issued in payment of a Performance
 Share shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer in Section 3.8
 herein.

9.6 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT DUE TO DEATH, DISABILITY, OR RETIREMENT
 (including early retirement). In the case of death, disability, or
 retirement (each of disability and retirement as defined under the
 established rules of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case
 may be), the holder of a Performance Share shall receive a prorated payment
 based on the Participant's number of full months of service during the
 Performance Period, further adjusted based on the achievement of the
 performance goals, as computed by the Committee. The Committee may require
 that a Participant have a minimum number of full months of service during
 the Performance Period to qualify for an Award payout.

9.7 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT FOR OTHER REASONS. In the event that a
 Participant terminates employment with the Company or any of its
 Subsidiaries for any reason other than death, disability, or retirement
 (including early retirement), all Performance Shares shall be forfeited;
 provided, however, that in the event of a termination of the employment of
 the Participant by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than for
 Cause, the Committee in its sole discretion may waive the automatic
 forfeiture provisions.

 15

9.8 NONTRANSFERABILITY. No Performance Shares granted under the Plan may be
 sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or
 hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution
 until the termination of the applicable Performance Period. All rights with
 respect to Performance Shares granted to a Participant under the Plan shall
 be exercisable during his/her lifetime only by such Participant.

ARTICLE 10 CASH AWARDS
 -----------

10.1 GRANT OF CASH AWARD. Subject to the terms of this Plan, Cash Awards may be
 made to Participants at any time and from time to time as shall be
 determined by the Committee. The Committee shall have complete discretion
 in the determining the form of the Cash Awards granted to Participants

10.2 CASH AWARD PERFORMANCE CRITERIA. All Cash Awards made under this Plan shall
 be subject to pre-established, objective, business-related Performance
 Measures. The performance measures shall be approved for use by the
 Committee and the Committee shall certify their attainment and the
 resulting payout of Cash Awards. Performance Measures for Cash Awards may
 be measurable for periods of one year to five years (allowing for prorated
 periods for new Participants). The Performance Measures may include, but
 shall not be limited to: operational measures (e.g. attaining merger
 milestones, customer satisfaction, service reliability, safety and tactical
 objectives), financial measures (e.g. expense control, revenue, margins and
 shareholder value added levels "SVA") and individual measures. Performance
 Measures can be made on overlapping cycles, (i.e. one-year cycles could
 emphasize operational measures and three-year cycles could emphasize SVA
 Performance Measures.) Each cycle of Performance Measures could have a
 distinct Cash Award associated with it.

10.3 PAYOUT OF CASH AWARDS. Payouts of Cash Awards are made in relationship to a
 target payout level determined prior to each cycle on a per Participant
 basis. Target levels under multiple cycles will be calibrated to provide,
 in total, an annualized level of incentives consistent with the Company's
 compensation philosophy as set by the Committee. Actual payouts of Cash
 Awards will vary with performance results as follows: actual payouts based
 upon operational or individual Performance Measures will vary from 50 (if
 threshold performance is attained) to 150 of the target level; actual
 payouts based upon Company SVA and other corporate financial measures will
 vary from 50 (if threshold performance is attained) up to 200 of the
 target level. The maximum Cash Award payable in a calendar year to any
 Participant with respect to any Performance Period shall not exceed
 2,000,000.

10.4 CONVERSION OF CASH AWARD PAYOUT TO RESTRICTED STOCK. At the request of the
 Participant, but subject to the discretion of the Committee, any Cash Award
 payout may be converted to Restricted Stock at a discount. The conversion
 to Restricted Stock will occur by multiplying the Cash Award by a premium,
 but in no event more than 120 and dividing the product by the Fair Market
 Value of the Restricted Stock on the date of conversion, which shall be
 chosen by the Committee at least 10 days in advance, to determine the
 number of shares of Restricted Stock that will be provided as full
 settlement of the Cash Award. The shares of Restricted Stock provided to
 Participants in settlement of Cash Awards shall be Restricted Stock subject
 to Article 8.

 16

ARTICLE 11 DIRECTORS' AWARDS
 -----------------

11.1 GRANT OF DIRECTORS' AWARDS. In lieu of a portion of their retainer,
 Directors' Awards can be made in the form of Stock Options or Restricted
 Stock under Articles 6 and 8 respectively. No other Awards may be made to
 Directors under the Plan.

11.2 CONVERSION OF RETAINER TO STOCK. At the request of a Director but subject
 to the election of the Committee, a Director may convert any retainer
 otherwise due to be paid by the Company in cash to an aggregate equivalent
 value of either Stock Options, Restricted Stock or both.

11.3 CONVERSION OF RETAINER TO RESTRICTED STOCK. Retainer, otherwise payable in
 cash may be converted to Restricted Stock under Article 8. The conversion
 to Restricted Stock will occur by multiplying the retainer by a premium,
 but in no event more than 120 and dividing the product by the Fair Market
 Value of the Restricted Stock on the date of conversion, which shall be
 chosen by the Committee at least 10 days in advance, into the amount of the
 retainer to determine the number of shares of Restricted Stock that will be
 provided as full settlement of the retainer.

11.4 CONVERSION OF RETAINER TO STOCK OPTIONS. Retainer otherwise due to be paid
 in cash may be converted to Stock Options under Article 6 at the request of
 the Participant but subject to the election of the Committee. Retainer
 shall be converted by multiplying the retainer by a premium, but in no
 event more than 120 and dividing the product by the amount equal to the
 Black-Scholes Value of the Stock Option on the date of conversion. The
 quotient of which is the number of Stock Options that shall be awarded.

ARTICLE 12 BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION
 -----------------------

Each Participant under the Plan may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or
beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively and who may include
a trustee under a will or living trust) to whom any benefit under the Plan is to
be paid in case of his/her death before he receives any or all of such benefit.
Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant,
shall be in a form prescribed by the Committee, and will be effective only when
filed by the Participant in writing with the Committee during his lifetime. In
the absence of any such designation or if all designated beneficiaries
predecease the Participant, benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant's death
shall be paid to the Participant's estate.

 17

ARTICLE 13 RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES
 -------------------

13.1 EMPLOYMENT. Nothing in the Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way
 the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate any
 Participant's employment at any time, nor confer upon any Participant any
 right to continue in the employ of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

13.2 PARTICIPATION. No employee shall have a right to be selected as a
 Participant, or, having been so selected, to be selected again as a
 Participant.

13.3 NO IMPLIED RIGHTS; RIGHTS ON TERMINATION OF SERVICE. Neither the
 establishment of the Plan nor any amendment thereof shall be construed as
 giving any Participant, beneficiary, or any other person any legal or
 equitable right unless such right shall be specifically provided for in the
 Plan or conferred by specific action of the Committee in accordance with
 the terms and provisions of the Plan. Except as expressly provided in this
 Plan, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required or
 be liable to make any payment under the Plan.

13.4 NO RIGHT TO COMPANY ASSETS. Neither the Participant nor any other person
 shall acquire, by reason of the Plan, any right in or title to any assets,
 funds or property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whatsoever
 including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any specific
 funds, assets, or other property which the Company or any of its
 Subsidiaries, in its sole discretion, may set aside in anticipation of a
 liability hereunder. Any benefits which become payable hereunder shall be
 paid from the general assets of the Company or the applicable subsidiary.
 The Participant shall have only a contractual right to the amounts, if any,
 payable hereunder unsecured by any asset of the Company or any of its
 Subsidiaries. Nothing contained in the Plan constitutes a guarantee by the
 Company or any of its Subsidiaries that the assets of the Company or the
 applicable subsidiary shall be sufficient to pay any benefit to any person.

ARTICLE 14 CHANGE IN CONTROL
 -----------------

14.1 STOCK BASED AWARDS. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, in
 the event of a Change in Control, all Stock based awards granted under this

 Stock Appreciation Rights, and Restricted Stock.

14.2 ALL AWARDS OTHER THAN STOCK BASED AWARDS. Notwithstanding any other
 provisions of the Plan, in the event of a Change in Control, all Awards
 other than Stock Based Awards granted under this Plan shall be immediately
 paid out in cash, including Performance Shares. The amount of the payout
 shall be based on the higher of: (i) the extent, as determined by the
 Committee, to which performance goals, established for the Performance
 Period then in progress have been met up through and including the
 effective date of the Change in Control or (ii) 100 of the value on the
 date of grant of the number of Performance Shares.

 18

ARTICLE 15 AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, AND TERMINATION
 ----------------------------------------

15.1 AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, AND TERMINATION. At any time and from time to
 time, the Board or Committee may terminate, amend, or modify the Plan.
 However, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company if

 Exchange Act, by any national securities exchange or system on which the
 Stock is then listed or reported, or by any regulatory body having

 may be eligible for deferral by any plan(s) offered by the company, subject
 to the approval of the Committee and any administrative requirements
 imposed by the Committee.

ARTICLE 16 WITHHOLDING AND DEFERRAL
 ------------------------

16.1 TAX WITHHOLDING. The Company and any of its Subsidiaries shall have the
 power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to
 remit to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, an amount sufficient to
 satisfy Federal, state and local taxes (including the Participant's FICA
 obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any grant,

16.2 STOCK DELIVERY OR WITHHOLDING. With respect to withholding required upon
 the exercise of Stock Options, or upon the lapse of restrictions on
 Restricted Stock, participants may elect, subject to the approval of the
 Committee, to satisfy the withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by
 tendering to the Company Shares of previously acquired Stock or by having
 the Company withhold Shares of Stock, in each such case in an amount having
 a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld to satisfy
 the tax withholding obligations described in Section 16.1. The value of the

 of the Stock on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be

 AMENDED FE DEFERRED COMP
 
 AMENDED
 FIRSTENERGY CORP.
 DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
 FOR DIRECTORS
 -------------

ARTICLE I

 Director Election
 -----------------

 Any member of the Board of Directors ("Director") of FirstEnergy
Corp. (the "Company") may elect from time to time, by written notice to the
Company given on or before December 31 of any year, to defer receipt of all or
any specified part of his or her fees (cash or equity instruments) for services
as a Director during succeeding calendar years, including retainer fees, fees
for attending meetings of the Board of Directors and its Committees and fees for
serving as Chairman or other official of the Board or a Committee (collectively
"Director's fees"). Any person elected to the Board who was not a Director on
the preceding December 31 may elect, by written notice to the Company given
within thirty (30) days after becoming a Director, to defer receipt of all or
any specified part of his or her Director's fees during the balance of the
calendar year following his or her becoming a Director and succeeding calendar
years.

 With respect to the calendar year in which this Plan is adopted by
the Board of Directors of the Company, any Director may elect, by written notice
to the Company given within thirty (30) days after the date on which this Plan
is adopted or, if later, within thirty (30) days after first becoming a
Director, to defer receipt of all or any specified part of his or her Director's
fees during the balance of that calendar year and succeeding calendar years. An
election to defer Director's fees shall be irrevocable and shall continue from
year to year unless the Director terminates it by written notice to the Company
on or before December 31 of the year preceding the year to which the termination
applies.

 Effective as of January 1, 2000, the Centerior Energy Corporation
Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (the "Centerior Plan") shall be merged
into this Plan. Any election to defer director's fees made under the Centerior
Plan prior to such date shall, to the extent such deferred fees and any earnings
credited to such deferred fees have not been paid to the director or to his or
her beneficiary prior to such date, be treated as having been made under this
Plan and shall be subject to all of the rights and limitations imposed on
elections made under this Plan. The individuals who made such elections shall be
considered "Directors" for purposes of this Plan even if they have not served on
the Board of Directors of the Company.

 ARTICLE II
 ----------

 Deferred Fee Account--Balances
 ------------------------------

 Any deferred Director's fees shall be credited by the Company to the
Director's deferred fee account to be maintained by the Company as of the date
the fees would otherwise be payable. Adjustments to the balance in the account
for deemed interest or deemed investment gains and losses shall be made from
time to time, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of FirstEnergy Corp. (the "Committee"), but at least annually. The
Committee, in its sole discretion shall determine whether adjustments to the
account shall be made based upon deemed interest or deemed investment earnings.
If deemed interest is selected by the Committee, the deemed interest rate shall
be the "prime rate" then in effect at The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., of New

York City, New York, or at another bank as the Committee may from time to time
designate. If the Committee elects to make adjustments to the accounts in
accordance with deemed investment gains and losses, the Committee, in its sole
discretion, shall determine the investment vehicles to be used. In its the sole
discretion, the Committee may permit the Director to designate that the balance
of his or her account be invested in one or more investment vehicles selected by
the Committee, and adjusted accordingly. The Company shall provide an annual
statement to each Director who has elected to defer fees.

 One of the investment options for equity instruments and cash
retainer fees, meeting fees, and/or chairperson fees, shall be an account whose
value will be adjusted as if the deferred fees were invested in FirstEnergy
Common Stock. This account shall be called the Deferred Stock Account (DSA). At
the time cash retainer, meeting fees, and/or chairperson fees are designated for
investment into this account, the initial account value shall be increased by 20
percent. If a Director separates from the Board for any reason other than death,
retirement, or disability as defined by Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code and such retainer fees are not kept in this account for a minimum of three
years from January 1 of the year of deferral, the Director shall forfeit the 20
percent bonus on such retainer fees and any earnings associated with it. A
Director shall be immediately entitled to the 20 percent bonus and all
associated earnings if a Change in Control occurs as defined in Article IX.
Initial unit valuation for cash deferrals into this account shall be based on
the Fair Market Value which is the average of the high and low price of
FirstEnergy Common Stock on the day when payment would otherwise be received.
Stock deferred into this account shall be valued at the actual purchase price,
including any commissions.

 With respect to any Director who had a balance in his or her
deferred fee account under the Centerior Plan immediately prior to January 1,
2000, the balance of such account shall be transferred to a deferred fee account
under this Plan as of January 1, 2000. Such Directors shall be permitted to
designate how such transferred account balances shall be deemed invested to the
same extent that other Directors are permitted such designations under this Plan
with respect to their deferred fee accounts.

 ARTICLE III
 -----------

 Payment to Director
 -------------------

 Amounts credited to a Director's deferred fee account, including
deemed interest and earnings shall be paid to the Director in cash, either in a
lump sum or in annual installments over a period not to exceed 10 years. For
this purpose, a designation by a Director of the form of payment will be
effective only if it is made at the time of his or her election to defer
Director's fees; provided, however, that if a Director makes a designation, he
or she may change that designation by filing a new superseding designation with
the Company during the period beginning 120 days prior and ending on the day
prior to the day on which the Director ceases to be a Director. Payment(s) shall
be made on or commencing with the January 1 next following the day the Director
ceases to be a Director unless during the foregoing 120 day election period, the
Director designates a later payment or commencement date (not later than the
January 1 next following the day he or she attains age 72).

 Payment of the balance of the DSA to the Director will be in
the form of FirstEnergy Common Stock and will be paid out when a Director ceases
to be a Director unless a separate election for the DSA is made. The election
options are the same as described in the paragraph above. If a Director requests
any change in the date of the pay-out of his DSA, the request must be approved
by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company.

A Director may at any time request an accelerated distribution of
his or her account balances, subject to a 10 percent penalty and, if applicable,
forfeiture of the 20 percent bonus and associated earnings described above if
the three-year criterion is not met. Such a request must be made in writing, in
a form and manner specified by the Committee. The Company will distribute to the
Director the balance of his or her account minus any forfeitures and the 10
percent penalty as a lump sum within 90 days after the end of the month in which
the Committee receives the request. Such distribution shall completely discharge
the Company from all liability with respect to the Director's account. If the
Director is an active Director, the Director may not resume any further
deferrals into the Plan until January 1 of the second calendar year following
the calendar year in which the Director receives such distribution. If a
Director requests an accelerated distribution of his DSA, the request must be
approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company.

 A Director who is an active Director and who has been a Plan
Participant for at least five calendar years may request to withdraw a portion
of his or her deferred fees and associated earnings. For this purpose,
participation in the Centerior Plan shall be considered as participation in this
Plan. All deferred cash fees must be disbursed prior to the disbursement of any
deferred stock fees. Such request must be made in writing in a form and manner
specified by the Committee and must specify the amount to be withdrawn and the
future date or dates to be paid. The date(s) must be the first of a month in the
second calendar year following the calendar year in which the request was made.
The request will be irrevocable after December 31 of the calendar in which it is
made unless, prior to payment, the Director separates from the Board or a Change
in Control occurs as defined in Article IX. In these instances, the request will
become null and void and the account balances will be paid as elected by the
Director or as in the paragraph below.

 In the instance of a Change in Control as defined in Article IX, all
cash account balances will be paid out immediately as a lump sum and the DSA in
stock as soon as practicable.

ARTICLE IV
 ----------

 Payment to Beneficiary
 ----------------------

 Upon the death of a Director or a former Director prior to the
distribution of the entire balance in the Director's or former Director's
deferred fee account and deferred stock account, the balance including interest,
shall be paid to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the Director or
former Director in writing filed with the Company, or in the absence of a
designation, paid to his or her estate, at the time and in the manner specified
in the Director or former Director's beneficiary designation, which may be
either (i) in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the date of death, (ii) in
a lump sum on January 1 of the year following the year in which the death
occurred or (iii) in one or more annual payments the last of which may occur no
later than January 1 of the fifth year following the year in which the death
occurred.

 ARTICLE V
 ---------

 Assignment
 ----------

 Except to the extent that a Director or former Director may
designate a beneficiary to receive any payment to be made following his or her
death and except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, no rights
under this Plan shall be assignable or transferable, or subject to encumbrance
or charge of any nature.

ARTICLE VI
 ----------

 Administration
 --------------

 This Plan shall be administered by the Committee as defined in
Article II. Except as otherwise provided by action of the Board of Directors of
the Company or the terms of the Plan: (a) a majority of the members of the
Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and (b) all
resolutions or other actions taken by the Committee at a meeting shall be by the
vote of the majority of the committee members present, or, without a meeting, by
an instrument in writing signed by all members of the Committee.

 The powers of the Committee shall include the power to construe,
interpret, and apply this Plan, and to render nondiscriminatory rulings or
determinations. Constructions, interpretations, and decisions of the committee
shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.

 ARTICLE VII
 -----------

 Amendment and Termination
 -------------------------

 The Board of Directors of the Company may from time to time amend,
suspend, terminate or reinstate any or all of the provisions of this Plan,
except that no amendment, suspension, termination or reinstatement shall
adversely affect the deferred fee account of any Director, former Director or
beneficiary (collectively, "Eligible Persons") as it existed immediately before
the amendment, suspension, termination or reinstatement or the manner of
payments, unless the Eligible Person shall have consented in writing.

 The Board of Directors of the Company may at any time terminate its
participation in this Plan and/or transfer its liabilities under this Plan to a
similar plan established by the Committee. Upon the termination of its
participation in this Plan, amounts credited to deferred fee accounts of
Eligible Persons shall continue to be payable to those Eligible Persons in
accordance with the terms of this Plan. Upon termination of the participation of
the Company in this Plan, if the Board of Directors of the Company should
transfer its liabilities to another plan, such transfer of liabilities shall not
adversely affect the deferred fee account of any Eligible Person as it existed
immediately prior to that transfer or the manner of payments, unless the
Eligible Person shall have consented in writing.

 All liabilities of the Ohio Edison Company Deferred Compensation
Plan for Directors shall be transferred to this Plan; and this Plan shall be an
amendment, restatement and continuation of that Plan. If any deferred fee
account is in pay status or is otherwise payable to an Eligible Person, it shall
continue to be payable to that person under the same terms and conditions as
were provided under the Plan. The balance in any deferred fee account under that
Plan maintained with respect to an individual who is a Director of FirstEnergy
Corp. at the time of the amendment or restatement of this Plan shall become
payable under the terms and conditions of this Plan; provided, however, that the
Director's deferral elections, commencement date elections, and beneficiary
elections made under the Prior Plan shall continue to be effective under this
Plan unless amended or changed under the terms of this Plan.

 All liabilities of the Centerior Plan shall be transferred to this
Plan as of January 1, 2000. If any deferred fee account under the Centerior Plan
is in pay status or is otherwise payable to an Eligible Person as of such date,
it shall continue to be payable to that person under the same terms and
conditions as were provided under the Centerior Plan. The balance of any

deferred fee account under the Centerior Plan shall become payable under the
terms and conditions of this Plan; provided, however, that the Director's
deferral elections, commencement date elections, and beneficiary elections made
under the Centerior Plan shall continue to be effective under this Plan unless
amended or changed under the terms of this Plan.

 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, if the Plan is
terminated and the liabilities of this Plan are not transferred to another plan,
no subsequent Director's fees may be deferred under this Plan, the balance in a
Director's deferred account shall continue to be credited with deemed interest
or earnings in a manner similar to that described in Article II, and the entire
balance in the account (including interest) shall become payable to the Director
(or his or her beneficiary) in accordance with the provisions of this Plan in
effect at the date of termination.

 ARTICLE VIII
 ------------

 Unfunded Plan
 -------------

 Deferred fee accounts maintained for purposes of this Plan shall
constitute bookkeeping records of the Company and shall not constitute any
allocation of any assets of the Company or be deemed to create any trust or
special deposit with respect to any of the assets of the Company. The Company
shall not be under any obligation to any Director, former Director or
beneficiary to acquire, segregate or reserve any funds or other assets for
purposes relating to this Plan. No Eligible Person shall have any rights
whatsoever in or with respect to any funds or other assets owned or held by the
Company; the rights of an Eligible Person under this Plan are solely those of a
general creditor of the Company to the extent of the amount credited to his or
her deferred fee account with the Company.

 The Company may, at its discretion, establish one or more trusts,
purchase one or more insurance contracts or otherwise invest or segregate funds
for purposes relating to this Plan, but the assets of such trusts, rights and
assets of such insurance contracts or otherwise invested or segregated funds
shall at all times remain subject to the claims of the general creditors of the
Company except to the extent and at the time any payment is made to an Eligible
Person under this Plan; and no Eligible Person shall have any rights whatsoever
in or with respect to any trust, insurance contract or other investment or fund,
or their assets.

 ARTICLE IX
 ----------

 Change In Control
 -----------------

For purposes of the Plan, a "Change in Control" means any of the following:

1. An acquisition by any person or entity of at least 50 (25 if the
 acquiring person or entity proposes any individual for election to the
 Board of Directors or is represented by any member of the Board) of either
 the Company's outstanding common stock ("Outstanding Common Stock") or the
 combined voting power of the Company's outstanding voting securities
 ("Outstanding Voting Securities"). The following acquisitions will not
 constitute a Change in Control:

 a) any acquisition directly from the Company (excluding an
 acquisition by virtue of the exercise of a conversion privilege);

 b) any acquisition by the Company;

c) any acquisition by an employee benefit plan sponsored by the
 Company or one of its affiliates (e.g., the FirstEnergy Corp.
 Savings Plan);

 d) any acquisition pursuant to a merger or other form of reorganization
 or consolidation where the requirements of paragraph 3 below are
 satisfied.

2. The current members of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Incumbent
 Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the
 Board. For this purpose, any individual whose election or nomination
 to the Board was approved by at least a majority of the Directors then
 comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though he or she
 were a member of the Incumbent board, unless the individual first
 assumed office as a result of an actual or threatened proxy or election

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FirstEnergy Corp.

 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan

 2002 Overview

 Effective January 1, 2002

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION

Overview of the Plan

 o The Plan allows you to defer base salary, Annual Incentive Awards,
 and Long-Term Incentive Awards.

 o The Company retains amounts deferred and credits an account(s) in
 your name.

 o The Retirement Account, Retirement Stock Account and the
 FirstEnergy Stock Account may earn a very attractive return. Your base
 salary and/or the 2001 Annual Incentive Award payable in 2002 may be
 deferred into a Retirement Account.

 o Your 2001 Annual Incentive Award and/or your Long-Term Incentive
 Award, that are payable in 2002, may be deferred into a FirstEnergy
 Stock Account.

 Why the Plan is Provided

 To provide you with:

 o Additional funds at your retirement to supplement other existing
 benefit plans.

 o Supplemental benefits in the event of preretirement death or
 disability.

 o Another opportunity to build assets on the most favorable tax basis.

 o A vehicle to acquire additional FirstEnergy stock.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EFFECT ON
FIRSTENERGY
SAVINGS PLAN

401(k) Impact Your decision to defer a portion of your salary and/or
 your Annual Incentive Award into this Plan will affect
 your decision regarding how much you would like to
 defer into the FirstEnergy Employee Savings Plan. In
 making your deferral elections in these plans, it is
 important to know that your deferrals into this Plan
 will be made first; therefore, the amount of base
 salary or Annual Incentive Award available to be
 deferred into the Employee Savings Plan will be
 reduced.

Example Amount of Annual Incentive Award you
 elected to defer to this Plan: 50 

 Amount of salary and Annual Incentive
 you elected to defer to the Employee
 Savings Plan: 16 

 Annual Incentive Award 10,000
 Deferral into this Plan 5,000
 ---------
 Balance 5,000
 Deferral into Savings Plan 800
 ---------
 Payable in cash, subject to
 taxation 4,200

Please take a moment to consider how your election to
 defer into this Plan will affect the amount of money
 available on which to base your Employee Savings Plan
 deferral election.

About the FirstEnergy Stock Account

o The Company will credit a 20 premium to your Stock Account when you
 defer compensation into the Account.

Example: If you elect to defer 1,000, 20 of that amount
 or 200 will be added to your deferral amount for a total
 of 1,200. This 1,200 will then be converted to stock
 units and held in your FirstEnergy Stock Account.

 o The number of stock units credited to your account will be determined
 by dividing the total, after applicable taxes, of your deferral and
 the Company-provided 20 premium by the average daily closing price of
 FirstEnergy common stock during February, 2002.

 o At the time dividend payments are made to FirstEnergy shareholders
 additional stock units will be credited to your account. The number
 of additional units credited will be based on the number of units in

 As of January 1, 2002, a new account, called the Retirement Stock

 that you can maintain an account based on the value of FirstEnergy stock
 until you terminate your employment with FirstEnergy.

 Transferring to the Retirement Stock Account

 During the open enrollment period, immediately prior to the end of the
 three-year vesting period, you will have the opportunity to elect to
 defer receiving the Stock Account balance, which would otherwise be
 payable to you during the following calendar year. If you make this
 election, the value of the Stock Account, including the vested 20 
 premium, will be transferred to your Retirement Stock Account. The
 Retirement Stock Account will be credited with gains, losses and
 dividends just as in the Stock Account and will maintain its
 tax-deferred status until you receive a distribution.

 During the 2001 enrollment period for the 2002 Plan year, you may, if
 you have a 1999 Stock Account:

 o Elect to transfer your 1999 Stock Account balance, including the
 vested 20 premium, to the Retirement Stock Account.

 Stock Account balance will, after withholding the appropriate taxes,
 be deposited as stock into a FirstEnergy Dividend Reinvestment

 EXEC. INCENTIVE - TIER 2
 
 FirstEnergy
 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan
 2001

Purpose
- -------

The purpose of the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (EICP) is to attract,
retain and motivate skilled executives; to more closely align the interests of
the executives and shareholders; and to promote growth in shareholder value.

Total Compensation Philosophy
- -----------------------------

FirstEnergy's total compensation philosophy is based on the following
principles:

- - A "pay-for-performance" orientation under which total compensation reflects
 corporate, business unit and individual success;
- - A focus on total compensation wherein base salaries and incentives are
 targeted generally at or near median competitive market levels, with
 opportunities to achieve total compensation at the 75th percentile level if
 both corporate and business unit performance are superior;
- - A mix between short-term and long-term compensation opportunities designed to
 reward both short and long-term strategic results and facilitate executive
 retention;
- - An escalating proportion of an executive's total compensation opportunity at
 risk through performance incentives and stock as an executive's level of
 responsibility increases; and
- - The use of various equity based incentive vehicles to promote FirstEnergy
 stock ownership and more closely align the interests of executives with the
 long-term interests of shareholders.

Plan Components
- ---------------

The Plan consists of a Short-Term Incentive Program (STIP) for 2001, a Long-Term
Incentive Program (LTIP) for the period 2001 - 2003, and a Stock Option Program.
Target incentive opportunities for each program are shown in Attachment 1.

Discretionary Award
- -------------------

There may be instances where an executive has demonstrated extraordinary
responsiveness to an unforeseen circumstance or has made a substantial
contribution that will not be properly recognized in the normal award process.
In these cases, FirstEnergy (the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors in the case of a member of the Senior Management Committee), in its
sole discretion, may grant a special incentive award to the executive.

Short-Term Incentive Program (STIP)
 -----------------------------------

Eligibility
- -----------

Employees with a 2001 standard rate at or above 92,119 and are in approved
positions that report to members of the Senior Management Committee, regional
presidents, consolidated plant managers, nuclear directors, and general office
department heads, are eligible to participate in this plan.

Eligible executives also must perform their jobs for a minimum of 1000 regular
work hours (actual on-the-job work hours exclusive of any time off) during the
year. Therefore, separation due to retirement, death or disability generally
must occur during the second half of the year in order to meet the 1000 hour
requirement. If an employee is promoted into the executive group or reassigned
to another position outside the executive group, all hours worked during the
year are counted toward the 1000-hour requirement.

Eligible executives must be actively employed as of December 31, 2001 or have
separated employment during the year due to retirement, disability, death, or
under conditions in which the executive qualifies for and elects benefits under
the FirstEnergy Severance Benefits Plan. Thus, an executive who voluntarily
resigns or is involuntarily separated for cause is ineligible to receive a
short-term award. Also, an executive who has been involuntarily separated for
cause between December 31, 2001 and the date that any awards are paid is
ineligible to receive and award.

Executives must receive or would have received a performance rating of Meets
Expectations or above. An executive with a rating "Does Not Meet Expectations"
is ineligible to receive an annual award.

Transfer between Plans
- ----------------------

Annual incentive awards are based on whole months of eligibility in an incentive
plan. Thus, employees who transfer from one incentive plan to another and work
the full year, will have their incentive awards prorated between the two plans
in whole month increments that total 12 months. Whole month increments are
determined by the effective date of the employee's move.

For a move resulting in a change in incentive plan eligibility that is effective
between the 1st and 15th of any month except December, the employee becomes
eligible for the plan into which they are moving for that entire month. If the
move is effective on or after the 16th of any month except January, the employee
becomes eligible for the plan into which they are moving on the 1st of the
following month.

Employees hired or changing plans at any time during January will be credited
with plan eligibility for the entire month of January. Employees who change
plans at any time on or after November 16 will continue their eligibility in the
"old" plan for the entire month of December, and will become eligible for the
"new" plan in January.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- ---------------------------------

Performance goals are allocated between FirstEnergy Financial KPIs and
Operational KPIs. FirstEnergy Financial KPIs apply to all executives.
Operational KPIs are established by each Group Vice President. The weighting of
Financial KPIs and Operational KPIs varies among executives depending upon their
job level.

Award Leverage
- --------------

Each KPI has a threshold, target and maximum level of achievement. The
achievement of Financial KPIs at or above threshold will generate a payout from
50 to 200 of the target award. The achievement of Operational KPIs at or above
threshold will generate a payout from 50 to 150 of target. Results achieved
between threshold and target, and target and maximum, will be interpolated.

Award Payments
- --------------

Annual awards will be paid in March 2002. If an executive meets the eligibility
criteria and works in an executive position for less than the full performance
year, his/her annual award will be prorated to reflect the number of months that
he/she has worked in an eligible position.

If an executive changes his/her job within the executive group or is reassigned
to another position outside the executive group during the plan year, the
executive's total annual incentive award will be the sum of the prorated awards
earned in each position and incentive plan.

Plan participants may elect to defer the receipt of any STIP award under the
terms of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.

Shareowner Protection
- ---------------------

Short-term incentive awards will not be paid unless total earnings exceed the
amount of dividends paid plus the maximum annual awards from all incentive
plans.

Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP)
 ----------------------------------

Eligibility
- -----------

An employee who is hired or promoted into the executive group on or after
February 1, 2001 will not be eligible for the LTIP until 2002, assuming he/she
remains eligible for EICP.
An executive must work a minimum of 12 months in an eligible position during the
three-year (36-month) plan cycle to be eligible for an award. Thus, an executive
who separates for any reason during 2001 will be ineligible to receive a
long-term award from the 2001 program.

An executive must be actively employed as of December 31, 2003, or have
separated due to retirement, disability or death; or under conditions in which
the executive qualifies for and elects benefits under the FirstEnergy Severance
Benefits Plan between December 31, 2001 and the award payment date. Thus, an
executive who voluntarily resigns or who is involuntarily separated for cause
during this time frame will be ineligible to receive an LTIP award.

Performance Shares
- ------------------

On January 1, 2001, each eligible employees LTIP award will be converted into
equivalent "Performance Shares" of FirstEnergy common stock based on the average
of the high and low stock prices of the common stock on the last trading day in
2000. These shares are placed into a Performance Share Account for three years
(2001 - 2003).

During the 2001 - 2003 performance period, dividend equivalents will be
converted into additional shares based on the closing stock price on the date
the dividends are paid. At the end of the three-year performance period, the
executive's account will be valued based on the average of the high and low
prices on the last trading day in December 2003.

The value may be adjusted upward or downward based upon the total shareholder
return (TSR) of FirstEnergy common stock relative to an energy services company
index during this three-year period. If the TSR is at the 63rd percentile, the
award payout will be 100 of the account value. If the TSR rating is at or above
the 86th percentile, the award payout will be 150 of the account value. If the
TSR is at the 41st percentile, the award payout will be 50 of the account
value. Award payouts for a ranking above the 41st and below the 86th percentile
will be interpolated. For a TSR ranking below the 41st percentile, no long-term
award will be paid. The purpose of this award structure is to strengthen the
linkage between an executive's total compensation and the long-term growth of
shareholder value.

Award Payments
- --------------

Awards for the 2001 - 2003 cycle will be paid in March 2004.

If an executive meets the eligibility criteria and is no longer employed in an
executive position, his/her original LTIP target award will be prorated to
reflect the number of months worked in an eligible position during the
performance cycle.

Plan participants may elect to defer the receipt of any LTIP award under the
provisions of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.

Attachment 2 illustrates a Long-Term Incentive Program example.

Stock Option Program
 --------------------

In 2001, eligible employees will receive stock option grants that will allow
them to purchase a specified number of common stock shares at a fixed grant
price over a defined period of time. The number of stock options granted and a
stock option agreement will be communicated to recipients at the time of the
grant.

 Terms
 -----

For the purposes of this Plan, the term FirstEnergy is defined as FirstEnergy
Corp. and all of its operating companies to which this Plan has been extended.
The term "Company" refers to FirstEnergy Corp. or its operating companies
individually, as appropriate.

Each employee's rights under the Plan are at all times governed by the official
text of the Executive and Directors Incentive Compensation Plan Document and are
in no way altered or modified by the contents of this summary.

Each executive may, at any time, designate one or more persons as the
executive's primary or contingent beneficiary (ies) to whom awards earned under
this Plan shall be paid in the event of the executive's death prior to payment
of such awards to the executive. In the absence of an effective beneficiary
designation, or if all beneficiaries predecease the executive, the executive's
designated beneficiary shall be the person in the first of the following classes
in which there is a survivor: the executive's surviving spouse; the executive's
estate.

Right to Modify or Terminate
- ----------------------------

This Plan may be amended or terminated at any time with or without notice by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of FirstEnergy. The Plan may
change from year to year or even be discontinued in the future. If it is
determined that significant unusual events occurred that impacted the
FirstEnergy's reported earnings but do not truly reflect the achieved operating
results of the FirstEnergy, then the Compensation Committee may, in its sole
discretion, increase or decrease the amount of any awards determined by this
Plan or even determine that no awards will be paid. Not withstanding, the
Committee shall have no authority to adjust upwards the amount payable to a
Covered Employee with respect to a particular Award, to take any of the
foregoing actions or to take any other action to the extent that such action or
the Committee's ability to take such action would cause any Award under the Plan
to any Covered Employee to fail to qualify as "performance-based compensation"
within the meaning of Code Section 162(m)(4) and the regulations issued
thereunder.

No Employment Guarantee
- -----------------------

Nothing in this Plan shall be construed as giving any participant the right to
be retained in the employ of any Company, nor shall any Company be required, by
virtue of the existence of this Plan, to maintain the employment of any
participant through any specified date.

Not A Funded Trust
- ------------------

All awards paid under this Plan shall at all times constitute general unsecured
liabilities of any Company, payable out of its own general assets. In no event
shall any Company be obliged to reserve any funds or assets to secure the
payment of such amounts and nothing contained in the Plan shall confer upon any
participant the right, title or interest of any assets of any Company.

Performance shares mature at the end of 2003 and are payable in March 2004 based
on the following factors:

 - Quarterly dividend equivalents that may be credited to the executive's
 account during the performance period.
 - The average of the high and low price of the Company's common stock on
 the last trading day of 2003.
 - The total shareholder return (TSR) of the Company's common stock during
 the performance period relative to the peer company index.

rankings based on the target opportunity. This illustration assumes that no
dividends are paid and that the common stock price does not appreciate during
the three-year performance period.

 For 2001, the method of representing our TSR ranking is being changed to
 reflect our percentile ranking in the more traditional way. This year, the
 TSR ranking is shown in the inverse of how it has been represented in the
 past. Previously, top performance was reflected as the "1st percentile"; this
 year, top performance is represented as the "100th percentile". This change
 has no impact on the "Award Payout" or the "Percent Earned".

 EXEC. INCENTIVE - TIER 3
 
 FirstEnergy
 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan
 2001

Purpose
- -------

The purpose of the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (EICP) is to attract,
retain and motivate skilled executives; to more closely align the interests of
the executives and shareholders; and to promote growth in shareholder value.

Total Compensation Philosophy
- -----------------------------

FirstEnergy's total compensation philosophy is based on the following
principles:

- - A "pay-for-performance" orientation under which total compensation reflects
 corporate, business unit and individual success;
- - A focus on total compensation wherein base salaries and incentives are
 targeted generally at or near median competitive market levels, with
 opportunities to achieve total compensation at the 75th percentile level if
 both corporate and business unit performance are superior;
- - A mix between short-term and long-term compensation opportunities designed to
 reward both short and long-term strategic results and facilitate executive
 retention;
- - An escalating proportion of an executive's total compensation opportunity at
 risk through performance incentives and stock as an executive's level of
 responsibility increases; and
- - The use of various equity based incentive vehicles to promote FirstEnergy
 stock ownership and more closely align the interests of executives with the
 long-term interests of shareholders.

Plan Components
- ---------------

The Plan consists of a Short-Term Incentive Program (STIP) for 2001, a Long-Term
Incentive Program (LTIP) for the period 2001 - 2003, and a Stock Option Program.
Target incentive opportunities for each program are shown in Attachment 1.

Discretionary Award
- -------------------

There may be instances where an executive has demonstrated extraordinary
responsiveness to an unforeseen circumstance or has made a substantial
contribution that will not be properly recognized in the normal award process.
In these cases, FirstEnergy (the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors in the case of a member of the Senior Management Committee), in its
sole discretion, may grant a special incentive award to the executive.

Short-Term Incentive Program (STIP)
 -----------------------------------

Eligibility
- -----------

Employees with a 2001 standard rate at or above 92,119 and are in approved
positions that report to members of the Senior Management Committee, regional
presidents, consolidated plant managers, nuclear directors, and general office
department heads, are eligible to participate in this plan.

Eligible executives also must perform their jobs for a minimum of 1000 regular
work hours (actual on-the-job work hours exclusive of any time off) during the
year. Therefore, separation due to retirement, death or disability generally
must occur during the second half of the year in order to meet the 1000 hour
requirement. If an employee is promoted into the executive group or reassigned
to another position outside the executive group, all hours worked during the
year are counted toward the 1000-hour requirement.

Eligible executives must be actively employed as of December 31, 2001 or have
separated employment during the year due to retirement, disability, death, or
under conditions in which the executive qualifies for and elects benefits under
the FirstEnergy Severance Benefits Plan. Thus, an executive who voluntarily
resigns or is involuntarily separated for cause is ineligible to receive a
short-term award. Also, an executive who has been involuntarily separated for
cause between December 31, 2001 and the date that any awards are paid is
ineligible to receive and award.

Executives must receive or would have received a performance rating of Meets
Expectations or above. An executive with a rating "Does Not Meet Expectations"
is ineligible to receive an annual award.

Transfer between Plans
- ----------------------

Annual incentive awards are based on whole months of eligibility in an incentive
plan. Thus, employees who transfer from one incentive plan to another and work
the full year, will have their incentive awards prorated between the two plans
in whole month increments that total 12 months. Whole month increments are
determined by the effective date of the employee's move.

For a move resulting in a change in incentive plan eligibility that is effective
between the 1st and 15th of any month except December, the employee becomes
eligible for the plan into which they are moving for that entire month. If the
move is effective on or after the 16th of any month except January, the employee
becomes eligible for the plan into which they are moving on the 1st of the
following month.

Employees hired or changing plans at any time during January will be credited
with plan eligibility for the entire month of January. Employees who change
plans at any time on or after November 16 will continue their eligibility in the
"old" plan for the entire month of December, and will become eligible for the
"new" plan in January.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- ---------------------------------

Performance goals are allocated between FirstEnergy Financial KPIs and
Operational KPIs. FirstEnergy Financial KPIs apply to all executives.
Operational KPIs are established by each Group Vice President. The weighting of
Financial KPIs and Operational KPIs varies among executives depending upon their
job level.

Award Leverage
- --------------

Each KPI has a threshold, target and maximum level of achievement. The
achievement of Financial KPIs at or above threshold will generate a payout from
50 to 200 of the target award. The achievement of Operational KPIs at or above
threshold will generate a payout from 50 to 150 of target. Results achieved
between threshold and target, and target and maximum, will be interpolated.

Award Payments
- --------------

Annual awards will be paid in March 2002. If an executive meets the eligibility
criteria and works in an executive position for less than the full performance
year, his/her annual award will be prorated to reflect the number of months that
he/she has worked in an eligible position.

If an executive changes his/her job within the executive group or is reassigned
to another position outside the executive group during the plan year, the
executive's total annual incentive award will be the sum of the prorated awards
earned in each position and incentive plan.

Plan participants may elect to defer the receipt of any STIP award under the
terms of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.

Shareowner Protection
- ---------------------

Short-term incentive awards will not be paid unless total earnings exceed the
amount of dividends paid plus the maximum annual awards from all incentive
plans.

Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP)
 ----------------------------------

Eligibility
- -----------

An employee who is hired or promoted into the executive group on or after
February 1, 2001 will not be eligible for the LTIP until 2002, assuming he/she
remains eligible for EICP.
An executive must work a minimum of 12 months in an eligible position during the
three-year (36-month) plan cycle to be eligible for an award. Thus, an executive
who separates for any reason during 2001 will be ineligible to receive a
long-term award from the 2001 program.

An executive must be actively employed as of December 31, 2003, or have
separated due to retirement, disability or death; or under conditions in which
the executive qualifies for and elects benefits under the FirstEnergy Severance
Benefits Plan between December 31, 2001 and the award payment date. Thus, an
executive who voluntarily resigns or who is involuntarily separated for cause
during this time frame will be ineligible to receive an LTIP award.

Performance Shares
- ------------------

On January 1, 2001, each eligible employees LTIP award will be converted into
equivalent "Performance Shares" of FirstEnergy common stock based on the average
of the high and low stock prices of the common stock on the last trading day in
2000. These shares are placed into a Performance Share Account for three years
(2001 - 2003).

During the 2001 - 2003 performance period, dividend equivalents will be
converted into additional shares based on the closing stock price on the date
the dividends are paid. At the end of the three-year performance period, the
executive's account will be valued based on the average of the high and low
prices on the last trading day in December 2003.

The value may be adjusted upward or downward based upon the total shareholder
return (TSR) of FirstEnergy common stock relative to an energy services company
index during this three-year period. If the TSR is at the 63rd percentile, the
award payout will be 100 of the account value. If the TSR rating is at or above
the 86th percentile, the award payout will be 150 of the account value. If the
TSR is at the 41st percentile, the award payout will be 50 of the account
value. Award payouts for a ranking above the 41st and below the 86th percentile
will be interpolated. For a TSR ranking below the 41st percentile, no long-term
award will be paid. The purpose of this award structure is to strengthen the
linkage between an executive's total compensation and the long-term growth of
shareholder value.

Award Payments
- --------------

Awards for the 2001 - 2003 cycle will be paid in March 2004.

If an executive meets the eligibility criteria and is no longer employed in an
executive position, his/her original LTIP target award will be prorated to
reflect the number of months worked in an eligible position during the
performance cycle.

Plan participants may elect to defer the receipt of any LTIP award under the
provisions of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.

Attachment 2 illustrates a Long-Term Incentive Program example.

Stock Option Program
 --------------------

In 2001, eligible employees will receive stock option grants that will allow
them to purchase a specified number of common stock shares at a fixed grant
price over a defined period of time. The number of stock options granted and a
stock option agreement will be communicated to recipients at the time of the

This Plan may be amended or terminated at any time with or without notice by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of FirstEnergy. The Plan may
change from year to year or even be discontinued in the future. If it is
determined that significant unusual events occurred that impacted the

Short-Term Incentive Program (STIP)
 -----------------------------------

Eligibility
- -----------

Employees with a 2001 standard rate at or above 92,119 and are in approved
positions that report to members of the Senior Management Committee, regional
presidents, consolidated plant managers, nuclear directors, and general office
department heads, are eligible to participate in this plan.

Eligible executives also must perform their jobs for a minimum of 1000 regular
work hours (actual on-the-job work hours exclusive of any time off) during the
year. Therefore, separation due to retirement, death or disability generally
must occur during the second half of the year in order to meet the 1000 hour
requirement. If an employee is promoted into the executive group or reassigned
to another position outside the executive group, all hours worked during the
year are counted toward the 1000-hour requirement.

Eligible executives must be actively employed as of December 31, 2001 or have
separated employment during the year due to retirement, disability, death, or
under conditions in which the executive qualifies for and elects benefits under
the FirstEnergy Severance Benefits Plan. Thus, an executive who voluntarily
resigns or is involuntarily separated for cause is ineligible to receive a
short-term award. Also, an executive who has been involuntarily separated for
cause between December 31, 2001 and the date that any awards are paid is
ineligible to receive and award.

Executives must receive or would have received a performance rating of Meets
Expectations or above. An executive with a rating "Does Not Meet Expectations"
is ineligible to receive an annual award.

Transfer between Plans
- ----------------------

Annual incentive awards are based on whole months of eligibility in an incentive
plan. Thus, employees who transfer from one incentive plan to another and work
the full year, will have their incentive awards prorated between the two plans
in whole month increments that total 12 months. Whole month increments are
determined by the effective date of the employee's move.

For a move resulting in a change in incentive plan eligibility that is effective
between the 1st and 15th of any month except December, the employee becomes
eligible for the plan into which they are moving for that entire month. If the
move is effective on or after the 16th of any month except January, the employee
becomes eligible for the plan into which they are moving on the 1st of the
following month.

Employees hired or changing plans at any time during January will be credited
with plan eligibility for the entire month of January. Employees who change
plans at any time on or after November 16 will continue their eligibility in the
"old" plan for the entire month of December, and will become eligible for the
"new" plan in January.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- ---------------------------------

Performance goals are allocated between FirstEnergy Financial KPIs and
Operational KPIs. FirstEnergy Financial KPIs apply to all executives.
Operational KPIs are established by each Group Vice President. The weighting of
Financial KPIs and Operational KPIs varies among executives depending upon their
job level.

Award Leverage
- --------------

Each KPI has a threshold, target and maximum level of achievement. The
achievement of Financial KPIs at or above threshold will generate a payout from
50 to 200 of the target award. The achievement of Operational KPIs at or above
threshold will generate a payout from 50 to 150 of target. Results achieved
between threshold and target, and target and maximum, will be interpolated.

Award Payments
- --------------

Annual awards will be paid in March 2002. If an executive meets the eligibility
criteria and works in an executive position for less than the full performance
year, his/her annual award will be prorated to reflect the number of months that
he/she has worked in an eligible position.

If an executive changes his/her job within the executive group or is reassigned
to another position outside the executive group during the plan year, the
executive's total annual incentive award will be the sum of the prorated awards
earned in each position and incentive plan.

Plan participants may elect to defer the receipt of any STIP award under the
terms of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.

Shareowner Protection
- ---------------------

Short-term incentive awards will not be paid unless total earnings exceed the
amount of dividends paid plus the maximum annual awards from all incentive
plans.

Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP)
 ----------------------------------

Eligibility
- -----------

An employee who is hired or promoted into the executive group on or after
February 1, 2001 will not be eligible for the LTIP until 2002, assuming he/she
remains eligible for EICP.
An executive must work a minimum of 12 months in an eligible position during the
three-year (36-month) plan cycle to be eligible for an award. Thus, an executive
who separates for any reason during 2001 will be ineligible to receive a
long-term award from the 2001 program.

An executive must be actively employed as of December 31, 2003, or have
separated due to retirement, disability or death; or under conditions in which
the executive qualifies for and elects benefits under the FirstEnergy Severance
Benefits Plan between December 31, 2001 and the award payment date. Thus, an
executive who voluntarily resigns or who is involuntarily separated for cause
during this time frame will be ineligible to receive an LTIP award.

Performance Shares
- ------------------

On January 1, 2001, each eligible employees LTIP award will be converted into
equivalent "Performance Shares" of FirstEnergy common stock based on the average
of the high and low stock prices of the common stock on the last trading day in
2000. These shares are placed into a Performance Share Account for three years
(2001 - 2003).

During the 2001 - 2003 performance period, dividend equivalents will be
converted into additional shares based on the closing stock price on the date
the dividends are paid. At the end of the three-year performance period, the
executive's account will be valued based on the average of the high and low
prices on the last trading day in December 2003.

The value may be adjusted upward or downward based upon the total shareholder
return (TSR) of FirstEnergy common stock relative to an energy services company
index during this three-year period. If the TSR is at the 63rd percentile, the
award payout will be 100 of the account value. If the TSR rating is at or above
the 86th percentile, the award payout will be 150 of the account value. If the
TSR is at the 41st percentile, the award payout will be 50 of the account
value. Award payouts for a ranking above the 41st and below the 86th percentile
will be interpolated. For a TSR ranking below the 41st percentile, no long-term
award will be paid. The purpose of this award structure is to strengthen the
linkage between an executive's total compensation and the long-term growth of
shareholder value.

Award Payments
- --------------

Awards for the 2001 - 2003 cycle will be paid in March 2004.

If an executive meets the eligibility criteria and is no longer employed in an
executive position, his/her original LTIP target award will be prorated to
reflect the number of months worked in an eligible position during the
performance cycle.

Plan participants may elect to defer the receipt of any LTIP award under the
provisions of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.

Attachment 2 illustrates a Long-Term Incentive Program example.

Stock Option Program
 --------------------

In 2001, eligible employees will receive stock option grants that will allow
them to purchase a specified number of common stock shares at a fixed grant
price over a defined period of time. The number of stock options granted and a
stock option agreement will be communicated to recipients at the time of the
grant.

 Terms
 -----

For the purposes of this Plan, the term FirstEnergy is defined as FirstEnergy
Corp. and all of its operating companies to which this Plan has been extended.
The term "Company" refers to FirstEnergy Corp. or its operating companies
individually, as appropriate.

Each employee's rights under the Plan are at all times governed by the official
text of the Executive and Directors Incentive Compensation Plan Document and are
in no way altered or modified by the contents of this summary.

Each executive may, at any time, designate one or more persons as the
executive's primary or contingent beneficiary (ies) to whom awards earned under
this Plan shall be paid in the event of the executive's death prior to payment
of such awards to the executive. In the absence of an effective beneficiary
designation, or if all beneficiaries predecease the executive, the executive's
designated beneficiary shall be the person in the first of the following classes
in which there is a survivor: the executive's surviving spouse; the executive's
estate.

Right to Modify or Terminate
- ----------------------------

This Plan may be amended or terminated at any time with or without notice by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of FirstEnergy. The Plan may
change from year to year or even be discontinued in the future. If it is
determined that significant unusual events occurred that impacted the
FirstEnergy's reported earnings but do not truly reflect the achieved operating
results of the FirstEnergy, then the Compensation Committee may, in its sole
discretion, increase or decrease the amount of any awards determined by this
Plan or even determine that no awards will be paid. Not withstanding, the
Committee shall have no authority to adjust upwards the amount payable to a
Covered Employee with respect to a particular Award, to take any of the
foregoing actions or to take any other action to the extent that such action or
the Committee's ability to take such action would cause any Award under the Plan
to any Covered Employee to fail to qualify as "performance-based compensation"
within the meaning of Code Section 162(m)(4) and the regulations issued
thereunder.

No Employment Guarantee
- -----------------------

Nothing in this Plan shall be construed as giving any participant the right to
be retained in the employ of any Company, nor shall any Company be required, by
virtue of the existence of this Plan, to maintain the employment of any
participant through any specified date.

Not A Funded Trust
- ------------------

All awards paid under this Plan shall at all times constitute general unsecured
liabilities of any Company, payable out of its own general assets. In no event
shall any Company be obliged to reserve any funds or assets to secure the
payment of such amounts and nothing contained in the Plan shall confer upon any
participant the right, title or interest of any assets of any Company.

Performance shares mature at the end of 2003 and are payable in March 2004 based
on the following factors:

 - Quarterly dividend equivalents that may be credited to the executive's
 account during the performance period.
 - The average of the high and low price of the Company's common stock on
 the last trading day of 2003.
 - The total shareholder return (TSR) of the Company's common stock during
 the performance period relative to the peer company index.

rankings based on the target opportunity. This illustration assumes that no
dividends are paid and that the common stock price does not appreciate during
the three-year performance period.

 For 2001, the method of representing our TSR ranking is being
 changed to reflect our percentile ranking in the more traditional
 way. This year, the TSR ranking is shown in the inverse of how it
 has been represented in the past. Previously, top performance was
 reflected as the "1st percentile"; this year, top performance is
 represented as the "100th percentile". This change has no impact on
 the "Award Payout" or the "Percent Earned".

 EXEC. INCENTIVE - TIER 5
 
 FirstEnergy
 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan
 2001

Purpose
- -------

The purpose of the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (EICP) is to attract,
retain and motivate skilled executives; to more closely align the interests of
the executives and shareholders; and to promote growth in shareholder value.

Total Compensation Philosophy
- -----------------------------

FirstEnergy's total compensation philosophy is based on the following
principles:

- - A "pay-for-performance" orientation under which total compensation reflects
 corporate, business unit and individual success;
- - A focus on total compensation wherein base salaries and incentives are
 targeted generally at or near median competitive market levels, with
 opportunities to achieve total compensation at the 75th percentile level if
 both corporate and business unit performance are superior;
- - A mix between short-term and long-term compensation opportunities designed to
 reward both short and long-term strategic results and facilitate executive
 retention;
- - An escalating proportion of an executive's total compensation opportunity at
 risk through performance incentives and stock as an executive's level of
 responsibility increases; and
- - The use of various equity based incentive vehicles to promote FirstEnergy
 stock ownership and more closely align the interests of executives with the
 long-term interests of shareholders.

Plan Components
- ---------------

The Plan consists of a Short-Term Incentive Program (STIP) for 2001, a Long-Term
Incentive Program (LTIP) for the period 2001 - 2003, and a Stock Option Program.
Target incentive opportunities for each program are shown in Attachment 1.

Discretionary Award
- -------------------

There may be instances where an executive has demonstrated extraordinary
responsiveness to an unforeseen circumstance or has made a substantial
contribution that will not be properly recognized in the normal award process.
In these cases, FirstEnergy (the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors in the case of a member of the Senior Management Committee), in its
sole discretion, may grant a special incentive award to the executive.

Short-Term Incentive Program (STIP)
 -----------------------------------

Eligibility
- -----------

Employees with a 2001 standard rate at or above 92,119 and are in approved
positions that report to members of the Senior Management Committee, regional
presidents, consolidated plant managers, nuclear directors, and general office
department heads, are eligible to participate in this plan.

Eligible executives also must perform their jobs for a minimum of 1000 regular
work hours (actual on-the-job work hours exclusive of any time off) during the
year. Therefore, separation due to retirement, death or disability generally
must occur during the second half of the year in order to meet the 1000 hour
requirement. If an employee is promoted into the executive group or reassigned
to another position outside the executive group, all hours worked during the
year are counted toward the 1000-hour requirement.

Eligible executives must be actively employed as of December 31, 2001 or have
separated employment during the year due to retirement, disability, death, or
under conditions in which the executive qualifies for and elects benefits under
the FirstEnergy Severance Benefits Plan. Thus, an executive who voluntarily
resigns or is involuntarily separated for cause is ineligible to receive a
short-term award. Also, an executive who has been involuntarily separated for
cause between December 31, 2001 and the date that any awards are paid is
ineligible to receive and award.

Executives must receive or would have received a performance rating of Meets
Expectations or above. An executive with a rating "Does Not Meet Expectations"
is ineligible to receive an annual award.

Transfer between Plans
- ----------------------

Annual incentive awards are based on whole months of eligibility in an incentive
plan. Thus, employees who transfer from one incentive plan to another and work
the full year, will have their incentive awards prorated between the two plans
in whole month increments that total 12 months. Whole month increments are
determined by the effective date of the employee's move.

For a move resulting in a change in incentive plan eligibility that is effective
between the 1st and 15th of any month except December, the employee becomes
eligible for the plan into which they are moving for that entire month. If the
move is effective on or after the 16th of any month except January, the employee
becomes eligible for the plan into which they are moving on the 1st of the
following month.

Employees hired or changing plans at any time during January will be credited
with plan eligibility for the entire month of January. Employees who change
plans at any time on or after November 16 will continue their eligibility in the
"old" plan for the entire month of December, and will become eligible for the
"new" plan in January.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- ---------------------------------

Performance goals are allocated between FirstEnergy Financial KPIs and
Operational KPIs. FirstEnergy Financial KPIs apply to all executives.
Operational KPIs are established by each Group Vice President. The weighting of
Financial KPIs and Operational KPIs varies among executives depending upon their
job level.

Award Leverage
- --------------

Each KPI has a threshold, target and maximum level of achievement. The
achievement of Financial KPIs at or above threshold will generate a payout from
50 to 200 of the target award. The achievement of Operational KPIs at or above
threshold will generate a payout from 50 to 150 of target. Results achieved
between threshold and target, and target and maximum, will be interpolated.

Award Payments
- --------------

Annual awards will be paid in March 2002. If an executive meets the eligibility
criteria and works in an executive position for less than the full performance
year, his/her annual award will be prorated to reflect the number of months that
he/she has worked in an eligible position.

If an executive changes his/her job within the executive group or is reassigned
to another position outside the executive group during the plan year, the
executive's total annual incentive award will be the sum of the prorated awards
earned in each position and incentive plan.

Plan participants may elect to defer the receipt of any STIP award under the
terms of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.

Shareowner Protection
- ---------------------

Short-term incentive awards will not be paid unless total earnings exceed the
amount of dividends paid plus the maximum annual awards from all incentive
plans.

Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP)
 ----------------------------------

Eligibility
- -----------

An employee who is hired or promoted into the executive group on or after
February 1, 2001 will not be eligible for the LTIP until 2002, assuming he/she
remains eligible for EICP.
An executive must work a minimum of 12 months in an eligible position during the
three-year (36-month) plan cycle to be eligible for an award. Thus, an executive
who separates for any reason during 2001 will be ineligible to receive a
long-term award from the 2001 program.

An executive must be actively employed as of December 31, 2003, or have
separated due to retirement, disability or death; or under conditions in which
the executive qualifies for and elects benefits under the FirstEnergy Severance
Benefits Plan between December 31, 2001 and the award payment date. Thus, an
executive who voluntarily resigns or who is involuntarily separated for cause
during this time frame will be ineligible to receive an LTIP award.

Performance Shares
- ------------------

On January 1, 2001, each eligible employees LTIP award will be converted into
equivalent "Performance Shares" of FirstEnergy common stock based on the average
of the high and low stock prices of the common stock on the last trading day in
2000. These shares are placed into a Performance Share Account for three years
(2001 - 2003).

During the 2001 - 2003 performance period, dividend equivalents will be
converted into additional shares based on the closing stock price on the date
the dividends are paid. At the end of the three-year performance period, the
executive's account will be valued based on the average of the high and low
prices on the last trading day in December 2003.

The value may be adjusted upward or downward based upon the total shareholder
return (TSR) of FirstEnergy common stock relative to an energy services company
index during this three-year period. If the TSR is at the 63rd percentile, the
award payout will be 100 of the account value. If the TSR rating is at or above
the 86th percentile, the award payout will be 150 of the account value. If the
TSR is at the 41st percentile, the award payout will be 50 of the account
value. Award payouts for a ranking above the 41st and below the 86th percentile
will be interpolated. For a TSR ranking below the 41st percentile, no long-term
award will be paid. The purpose of this award structure is to strengthen the
linkage between an executive's total compensation and the long-term growth of
shareholder value.

Award Payments
- --------------

Awards for the 2001 - 2003 cycle will be paid in March 2004.

If an executive meets the eligibility criteria and is no longer employed in an
executive position, his/her original LTIP target award will be prorated to
reflect the number of months worked in an eligible position during the
performance cycle.

Plan participants may elect to defer the receipt of any LTIP award under the
provisions of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.

Attachment 2 illustrates a Long-Term Incentive Program example.

Stock Option Program
 --------------------

In 2001, eligible employees will receive stock option grants that will allow
them to purchase a specified number of common stock shares at a fixed grant
price over a defined period of time. The number of stock options granted and a
stock option agreement will be communicated to recipients at the time of the

This Plan may be amended or terminated at any time with or without notice by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of FirstEnergy. The Plan may
change from year to year or even be discontinued in the future. If it is

AMENDMENT TO
 GPU INC. 1990 STOCK PLAN

The GPU Inc. 1990 Stock Plan for Employees of GPU, Inc. and
Subsidiaries, as amended and restated to reflect amendments through June 3,
1999, is hereby further amended effective as of April 5, 2001 by adding at the
end thereof a new Section 17 which shall read as follows:

 17. FirstEnergy Merger Provisions. Notwithstanding any other
 provision to the contrary in this Plan, the provisions of this Section
 17 shall apply upon the merger (the "Merger") of the Corporation with
 FirstEnergy Corp. ("FirstEnergy") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan
 of Merger between FirstEnergy and the Corporation dated as of August
 8, 2000 (the "Merger Agreement"). Unless otherwise defined in this
 Section 17 or elsewhere in the Plan, each capitalized term used in
 this Section 17 shall have the meaning given to such term in the
 Merger Agreement.

 (a) On the fifth Business Day preceding the date which
 FirstEnergy publicly announces as the Election Deadline for purposes
 of the Merger Agreement in accordance with Section 2.01(c) thereof
 (the "Accelerated Vesting Date"), each outstanding option previously
 granted under the Plan on or after June 3,1999 , to the extent it had
 not otherwise become exercisable prior to the Accelerated Vesting Date
 a "Non-Vested Option"), shall become immediately and fully
 exercisable, and may be exercised on the Accelerated Vesting Date as
 to any or all shares of Common Stock that are then still subject to
 the option. The holder of a Non-Vested Option may exercise it by
 delivering to the Corporation, at any time during the period beginning
 on the 20th Business Day preceding the Election Deadline and ending at
 the close of business on the Accelerated Vesting Date, an executed
 notice of exercise on a form furnished by the Corporation to the
 holder for such purpose (the "Notice of Exercise Form"), together with
 a check in the amount of the aggregate purchase price for the shares
 of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to the holder's exercise of
 such option. By no later than the 20th Business Day preceding the
 Election Deadline, each holder of a Non-Vested Option shall be
 furnished with (i) a Notice of Exercise Form, and (ii) copies of the
 Form of Election, Joint Proxy Statement, and all other related
 materials, which FirstEnergy furnishes to recordholders of GPU Common
 Stock pursuant to Section 2.01(k) of the Merger Agreement in
 connection with their right to make an election regarding the form in
 which the Merger Consideration for their GPU Common Stock is to be
 paid.
 (b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option granted under
 the Plan on or after June 3,1999 (including any Non-Vested Option), to
 the extent then still unexercised (each such option, a "GPU Option"),
 shall automatically become an option (a "FirstEnergy Option") to
 purchase a number of shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock equal to the
 number of shares of GPU Common Stock that remained subject to the GPU
 Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
 Exchange Ratio as adjusted in accordance with Section 2.01(m) of the
 Merger Agreement (with the resulting number of shares rounded up or
 down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share of
 FirstEnergy Common Stock equal to the exercise price for the purchase
 of shares under the GPU Option divided by the Exchange Ratio as
 adjusted in accordance with Section 2.01(m) of the Merger Agreement
 (with the resulting exercise price rounded up or down to the nearest
 whole cent).

 (c) In the case of each option granted under the Plan prior to
 June 3, 1999 that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
 Time, the holder thereof may elect, in lieu of having such option
 cancelled and receiving a lump sum cash payment therefor as provided
 in Sections 7(c) and (d) of the Plan, to have such option converted
 into a FirstEnergy Option entitling the holder to purchase a number of
 shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock, at an exercise price per share of
 FirstEnergy Common Stock, determined in the same manner as set forth
 in subsection (b) above. Any such election shall be made in writing,
 on a form furnished to the option holder by FirstEnergy for such
 purpose. The election form shall be signed by the option holder and
 filed with FirstEnergy within 30 days after the Closing Date. Any
 election so made shall be irrevocable.

 (d) Each FirstEnergy Option issued to an employee pursuant to
 subsection (b) or (c) above shall be subject to the same terms and
 conditions as the option for which it was issued, as set forth in this
 Plan and in the written agreements evidencing the grant of such
 options under this Plan to the employee.

 (e) In the case of all performance units and deferred vested
 units standing to an employee's credit under the Plan which, pursuant
 to the terms of the Plan or the written agreements evidencing the
 grant of such units to the employee (or pursuant to any payment
 election made by the employee in accordance with the provisions of
 such agreements), will become payable upon the consummation of the
 Merger, payment with respect to such units (collectively, the
 employee's "GPU Stock Units") shall be made as soon as practicable
 after the Effective Time, in cash, or in shares of FirstEnergy Common
 Stock, or in any combination of cash and such shares, as the employee
 may elect. Any such election shall be made in writing, on a form
 furnished to the employee by the Corporation for such purpose. In such
 form the employee shall specify by number or percentage (which
 percentage must be an even multiple of 10 the portion of his or her
 GPU Stock Units to be paid in cash and the portion of such units to be
 paid in shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock. The election form shall be
 signed by the employee and delivered to the Corporation by no later
 than the close of business on the Accelerated Vesting Date. Any
 election so made shall be irrevocable. In the case of any employee who
 fails to make a timely election in accordance with this subsection
 (e), payment with respect to all of the employee's GPU Stock Units
 shall be made in cash.

 (f) If payment with respect to any of an employee's GPU Stock
 Units is to be made in cash pursuant to the employee's election (or as
 a result of the employee's failure to make a timely election) under
 subsection (e) above , the amount of cash to be paid for such units
 shall be equal to the product of the number of such units multiplied
 by the highest closing price per share of GPU Common Stock, as
 reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape, occurring
 during the 90-day period immediately preceding the Closing Date (the
 "GPU Stock Price"). If payment with respect to any of an employee's
 GPU Stock Units is to be made in shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock
 pursuant to the employee's election under subsection (e) above, the
 number of shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock to be delivered to the
 employee in payment for such units shall be equal to the quotient of
 (i) the product of the number of such units multiplied by the GPU
 Stock Price, divided by (ii) the per share closing price of
 FirstEnergy Common Stock on the last Business Day preceding the
 Closing Date; provided, however, that if the resulting number of
 shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock includes a fraction of a share,
 payment with respect to such fraction shall be made in cash, in an
 amount based on the per share closing price of FirstEnergy Common
 Stock on the last Business Day preceding the Closing Date.

 (g) Unless an employee otherwise elects under subsection (h)
 below, all deferred vested units standing to the employee's credit
 under the Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time which do not
 become payable upon consummation of the Merger shall be automatically
 converted at the Effective Time into deferred cash accounts to be
 established and maintained for the employee by FirstEnergy or one of
 its Subsidiaries. A separate deferred cash account shall be so
 established and maintained for all of the deferred vested units that
 are subject to the same payment commencement date and payment method
 selected by the employee in the election made by the employee to defer
 payment with respect to such units. Each deferred cash account so
 established shall have an initial balance equal to the product of the
 number of deferred vested units the conversion of which is to be
 reflected in such account, multiplied by the GPU Stock Price. Payment
 with respect to each account so established shall be made in cash, and
 payment shall be made or commence on the payment commencement date,
 and under the payment method, selected by the employee in his or her
 election to defer payment with respect to the units the conversion of
 which is reflected in such account. Until payment with respect to any
 deferred cash account maintained for an employee has been made in
 full, interest, compounded monthly, shall be credited to the balance
 of such account at the end of each calendar quarter, at a rate not
 less than the simple average of Citibank, N.A. of New York Prime Rates
 for the last business day of each of the three months in the calendar
 quarter.

 (h) In lieu of the deferred cash accounts that otherwise would be
 established for an employee with respect to his or her deferred vested
 units pursuant to subsection (g) above, the employee may elect to have
 the deferred vested units standing to his or her credit under the Plan
 immediately prior to the Effective Time that do not become payable
 upon consummation of the Merger converted, as of the Effective Time,
 into deferred vested units ("FirstEnergy Deferred Units") in respect
 of a number of shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock equal to the
 quotient of (i) the product of the number of such deferred vested
 units, multiplied by the GPU Stock Price, divided by (ii) the per
 share closing price of FirstEnergy Common Stock on the last Business
 Day immediately preceding the Closing Date. Any such election shall be
 made in writing, on a form furnished to the employee by FirstEnergy
 for such purpose and filed with FirstEnergy within 30 days after the
 Closing Date. The FirstEnergy Deferred Units credited to an employee
 pursuant to his or her election under this subsection (h) shall be
 subject to the same terms and conditions as the deferred vested units
 with respect to which the FirstEnergy Deferred Units were credited, as
 set forth in this Plan and in the written agreements evidencing the
 grant of such deferred vested units to the employee.

 (i) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 17 to the
 contrary, no shares of Common Stock will be delivered to an employee
 upon his or her exercise of a Non-Vested Option pursuant to subsection
 (a) above, and no payment of cash or delivery of shares of FirstEnergy
 Common Stock will be made to an employee with respect to his or her
 GPU Stock Units pursuant to subsection (e) above, unless the employee
 has paid all Federal, state and local taxes required to be withheld
 with respect to the employee's exercise of such option or with respect
 to the employee's receipt of such cash payment or shares of
 FirstEnergy Common Stock.

 (j) The provisions of each agreement evidencing the grant of
 stock options, performance units, or deferred vested units to an
 employee under the Plan that are still outstanding immediately prior
 to the Effective Time shall be deemed to have been amended as of the
 Effective Time to the extent necessary to conform to and reflect the
 provisions of this Section 17.

majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum. The
Committee may act at a meeting, including a telephone meeting, by action of a
majority of the members present, or without a meeting by unanimous written
consent. The Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion, to establish
from time to time guidelines or regulations for the administration of the Plan,
interpret the Plan, and make all determinations considered necessary or
advisable for the administration of the Plan. The Committee also shall have all
of the rights, powers and authority with respect to the GPU Stock Options and
GPU Restricted Shares granted under this Plan as the "Committee", as defined in
the Applicable MYR Plan, had with respect to the MYR Stock Options and MYR
Restricted Shares in respect of which such GPU Stock Options or GPU Restricted
Shares were granted. The Committee may delegate any ministerial or
nondiscretionary function pertaining to the administration of the Plan to any
one or more officers or employees of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the
Corporation. All decisions, actions or interpretations of the Committee under
the Plan shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties.

 6. Amendment. The Board of Directors may, with prospective or retroactive

the contrary in this Plan, the provisions of this Section 8 shall apply upon the

Merger Agreement (the "Merger"). Unless otherwise defined in this Section 8 or
elsewhere in the Plan, each capitalized term used in this Section 8 shall have
the meaning given to such term in the Merger Agreement.

 (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding GPU Stock Option granted under
Section 3 of the Plan shall automatically become an option (a "FirstEnergy
Option") to purchase a number of shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock equal to the
product of the number of shares of GPU Common Stock that are then still subject
to the GPU Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio as adjusted in accordance
with Section 2.01(m) of the Merger Agreement (with the resulting number of
shares rounded up or down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per
share of FirstEnergy Common Stock equal to the quotient of the exercise price
for the purchase of shares under the GPU Option divided by the Exchange Ratio as
adjusted in accordance with Section 2.01(m) of the Merger Agreement (with the
resulting exercise price rounded up or down to the nearest whole cent).

 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (a) above, each FirstEnergy
Option issued pursuant to subsection (a) shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions as the GPU Stock Option with respect to which it was issued, as
provided in this Plan and in any written agreement or certificate evidencing the
grant of such option hereunder.

 (c) At the Effective Time, each of the GPU Restricted Shares granted under
Section 4 of the Plan that are then still subject to restrictions shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with
respect to such shares upon the same terms and conditions (including the right
to make an Election as to the form in which the Merger Consideration will be
paid with respect to such shares, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement)
as are applicable under the Merger Agreement to all shares of GPU Common Stock
(other than Dissenting Shares and shares canceled under Section 2.01(b) of the
Merger Agreement) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject
however to the following:

 (i) The amount of cash included in the Merger Consideration payable
 with respect to any of a holder's GPU Restricted Shares shall be paid to
 the holder in cash in a single lump sum, without interest, on the Lapse
 Date applicable to such shares, or as soon as practicable thereafter. As
 used herein, the term "Lapse Date" shall mean, with respect to any of a
 holder's GPU Restricted Shares, the date on which the restrictions to which
 such shares were subject immediately prior to the Effective Time would have
 lapsed under the provisions of Section 4 hereof and the Restricted Share
 Agreement evidencing the grant of such shares, in the absence of the
 Merger.

 (ii) The shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock included in the Merger
 Consideration payable with respect to any of a holder's GPU Restricted
 Shares shall be registered in the name of the holder, or for his or her
 benefit, either individually or collectively with others, as of the date on
 which the Merger becomes effective, but they shall be issued subject to the
 same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, the same
 restrictions on the transfer of such shares, the same periods during which
 the shares are to remain subject to such restrictions, and the same
 provisions for forfeiture of the shares upon termination of employment
 before the expiration of such periods) as were applicable to the GPU
 Restricted Shares with respect to which such shares are issued, as set
 forth in Section 4 hereof and in the Restricted Share Agreements evidencing
 the grant of such GPU Restricted Shares.

 (iii) If the holder of any GPU Restricted Shares should terminate
 employment with the Corporation and its subsidiaries prior to the Lapse
 Date applicable to such shares, the holder's right to receive the Merger
 Consideration otherwise payable with respect to such shares shall be
 forfeited, except to the extent the Committee, in its discretion, otherwise
 determines.

 (iv) A proportionate part of the total amount of cash, and a
 proportionate part of the total number of shares of FirstEnergy Common
 Stock, included in the Merger Consideration payable with respect to all of
 a holder's GPU Restricted Shares that are still subject to restrictions
 immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as included in the
 Merger Consideration payable with respect to each such GPU Restricted
 Share.

 (d) With respect to all periods beginning after the Effective Time, the
terms "Corporation" and "Committee", as used in this Plan, shall mean
FirstEnergy Corp. and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
respectively.

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of FirstEnergy Corp.:

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
consolidated statements of capitalization of FirstEnergy Corp. (an Ohio
corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of income, common stockholders' equity, preferred stock,
cash flows and taxes for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
 in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FirstEnergy Corp.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

 As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 2001, the Company changed its method of accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities by adopting Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities", as amended.

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of
 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

This discussion includes forward-looking statements based on
information currently available to management that is subject to certain risks
and uncertainties. Such statements typically contain, but are not limited to,
the terms anticipate, potential, expect, believe, estimate and similar words.
Actual results may differ materially due to the speed and nature of increased
competition and deregulation in the electric utility industry, economic or
weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changes in markets for
energy services, changing energy and commodity market prices, legislative and
regulatory changes (including revised environmental requirements), the
availability and cost of capital, our ability to accomplish or realize
anticipated benefits from strategic initiatives and other similar factors.

 FirstEnergy Corp. is a holding company that provides regulated and
competitive energy services (see Results of Operations - Business Segments)
domestically and internationally. The international operations were acquired as
part of FirstEnergy's acquisition of GPU, Inc. in November 2001. GPU Capital,
Inc. and its subsidiaries provide electric distribution services in foreign
countries. GPU Power, Inc. and its subsidiaries develop, own and operate
generation facilities in foreign countries. Sales are pending for portions of
the international operations (see Capital Resources and Liquidity). Prior to the
GPU merger, regulated electric distribution services were provided to portions
of Ohio and Pennsylvania by our wholly owned subsidiaries - Ohio Edison Company
(OE), The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (CEI), Pennsylvania Power
Company (Penn) and The Toledo Edison Company (TE) with American Transmission
Systems, Inc. (ATSI) providing transmission services. Following the GPU merger,
regulated services are also provided through wholly owned subsidiaries - Jersey
Central Power & Light Company (JCP&L), Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed) and
Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec) - which provide electric distribution
and transmission services to portions of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The
coordinated delivery of energy and energy-related products to customers in
unregulated markets is provided through a number of subsidiaries, often under
master contracts providing for the delivery of multiple energy and
energy-related services. Prior to the GPU merger, competitive services were
principally provided by FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. (FES), FirstEnergy
Facilities Services Group, LLC (FEFSG) and MARBEL Energy Corporation. Following
the GPU merger, competitive services are also provided through GPU Advanced
Resources, Inc. and MYR Group, Inc.

GPU Merger

 On November 7, 2001, the merger of FirstEnergy and GPU became
effective with FirstEnergy being the surviving company. The merger was accounted
for using purchase accounting under the guidelines of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 141, "Business Combinations." Under purchase
accounting, the results of operations for the combined entity are reported from
the point of consummation forward. As a result, FirstEnergy's financial
statements for 2001 reflect twelve months of operations for FirstEnergy's
pre-merger organization and only seven weeks of operations (November 7, 2001 to
December 31, 2001) for the former GPU companies. Additional goodwill resulting
from the merger 2.3 billion) plus goodwill existing at GPU 1.9 billion) at
the time of the merger is not being amortized, reflecting the application of
SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Goodwill continues to be
subject to review for potential impairment (see Recently Issued Accounting
Standards). Prior to consummation of the GPU merger we identified certain GPU
international operations (see Note 2 - Divestitures-International Operations)
providing gas transmission and electric distribution services for divestiture
within twelve months of the merger date. These operations constitute individual
"lines of business" as defined in Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No.
30, "Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of
a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions" with physically and operationally separable activities.
Application of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 87-11, "Allocation of
Purchase Price to Assets to Be Sold," requires that expected, pre-sale cash
flows (including incremental interest costs on related acquisition debt) of
these operations be considered part of the purchase price allocation.
Accordingly, subsequent to the merger date, results of operations (and related
interest expense) of these international subsidiaries have not been included in
FirstEnergy's Consolidated Statement of Income. Additionally, assets and
liabilities of these international operations have been segregated under
separate captions - "Assets Pending Sale" and "Liabilities Related to Assets
Pending Sale" on FirstEnergy's Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Results of Operations

 Net income increased to 646.4 million in 2001, compared to 599.0
million in 2000 and 568.3 million in 1999. Net income in 2001 included an
after-tax charge of 8.5 million resulting from the cumulative effect of an
accounting change due to the adoption of SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." Excluding the seven weeks of the former GPU
companies' results (and related interest expense on acquisition debt), net
income increased to 613.7 million in 2001 due to reduced depreciation and
amortization, general taxes and net interest

charges. The benefit of these reductions was offset in part by lower retail
electric sales, increased other operating expenses and higher gas costs. In
2000, lower fuel costs, increased generation output, reduced financing costs and
gains realized on the sale of emission allowances contributed to the increase in
net income from the prior year.

 Total revenues increased 970.4 million in 2001 compared to 2000.
Excluding the seven weeks of results from the former GPU companies, total
revenues increased 336.7 million following a 709.3 million increase in 2000.
In both 2001 and 2000, the additional sales resulted from an expansion of our
unregulated businesses, which more than offset lower sales from our electric
utility operating companies (EUOC). Sources of changes in pre-merger and
post-merger companies' revenues during 2001 and 2000, compared to the prior
year, are summarized in the following table:

 ======================================================================

Electric Sales

 EUOC retail electric sales revenues for our pre-merger companies
decreased by 240.5 million in 2001, compared to 2000, primarily due to lower
generation kilowatt-hour sales reflecting the result of customer choice in Ohio
and the influence of a declining national economy on our regional business
activity, which reduced our distribution deliveries. Both unit prices and sales
volumes declined from the prior year. As a result of opening Ohio to competing
generation suppliers in 2001, sales of electric generation by alternative
suppliers in our franchise area increased to 11.3 of total energy delivered,
compared to 0.8 in 2000. Consequently, generation kilowatt-hour sales to retail
customers were 12.2 lower in 2001 than the prior year. Implementation of a 5 
reduction in generation charges for residential customers as part of Ohio's
electric utility restructuring implemented in 2001, also contributed 51.2
million to the reduced electric sales revenues. Weather in 2001 had a minor
influence on sales with mild weather in the fourth quarter substantially
offsetting a net increase in weather-related sales revenue through the third
quarter. Kilowatt-hour deliveries to franchise customers were down a more
moderate 1.7 due in part to the decline in economic conditions, which was a
major factor resulting in a 3.1 decrease in kilowatt-hour deliveries to
commercial and industrial customers. Other regulated electric revenues decreased
by 22.6 million in 2001, compared to the prior year, due in part to reduced
customer reservation of transmission capacity.

 Total electric generation sales increased by 8.3 in 2001 compared to
the prior year with sales to the wholesale market being the largest single
factor contributing to this increase. While revenues from the wholesale market
increased 287.1 million in 2001 from the prior year, kilowatt-hour sales to
that market more than doubled as nonaffiliated energy suppliers made use of the
1,120 megawatts (MW) supply commitment under our Ohio transition plan, and
reduced sales to the regulated retail market made additional energy available to
pursue opportunities in the wholesale market. Retail kilowatt-hour sales by our
competitive services segment increased by 10.6 in 2001, compared to 2000. The
increase resulted from expanding kilowatt-hour sales within Ohio as a result of
retail customers switching to FES, our unregulated subsidiary, under Ohio's
electricity choice program. The higher kilowatt-hour sales in Ohio were
partially offset by lower sales in markets outside of Ohio as more customers
returned to their local distribution companies. Declining sales to higher-priced
eastern markets contributed to an overall decline in retail competitive sales
revenue in 2001 from the prior year, despite an increase in kilowatt hour sales
in Ohio's competitive market.

EUOC retail revenues decreased by 36.8 million in 2000 compared to
1999, as a result of lower unit prices, which were partially offset by increased
generation sales volume. Despite a milder summer, retail electric generation
sales were 2 higher in 2000 than the previous year. Total electric generation
sales (including unregulated sales) increased 8.4 in 2000, compared to 1999.
Unregulated retail sales more than tripled in 2000 reflecting our marketing
efforts to expand retail electric sales to targeted unregulated markets in the
eastern seaboard states, principally the commercial and industrial sectors. The
cooler summer weather reduced retail customer demand, making more of our energy
available to the wholesale market. As a result, we were able to achieve moderate
growth in kilowatt-hour sales to that market in 2000. EUOC kilowatt-hour
deliveries (to customers in our franchise areas) increased in 2000 from the
prior year due to additional sales to commercial and industrial customers.
Kilowatt-hour sales to residential customers declined. Other electric utility
revenues increased in 2000 from the previous year primarily due to additional
transmission service revenue.

 Changes in electric generation sales and distribution deliveries in
2001 and 2000 for our pre-merger companies are summarized in the following
table:

 Changes in Kilowatt-hour Sales 2001 2000

 ==================================================================

Other Sales

 Natural gas revenues were the largest source of increases in other
sales in 2001. Beginning November 1, 2000, residential and small business
customers in the service area of Dominion East Ohio, a nonaffiliated gas
utility, began shopping among alternative gas suppliers as part of a customer
choice program. FES took advantage of this opportunity to expand its customer
base. The average number of retail gas customers served by FES increased to
approximately 161,000 in 2001 from approximately 44,000 in 2000. Total gas sales
increased by 226.1 million or 40 from the prior year. In 2000, retail natural
gas revenues were the largest source of increase in other sales. Collectively,
three gas acquisitions in 1999 (Atlas Gas Marketing Inc., Belden Energy Services
Company and Volunteer Energy LLC), as well as increased retail marketing
efforts, significantly expanded retail gas revenues. Wholesale gas revenues were
also higher.

Expenses

 Total expenses increased 790.2 million in 2001, which included 542.4
million of incremental expenses for the former GPU companies during the last
seven weeks of 2001. For our pre-merger companies, total expenses increased
 280.4 million in 2001 and 739.8 million in 2000, compared to the prior year.
Sources of changes in pre-merger and post-merger companies' expenses in 2001 and
2000, compared to the prior year, are summarized in the following table:

Sources of Expense Changes 2001 2000

 Net Expense Increase...................... 790.2 739.8
 ===================================================================

 The following comparisons reflect variances for the pre-merger
companies only, excluding the incremental expenses for the former GPU companies
during the last seven weeks of 2001.

 The increase in fuel expense in 2001 compared to 2000 24.3 million)
resulted from the substitution of coal and natural gas fired generation for
nuclear generation (which has lower unit fuel costs than fossil fuel) during a
period of reduced nuclear availability resulting from both planned and unplanned
outages. Coal prices were also higher during that period. Purchased power costs
increased early in 2001, compared to 2000, due to higher winter prices and
additional purchased power requirements during that period, with the balance of
the year offsetting all but 24.4 million of that increase, reflecting generally
lower prices and reduced external power needs than last year's.

 In 2000, fuel and purchased power increased 125.9 million due to a
 201.6 million increase in fuel and purchased power expense of FirstEnergy
Trading Services Inc. (FETS), a wholly owned subsidiary, reflecting expansion of
its operations to support our retail marketing efforts (FETS operations were
assumed by FES in 2001). Excluding those competitive activities, fuel and
purchased power costs decreased 75.7 million in 2000, compared to 1999. Lower
fuel expense accounted for all of the reduction, declining 103.6 million from
1999, despite a 7 increase in the output from our generating units due to
additional nuclear generation, the expiration of an above-market coal contract
and continued improvement in coal blending strategies. Purchased power costs
increased 27.9 million in 2000 from the prior year due to higher average prices
and to additional kilowatt-hours purchased. Purchased gas costs increased 48 in
2001 and 224 in 2000 from the prior year. The increases were due principally to
the expansion of FES's retail gas business.

 Other operating expenses increased by 178.2 million in 2001 and by
 231.7 million in 2000 compared to the prior year. The significant reduction in
2001 of gains from the sale of emission allowances, higher fossil operating
costs and additional employee benefit costs accounted for 144.5 million of the
increase in 2001. Additionally, higher operating costs from the competitive
services business segment due to expanded operations contributed 56.9 million
to the increase. Partially offsetting these higher other operating expenses was
a reduction in low-income payment plan customer costs and a 30.2 million
decrease in nuclear operating costs in 2001, compared to the prior year,
resulting from one less refueling outage.

 Fossil operating costs increased 44.3 million in 2001 from last year
due principally to planned maintenance work at the Mansfield generating plant.
Pension costs increased by 32.6 million in 2001 from the prior year primarily
due to lower returns on pension plan assets (due to significant market-related
reductions in the value of pension plan assets), the completion of the 15-year
amortization of OE's pension transition asset and changes to plan benefits.
Health care benefit costs also increased by 21.4 million in 2001, compared to
2000, principally due to an increase in the health care cost trend rate
assumption for computing post-retirement health care benefit liabilities.

 In 2000, other operating expenses increased from 1999 due to several
factors. A significant portion of the increase resulted from additional nuclear
costs associated with three refueling outages in 2000 versus two during the
previous year and increased nuclear ownership resulting from the Duquesne asset
exchange. Costs incurred to improve the availability of our fossil generation
fleet and leased portable diesel generators, acquired as part of our summer
supply strategy, added to other expenses for the EUOC in 2000, compared to 1999.
We also incurred increased reserves for potentially uncollectible accounts from
customers in the steel sector as well as a reserve for expected construction
contract losses at FEFSG. The increase in other operating costs in 2000 from
1999 also reflected an increase in expenses related to expanded operations of
the competitive services business segment. Partially offsetting the higher costs
were increased gains of 38.5 million realized from the sale of emission
allowances in 2000 as well as the absence of nonrecurring costs recognized in
the prior year.

 Charges for depreciation and amortization decreased by 99.0 million
in 2001 and 4.3 million in 2000 from the prior year. Approximately 64.6
million of the decrease in 2001 resulted from lower incremental transition cost
amortization under FirstEnergy's Ohio transition plan compared to accelerated
cost recovery in connection with OE's prior rate plan. The reduction in
depreciation and amortization also reflected additional cost deferrals of 51.2
million for recoverable shopping incentives under the Ohio transition plan,
partially offset by increases associated with depreciation on recently completed
combustion turbines.

 In November 2001, we announced an agreement to sell four of our
coal-fired power plants to NRG Energy, Inc. The plants meet the criteria under
SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of" and have been classified as assets to be disposed of
since November 2001. Accordingly, depreciation of those plants ceased pending
their sale. Due to the cessation of depreciation on those plants, depreciation
was reduced by 6.6 million in 2001 from what it otherwise would have been.
Under SFAS 121 guidance, the long-lived assets to be disposed of must be
included on the balance sheet at the lower of their carrying amount or fair
value less cost to sell (see Outlook - Optimizing the Use of Assets) and at year
end continued to be reported at their carrying amount of 539 million.

In 2000, depreciation and amortization was reduced by 9.8 million in
the second half of the year, following approval by the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio (PUCO) of FirstEnergy's Ohio transition plan. Incremental
transition costs recovered in 2001 and cost recovery accelerated under OE's rate
plan and Penn's restructuring plan in 2000 and 1999 are summarized by income
statement caption in the following table:

 Accelerated Cost Recovery 2001 2000 1999
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (In millions)

 Depreciation and amortization.. 268.0 332.6 333.3
 Income tax amortization........ 41.1 42.6 18.7
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Total Accelerations............ 309.1 375.2 352.0
 ========================================================================

 General taxes declined 114.0 million from last year primarily due to
reduced property taxes and other state tax changes in connection with the Ohio
electric industry restructuring. In addition, as a result of successfully
resolving certain pending tax issues, a one-time benefit of 15 million was also
recognized in 2001. The reduction in general taxes was partially offset by 66.6
million of new Ohio franchise taxes, which are classified as state income taxes
on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Net Interest Charges

 Net interest charges increased 26.6 million in 2001, compared to
2000. This increase reflects interest on 4 billion of long-term debt issued by
FirstEnergy in connection with the merger and related bridge financing, which
totaled 40.4 million. Excluding the results associated with the last seven
weeks of 2001 for the former GPU companies and merger-related financing, net
interest charges decreased 39.8 million in 2001, compared to a 43.2 million
decrease in 2000 from the prior year. We continued to redeem and refinance our
outstanding debt and preferred stock, maintaining a downward trend in financing
costs during 2001, before the effects of the GPU merger.

 After the merger with GPU became probable, we established cash flow
hedges under SFAS 133 covering a portion of our future interest payments in
connection with the anticipated issuance of 4 billion of acquisition-related
debt. The hedges provided us with protection against a possible upward move in
interest rates but limited our ability to completely participate in the benefits
of a downward move. Due to a decline in interest rates during the period in
which cash flow hedges were in place, FirstEnergy incurred a net deferred loss
in connection with this transaction and a related reduction in other
comprehensive income totaling 134 million (after tax). The cash flow hedges
were the primary contributor to the current net deferred loss of 169.4 million
included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) as of December 31, 2001
for derivative hedging activity. In accordance with the requirements of SFAS
133, this amount is being amortized from AOCL to interest expense over the
corresponding interest payment periods hedged - 5, 10 and 30 years.

Results of Operations - Business Segments

 We manage our business as two separate major business segments -
regulated services and competitive services. The regulated services segment
designs, constructs, operates and maintains our regulated domestic transmission
and distribution systems. It also provides generation services to franchise
customers who have not chosen an alternative generation supplier. OE, CEI and TE
(Ohio Companies) and Penn obtain generation through a power supply agreement
with the competitive services segment (see Outlook - Business Organization). The
competitive services segment includes all unregulated energy and energy-related
services including commodity sales (both electricity and natural gas) in the
retail and wholesale markets, marketing, generation, trading and sourcing of
commodity requirements, as well as other competitive energy application
services. Competitive products are increasingly marketed to customers as bundled
services, often under master contracts. Financial results discussed below
include intersegment revenue. A reconciliation of segment financial results to
consolidated financial results is provided in Note 7 to the consolidated
financial statements.

Regulated Services

 Net income increased to 640.2 million in 2001, compared to 464.4
million in 2000 and 413.9 million in 1999. Excluding the last seven weeks of
2001 results associated with the former GPU companies, net income increased by
 98.7 million in 2001. The increases in pre-merger net income are summarized in
the following table:

 =====================================================================

 Distribution throughput was 1.7 lower in 2001, compared to 2000,
reducing external revenues by 245.7 million. Partially offsetting the decrease
in external revenues were revenues from FES for the rental of fossil generating
facilities and the sale of generation from nuclear plants, resulting in a net
 130.2 million reduction to total revenues. Expenses were 345.2 million lower
in 2001 than 2000 due to lower purchased power, depreciation and amortization
and general taxes, offset in part by higher other operating expenses. Lower
generation sales reduced the need to purchase power from FES, with a resulting
 269.0 million decline in those costs in 2001 from the prior year. Other
operating expenses increased by 178.5 million in 2001 from the previous year
reflecting a significant reduction in 2001 of gains from the sale of emission
allowances, higher fossil operating costs and additional employee benefit costs.
Lower incremental transition cost amortization and the new shopping incentive
deferrals under FirstEnergy's Ohio transition in 2001 plan as compared with the
accelerated cost recovery in connection with OE's prior rate plan in 2000
resulted in a 131.0 million reduction in depreciation and amortization in 2001.
A 123.6 million decrease in general taxes in 2001 from the prior year primarily
resulted from reduced property taxes and other state tax changes in connection
with the Ohio electric industry restructuring.

 Lower unit prices in 2000 compared to 1999 produced a 33.2 million
decrease in revenues from nonaffiliates despite a 1.7 increase in kilowatt-hour
deliveries. Rental of fossil generating facilities and the sale of generation
from nuclear plants more than offset the reduced external revenue resulting in a
net 57.5 million increase in total revenues. Expenses increased 54.1 million
in 2000 from 1999 primarily due to higher purchased power costs resulting from
higher average prices and additional megawatt-hours purchased, as well as higher
other operating costs. Interest charges in 2000 decreased 55.9 million compared
to 1999, reflecting the impact of net debt redemptions and refinancings and was
the primary contributor to the increase in net income.

Competitive Services

 Net income decreased to 57.2 million in 2001, compared to 137.2
million in 2000 and 129.2 million in 1999. Excluding the last seven weeks of
2001 results associated with the former GPU companies, net income decreased
 83.0 million in 2001. The changes to pre-merger net income are summarized in
the following table:

 Sales to nonaffiliates increased 523.1 million in 2001, compared to
the prior year, with electric revenues contributing 260.1 million, natural gas
revenues 226.1 million and the balance of the increase from energy-related
services. Reduced power requirements by the regulated services segment reduced
internal revenues by 269.0 million. Expenses increased 366.9 million in 2001
from 2000 primarily due to a 266.5 million increase in purchased gas costs and
increases resulting from additional fuel and purchased power costs (see Results
of Operations) as well as higher expenses for energy-related services. Reduced
margins for both major competitive product areas - electricity and natural gas -
contributed to the reduction in net income, along with higher interest charges
and the cumulative effect of the SFAS 133 accounting change. Margins for
electricity and gas sales were both adversely affected by higher fuel costs.

 In 2000, sales to nonaffiliates increased 749.3 million, compared to
the prior year, with electric revenues contributing 283.5 million, natural gas
revenues 376.3 million and the balance of the increase from energy-related
services. Additional power sales to the regulated services segment increased
revenues by 40.3 million. Expenses

increased 773.6 million in 2000 from 1999 primarily due to the additional
purchased gas and purchased power costs resulting from the increased sales. The
exchange of fossil assets for nuclear assets with Duquesne Light Company in
December 1999 changed the mix of expenses, increasing plant operating costs and
decreasing fuel expense. The resulting net income increase primarily reflected
the contribution of competitive electric sales offset in part by higher interest
charges.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

 We had approximately 220.2 million of cash and temporary investments
and 614.3 million of short-term indebtedness on December 31, 2001. Our unused
borrowing capability included 1.115 billion under revolving lines of credit and
 84 million from unused bank facilities. At the end of 2001, OE, CEI, TE and
Penn had the capability to issue 2.2 billion of additional first mortgage bonds
(FMB) on the basis of property additions and retired bonds. The former GPU EUOC
will not issue FMB other than as collateral for senior notes, since their senior
note indentures prohibit (subject to certain exceptions) the GPU EUOC from
issuance of any debt which is senior to the senior notes. As of December 31,
2001, the GPU EUOC had the capability to issue 795 million of additional senior
notes based upon FMB collateral. At year end 2001, based upon applicable
earnings coverage tests and their respective charters, OE, Penn, TE and JCP&L
could issue 7.0 billion of preferred stock (assuming no additional debt was
issued). CEI, Met-Ed and Penelec have no restrictions on the issuance of
preferred stock.

 At the end of 2001, our common equity as a percentage of
capitalization, including debt relating to assets held for sale, stood at 35 
compared to 42 at the end of 2000. This decrease resulted from the addition of
 8.2 billion of debt, 378 million of preferred stock and 2.6 billion of common
stock (issued to former GPU stockholders) to our capital structure as a result
of the GPU acquisition. The incremental debt included 6.0 billion of the former
GPU companies' debt, 1.5 billion of which was replaced with FirstEnergy debt
and an additional 2.2 billion of FirstEnergy debt used to pay GPU shareholders
as part of the merger.

 Following approval of our merger with GPU by the New Jersey Board of
Public Utilities (NJBPU) on September 26, 2001 and by the Securities and
Exchange Commission on October 29, 2001, Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's
Investors Service established initial credit ratings for FirstEnergy's holding
company and adjusted those of our EUOC to reflect our new consolidated credit
profile. S&P's outlook on all our credit ratings is stable. On February 22,
2002, Moody's announced a change in its outlook for the credit ratings of
FirstEnergy, Met-Ed and Penelec from stable to negative. The change was based
upon a decision by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania to remand to the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC) for reconsideration its decision
regarding rate relief, accounting deferrals and the mechanism for sharing merger
savings rendered in connection with its approval of the GPU merger (see State
Regulatory Matters-Pennsylvania).

 Our cash requirements in 2002 for operating expenses, construction
expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and preferred stock redemptions are
expected to be met without increasing our net debt and preferred stock
outstanding. Major contractual obligations for future cash payments are
summarized in the following table:

Excludes approximately 1.75 billion of long-term debt and 233.8 million of
 short-term borrowings related to pending divestitures discussed below.

Our capital spending for the period 2002-2006 is expected to be about
 3.4 billion (excluding nuclear fuel), of which approximately 850 million
applies to 2002. Investments for additional nuclear fuel during the 2002-2006
period are estimated to be approximately 536 million, of which about 54
million applies to 2002. During the same period, our nuclear fuel investments
are expected to be reduced by approximately 507 million and 101 million,
respectively, as the nuclear fuel is consumed.

 Off balance sheet obligations primarily consist of sale and leaseback
arrangements involving Perry Unit 1, Beaver Valley Unit 2 and the Bruce
Mansfield Plant, which are reflected in the operating lease payments disclosed
above (see Note 3). The present value as of December 31, 2001, of these sale and
leaseback operating lease commitments,

net of trust investments, total 1.5 billion. CEI and TE sell substantially all
of their retail customer receivables, which provided 200 million of off balance
sheet financing as of December 31, 2001 (see Note 1 - Revenues).

 FirstEnergy's sale of the former GPU subsidiary, GasNet, in December
2001, eliminated 290 million of debt and also provided 125 million of net cash
proceeds, which were used to reduce short-term borrowings. Expected proceeds
from the pending sales of four fossil plants and Avon Energy Partners Holdings,
a wholly owned subsidiary, are shown in the following table:

FirstEnergy continues to pursue divestiture of the remainder of its
international operations (see Outlook - Optimizing the Use of Assets).

Market Risk Information

 We use various market risk sensitive instruments, including derivative
contracts, primarily to manage the risk of price, interest rate and foreign
currency fluctuations. Our Risk Policy Committee, comprised of executive
officers, exercises an independent risk oversight function to ensure compliance
with corporate risk management policies and prudent risk management practices.

Commodity Price Risk

 We are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in
electricity, natural gas and coal prices. To manage the volatility relating to
these exposures, we use a variety of non-derivative and derivative instruments,
including forward contracts, options, futures contracts and swaps. The
derivatives are used principally for hedging purposes and, to a much lesser
extent, for trading purposes. The change in the fair value of commodity
derivative contracts related to energy production during 2001 is summarized in
the following table:

 Increase (Decrease)in the Fair Value of Commodity Derivative Contracts

 ======================================================================

 Does not include 11.6 million of derivative contract fair
 value increase, as of December 31, 2001, representing our
 50 share of Great Lakes Energy Partners, LLC

While the valuation of derivative contracts is always based on active
market prices when they are available, longer-term contracts can require the use
of model-based estimates of prices in later years due to the absence of
published market prices. We currently use modeled prices for the later years of
some electric contracts. Our model incorporates explicit assumptions regarding
future supply and demand and fuel prices. The model provides estimates of the
future prices for electricity and an estimate of price volatility. We make use
of these results in developing estimates of fair value for the later years of
those electric contracts for financial reporting purposes as well as for
internal management decision making. Sources of information for the valuation of
derivative contracts by year are summarized in the following table:

Source of Information - Fair Value by Contract Year
 2002 2003 2004 Thereafter Total
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prices actively quoted... (54.1) (19.9) (3.2) -- (77.2)

 --------------------------------------------------

 Total................. (54.1) (19.9) (11.3) 18.9 (66.4)
=============================================================================

We perform sensitivity analyses to estimate our exposure to the market
risk of our commodity position. A hypothetical 10 adverse shift in quoted
market prices in the near term on both our trading and nontrading derivative
instruments would not have had a material effect on our consolidated financial
position or cash flows as of December 31, 2001. We estimate that if energy
commodity prices move on average 10 percent higher or lower, pretax income for
the next twelve months would increase or decrease, respectively, by
approximately 2.4 million.

Interest Rate Risk

 Our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is reduced since
a significant portion of our debt has fixed interest rates, as noted in the
table on the following page. We are subject to the inherent interest rate risks
related to refinancing maturing debt by issuing new debt securities. As
discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, our investments in
capital trusts effectively reduce future lease obligations, also reducing
interest rate risk. Changes in the market value of our nuclear decommissioning
trust funds are recognized by making corresponding changes to the
decommissioning liability, as described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

 Penelec, GPU Power through a subsidiary and GPU Electric, Inc.
(through GPU Power UK) use interest rate swap agreements, denominated in dollars
and sterling, to manage the risk of increases in variable interest rates. All of
the agreements convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. As of December 31,
2001, interest rate swaps denominated in dollars had a weighted average fixed
interest rate of 6.99 ; those in sterling had a weighted average fixed interest
rate of 6.00 . The following summarizes the principal characteristics of the
swap agreements in effect as of December 31, 2001:

 ------------------------------------------------------------------

Foreign Currency Swap Agreements

 GPU Electric uses currency swap agreements to manage currency risk
caused by fluctuations in the US dollar exchange rate related to bonds issued in
the US by Avon Energy, which owns GPU Power UK. These swap agreements convert
principal and interest payments on this US dollar debt to fixed sterling
principal and interest payments, and expire on the maturity dates of the bonds.
Interest expense is recorded based on the fixed sterling interest rate.

Outlook

 We continue to pursue our goal of being the leading regional supplier
of energy and related services in the northeastern quadrant of the United
States, where we see the best opportunities for growth. We intend to provide
competitively priced, high-quality products and value-added services - energy
sales and services, energy delivery, power supply and supplemental services
related to our core business. As our industry changes to a more competitive
environment, we have taken and expect to take actions designed to create a
larger, stronger regional enterprise that will be positioned to compete in the
changing energy marketplace.

Business Organization

 Beginning in 2001, Ohio utilities that offered both competitive and
regulated retail electric services were required to implement a corporate
separation plan approved by the PUCO - one which provided a clear separation
between regulated and competitive operations. Our business is separated into
three distinct units - a competitive services unit, a regulated services unit
and a corporate support unit. FES provides competitive retail energy services
while the EUOC continue to provide regulated transmission and distribution
services. FirstEnergy Generation Corp. (FGCO), a wholly owned subsidiary of FES,
leases fossil and hydroelectric plants from the EUOC and operates those plants.
We expect the transfer of ownership of EUOC generating assets to FGCO will be
substantially completed by the end of the market development period in 2005. All
of the EUOC power supply requirements for the Ohio Companies and Penn are
provided by FES to satisfy their "provider of last resort" (PLR) obligations, as
well as grandfathered wholesale contracts.

Optimizing the Use of Assets

 A significant step toward being the leading regional supplier in our
target market was achieved when we merged with GPU in November, making us the
fourth largest investor-owned electric system in the nation based on the number
of customers served. Through the merger we can create a stronger enterprise with
greater resources and more opportunities to provide value to our customers,
shareholders and employees. However, additional steps must be taken in order to
deliver the full value of the merger. While GPU's former domestic electric
utility companies fit well with our regional market focus, GPU's former
international companies do not. In December 2001, we divested GasNet, an
Australian gas transmission company. Also, the sale of most of our interest in
Avon Energy - the holding company for Midlands Electricity plc - to Aquila, Inc.
(formerly UtiliCorp United) is pending. The transaction must be completed by
April 26, 2002, or either party may terminate the original agreement. On March
18, 2002, we announced that we finalized terms of the agreement under which
Aquila will acquire a 79.9 percent interest in Avon for approximately 1.9
billion (including the transfer of 1.7 billion of debt). We and Aquila together
will own all of the outstanding shares of Avon through a jointly owned
subsidiary, with each company having a 50-percent voting interest. GPU's other
foreign companies (excluding GPU Power) are held for sale including our
investment in Empresa Distribuidora Electrica Regional S.A. The pending
divestitures should increase our financial flexibility by reducing debt and
preferred stock, and aid us in providing more competitively priced products and
services.

 On November 29, 2001, we announced an agreement to sell four of our
older coal-fired power plants located along Lake Erie in Ohio to NRG Energy,
Inc. Under the agreement, the Ashtabula, Bay Shore, Eastlake and Lake Shore
generating plants with a total net generating capacity of 2,535 MW will be sold.
The transaction includes our purchase of up to 10.5 billion kilowatt-hours of
electricity annually, similar to the average annual output of the plants,
through 2005 (the end of the market development period under Ohio's Electric
Choice Law). The transaction is subject to the receipt of

necessary regulatory approvals. This transaction is consistent with our strategy
of aggressively pursuing cost savings to maintain competitively priced products
and services. The sale will allow us to more closely match our generating
capabilities to the load profiles of our customers, resulting in more efficient
operation of our remaining generating units. It also enables us to concentrate
on our coal-fired generation along the Ohio River, which should contribute to
added supply efficiencies. The net, after-tax gain from the sale, based on the
difference between the sale price of the plants and their market price used in
our Ohio restructuring transition plan, will be credited to customers by
reducing the transition cost recovery period. We expect to use the net proceeds
from the sale for the redemption of high cost debt and preferred stock or to
reduce other outstanding obligations to provide additional cost savings.

State Regulatory Matters

 As of January 1, 2001, customers in all of our service areas, covering
portions of Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, could select alternative energy
suppliers. Our EUOC continue to deliver power to homes and businesses through
their existing distribution systems, which remain regulated. Customer rates have
been restructured into separate components to support customer choice. In each
of the states, we have a continuing responsibility to provide power to those
customers not choosing to receive power from an alternative energy supplier,
subject to certain limits. However, despite similarities, the specific approach
taken by each state and for each of our regulated companies varies.

 Regulatory assets are costs which the respective regulatory agencies
have authorized for recovery from customers in future periods and, without such
authorization, would have been charged to income when incurred. The increase in
those assets in 2001 is primarily the result of the acquisition of the former
GPU companies. All of the regulatory assets are expected to continue to be
recovered under the provisions of the respective transition and regulatory plans
as discussed below. The regulatory assets of the individual companies are as
follows:

Ohio -

 Beginning on January 1, 2001, Ohio customers were able to choose their
electricity suppliers. Customer rates of OE, CEI and TE were restructured to
establish separate charges for transmission and distribution, transition cost
recovery and a generation-related component. When one of our Ohio customers
elects to obtain power from an alternative supplier, the regulated utility
company reduces the customer's bill with a "generation shopping credit," based
on the regulated generation component plus an incentive, and the customer
receives a generation charge from the alternative supplier. Our Ohio EUOC have
continuing responsibility to provide energy to service-area customers as PLR
through December 31, 2005.

 The transition cost portion of rates provides for recovery of certain
amounts not otherwise recoverable in a competitive generation market (such as
regulatory assets). Transition costs are paid by all customers whether or not
they choose an alternative supplier. Under the PUCO-approved transition plan, we
assumed the risk of not recovering up to 500 million of transition revenue if
the rate of customers (excluding contracts and full-service accounts) switching
their service from OE, CEI and TE does not reach 20 for any consecutive
twelve-month period by December 31, 2005 - the end of the market development
period. As of December 31, 2001, the customer switching rate, on an annualized
basis, implies that our risk of not recovering transition revenue has been
reduced to approximately 174 million. We are also committed under the
transition agreement to make available 1,120 MW of our generating capacity to
marketers, brokers, and aggregators at set prices, to be used for sales only to
retail customers in our Ohio service areas. Through December 31, 2001,
approximately 1,032 MW of the 1,120 MW supply commitment had been secured by
alternative suppliers. We began accepting customer applications for switching to
alternative suppliers on December 8, 2000; as of December 31, 2001 our Ohio EUOC
had been notified that over 600,000 of their customers requested generation
services from other authorized suppliers, including FES, a wholly owned
subsidiary.

Pennsylvania -

 Choice of energy suppliers by Pennsylvania customers was phased in
starting in 1999 and was completed by January 1, 2001. The Pennsylvania Public
Utility Commission (PPUC) authorized rate restructuring plans for Penn, Met-Ed
and Penelec, establishing separate charges for transmission, distribution,
generation and stranded cost recovery, which is recovered through a "competitive
transition charge" (CTC). Pennsylvania customers electing to obtain power from
an alternative supplier have their bills reduced based on the regulated
generation component, and the customers receive a generation charge from the
alternative supplier.

 In June 2001, Met-Ed, Penelec and FirstEnergy entered into a
settlement agreement with major parties in the combined merger and rate
proceedings that, in addition to resolving certain issues concerning the PPUC's
approval of the GPU merger, also addressed Met-Ed's and Penelec's request for
PLR rate relief. Met-Ed and Penelec are permitted to defer, for future recovery,
the difference between their actual energy costs and those reflected in their
capped generation rates. Those costs will continue to be deferred through
December 31, 2005. If energy costs incurred by Met-Ed and Penelec during that
period are below their respective capped generation rates, the difference would
be used to reduce their recoverable deferred costs. Met-Ed's and Penelec's PLR
obligations were extended through December 31, 2010. Met-Ed's and Penelec's CTC
revenues will be applied first to PLR costs, then to stranded costs other than
for non-utility generation (NUG) and finally to NUG stranded costs through
December 31, 2010. Met-Ed and Penelec would be permitted to recover any
remaining stranded costs through a continuation of the CTC, after December 31,
2010, however, such recovery would extend to no later than December 31, 2015.
Any amounts not expected to be recovered by December 31, 2015 would be written
off at the time such nonrecovery becomes probable. Several parties had appealed
this PPUC decision to the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. On February 21,
2002, the Court affirmed the PPUC decision regarding approval of the GPU merger,
remanding the decision to the PPUC only with respect to the issue of merger
savings. The Court reversed the PPUC's decision regarding the PLR obligations of
Met-Ed and Penelec, and denied the related requests for rate relief by Met-Ed
and Penelec. We are considering our response to the Court's decision, which
could include asking the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to review the decision. We
are unable to predict the outcome of these matters.

New Jersey -

 Customers of JCP&L were able to choose among alternative energy
suppliers beginning in late 1999. To support customer choice, rates were
restructured into unbundled service charges and additional non-bypassable
charges to recover stranded costs (confirmed by a NJBPU Final Decision and Order
issued in March 2001). JCP&L has a PLR obligation, referred to as Basic
Generation Service (BGS), until July 31, 2002. For the period from August 1,
2002 to July 31, 2003, the NJBPU has authorized the auctioning of BGS to meet
the electric demands of customers who have not selected an alternative supplier.
The auction was successfully concluded on February 13, 2002, thereby eliminating
JCP&L's obligation to provide for the energy requirements of BGS during that
period. Beginning August 1, 2003, the approach to be taken in procuring the
energy needs for BGS has not been determined. The NJBPU recently initiated a
formal proceeding to decide how BGS will be handled after the transition period.
JCP&L is permitted to defer, for future recovery, the amount by which its
reasonable and prudently incurred costs for providing BGS to non-shopping
customers and costs incurred under NUG agreements exceed amounts currently
reflected in its BGS rate and market transition charge rate (for the recovery of
stranded costs).

 On September 26, 2001, the NJBPU approved the GPU merger subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in a settlement agreement with major
intervenors. As part of the settlement, we agreed to reduce JCP&L's costs
deferred for future recovery by 300 million, in order to ensure that customers
receive the benefit of future merger savings. JCP&L wrote off 300 million of
its deferred costs in October 2001 upon receipt of the final regulatory approval
for the merger, which occurred on October 29, 2001.

 On February 6, 2002, JCP&L received a Financing Order from the NJBPU
with authorization to issue 320 million of transition bonds to securitize the
recovery of bondable stranded costs associated with the previously divested
Oyster Creek nuclear generating station. The Order grants JCP&L the right to
charge a usage-based, non-bypassable transition bond charge (TBC) and provide
for the transfer of the bondable transition property relating to the TBC to
JCP&L Transition Funding LLC (Transition Funding), a wholly owned limited
liability corporation. Transition Funding is expected to issue and sell up to
 320 million of transition bonds that will be recognized on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet in the second quarter of 2002, with the TBC providing recovery of
principal, interest and related fees on the transition bonds.

FERC Regulatory Matters

 On December 19, 2001, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
issued an order in which it stated that the Alliance Regional Transmission
Organization (Alliance TransCo) did not meet agency requirements to operate the
Alliance TransCo as an approved Regional Transmission Organization (RTO). It
further concluded that National Grid could be the independent Managing Member of
the Alliance TransCo. FERC ordered the Alliance TransCo and National Grid to
refile their business plan to consider operating as an independent transmission
company within the

Midwest ISO or another RTO. The order gave the Alliance TransCo 60 days to file
a status report. On January 22, 2002, the Alliance TransCo companies filed a
series of rehearing applications with FERC.

Supply Plan

 As part of the Restructuring Orders for the States of Ohio,
Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, the FirstEnergy companies are obligated to supply
electricity to customers who do not choose an alternate supplier. The total
forecasted peak of this obligation in 2002 is 20,300 MW (10,100 MW in Ohio,
5,400 MW in New Jersey, and 4,800 MW in Pennsylvania). The successful BGS
auction in New Jersey removed JCP&L's BGS obligation for 5,100 MW for the period
from August 1, 2002 to July 31, 2003. In that auction FES was a successful
bidder to provide 1,700 MW during the same period to JCP&L and two other
electric utilities in New Jersey. Our current supply portfolio contains 13,283
MW of owned generation and approximately 1,600 MW of long-term purchases from
non-utility generators. The remaining obligation is expected to be met through a
mix of multi-year forward purchases, short-term forward (less than one year)
purchases and spot market purchases.

 The announced sale of four fossil generating plants expected to close
in mid-2002, will have little impact on our supply plan. As part of the asset
sale, FirstEnergy has a power purchase agreement under which the purchaser will
provide a similar amount of electricity as was expected before the sale. This
power purchase agreement runs from the close of the sale transaction, through
December 31, 2005, which is the end of the market development period for the
Ohio operating companies.

 Unregulated retail sales are generally short-term arrangements (less
than 18 months) at prevailing market prices. They are primarily hedged through
short-term purchased power contracts, supplemented by any of our excess
generation when available and economical.

Environmental Matters

 We are in compliance with the current sulfur dioxide (SO2) and
nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990. In 1998, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized
regulations requiring additional NOx reductions in the future from our Ohio and
Pennsylvania facilities. Various regulatory and judicial actions have since
sought to further define NOx reduction requirements (see Note 6 - Environmental
Matters). We continue to evaluate our compliance plans and other compliance
options.

 Violations of federally approved SO2 regulations can result in
shutdown of the generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of
up to 27,500 for each day a unit is in violation. The EPA has an interim
enforcement policy for SO2 regulations in Ohio that allows for compliance based
on a 30-day averaging period. We cannot predict what action the EPA may take in
the future with respect to the interim enforcement policy.

 In 1999 and 2000, the EPA issued Notices of Violation (NOV) or a
Compliance Order to nine utilities covering 44 power plants, including the W.H.
Sammis Plant. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice filed eight civil
complaints against various investor-owned utilities, which included a complaint
against OE and Penn. The NOV and complaint allege violations of the Clean Air
Act (CAA). The civil complaint against OE and Penn requests installation of
"best available control technology" as well as civil penalties of up to 27,500
per day. Although unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings, we believe
the Sammis Plant is in full compliance with the CAA and that the NOV and
complaint are without merit. Penalties could be imposed if the Sammis Plant
continues to operate without correcting the alleged violations and a court
determines that the allegations are valid. The Sammis Plant continues to operate
while these proceedings are pending.

 In December 2000, the EPA announced it would proceed with the
development of regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants from electric
power plants. The EPA identified mercury as the hazardous air pollutant of
greatest concern. The EPA established a schedule to propose regulations by
December 2003 and issue final regulations by December 2004. The future cost of
compliance with these regulations may be substantial.

 As a result of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as
amended, and the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state
hazardous waste regulations have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel
combustion waste products, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste
disposal requirements pending the EPA's evaluation of the need for future
regulation. The EPA has issued its final regulatory determination that
regulation of coal ash as a hazardous waste is unnecessary. In April 2000, the
EPA announced that it will develop national standards regulating disposal of
coal ash under its authority to regulate nonhazardous waste.

 Various environmental liabilities have been recognized on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2001, based on estimates of the
total costs of cleanup, the Companies' proportionate responsibility for such
costs and the financial ability of other nonaffiliated entities to pay. The
Companies have been named as "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste
disposal sites which may require cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of disposal of
hazardous substances at historical sites

and the liability involved, are often unsubstantiated and subject to dispute.
Federal law provides that all PRPs for a particular site be held liable on a
joint and several basis. In addition, JCP&L has accrued liabilities for
environmental remediation of former manufactured gas plants in New Jersey; those
costs are being recovered by JCP&L through a non-bypassable societal benefits
charge. The Companies have total accrued liabilities aggregating approximately
 60 million as of December 31, 2001. We do not believe environmental remediation
costs will have a material adverse effect on financial condition, cash flows or
results of operations.

Legal Matters

 Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to FirstEnergy's
normal business operations are pending against FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries.
The most significant are described below.

 Due to our merger with GPU, we own Unit 2 of the Three Mile Island
(TMI-2) Nuclear Plant. As a result of the 1979 TMI-2 accident, claims for
alleged personal injury against JCP&L, Met-Ed, Penelec and GPU were filed in the
U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. In 1996, the
District Court granted a motion for summary judgment filed by the GPU companies
and dismissed the ten initial "test cases" which had been selected for a test
case trial, as well as all of the remaining 2,100 pending claims. In November
1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the District
Court's dismissal of the ten test cases, but set aside the dismissal of the
additional pending claims, remanding them to the District Court for further
proceedings. Following the resolution of judicial proceedings dealing with
admissible evidence, we have again requested summary judgment of the remaining
2,100 claims in the District Court. On January 15, 2002, the District Court
granted our motion. On February 14, 2002, the plaintiffs filed a notice of
appeal of this decision (see Note 6 - Other Legal Proceedings). Although unable
to predict the outcome of this litigation, we believe that any liability to
which we might be subject by reason of the TMI-2 accident will not exceed our
financial protection under the Price-Anderson Act.

 In July 1999, the Mid-Atlantic states experienced a severe heat storm
which resulted in power outages throughout the service areas of many electric
utilities, including JCP&L. In an investigation into the causes of the outages
and the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of all four New
Jersey electric utilities, the NJBPU concluded that there was not a prima facie
case demonstrating that, overall, JCP&L provided unsafe, inadequate or improper
service to its customers. Two class action lawsuits (subsequently consolidated
into a single proceeding) were filed in New Jersey Superior Court in July 1999
against JCP&L, GPU and other GPU companies seeking compensatory and punitive
damages arising from the service interruptions of July 1999 in the JCP&L
territory. In May 2001, the court denied without prejudice the defendant's
motion seeking decertification of the class. Discovery continues in the class
action, but no trial date has been set. The judge has set a schedule under which
factual legal discovery would conclude in March 2002, and expert reports would
be exchanged by June 2002. In October 2001, the court held argument on the
plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment, which contends that JCP&L is
bound to several findings of the NJBPU investigation. The plaintiffs' motion was
denied by the Court in November 2001 and the plaintiffs' motion seeking
permission to file an appeal on this denial of their motion was rejected by the
New Jersey Appellate Division. We have also filed a motion for partial summary
judgment that is currently pending before the Superior Court. We are unable to
predict the outcome of these matters.

Other Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies

 GPU had made significant investments in foreign businesses and
facilities through its GPU Electric and GPU Power subsidiaries. Although we will
attempt to mitigate our risks related to foreign investments, we face additional
risks inherent in operating in such locations, including foreign currency
fluctuations.

 GPU Electric, through its subsidiary, Midlands, has a 40 equity
interest in a 586 MW power project in Pakistan (the Uch Power Project), which
commenced commercial operations in October 2000. GPU Electric's investment in
this project as of December 31, 2001 was approximately 38 million, plus a
guaranty letter of credit of 3.6 million, and its share of the projected
completion costs represents an additional 4.8 million commitment. Cinergy (the
former owner of 50 of Midlands Electricity plc) agreed to fund up to an
aggregate of 20 million of the required capital contributions and has
reimbursed GPU Electric 4.9 million through December 31, 2001, leaving a
remaining commitment for future cash losses of up to 15.1 million. Midlands
also has a 31 equity interest in a 478 MW power project in Turkey (the Trakya
Power Project). Trakya is presently engaged in a foreign currency conversion
issue with TETTAS (the state owned electricity purchaser). Midlands established
a 16.5 million reserve for non-recovery relating to that issue as of December
31, 2001. These commitments and contingencies associated with Midlands will
transfer to the new partnership upon completion of the sale discussed in Note 2
- - Merger, and we will be responsible for our lower proportionate interest.

 El Barranquilla, a wholly owned subsidiary of GPU Power, is an equity
investor in Termobarranquilla S.A., Empresa de Servicios Publicos (TEBSA), which
owns a Colombian independent power generation project. As of December 31, 2001,
GPU Power had an investment of approximately 109.4 million in TEBSA and is
committed, under certain circumstances, to make additional standby equity
contributions of 21.3 million, which we have guaranteed. The total outstanding
senior debt of the TEBSA project is 315 million at December 31, 2001. The
lenders include the

Overseas Private Investment Corporation, US Export Import Bank and a commercial
bank syndicate. GPU had guaranteed the obligations of the operators of the TEBSA
project, up to a maximum of 5.8 million (subject to escalation) under the
project's operations and maintenance agreement.

 GPU believed that various events of default have occurred under the
loan agreements relating to the TEBSA project. In addition, questions have been
raised as to the accuracy and completeness of information provided to various
parties to the project in connection with the project's formation. We continue
to discuss these issues and related matters with the project lenders, CORELCA
(the government owned Colombian electric utility with an ownership interest in
the project) and the Government of Colombia.

 Moreover, in September 2001, the DIAN (the Colombian national tax
authority) had presented TEBSA with a statement of charges alleging that certain
lease payments made under the Lease Agreement with Los Amigos Leasing Company
(an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GPU Power) violated Colombian foreign
exchange regulations and were, therefore, subject to substantial penalties. The
DIAN has calculated a statutory penalty amounting to approximately 200 million
and gave TEBSA two months to respond to the statement of charges. In November
2001, TEBSA filed a formal response to this statement of charges. TEBSA is
continuing to review the DIAN's position and has been advised by its Colombian
counsel that the DIAN's position is without substantial legal merit. We are
unable to predict the outcome of these matters.
Significant Accounting Policies

 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Application of
these principles often require a high degree of judgment, estimates and
assumptions that affect our financial results. All of our assets are subject to
their own specific risks and uncertainties and are continually reviewed for
impairment. Assets related to the application of the policies discussed below
are similarly reviewed with their risks and uncertainties reflecting these
specific factors. Our more significant accounting policies are described below:

Purchase Accounting - Acquisition of GPU

 Purchase accounting requires judgment regarding the allocation of the
purchase price based on the fair values of the assets acquired (including
intangible assets) and the liabilities assumed. The fair values of the acquired
assets and assumed liabilities for GPU were based primarily on estimates. The
more significant of these included the estimation of the fair value of the
international operations, certain domestic operations and the fair value of the
pension and other postretirement benefit assets and liabilities. The preliminary
purchase price allocations for the GPU acquisition are subject to adjustment in
2002 when finalized. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair
values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as
goodwill, which will be reviewed for impairment at least annually. As of
December 31, 2001, we had 5.6 billion of goodwill (excluding the goodwill in
"Assets Pending Sale" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) that primarily relates
to our regulated services segment.

Regulatory Accounting

 Our regulated services segment is subject to regulation that sets the
prices (rates) we are permitted to charge our customers based on our costs that
the regulatory agencies determine we are permitted to recover. At times,
regulators permit the future recovery through rates of costs that would be
currently charged to expense by an unregulated company. This rate-making process
results in the recording of regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash
inflows. As a result of the changing regulatory framework in each state in which
we operate, a significant amount of regulatory assets have been recorded. As of
December 31, 2001, we had regulatory assets of 8.9 billion. We continually
review these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved
regulatory guidelines. Impairment risk associated with these assets relates to
potentially adverse legislative, judicial or regulatory actions in the future.
As disclosed in Note 1 - Regulatory Plans, the full recovery of transition costs
for the Ohio EUOC is dependent on achieving 20 customer shopping levels in any
twelve-month period by December 31, 2005.

Derivative Accounting

 Determination of appropriate accounting for derivative transactions
requires the involvement of management representing operations, finance and risk
assessment. In order to determine the appropriate accounting for derivative
transactions, the provisions of the contract need to be carefully assessed in
accordance with the authoritative accounting literature and management's
intended use of the derivative. New authoritative guidance continues to shape
the application of derivative accounting. Management's expectations and
intentions are key factors in determining the appropriate accounting for a
derivative transaction and, as a result, such expectations and intentions must
be documented. Derivative contracts that are determined to fall within the scope
of SFAS 133, as amended, must be recorded at their fair value. Active market
prices are not always available to determine the fair value of the later years
of a contract, requiring that various assumptions and estimates be used in the
valuation. We continually monitor our

derivative contracts to determine if our activities, expectations, intentions,
assumptions and estimates remain valid. As part of our normal operations we
enter into significant commodities contracts, which increase the impact of
derivative accounting judgments.

Revenue Recognition

 We follow the accrual method of accounting for revenues, recognizing
revenue for kilowatt-hour sales that have been delivered but not yet been billed
through the end of the year. The determination of unbilled revenues requires
management to make various estimated including:

 o Net energy generated or purchased for retail load
 o Losses of energy over distribution lines
 o Mix of kilowatt-hour usage by residential, commercial and
 industrial customers
 o Kilowatt-hour usage of customers receiving electricity from
 alternative suppliers

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approved SFAS 141,
"Business Combinations" and SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," on
June 29, 2001. SFAS 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June
30, 2001, to be accounted for using purchase accounting. The provisions of the
new standard relating to the determination of goodwill and other intangible
assets have been applied to the GPU merger, which was accounted for as a
purchase transaction, and have not materially affected the accounting for this
transaction. Under SFAS 142, amortization of existing goodwill will cease
January 1, 2002. Instead, goodwill will be tested for impairment at least on an
annual basis, and no impairment of goodwill is anticipated as a result of a
preliminary analysis. Prior to the GPU merger, FirstEnergy amortized about 57
million .25 per share of common stock) of goodwill annually. There was no
goodwill amortization in 2001 associated with the GPU merger under the
provisions of the new standard.

 In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations." The new statement provides accounting standards for
retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets, with adoption
required by January 1, 2003. SFAS 143 requires that the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which
it is incurred. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of
the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. Over time the capitalized costs are
depreciated and the present value of the asset retirement liability increases,
resulting in a period expense. Upon retirement, a gain or loss will be recorded
if the cost to settle the retirement obligation differs from the carrying
amount. We are currently assessing the new standard and have not yet determined
the impact on our financial statements.

 In September 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of." The Statement also supersedes the accounting and reporting
provisions of APB 30. Our adoption of this Statement, effective January 1, 2002,
will result in our accounting for any future impairments or disposals of
long-lived assets under the provisions of SFAS 144, but will not change the
accounting principles used in previous asset impairments or disposals.
Application of SFAS 144 is not anticipated to have a major impact on accounting
for impairments or disposal transactions compared to the prior application of
SFAS 121 or APB 30.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

 The consolidated financial statements include FirstEnergy Corp., a
public utility holding company, and its principal electric utility operating
subsidiaries, Ohio Edison Company (OE), The Cleveland Electric Illuminating
Company (CEI), Pennsylvania Power Company (Penn), The Toledo Edison Company
(TE), American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI), Jersey Central Power & Light
Company (JCP&L), Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed) and Pennsylvania Electric
Company (Penelec). These utility subsidiaries are referred to throughout as
"Companies." FirstEnergy's 2001 results include the results of JCP&L, Met-Ed and
Penelec for the period November 7, 2001 through December 31, 2001 (see Note 2 -
Merger).The consolidated financial statements also include FirstEnergy's other
principal subsidiaries: FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. (FES); FirstEnergy
Facilities Services Group, LLC (FEFSG); MYR Group, Inc. (MYR); MARBEL Energy
Corporation (MARBEL); FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC); GPU
Capital, Inc.; GPU Power, Inc.; FirstEnergy Service Company (FECO); and GPU
Service, Inc. (GPUS). FES provides energy-related products and services and,
through its FirstEnergy Generation Corp. (FGCO) subsidiary, operates
FirstEnergy's nonnuclear generation business. FENOC operates the Companies'
nuclear generating facilities. FEFSG is the parent company of several heating,
ventilating, air conditioning and energy management companies, and MYR is a
utility infrastructure construction service company. MARBEL is a fully
integrated natural gas company. GPU Capital owns and operates electric
distribution systems in foreign countries (see Note 2 - Merger) and GPU Power
owns and operates generation facilities in foreign countries. FECO and GPUS
provide legal, financial and other corporate support services to affiliated
FirstEnergy companies. Significant intercompany transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

 The Companies follow the accounting policies and practices prescribed
by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), the Pennsylvania Public
Utility Commission (PPUC), the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) and
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States (GAAP) requires management to make periodic estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results
could differ from these estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

 REVENUES-

 The Companies' principal business is providing electric service to
customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Companies' retail customers
are metered on a cycle basis. Revenue is recognized for unbilled electric
service provided through the end of the year.

 Receivables from customers include sales to residential, commercial
and industrial customers and sales to wholesale customers. There was no material
concentration of receivables as of December 31, 2001 or 2000, with respect to
any particular segment of FirstEnergy's customers.

 CEI and TE sell substantially all of their retail customer receivables
to Centerior Funding Corp. (CFC), a wholly owned subsidiary of CEI. CFC
subsequently transfers the receivables to a trust under an asset-backed
securitization agreement. The trust completed private sales of 50 million and
 150 million of receivables-backed investor certificates in 2000 and 2001,
respectively, in transactions that qualified for sale accounting treatment.
CFC's creditors are entitled to be satisfied first out of the proceeds of CFC's
assets. The 2001 private sale was used to repay a 1996 public sale of 150
million of receivables-backed investor certificates which was replaced under an
amended securitization agreement. FirstEnergy's retained interest in the pool of
receivables held by the trust (34 as of December 31, 2001) is stated at fair
value, reflecting adjustments for anticipated credit losses. Sensitivity
analyses reflecting a 10 and 20 increase in the rate of anticipated credit
losses did not significantly affect FirstEnergy's retained interest in the pool
of receivables. Of the 301 million sold to the trust and outstanding as of
December 31, 2001, FirstEnergy had a retained interest in 101 million of the
receivables. Accordingly, receivables recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets were reduced by approximately 200 million due to these sales.
Collections of receivables previously transferred to the trust and used for the
purchase of new receivables from CFC during 2001, totaled approximately 2.2
billion. CEI and TE processed receivables for the trust and received servicing
fees of approximately 4.5 million in 2001. Expenses associated with the
factoring discount related to the sale of receivables were 12 million in 2001.

 REGULATORY PLANS-

 Ohio's 1999 electric utility restructuring law allowed Ohio electric
customers to select their generation suppliers beginning January 1, 2001,
provided for a five percent reduction on the generation portion of residential
customers' bills and the opportunity for utilities to recover transition costs,
including regulatory assets. Under this law, the PUCO approved FirstEnergy's
transition plan in 2000 as modified by a settlement agreement with major parties
to the transition plan, which it filed on behalf of OE, CEI and TE (Ohio
Companies). The settlement agreement included

approval for recovery of the amounts of transition costs filed in the transition
plan through no later than 2006 for OE, mid-2007 for TE and 2008 for CEI, except
where a longer period of recovery is provided for in the settlement agreement.
The settlement also granted preferred access over FirstEnergy's subsidiaries to
nonaffiliated marketers, brokers and aggregators to 1,120 megawatts (MW) of
generation capacity through 2005 at established prices for sales to the Ohio
Companies' retail customers. The Ohio Companies' base electric rates for
distribution service under their prior respective regulatory plans were extended
from December 31, 2005 through December 31, 2007. The transition rate credits
for customers under their prior regulatory plans were also extended through the
Ohio Companies' respective transition cost recovery periods.

 The transition plan itemized, or unbundled, the current price of
electricity into its component elements -- including generation, transmission,
distribution and transition charges. As required by the PUCO's rules,
FirstEnergy's transition plan also resulted in the corporate separation of its
regulated and unregulated operations, operational and technical support changes
needed to accommodate customer choice, an education program to inform customers
of their options under the law, and planned changes in how FirstEnergy's
transmission system will be operated to ensure access to all users. Customer
prices are frozen through a five-year market development period (2001-2005),
except for certain limited statutory exceptions including a 5 reduction in the
price of generation for residential customers.

 FirstEnergy's Ohio customers choosing alternative suppliers receive an
additional incentive applied to the shopping credit of 45 for residential
customers, 30 for commercial customers and 15 for industrial customers. The
amount of the incentive serves to reduce the amortization of transition costs
during the market development period and will be recovered through the extension
of the transition cost recovery periods. If the customer shopping goals
established in the agreement are not achieved by the end of 2005, the transition
cost recovery periods could be shortened for OE, CEI and TE to reduce recovery
by as much as 500 million (OE- 250 million, CEI- 170 million and TE- 80
million), but any such adjustment would be computed on a class-by-class and
pro-rata basis. Based on annualized shopping levels as of December 31, 2001,
FirstEnergy believes the maximum potential recovery reductions are approximately
 174 million (OE - 87 million, CEI - 52 million and TE - 35 million).

 New Jersey is also evolving to a competitive electric utility
marketplace. In March 2001, the NJBPU issued a Final Decision and Order (Final
Order) with respect to JCP&L's rate unbundling, stranded cost and restructuring
filings, which superseded its 1999 Summary Order. The Final Order confirms rate
reductions set forth in the Summary Order, which remain in effect at increasing
levels through July 2003 with rates after July 31, 2003 to be determined in a
rate case commencing in 2002. The Final Order also confirms the right of
customers to select their generation suppliers effective August 1, 1999, and
includes the deregulation of electric generation service costs. The Final Order
confirms the establishment of a non-bypassable societal benefits charge to
recover costs which include nuclear plant decommissioning and manufactured gas
plant remediation, as well as a non-bypassable market transition charge (MTC)
primarily to recover stranded costs; however, the NJBPU deferred making a final
determination of the net proceeds and stranded costs related to prior generating
asset divestitures until JCP&L's request for an Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
ruling regarding the treatment of associated federal income tax benefits is
acted upon. Should the IRS ruling support the return of the tax benefits to
ratepayers, JCP&L would need to record a corresponding charge to income of
approximately 25 million; there would be no effect to FirstEnergy's net income
as the contingency existed prior to the merger.

 JCP&L has an obligation to provide basic generation service (BGS),
that is, it must act as provider of last resort (PLR) to non-shopping customers
as a result of the NJBPU's restructuring plans. JCP&L obtains its supply of
electricity to meet its BGS obligation to non-shopping customers almost entirely
from contracted and open market purchases. JCP&L is permitted to defer for
future collection from customers the amounts by which its costs of supplying BGS
to non-shopping customers and costs incurred under nonutility generation (NUG)
agreements exceed amounts collected through BGS and MTC rates. As of December
31, 2001, the accumulated deferred cost balance totaled approximately 300
million, after giving effect to the reduction discussed below. The Final Order
provided for the ability to securitize stranded costs associated with the
divested Oyster Creek Nuclear Generation Station. In February 2002, JCP&L
received NJBPU authorization to issue 320 million of transition bonds to
securitize the recovery of these costs. The NJBPU order also provides for a
usage-based non-bypassable transition bond charge and for the transfer of the
bondable transition property to another entity. JCP&L plans to sell transition
bonds in the second quarter of 2002 which will be recognized on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The Final Order also allows for additional securitization of
JCP&L's deferred balance to the extent permitted by law upon application by
JCP&L and a determination by the NJBPU that the conditions of the New Jersey
restructuring legislation are met. There can be no assurance as to the extent,
if any, that the NJBPU will permit such securitization.

 The obligation to provide BGS to non-shopping customers was bid out
for the period commencing August 1, 2002. In June 2001, the four incumbent New
Jersey electric distribution companies, including JCP&L, filed a joint proposal
seeking NJBPU approval of a competitive bidding process to procure supply for
the provision of BGS for the period of August 1, 2002 through July 31, 2003. In
December 2001, the NJBPU authorized the auctioning of BGS to meet the electric
demands of all customers who have not selected an alternative supplier. BGS for
all four companies, for the period of August 1, 2002 to July 31, 2003, was
simultaneously put out for bid. The auction, which ended on

February 13, 2002 and was approved by the NJBPU on February 15, 2002, removed
JCP&L's BGS obligation of 5,100 MW for the period from August 1, 2002 to July
31, 2003. The auction represents a transitional mechanism and a different model
for the procurement of BGS commencing August 1, 2003 may be adopted.

On September 26, 2001, the NJBPU approved the merger between
FirstEnergy and GPU, Inc., (see Note 2 - Merger) subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in a Stipulation of Settlement which had been signed by the
major parties in the merger discussions. Under this Stipulation of Settlement,
FirstEnergy agreed to reduce JCP&L's regulatory assets by 300 million, in order
to ensure that customers receive the benefit of future merger savings. JCP&L
wrote off 300 million of its deferred costs upon receipt of the final
regulatory approval for the merger, which occurred on October 29, 2001.

 Pennsylvania enacted its electric utility competition law in 1996 with
the phase-in of customer choice for generation suppliers completed as of January
1, 2001. The PPUC authorized 1998 rate restructuring plans for Penn, Met-Ed and
Penelec which essentially resulted in the deregulation of their respective
generation businesses.

 In 2000, the PPUC disallowed a portion of the requested additional
stranded costs above those amounts granted in Met-Ed's and Penelec's 1998 rate
restructuring plan orders. The PPUC required Met-Ed and Penelec to seek an IRS
ruling regarding the return of certain unamortized investment tax credits and
excess deferred income tax benefits to ratepayers. Similar to JCP&L's situation,
if the IRS ruling ultimately supports returning these tax benefits to
ratepayers, Met-Ed and Penelec would then reduce stranded costs by approximately
 12 million and 25 million, respectively, plus interest and record a
corresponding charge to income. Similar to JCP&L, there would be no effect to
FirstEnergy's net income.

 As a result of their generating asset divestitures, Met-Ed and Penelec
obtain their supply of electricity to meet their PLR obligations almost entirely
from contracted and open market purchases. During 2000, their purchased power
costs substantially exceeded the amounts they could recover under their capped
generation rates which are in effect for varying periods, pursuant to their 1998
rate restructuring plans. In November 2000, Met-Ed and Penelec filed a petition
with the PPUC seeking permission to defer for future recovery their energy costs
in excess of amounts reflected in their capped generation rates. In January
2001, the PPUC consolidated this petition with the FirstEnergy/GPU merger
proceeding (see Note 2 - Merger) for consideration and resolution in accordance
with the merger procedural schedule.

 In June 2001, Met-Ed, Penelec and FirstEnergy entered into a
Settlement Stipulation with all of the major parties in the combined merger and
rate relief proceedings, that, in addition to resolving certain issues
concerning the PPUC's approval of the FirstEnergy/GPU merger, also addressed
Met-Ed's and Penelec's request for PLR rate relief. On June 20, 2001, the PPUC
entered orders approving the Settlement Stipulation, which approved the merger
and provided Met-Ed and Penelec PLR rate relief. Met-Ed and Penelec are
permitted to defer for future recovery the difference between their actual
energy costs and those reflected in their capped generation rates, retroactive
to January 1, 2001. Deferral accounting will continue for such cost differences
through December 31, 2005; should energy costs incurred by Met-Ed and Penelec
during that period be below their respective capped generation rates, the
difference would be used to reduce their recoverable deferred costs. Met-Ed's
and Penelec's PLR obligations have been extended through December 31, 2010.
Met-Ed's and Penelec's competitive transition charge (CTC) revenues will be
applied first to PLR costs, then to non-NUG stranded costs and finally to NUG
stranded costs through December 31, 2010. Met-Ed and Penelec would be permitted
to recover any remaining stranded costs through a continuation of the CTC, after
December 31, 2010, however, such recovery would extend to no later than December
31, 2015. Any amounts not expected to be recovered by December 31, 2015 would be
written off at the time such nonrecovery becomes probable.

 Several parties had filed Petitions for Review with the Commonwealth
Court of Pennsylvania regarding the PPUC's orders. On February 21, 2002, the
Court affirmed the PPUC decision regarding the FirstEnergy/GPU merger, remanding
the decision to the PPUC only with respect to the issue of merger savings. The
Court reversed the PPUC's decision regarding the PLR obligations of Met-Ed and
Penelec, and denied the related requests for rate relief by Met-Ed and Penelec.
FirstEnergy is considering its response to the Court's decision, which could
include asking the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to review the decision.
FirstEnergy is unable to predict the outcome of these matters.

 All of the Companies' regulatory assets are expected to continue to be
recovered under provisions of the Ohio transition plan and the respective
Pennsylvania and New Jersey regulatory plans. Under the previous regulatory
plan, the PUCO had authorized OE to recognize additional capital recovery
related to its generating assets (which was reflected as additional depreciation
expense) and additional amortization of regulatory assets during the prior
regulatory plan period of at least 2 billion, and the PPUC had authorized Penn
to accelerate at least 358 million, more than the amounts that would have been
recognized if the prior regulatory plans were not in effect. These additional
amounts were being recovered through rates. Under OE's prior regulatory plan,
which was terminated at the end of 2000, and Penn's rate restructuring plan,
OE's and Penn's cumulative additional capital recovery and regulatory asset
amortization amounted to 1.424 billion.

The application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS 71),
was discontinued in 1997 with respect to CEI's and TE's nuclear operations; in
1998 with respect to Penn's, Met-Ed's and Penelec's generation operations; in
1999 with respect to JCP&L's generation operations and in 2000 with respect to
OE's generation business and the nonnuclear generation businesses of CEI and TE.
JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec subsequently divested substantially all of their
generating assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued
interpretive guidance regarding asset impairment measurement, concluding that
any supplemental regulated cash flows such as a CTC should be excluded from the
cash flows of assets in a portion of the business not subject to regulatory
accounting practices. If those assets are impaired, a regulatory asset should be
established if the costs are recoverable through regulatory cash flows.
Consistent with the SEC guidance, 1.6 billion of impaired plant investments 1.2 billion, 304 million and 53 million for OE, CEI and TE, respectively)
were recognized as regulatory assets recoverable as transition costs through
future regulatory cash flows. The following summarizes net assets included in
property, plant and equipment relating to operations for which the application
of SFAS 71 was discontinued, compared with the respective company's total assets
as of December 31, 2001.

 Penn........ 88 960
 JCP&L....... 46 8,040
 Met-Ed...... 18 3,607
 --------------------------------------------------------

 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT-

 Property, plant and equipment reflects original cost (except for the
Ohio Companies' and Penn's nuclear generating units and the former GPU
companies' properties which were adjusted to fair value), including payroll and
related costs such as taxes, employee benefits, administrative and general
costs, and interest costs. In addition to FirstEnergy's wholly-owned facilities,
JCP&L holds a 50 ownership interest in Yards Creek Pumped Storage Facility --
its net book value was approximately 21.5 million as of December 31, 2001.
FirstEnergy also shares ownership interests in various foreign properties with
an aggregate net book value of 1.9 billion, representing the fair value of
FirstEnergy's interest.

 The Companies provide for depreciation on a straight-line basis at
various rates over the estimated lives of property included in plant in service.
The respective annual composite rates for the Companies' electric plant in 2001,
2000 and 1999 (post merger periods only for JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec) are shown
in the following table:

 Annual Composite
 Depreciation Rate
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 2001 2000 1999
 ---- ---- ----

 OE............... 2.7 2.8 3.0 
 CEI.............. 3.2 3.4 3.4
 TE............... 3.5 3.4 3.4
 Penn............. 2.9 2.6 2.5
 JCP&L............ 3.4
 Met-Ed........... 3.0
 Penelec.......... 2.9
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 Annual depreciation expense in 2001 included approximately 128.7
million for future decommissioning costs applicable to the Companies' ownership
and leasehold interests in five nuclear generating units, a demonstration
nuclear reactor owned by a wholly-owned subsidiary of JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec
and decommissioning liabilities for previously divested GPU nuclear generating
units. The 2001 amounts reflected increases of approximately 60 million from
implementing the Ohio utilities' transition plan in 2001. The Companies' share
of the future obligation to decommission these units is approximately 2.5
billion in current dollars and (using a 4.0 escalation rate) approximately 5.4
billion in future dollars. The estimated obligation and the escalation rate were
developed based on site specific studies. Decommissioning of the demonstration
nuclear reactor is expected to be completed in 2003; payments for
decommissioning of the nuclear generating units are expected to begin in 2014,
when actual decommissioning work is expected to begin. The Companies have
recovered approximately 568 million for decommissioning through their electric
rates from customers through December 31, 2001. The Companies have also
recognized an estimated liability of approximately 46.5 million related to
decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear enrichment facilities operated by
the United States Department of Energy (DOE), as required by the Energy Policy
Act of 1992.

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS
143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The new statement provides
accounting treatment for retirement obligations associated with tangible
long-lived assets with adoption required by January 1, 2003. SFAS 143 requires
the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recorded in
the period in which it is incurred. The associated asset retirement costs are
capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. Over time
the capitalized costs are depreciated and the present value of the asset
retirement liability increases, resulting in a period expense. Upon retirement,
a gain or loss will be recorded if the costs to settle the retirement obligation
differ from the carrying amount. Under the new standard, additional assets and
liabilities relating principally to nuclear decommissioning obligations will be
recorded, the pattern of expense recognition will change and income from the
external decommissioning trusts will be recorded as investment income.
FirstEnergy is currently assessing the new standard and has not yet quantified
the impact on its financial statements.

 NUCLEAR FUEL-

 Nuclear fuel is recorded at original cost, which includes material,
enrichment, fabrication and interest costs incurred prior to reactor load. The
Companies amortize the cost of nuclear fuel based on the rate of consumption.

 INCOME TAXES-

 Details of the total provision for income taxes are shown on the
Consolidated Statements of Taxes. Deferred income taxes result from timing
differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and accounting
purposes. Investment tax credits, which were deferred when utilized, are being
amortized over the recovery period of the related property. The liability method
is used to account for deferred income taxes. Deferred income tax liabilities
related to tax and accounting basis differences are recognized at the statutory
income tax rates in effect when the liabilities are expected to be paid.

 RETIREMENT BENEFITS-

 FirstEnergy's trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan
covers almost all full-time employees. Upon retirement, employees receive a
monthly pension based on length of service and compensation. On December 31,
2001, the GPU pension plans were merged with the FirstEnergy plan. FirstEnergy
uses the projected unit credit method for funding purposes and was not required
to make pension contributions during the three years ended December 31, 2001.
The assets of the pension plan consist primarily of common stocks, United States
government bonds and corporate bonds. The FirstEnergy and GPU postretirement
benefit plans are currently separately maintained; the information shown below
is aggregated as of December 31, 2001. Costs for the year 2001 include the
former GPU companies' pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the
period November 7, 2001 through December 31, 2001.

 FirstEnergy provides a minimum amount of noncontributory life
insurance to retired employees in addition to optional contributory insurance.
Health care benefits, which include certain employee deductibles and copayments,
are also available to retired employees, their dependents and, under certain
circumstances, their survivors. FirstEnergy pays insurance premiums to cover a
portion of these benefits in excess of set limits; all amounts up to the limits
are paid by FirstEnergy. FirstEnergy recognizes the expected cost of providing
other postretirement benefits to employees and their beneficiaries and covered
dependents from the time employees are hired until they become eligible to
receive those benefits.

 The following sets forth the funded status of the plans and amounts
recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31:

The composite health care trend rate assumption is approximately 10 
in 2002, 9 in 2003 and 8 in 2004, trending to 4 -6 in later years. Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported
for the health care plan. An increase in the health care trend rate assumption
by one percentage point would increase the total service and interest cost
components by 14.6 million and the postretirement benefit obligation by 151.2
million. A decrease in the same assumption by one percentage point would
decrease the total service and interest cost components by 12.7 million and the
postretirement benefit obligation by 131.3 million.

 SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOWS INFORMATION-

 All temporary cash investments purchased with an initial maturity of
three months or less are reported as cash equivalents on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at cost, which approximates their fair market value. Noncash
financing and investing activities included the 2001 FirstEnergy common stock
issuance of 2.6 billion for the GPU acquisition and capital lease transactions
amounting to 3.1 million, 89.3 million and 36.2 million for the years 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. Commercial paper transactions of OES Fuel,
Incorporated (a wholly owned subsidiary of OE) that have initial maturity
periods of three months or less are reported net within financing activities
under long-term debt and are reflected as currently payable long-term debt on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets in anticipation of the expiration of the related
long-term financing agreement in March 2002 (see Note 4G).

All borrowings with initial maturities of less than one year are
defined as financial instruments under GAAP and are reported on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at cost, which approximates their fair market value. The
following sets forth the approximate fair value and related carrying amounts of
all other long-term debt, preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption and
investments other than cash and cash equivalents as of December 31:

 Excluding approximately 1.75 billion of long-term in 2001 debt related to
 pending divestitures.

 The fair values of long-term debt and preferred stock reflect the
present value of the cash outflows relating to those securities based on the
current call price, the yield to maturity or the yield to call, as deemed
appropriate at the end of each respective year. The yields assumed were based on
securities with similar characteristics offered by corporations with credit
ratings similar to the Companies' ratings. Long-term debt and preferred stock
subject to mandatory redemption of the former GPU companies were recognized at
fair value in connection with the merger.

 The fair value of investments other than cash and cash equivalents
represent cost (which approximates fair value) or the present value of the cash
inflows based on the yield to maturity. The yields assumed were based on
financial instruments with similar characteristics and terms. Investments other
than cash and cash equivalents include decommissioning trust investments.
Unrealized gains and losses applicable to the decommissioning trusts have been
recognized in the trust investment with a corresponding change to the
decommissioning liability. The Companies have no securities held for trading
purposes.

 Effective December 31, 1998, FirstEnergy began accounting for its
commodity price derivatives, entered into specifically for trading purposes, on
a mark-to-market basis in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
Issue No. 98-10, "Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities,"
with gains and losses recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

 On January 1, 2001, FirstEnergy adopted SFAS 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as amended by SFAS 138,
"Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities --
an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133". The cumulative effect to January 1,
2001 was a charge of 8.5 million (net of 5.8 million of income taxes) or .03
per share of common stock. The reported results of operations for the years
ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 would not have been materially different if
this accounting had been in effect during those years.

 FirstEnergy is exposed to financial risks resulting from the
fluctuation of interest rates and commodity prices, including electricity,
natural gas and coal. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures,
FirstEnergy uses a variety of non-derivative and derivative instruments,
including forward contracts, options, futures contracts and swaps. The
derivatives are used principally for hedging purposes and, to a lesser extent,
for trading purposes. FirstEnergy's Risk Policy Committee, comprised of
executive officers, exercises an independent risk oversight function to ensure
compliance with corporate risk management policies and prudent risk management
practices.

 FirstEnergy uses derivatives to hedge the risk of price, interest rate
and foreign currency fluctuations. FirstEnergy's primary ongoing hedging
activity involves cash flow hedges of electricity and natural gas purchases. The
maximum periods over which the variability of electricity and natural gas cash
flows are hedged are two and three years, respectively. Gains and losses from
hedges of commodity price risks are included in net income when the underlying
hedged commodities are delivered. FirstEnergy entered into interest rate
derivative transactions during 2001 to hedge a portion of the anticipated
interest payments on debt related to the GPU acquisition. Gains and losses from
hedges of anticipated interest payments on acquisition debt will be included in
net income over the periods that hedged interest payments are made - 5, 10 and
30 years. The current net deferred loss of 169.4 million included in
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) as of December 31, 2001, for
derivative hedging activity, as compared to the December 31, 2000 balance of
 44.2 million (including the SFAS 133 cumulative adjustment) in deferred gains,
resulted from a 181.1 million reduction related to current hedging activity and
a 32.5 million reduction due to net hedge gains included in earnings during the
year. Approximately 40.7 million (after tax) of the current net deferred loss
on

derivative instruments in AOCL is expected to be reclassified to earnings during
the next twelve months as hedged transactions occur. However, the fair value of
these derivative instruments will fluctuate from period to period based on
various market factors and will generally be more than offset by the margin on
related sales and revenues.

 REGULATORY ASSETS-

 The Companies recognize, as regulatory assets, costs which the FERC,
PUCO, PPUC and NJBPU have authorized for recovery from customers in future
periods. Without such authorization, the costs would have been charged to income
as incurred. All regulatory assets are expected to continue to be recovered from
customers under the Companies' respective transition and regulatory plans. Based
on those plans, the Companies continue to bill and collect cost-based rates for
their transmission and distribution services, which remain regulated;
accordingly, it is appropriate that the Companies continue the application of
SFAS 71 to those operations. OE and Penn recognized additional cost recovery of
 270 million in 2000 and 257 million in 1999, as additional regulatory asset
amortization in accordance with their prior Ohio and current Pennsylvania
regulatory plans. The Ohio companies and Penn recognized incremental transition
cost recovery aggregating 309 million in accordance with the current Ohio
transition plan and Pennsylvania regulatory plan.

 Net regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are comprised
of the following:

2. MERGER:

 On November 7, 2001, the merger of FirstEnergy and GPU became
effective pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 8, 2000
(Merger Agreement). As a result of the merger, GPU's former wholly owned
subsidiaries, including JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec (collectively, the Former GPU
Companies), became wholly owned subsidiaries of FirstEnergy.

 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, GPU shareholders received the
equivalent of 36.50 for each share of GPU common stock they owned, payable in
cash and/or FirstEnergy common stock. GPU shareholders receiving FirstEnergy
shares received 1.2318 shares of FirstEnergy common stock for each share of GPU
common stock that they exchanged. The elections by GPU shareholders were subject
to proration since the total elections received would have resulted in more than
one-half of the GPU common stock being exchanged for FirstEnergy shares.
FirstEnergy borrowed the funds for the cash portion of the merger consideration,
approximately 2.2 billion, through a credit agreement dated as of October 2,
2001, from a group of banks led by Barclay's Bank Plc, as administrative agent;
the borrowings were refinanced with long-term debt on November 15, 2001.
FirstEnergy issued nearly 73.7 million shares of its common stock to GPU
shareholders for the share portion of the transaction consideration.

 The merger was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, the Consolidated Statements of Income include the results of the
Former GPU Companies beginning November 7, 2001. The assets acquired and
liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair values as determined by
FirstEnergy's management based on information currently available and on current
assumptions as to future operations. The merger purchase accounting adjustments,
which were recorded in the records of GPU's direct subsidiaries, primarily
consist of: (1) revaluation of GPU's international operations to fair value; (2)
revaluation of property, plant and equipment; (3) adjusting preferred stock
subject to mandatory redemption and long-term debt to estimated fair value; (4)
recognizing additional obligations related to retirement benefits; and (5)
recognizing estimated severance and other compensation liabilities. Other assets
and liabilities were not adjusted since they remain subject to rate regulation
on a historical cost basis. The severance and compensation liabilities are based
on anticipated workforce reductions reflecting duplicate positions primarily
related to corporate support groups including finance, legal, communications,
human resources and information technology. The workforce reductions represent
the expected reduction of approximately 1,000 employees at a cost of
approximately 140 million. Merger related staffing reductions began in late
2001 and the remaining reductions are anticipated to occur through 2003 as
merger-related transition assignments are completed.

The merger greatly expanded the size and scope of our electric
business and the goodwill recognized primarily relates to the regulated services
segment.

 The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The allocation of
the purchase price is subject to adjustment within one year of the merger.

DIVESTITURES-INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

 Prior to consummation of the GPU merger, FirstEnergy identified
certain GPU international operations (see below) for divestiture within twelve
months of the merger date. These operations constitute individual "lines of
business" as defined in Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 30,
"Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions" with physically and operationally separable activities.
Application of EITF Issue No. 87-11, "Allocation of Purchase Price to Assets to
Be Sold," required that expected, pre-sale cash flows, including incremental
interest costs on related acquisition debt, of these operations be considered
part of the purchase price allocation. Accordingly, subsequent to the merger
date, results of operations and incremental interest costs related to these
international subsidiaries have not been included in FirstEnergy's Consolidated
Statement of Income. Additionally, assets and liabilities of these
international operations have been segregated under separate captions on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as "Assets Pending Sale" and "Liabilities Related to
Assets Pending Sale" (see the tables below). The following entities are included
in such captions:

Australia - Gas Transmission (GasNet)
- -------------------------------------
GasNet Pty Ltd. and subsidiaries
GPU GasNet Trading Pty Ltd. (and related trusts)

United Kingdom - Electric Distribution
- --------------------------------------
Avon Energy Partners Holdings
Avon Energy Partners plc
Midlands Electricity plc
Midlands Power International Ltd.

Argentina - Electric Distribution
- ---------------------------------
GPU Empresa Distribuidora Electrica Regional S.A. and affiliates

 In December 2001, FirstEnergy divested its Australian gas transmission
companies through an initial public offering of GasNet's common stock. The IPO
provided net proceeds of 125 million to FirstEnergy and immediately removed
 290 million of GasNet-related debt from FirstEnergy's consolidated debt.

 On October 18, 2001, FirstEnergy and Aquila, Inc. (formerly UtiliCorp
United) announced that Aquila made an offer to FirstEnergy to purchase Avon
Energy Partners Holdings, FirstEnergy's wholly owned holding company of Midlands
Electricity plc, for 2.1 billion including the assumption of 1.7 billion of
debt. FirstEnergy accepted the offer upon completion of its merger with GPU and
regulatory approvals for the transaction have been received by Aquila. One
condition of regulatory approval requires that Aquila include a financial
partner in the transaction. The transaction must be completed by April 26, 2002,
or either party may terminate the original agreement. On March 18, 2002,
FirstEnergy announced that it finalized terms of the agreement in which Aquila
will acquire a 79.9 percent interest in Avon for approximately 1.9 billion
(including the transfer of 1.7 billion of debt).

 FirstEnergy and Aquila together will own all of the outstanding shares
of Avon through a jointly owned subsidiary, with each company having a
50-percent voting interest.

Midlands maintains a defined benefit pension plan covering almost all
full-time employees of Midlands. The plan is maintained separately from the
FirstEnergy plan and will transfer upon completion of the sale. The pension
benefit obligations as of the November 7, 2001 merger date and December 31, 2001
were approximately 1,263 million and 1,264 million, respectively, with the net
change primarily due to actuarial gains of 12 million offset by benefits paid
of 11 million. The fair values of plan assets as of November 7, 2001 and
December 31, 2001, were approximately 1,313 million and 1,291 million,
respectively, with the change including benefits paid of approximately 11
million. The 2001 post-merger net periodic benefit income for the last seven
weeks of 2001 was approximately 3 million. The plan assumptions as of December
31, 2001 included a discount rate of 6.0 , an expected return on plan assets of
7.0 and a rate of compensation increase of 4.5 .

 As with the other international subsidiaries identified above, GPU's
former Argentina operations, including GPU Empresa Distribuidora Electrica
Regional S.A., were identified by FirstEnergy for divestiture within twelve
months of the merger date. FirstEnergy is actively pursuing the sale of these
operations. FirstEnergy has determined the fair value of the Argentina
operations based on the best available information as of the date of the merger.
Subsequent to that date, a number of economic events have occurred in Argentina
which may have an impact on FirstEnergy's ability to realize the estimated fair
value of the Argentina operations. These events include currency devaluation,
restrictions on repatriation of cash, and the anticipation of future asset sales
in that region by competitors. FirstEnergy has determined that the current
economic conditions in Argentina have not eroded the fair value recorded for
these operations, and as a result, an impairment writedown of this investment is
not warranted as of December 31, 2001. FirstEnergy will continue to assess the
potential impact of these and other related events on the realizability of the
value recorded for the Argentina operations. Other international companies are
being considered for sale, however; as of the merger date those sales were not
judged to be probable of occurring within twelve months.

 Post-merger results of operations and incremental interest costs for
the international operations included in "Assets Pending Sale" and "Liabilities
Related to Assets Pending Sale" on FirstEnergy's Consolidated Balance Sheet as
of December 31, 2001, are as follows:

SALE OF GENERATING ASSETS-

 On November 29, 2001, FirstEnergy reached an agreement to sell four
coal-fired power plants (with an aggregate net book value of 539 million as of
December 31, 2001) totaling 2,535 MW to NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG) for 1.5 billion 1.355 billion in cash and 145 million in debt assumption). The net, after-tax
gain from the sale, based on the difference between the sale price of the plants
and their market price used in our Ohio restructuring transition plan, will be
credited to customers by reducing the transition cost recovery period.
FirstEnergy also entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with NRG. Under
the terms of the PPA, NRG is obligated to sell to FirstEnergy up to 10.5 billion
kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, similar to the average annual output of
the plants, through 2005. The sale is expected to close in mid-2002.

3. LEASES:

 The Companies lease certain generating facilities, office space and
other property and equipment under cancelable and noncancelable leases.

 OE sold portions of its ownership interests in Perry Unit 1 and Beaver
Valley Unit 2 and entered into operating leases on the portions sold for basic
lease terms of approximately 29 years. CEI and TE also sold portions of their
ownership interests in Beaver Valley Unit 2 and Bruce Mansfield Units 1, 2 and 3
and entered into similar operating leases for lease terms of approximately 30
years. During the terms of their respective leases, OE, CEI and TE continue to
be responsible, to the extent of their individual combined ownership and
leasehold interests, for costs associated with the units including construction
expenditures, operation and maintenance expenses, insurance, nuclear fuel,
property taxes and decommissioning. They have the right, at the expiration of
the respective basic lease terms, to renew their respective leases. They also
have the right to purchase the facilities at the expiration of the basic lease
term or renewal term (if elected) at a price equal to the fair market value of
the facilities. The basic rental payments are adjusted when applicable federal
tax law changes.

 OES Finance, Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of OE, maintains
deposits pledged as collateral to secure reimbursement obligations relating to
certain letters of credit supporting OE's obligations to lessors under the
Beaver Valley Unit 2 sale and leaseback arrangements. The deposits pledged to
the financial institution providing those letters of credit are the sole
property of OES Finance. In the event of liquidation, OES Finance, as a separate
corporate entity, would have to satisfy its obligations to creditors before any
of its assets could be made available to OE as sole owner of OES Finance common
stock.

 Consistent with the regulatory treatment, the rentals for capital and
operating leases are charged to operating expenses on the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Such costs for the three years ended December 31, 2001,
are summarized as follows:

 2001 2000 1999

OE invested in the PNBV Capital Trust, which was established to
purchase a portion of the lease obligation bonds issued on behalf of lessors in
OE's Perry Unit 1 and Beaver Valley Unit 2 sale and leaseback transactions. CEI
and TE established the Shippingport Capital Trust to purchase the lease
obligation bonds issued on behalf of lessors in their Bruce Mansfield Units 1, 2
and 3 sale and leaseback transactions. The PNBV and Shippingport capital trust
arrangements effectively reduce lease costs related to those transactions.

4. CAPITALIZATION:

 (A) RETAINED EARNINGS-

 There are no restrictions on retained earnings for payment of cash
dividends on FirstEnergy's common stock.

 (B) EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN-

 FirstEnergy funds the matching contribution for its 401(k) savings
plan through an ESOP Trust. All full-time employees eligible for participation
in the 401(k) savings plan are covered by the ESOP. The ESOP borrowed 200
million from OE and acquired 10,654,114 shares of OE's common stock
(subsequently converted to FirstEnergy common stock) through market purchases.
Dividends on ESOP shares are used to service the debt. Shares are released from
the ESOP on a pro rata basis as debt service payments are made. In 2001, 2000
and 1999, 834,657 shares, 826,873 shares and 627,427 shares, respectively, were
allocated to employees with the corresponding expense recognized based on the
shares allocated method. The fair value of 5,117,375 shares unallocated as of
December 31, 2001, was approximately 179.0 million. Total ESOP-related
compensation expense was calculated as follows:

 2001 2000 1999
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (In millions)
 Base compensation........................... 25.1 18.7 18.3
 Dividends on common stock held by the ESOP
 and used to service debt.................. (6.1) (6.4) (4.5)
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Net expense............................. 19.0 12.3 13.8
=============================================================================

(C) STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS-

 In 2001, FirstEnergy assumed responsibility for two new stock-based
plans as a result of the merger with GPU. No further stock based compensation
can be awarded under the GPU, Inc. Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan for
MYR Group Inc. Employees (MYR Plan) or the 1990 Stock Plan for Employees of GPU,
Inc. and Subsidiaries (GPU Plan). All options and restricted stock under both
Plans have been converted into FirstEnergy options and restricted stock. Options
under the GPU Plan became fully vested on November 7, 2001, and will expire on
or before June 1, 2010. Under the MYR Plan, all options and restricted stock
maintained their original vesting periods, which range from one to four years,
and will expire on or before December 17, 2006.

 Additional stock based plans administered by FirstEnergy include the
Centerior Equity Plan (CE Plan) and the FirstEnergy Executive and Director
Incentive Compensation Plan (FE Plan). All options are fully vested under the CE
Plan, and no further awards are permitted. Outstanding options will expire on or
before February 25, 2007. Under the FE Plan, total awards cannot exceed 15
million shares of common stock or their equivalent. Only stock options and
restricted stock have been granted, with vesting periods ranging from six months
to seven years.

 Collectively, the above plans are referred to as the FE Programs.
Restricted common stock grants under the FE Programs were as follows:

 2001 2000 1999
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Restricted common shares granted..... 133,162 208,400 8,000
 Weighted average market price ....... 35.68 26.63 30.89
 Weighted average vesting period (years) 3.7 3.8 5.8
 Dividends restricted................. Yes Yes
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 FE Plan dividends are paid as restricted stock on 4,500
 shares; MYR Plan dividends are paid as unrestricted cash
 on 128,662 shares

Stock option activity under the FE Programs was as follows:

 (1,828,341 options exercisable)....... 24.83
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 As of December 31, 2001, the weighted average remaining contractual
life of outstanding stock options was 7.8 years.

 Under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, covered employees can
direct a portion of their Annual Incentive Award and/or Long Term Incentive
Award into an unfunded FirstEnergy Stock Account to receive vested stock units.
An additional 20 premium is received in the form of stock units based on the
amount allocated to the FirstEnergy Stock Account. Dividends are calculated
quarterly on stock units outstanding and are paid in the form of additional
stock units. Upon withdrawal, stock units are converted to FirstEnergy shares.
Payout occurs three years from the date of deferral. As of December 31, 2001,
there were 234,558 stock units outstanding.

 FirstEnergy continues to apply APB 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees." As required by SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"
FirstEnergy has determined pro forma earnings as though FirstEnergy had
accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method. The weighted
average assumptions used in valuing the options and their resulting fair values
are as follows:

 2001 2000 1999
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Valuation assumptions:
 Expected option term (years) 8.3 7.6 6.4
 Expected volatility......... 23.45 21.77 20.03 
 Expected dividend yield..... 5.00 6.68 5.97 
 Risk-free interest rate..... 4.67 5.28 5.97 
 Fair value per option......... 4.97 2.86 3.42
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The following table summarizes the pro forma effect of applying fair
value accounting to FirstEnergy's stock options.

 2001 2000 1999
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Net Income (000)
 As Reported................. 646,447 598,970 568,299

 Diluted 
 As Reported................. 2.81 2.69 2.50
 Pro Forma................... 2.79 2.69 2.50

 The denominator used in the calculation of diluted earnings per
 share of common stock includes the weighted average number of
 common shares outstanding (used as the denominator for the
 calculation of basic earnings per share of common stock) plus
 common stock equivalents resulting from the stock-based
 compensation plans discussed above-including 723,931 for options
 and 194,107 for stock units.

(D) PREFERRED AND PREFERENCE STOCK-

 JCP&L's 7.52 Series K of preferred stock has a restriction which
prevents early redemption prior to June 2002. Penn's 7.75 series has a
restriction which prevents early redemption prior to July 2003. CEI's 90.00
Series S has no optional redemption provision. All other preferred stock may be
redeemed by the Companies in whole, or in part, with 30-90 days' notice.

 TE exercised its option to redeem all outstanding shares of five
series of preferred stock on February 1, 2002 as follows:

 Series Outstanding Shares Call Price
 ------------------------------------------------------
 7.76 150,000 102.44
 7.80 150,000 101.65
 8.32 100,000 102.46
 10.00 190,000 101.00
 2.21 1,000,000 25.25
 -----------------------------------------------------

 CEI redeemed, pursuant to redemption provisions of its 42.40 Series T
issue, all 200,000 shares outstanding on February 1, 2002 at a price of 500 per
share.

 Met-Ed's and Penelec's preferred stock authorization consists of 10
million and 11.435 million shares, respectively, without par value. No preferred
shares are currently outstanding for the two companies.

 The Companies' preference stock authorization consists of 8 million
shares without par value for OE; 3 million shares without par value for CEI; and
5 million shares, 25 par value for TE. No preference shares are currently
outstanding.

 (E) PREFERRED STOCK SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION-

 Annual sinking fund provisions for the Companies' preferred stock are
as follows:

 Redemption
 Price Per
 Series Shares Share
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CEI 7.35 C 10,000 100
 90.00 S 17,750 1,000
JCP&L 8.65 J 83,333 100
 7.52 K 25,000 100
Penn 7.625 7,500 100
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Annual sinking fund requirements for the next five years are 30
million in 2002, 13 million in each year 2003 and 2004, and 4 million in each
year 2005 and 2006.

(F) SUBSIDIARY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF
 SUBSIDIARY TRUST OR LIMITED PARTNERSHIP HOLDING SOLELY SUBORDINATED
 DEBENTURES OF SUBSIDIARIES-

 OE and CEI have each formed statutory business trusts as wholly owned
financing subsidiaries for which they own all of the respective common
securities. Each trust sold preferred securities and invested the gross proceeds
in subordinated debentures of the applicable parent company and the sole assets
of each trust are the applicable subordinated debentures. In each case, interest
payment provisions of the subordinated debentures match the distribution payment
provisions of the trust's preferred securities. In addition, upon redemption or
payment at maturity of subordinated debentures, the applicable trust's preferred
securities will be redeemed on a pro rata basis at their liquidation value.
Under certain circumstances, the applicable subordinated debentures could be
distributed to the holders of the outstanding preferred securities of the trust
in the event that the trust is liquidated. The applicable parent company has
effectively provided a full and unconditional guarantee of payments due on its
trust's preferred securities. Their respective trust preferred securities are
redeemable at 100 of their principal amount at the option of OE and, beginning
in December 2006, at the option of CEI.

 Met-Ed and Penelec have each also formed statutory business trusts for
substantially similar transactions as OE and CEI. However, ownership of the
respective Met-Ed and Penelec trusts is through separate wholly-owned limited
partnerships, of which a wholly-owned subsidiary of each company is the sole
general partner. In these transactions, each trust invested the gross proceeds
from the sale of its trust preferred securities in the preferred securities of
the applicable limited partnership, which in turn invested those proceeds in the
7.35 and 7.34 subordinated debentures of Met-Ed and Penelec, respectively. In
each case, the applicable parent company has effectively provided a full and

unconditional guarantee of its obligations under its trust's preferred
securities. The Met-Ed and Penelec trust preferred securities are redeemable at
the option of Met-Ed and Penelec beginning in May 2004 and September 2004,
respectively, at 100 of their principal amount.

 Additionally, JCP&L has formed a limited partnership for a
substantially similar transaction; however, no statutory trust is involved. That
limited partnership, of which JCP&L is the sole general partner, invested the
gross proceeds from the sale of its monthly income preferred securities (MIPS)
in JCP&L's 8.56 subordinated debentures. JCP&L has effectively provided a full
and unconditional guarantee of its obligations under its limited partnership's
MIPS. The limited partnership's MIPS are redeemable at the option of JCP&L at
100 of their principal amount. In all of these transactions, interest on the
subordinated debentures (and therefore the distributions on trust preferred
securities or MIPS) may be deferred for up to 60 months, but the parent company
may not pay dividends on, or redeem or acquire, any of its cumulative preferred
or common stock until deferred payments on its subordinated debentures are paid
in full.

 The following table lists the subsidiary trusts and limited
partnership and information regarding their preferred securities outstanding as
of December 31, 2001.

(b) The sole assets of the trust or limited partnership are the parent
 company's subordinated debentures with the same rate and maturity date as
 the preferred securities.
(c) The sole assets of the trust are the preferred securities of Met-Ed Capital II, L.P. and Penelec
 Capital II, L.P., respectively, whose sole assets are the parent company's subordinated
 debentures with the same rate and maturity date as the preferred securities.

(G) LONG-TERM DEBT-

 The first mortgage indentures and their supplements, which secure all
of the Companies' first mortgage bonds, serve as direct first mortgage liens on
substantially all property and franchises, other than specifically excepted
property, owned by the Companies.

 Based on the amount of bonds authenticated by the Trustees through
December 31, 2001, the Companies' annual sinking and improvement fund
requirements for all bonds issued under the mortgages amounts to 66.9 million.
OE, TE and Penn expect to deposit funds in 2002 that will be withdrawn upon the
surrender for cancellation of a like principal amount of bonds, which are
specifically authenticated for such purposes against unfunded property additions
or against previously retired bonds. This method can result in minor increases
in the amount of the annual sinking fund requirement. JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec
expect to fulfill their sinking and improvement fund obligation by providing
bondable property additions and/or retired bonds to the Trustee to meet their
annual sinking fund requirement.

 Sinking fund requirements for first mortgage bonds and maturing
long-term debt (excluding capital leases and long-term debt included in
"Liabilities Related to Assets Pending Sale") for the next five years are:

 2006.............. 1,432.5
 ---------------------------------

 The Companies' obligations to repay certain pollution control revenue
bonds are secured by several series of first mortgage bonds. Certain pollution
control revenue bonds are entitled to the benefit of irrevocable bank letters of
credit of 287.6 million and noncancelable municipal bond insurance policies of
 493.9 million to pay principal of, or interest on, the pollution control
revenue bonds. To the extent that drawings are made under the letters of credit,
the Companies are entitled to a credit against their obligation to repay those
bonds. The Companies pay annual fees of 1.00 to 1.375 of the amounts of the
letters of credit to the issuing banks and are obligated to reimburse the banks
for any drawings thereunder.

FirstEnergy had unsecured borrowings of 250 million as of December
31, 2001, supported by a 500 million long-term revolving credit facility
agreement which expires November 29, 2004. As of December 31, 2001, FirstEnergy
currently pays an annual facility fee of 0.25 on the total credit facility
amount. The fee is subject to change based on credit agency ratings for
FirstEnergy.

 OE had no unsecured borrowings as of December 31, 2001 under a 250
million long-term revolving credit facility agreement which expires November 18,
2002. OE must pay an annual facility fee of 0.20 on the total credit facility
amount. In addition, the credit agreement provides that OE maintain unused first
mortgage bond capability for the full credit agreement amount under OE's
indenture as potential security for the unsecured borrowings.

 CEI and TE have letters of credit of approximately 222 million in
connection with the sale and leaseback of Beaver Valley Unit 2 that expire in
May 2002. The letters of credit are secured by first mortgage bonds of CEI and
TE in the proportion of 40 and 60 , respectively (see Note 3).

 OE's and Penn's nuclear fuel purchases are financed through the
issuance of OES Fuel commercial paper and loans, both of which are supported by
a 141.5 million long-term bank credit agreement which expires March 31, 2002.
FirstEnergy does not anticipate extending the credit agreement. Accordingly, the
commercial paper and loans are reflected as currently payable long-term debt on
the December 31, 2001 Consolidated Balance Sheet. OES Fuel must pay an annual
facility fee of 0.20 on the total line of credit and an annual commitment fee
of 0.0625 on any unused amount.

 (H) COMPREHENSIVE INCOME-

 Comprehensive income includes net income as reported on the
Consolidated Statements of Income and all other changes in common stockholders'
equity except those resulting from transactions with common stockholders. As of
December 31, 2001, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consisted of a
minimum liability for unfunded retirement benefits of 0.6 million, unrealized
gains on investments in securities available for sale of 1.0 million and
unrealized losses on derivative instrument hedges of 169.4 million.

5. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND BANK LINES OF CREDIT:

 Short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2001, consisted
of 688.3 million of bank borrowings and 159.8 million of OES Capital,
Incorporated commercial paper. Total borrowings include 233.8 million related
to pending divestitures (see Note 2 - Merger) that are included in "Liabilities
Related to Assets Pending Sale" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December
31, 2001. OES Capital is a wholly owned subsidiary of OE whose borrowings are
secured by customer accounts receivable. OES Capital can borrow up to 170
million under a receivables financing agreement at rates based on certain bank
commercial paper and is required to pay an annual fee of 0.20 on the amount of
the entire finance limit. The receivables financing agreement expires in 2002.

 FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries have various credit facilities
(including a FirstEnergy 1 billion short-term revolving credit facility) with
domestic and foreign banks that provide for borrowings of up to 1.291 billion
under various interest rate options. OE's short-term borrowings may be made
under its lines of credit on its unsecured notes. To assure the availability of
these lines, FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries are required to pay annual
commitment fees that vary from 0.125 to 0.20 . These lines expire at various
times during 2002. The weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings
outstanding as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, were 3.80 and 7.92 ,
respectively.

6. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES:

 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES-

 FirstEnergy's current forecast reflects expenditures of approximately
 3.4 billion for property additions and improvements from 2002-2006, of which
approximately 850 million is applicable to 2002. Investments for additional
nuclear fuel during the 2002-2006 period are estimated to be approximately 536
million, of which approximately 54 million applies to 2002. During the same
periods, the Companies' nuclear fuel investments are expected to be reduced by
approximately 507 million and 101 million, respectively, as the nuclear fuel
is consumed.

 STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM-

 On November 17, 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
of up to 15 million shares of FirstEnergy's common stock over a three-year
period beginning in 1999. Repurchases were made on the open market, at
prevailing prices, and were funded primarily through the use of operating cash
flows. During 2001, 2000 and 1999, FirstEnergy repurchased and retired 550,000
shares (average price of 27.82 per share), 7.9 million shares (average price of
 24.51 per share) and 4.6 million shares (average price of 28.08 per share),
respectively.

NUCLEAR INSURANCE-

 The Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability relative to a
single incident at a nuclear power plant to 9.5 billion. The amount is covered
by a combination of private insurance and an industry retrospective rating plan.
The Companies' maximum potential assessment under the industry retrospective
rating plan would be 352.4 million per incident but not more than 40 million
in any one year for each incident.

 The Companies are also insured under policies for each nuclear plant.
Under these policies, up to 2.75 billion is provided for property damage and
decontamination and decommissioning costs. The Companies have also obtained
approximately 1.2 billion of insurance coverage for replacement power costs.
Under these policies, the Companies can be assessed a maximum of approximately
 71 million for incidents at any covered nuclear facility occurring during a
policy year which are in excess of accumulated funds available to the insurer
for paying losses.

 The Companies intend to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as
described above as long as it is available. To the extent that replacement
power, property damage, decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement
costs and other such costs arising from a nuclear incident at any of the
Companies' plants exceed the policy limits of the insurance in effect with
respect to that plant, to the extent a nuclear incident is determined not to be
covered by the Companies' insurance policies, or to the extent such insurance
becomes unavailable in the future, the Companies would remain at risk for such
costs.

 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS-

 Various federal, state and local authorities regulate the Companies
with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters.
FirstEnergy estimates additional capital expenditures for environmental
compliance of approximately 225 million, which is included in the construction
forecast provided under "Capital Expenditures" for 2002 through 2006.

 The Companies are required to meet federally approved sulfur dioxide
(SO2) regulations. Violations of such regulations can result in shutdown of the
generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of up to 27,500 for
each day the unit is in violation. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
an interim enforcement policy for SO2 regulations in Ohio that allows for
compliance based on a 30-day averaging period. The Companies cannot predict what
action the EPA may take in the future with respect to the interim enforcement
policy.

 The Companies are in compliance with the current SO2 and nitrogen
oxide (NOx) reduction requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
SO2 reductions are being achieved by burning lower-sulfur fuel, generating more
electricity from lower-emitting plants, and/or using emission allowances. NOx
reductions are being achieved through combustion controls and the generation of
more electricity at lower-emitting plants. In September 1998, the EPA finalized
regulations requiring additional NOx reductions from the Companies' Ohio and
Pennsylvania facilities. The EPA's NOx Transport Rule imposes uniform reductions
of NOx emissions (an approximate 85 reduction in utility plant NOx emissions
from projected 2007 emissions) across a region of nineteen states and the
District of Columbia, including New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania, based on a
conclusion that such NOx emissions are contributing significantly to ozone
pollution in the eastern United States. State Implementation Plans (SIP) must
comply by May 31, 2004 with individual state NOx budgets established by the EPA.
Pennsylvania submitted a SIP that requires compliance with the NOx budgets at
the Companies' Pennsylvania facilities by May 1, 2003 and Ohio submitted a
"draft" SIP that requires compliance with the NOx budgets at the Companies' Ohio
facilities by May 31, 2004. The Companies continue to evaluate their compliance
plans and other compliance options.

 In July 1997, the EPA promulgated changes in the National Ambient Air
Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone emissions and proposed a new NAAQS for
previously unregulated ultra-fine particulate matter. In May 1999, the U.S.
Court of Appeals found constitutional and other defects in the new NAAQS rules.
In February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the new NAAQS rules regulating
ultra-fine particulates but found defects in the new NAAQS rules for ozone and
decided that the EPA must revise those rules. The future cost of compliance with
these regulations may be substantial and will depend if and how they are
ultimately implemented by the states in which the Companies operate affected
facilities.

 In 1999 and 2000, the EPA issued Notices of Violation (NOV) or a
Compliance Order to nine utilities covering 44 power plants, including the W. H.
Sammis Plant. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice filed eight civil
complaints against various investor-owned utilities, which included a complaint
against OE and Penn in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Ohio. The NOV and complaint allege violations of the Clean Air Act based on
operation and maintenance of the Sammis Plant dating back to 1984. The complaint
requests permanent injunctive relief to require the installation of "best
available control technology" and civil penalties of up to 27,500 per day of
violation. Although unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings,
FirstEnergy believes the Sammis Plant is in full compliance with the Clean Air
Act and the NOV and complaint are without merit. Penalties could be imposed if
the Sammis Plant continues to

operate without correcting the alleged violations and a court determines that
the allegations are valid. The Sammis Plant continues to operate while these
proceedings are pending.

 In December 2000, the EPA announced it would proceed with the
development of regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants from electric
power plants. The EPA identified mercury as the hazardous air pollutant of
greatest concern. The EPA established a schedule to propose regulations by
December 2003 and issue final regulations by December 2004. The future cost of
compliance with these regulations may be substantial.

 As a result of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as
amended, and the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state
hazardous waste regulations have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel
combustion waste products, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste
disposal requirements pending the EPA's evaluation of the need for future
regulation. The EPA has issued its final regulatory determination that
regulation of coal ash as a hazardous waste is unnecessary. In April 2000, the
EPA announced that it will develop national standards regulating disposal of
coal ash under its authority to regulate nonhazardous waste.

 Various environmental liabilities have been recognized on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2001, based on estimates of the
total costs of cleanup, the Companies' proportionate responsibility for such
costs and the financial ability of other nonaffiliated entities to pay. The
Companies have been named as "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) at waste
disposal sites which may require cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of disposal of
hazardous substances at historical sites and the liability involved are often
unsubstantiated and subject to dispute. Federal law provides that all PRPs for a
particular site be held liable on a joint and several basis. In addition, JCP&L
has accrued liabilities for environmental remediation of former manufactured gas
plants in New Jersey; those costs are being recovered by JCP&L through a
non-bypassable societal benefits charge. The Companies have total accrued
liabilities aggregating approximately 60 million as of December 31, 2001.
FirstEnergy does not believe environmental remediation costs will have a
material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of
operations.

 OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS-

 Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to FirstEnergy's
normal business operations are pending against FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries.
The most significant are described below.

 Unit 2 of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Plant (TMI-2) was acquired by
FirstEnergy in 2001 as part of the merger with GPU. As a result of the 1979
TMI-2 accident, claims for alleged personal injury against JCP&L, Met-Ed,
Penelec and GPU were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of
Pennsylvania. In 1996, the District Court granted a motion for summary judgment
filed by GPU and dismissed the ten initial "test cases" which had been selected
for a test case trial, as well as all of the remaining 2,100 pending claims. In
November 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the
District Court's dismissal of the ten "test cases," but set aside the dismissal
of the additional pending claims, remanding them to the District Court for
further proceedings. In September 2000, GPU filed for a summary judgment in the
District Court. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs appealed to the Third Circuit for a
review of the District Court's decision placing limitations on the remaining
plaintiffs' suits. In April 2001, the Third Circuit affirmed the District
Court's decision. In July 2001, GPU renewed its motion for a summary judgment on
the remaining 2,100 claims in the District Court. On January 15, 2002, the
District Court granted GPU's amended motion for summary judgment. On February
14, 2002 plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition to the approximately 2,100 claims for
which summary judgment has been granted, there is other pending litigation
arising out of the TMI-2 accident. This litigation consists of the following:
eight personal injury cases that were not consolidated with the above-referenced
approximately 2,100 claims; two class actions brought on behalf of plaintiffs
alleging additional injuries diagnosed after the filing of the complaints in the
above-referenced case; a case alleging exposure during the post-accident cleanup
of the TMI-2 plant; and claims by individual businesses for economic loss
resulting from the TMI-2 accident. Although unable to predict the outcome of
this litigation, FirstEnergy believes that any liability to which it might be
subject by reason of the TMI-2 accident will not exceed its financial protection
under the Price-Anderson Act.

 In July 1999, the Mid-Atlantic states experienced a severe heat storm
which resulted in power outages throughout the service territories of many
electric utilities, including the territory of JCP&L. In an investigation into
the causes of the outages and the reliability of the transmission and
distribution systems of all four New Jersey electric utilities, the NJBPU
concluded that there was not a prima facie case demonstrating that, overall,
JCP&L provided unsafe, inadequate or improper service to its customers. Two
class action lawsuits (subsequently consolidated into a single proceeding) were
filed in New Jersey Superior Court in July 1999 against JCP&L, GPU and other GPU
companies seeking compensatory and punitive damages arising from the July 1999
service interruptions in the JCP&L territory. In May 2001, the court denied
without prejudice the defendants' motion seeking decertification of the class.
Discovery continues in the class action, but no trial date has been set. The
judge has set a schedule under which factual legal discovery would conclude in
March 2002, and expert reports would be exchanged by June 2002. In October 2001,
the court held argument on the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment,
which contends that JCP&L is bound to several findings of the NJBPU
investigation. The plaintiffs' motion was denied by the Court in November 2001
and the

plaintiffs' motion to file an appeal of this decision was denied by the New
Jersey Appellate Division. JCP&L has also filed a motion for partial summary
judgement that is currently pending before the Superior Court. FirstEnergy is
unable to predict the outcome of these matters.

OTHER COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES-

 GPU had made significant investments in foreign businesses and
facilities through its GPU Electric and GPU Power subsidiaries. Although
FirstEnergy will attempt to mitigate its risks related to foreign investments,
it faces additional risks inherent in operating in such locations, including
foreign currency fluctuations.

 GPU Electric, through its subsidiary, Midlands, has a 40 equity
interest in a 586 MW power project in Pakistan (the Uch Power Project), which
commenced commercial operations in October 2000. GPU Electric's investment in
this project as of December 31, 2001 was approximately 38 million, plus a
guaranty letter of credit of 3.6 million, and its share of the projected
completion costs represents an additional 4.8 million commitment. Cinergy (the
former owner of 50 of Midlands Electricity plc) agreed to fund up to an
aggregate of 20 million of the required capital contributions, for a period of
one year from July 15, 1999, and "cash losses" which could be incurred on the
Uch Power Project, for a period of up to ten years from July 15, 1999. Cinergy
has reimbursed GPU Electric 4.9 million through December 31, 2001, leaving a
remaining commitment for future cash losses of up to 15.1 million. Midlands
also has a 31 equity interest in a 478 MW power project in Turkey (the Trakya
Power Project). Trakya is presently engaged in a foreign currency conversion
issue with TETTAS (the state owned electricity purchaser). Midlands established
a 16.5 million reserve for non-recovery relating to that issue as of December
31, 2001. These commitments and contingencies associated with Midlands will
transfer to the new partnership upon completion of the sale discussed in Note 2
- - Merger, with FirstEnergy being responsible for its lower proportionate
interest.

 EI Barranquilla, a wholly owned subsidiary of GPU Power, is an equity
investor in Termobarranquilla S.A., Empresa de Servicios Publicos (TEBSA), which
owns a Colombian independent power generation project. As of December 31, 2001,
GPU Power has an investment of approximately 109.4 million in TEBSA and is
committed, under certain circumstances, to make additional standby equity
contributions of 21.3 million, which FirstEnergy has guaranteed. The total
outstanding senior debt of the TEBSA project is 315 million at December 31,
2001. The lenders include the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, US Export
Import Bank and a commercial bank syndicate. GPU had guaranteed the obligations
of the operators of the TEBSA project, up to a maximum of 5.8 million (subject
to escalation) under the project's operations and maintenance agreement.

 GPU believed that various events of default have occurred under the
loan agreements relating to the TEBSA project. In addition, questions have been
raised as to the accuracy and completeness of information provided to various
parties to the project in connection with the project's formation. FirstEnergy
continues to discuss these issues and related matters with the project lenders,
CORELCA (the government owned Colombian electric utility with an ownership
interest in the project) and the Government of Colombia.

 Moreover, in September 2001, the DIAN (the Colombian national tax
authority) had presented TEBSA with a statement of charges alleging that certain
lease payments made under the Lease Agreement with Los Amigos Leasing Company
(an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GPU Power) violated Colombian foreign
exchange regulations and were, therefore, subject to substantial penalties. The
DIAN has calculated a statutory penalty amounting to approximately 200 million
and gave TEBSA two months to respond to the statement of charges. In November
2001, TEBSA filed a formal response to this statement of charges. TEBSA is
continuing to review the DIAN's position and has been advised by its Colombian
counsel that the DIAN's position is without substantial legal merit. FirstEnergy
is unable to predict the outcome of these matters.

7. SEGMENT INFORMATION:

 FirstEnergy operates under the following reportable segments:
regulated services, competitive services and other (primarily corporate support
services and international operations acquired in the GPU merger). FirstEnergy's
primary segment is its regulated services, which include eight electric utility
operating companies in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey that formerly provided
bundled electric service. Its other material business segment consists of the
subsidiaries that operate unregulated energy and energy-related businesses.

 The regulated services segment designs, constructs, operates and
maintains FirstEnergy's regulated transmission and distribution systems. It also
provides generation services to regulated franchise customers who have not
chosen an alternative, competitive generation supplier. The regulated services
segment obtains a portion of its required generation through power supply
agreements with the competitive services segment.

The competitive services segment includes all domestic unregulated
energy and energy-related services including commodity sales (both electricity
and natural gas) in the retail and wholesale markets, marketing, generation and
sourcing of commodity requirements, as well as other competitive
energy-application services. Competitive products are increasingly marketed to
customers as bundled services.

 2000 and 1999 financial data are pro forma amounts to represent 2001
business segment organizations and operations. Financial data for these business
segments are as follows:

9. PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FIRSTENERGY STATEMENTS OF INCOME (UNAUDITED):

 The following pro forma combined condensed statements of income of
FirstEnergy give effect to the FirstEnergy/GPU merger as if it had been
consummated on January 1, 2000, with the purchase accounting adjustments
actually recognized in the business combination (see Note 2 - Merger). The pro
forma combined condensed financial statements have been prepared to reflect the
merger under the purchase method of accounting with FirstEnergy acquiring GPU.
Under the purchase method of accounting, tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair
values. The excess of the purchase price, including estimated fees and expenses
related to the merger, over the net assets acquired (which included existing
goodwill of 1.9 billion) is classified as goodwill and amounts to an
additional 2.3 billion. In addition, the pro forma adjustments reflect a
reduction in debt from application of the proceeds from certain pending
divestitures as well as the related reduction in interest costs.

 Written notice of every annual or special meeting of the shareholders
stating the time, place and purposes thereof shall be given to each shareholder
entitled to notice as provided by law, not less than seven (7) nor more than
sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. Such notice may be given by or
at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Corporate
Secretary. Except to the full extent that notice is legally permitted (now or
hereafter) to be given by any other form of media, including any form of
electronic or other communications, notice shall be given by personal delivery
or by mail addressed to the shareholder at his last address as it appears on the
records of the Corporation. Any shareholder may waive in writing notice of any
meeting, either before or after the holding of such meeting, and, by attending
any meeting without protesting the lack of proper notice, shall be deemed to
have waived notice thereof.

Section 4. Business Transacted at Meetings.
- ---------- --------------------------------

 Business transacted at any meeting of shareholders shall be for the
purposes stated in the notice.

Section 5. Quorum and Adjournments.

transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

Section 6. Required Vote; Inspectors.
- ---------- --------------------------

 (a) When a quorum is present or represented at any meeting, the vote of
the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or
represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting,
unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes or of
the Articles of Incorporation a different vote is required in which case such
express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.

 (b) Inspectors of election may be appointed to act at any meeting of
shareholders in accordance with Ohio law.

Section 7. Voting Power of Shareholders.
- ---------- -----------------------------

 Every shareholder of record of the Corporation shall be entitled at each

shareholder, one vote for each share of Preferred Stock, 100 par value, held by
such shareholder, and one-quarter vote for each share of Class A Preferred
Stock, 25 par value, held by such shareholder, in each case according to the
books of the Corporation as of the date of such vote or, if a record date is set
by the Board of Directors, as of such record date.

Section 8. Voting by Proxy.
- ---------- ----------------

At any meeting of the shareholders, any shareholder may be represented and vote
by a proxy or proxies appointed by an instrument in writing or by any other form
of verifiable communication, including any form of electronic or other
communications, to the full extent legally permitted (now or hereafter). In the
event that any such instrument shall designate two or more persons to act as
proxies, a majority of such persons present at the meeting, or, if only one
shall be present, then that one shall have and may exercise all of the powers
conferred by such instrument upon all of the persons so designated unless the

instrument shall otherwise provide. No such proxy shall be valid after the
expiration of eleven (11) months from the date of its execution, unless coupled
with an interest, or unless the person executing it specifies therein the length
of time for which it is to continue in force. Subject to the above, any proxy
duly executed is not revoked and continues in full force and effect until an
instrument or verifiable communication revoking it or a duly executed proxy
bearing a later date is filed with the Secretary of the Corporation.

Section 9. Action by Shareholders Without a Meeting.
- ---------- -----------------------------------------

 Any action which may be taken by the vote of the shareholders at a meeting
may be taken without a meeting if authorized by the written consent of the
shareholders holding at least a majority of the voting power, unless the
provisions of the statutes or of the Articles of Incorporation provide that a
greater proportion of written consents shall be required. Such written consent
shall be filed with or entered upon the records of the Corporation.

DIRECTORS

Section 10. Authority of Directors.
- ----------- -----------------------

 (a) The business of the Corporation shall be managed by its Board of
Directors, which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such
lawful acts and things as are not by statute, the Articles of Incorporation, or
these Regulations directed or required to be exercised or done by the
shareholders.

 (b) Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board
of Directors or any committee of the Board of Directors may be taken without a
meeting if, prior or subsequent to such action, all members of the Board of
Directors or of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing
and such written consents are filed with the Secretary of the Corporation.

Section 11. Number; Qualifications.
- ----------- -----------------------

 The number of Directors shall be not less than three (3) and not more than
five (5) (plus any Directors separately elected by the holders of any class of
stock other than the Common Stock as provided in the Articles of Incorporation
as amended from time to time). The number of Directors may be determined (a) by
the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon at
any annual meeting or special meeting called for the purpose of electing
Directors or (b) by action of the Board of Directors at a meeting by the vote of
a majority of the Directors in office at the time or in a writing signed by all
the Directors in office at the time. When so fixed, such number shall continue
to be the authorized number of Directors until changed by the shareholders or
Directors in the manner described above. Any increase in the number of Directors
shall be deemed to create a vacancy or vacancies which may be filled as provided
in Section 14. A reduction in the number of Directors shall not be applied to
remove any Director from office prior to the expiration of his term. Directors
need not be shareholders of the Corporation.

Section 12. Election of Directors.
- ----------- ----------------------

 At each meeting of the shareholders for the election of Directors, the
persons receiving the greatest number of votes shall be the Directors. Such
elections shall be by ballot whenever requested by any person entitled to vote
at such meeting; but unless so requested, such election may be conducted in any
way approved at such meeting.

Section 13. Term of Office; Removal; Resignations.
- ----------- --------------------------------------

 (a) Directors shall hold office until the annual meeting of the
shareholders next following their election and until their respective successors
are elected, or until their earlier resignation, death or removal from office.

 (b) Any Director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed upon the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
Corporation.

 (c) Any Director may resign at any time by giving written notice of his
resignation to the President or Secretary. Any resignation will be effective
upon actual receipt by such person or, if later, as of the date and time
specified in such written notice.

Section 14. Vacancies.
- ----------- ----------

 Vacancies, including those caused by an increase in the number of
Directors, may be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors though less
than a quorum. When one or more Directors shall give notice of his or their
resignation to the Board, effective at a future date, the Board shall have the
power to fill such vacancy or vacancies to take effect when such resignation or
resignations shall become effective, each Director so appointed to hold office
during the remainder of the term of office of the resigning Director or
Directors. Whenever any vacancy shall occur among the Directors, the remaining
Directors shall constitute the Directors of the Corporation until such vacancy
is filled or until the number of Directors is changed as in Section 11 hereof.

MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Section 15. Organizational Meeting.
- ----------- -----------------------

 Immediately after each annual meeting of the shareholders at which
Directors are elected, or each special meeting held in lieu thereof, the newly
elected Directors, if a quorum thereof is present, shall hold an organizational
meeting at the same place or at such other time and place as may be fixed by the
shareholders at such meeting, for the purpose of electing officers and
transacting any other business. Notice of such meeting need not be given. If for
any reason such organizational meeting is not held at such time, a special
meeting of the Directors for such purpose shall be held as soon thereafter as
practicable.

Section 16. Regular Meetings.
- ----------- -----------------

 Regular meetings of the Directors may be held without notice at such times
and places within or without the State of Ohio as shall be determined by the
Directors from time to time.

Section 17. Special Meetings.
- ----------- -----------------

 Special meetings of the Directors may be held at any time within or
without the State of Ohio upon call by the Chairman of the Board, the President,
or the Corporate Secretary upon the written request of two Directors. Notice of
each such meeting shall be given to each Director by letter, facsimile,
telegram, telephone, or in person not less than forty-eight (48) hours prior to
such meeting. Notices sent by mail shall be sent postage prepaid and shall be
addressed to each Director at his address as it appears upon the records of the
Corporation. Notice by mail shall be deemed to be given at the time when the
notice is deposited in the mail, and notice by facsimile or telegram shall be
deemed to be given at the time when confirmation of successful transmission is
received. Such notice may be waived in writing by Directors either before or
after the meeting, and such written waivers shall be filed with or entered upon
the records of the meeting. The attendance of any Director at any such meeting
without protesting the lack of proper notice, prior to or at the commencement of
the meeting, shall be deemed to be a waiver by the Director of notice of the
meeting. Unless otherwise limited in the notice thereof, any business may be
transacted at any organizational, regular or special meeting.

Section 18. Quorum and Adjournments; Participation by Communications
- ------- --- --------------------------------------------------------
 Equipment.
 ---------

 (a) A majority of the Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, shall
be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act
of a majority of the Directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is
present shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise
specifically provided by statute or by the Articles of Incorporation. Any action
required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Directors may be taken
without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken,
shall be signed by all of the Directors entitled to vote with respect to the
subject matter thereof. Any meeting duly called, whether or not a quorum is
present, may, by vote of a majority of the Directors present, be adjourned from
time to time and place to place within or without the State of Ohio, in which
case no further notice of the adjourned meeting need be given.

 (b) Meetings of the Board of Directors or of any committee of the Board of
Directors may be held through any means of communications equipment if all
persons participating can hear each other, and such participation will
constitute presence in person at such meeting.

Section 19. Committees.
- ----------- -----------

 The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the
Directors, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or
more of the Directors of the Corporation, which, to the extent provided in the
resolution, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of Directors in
the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation. Such committee or

committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time
by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. The committees shall keep
regular minutes of their proceedings and report the same to the Board when
required.

Section 20. Compensation.
- ----------- -------------

 The Directors may be paid their expenses, if any, for attendance at each
meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at
each meeting of the Board of Directors. The sums may be different for different
Directors, and the sum shall be established by resolution of the Board of
Directors and may be changed from time to time by resolution. No such payment
shall preclude any Director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity
and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees
may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

Section 21. Executive Committee
- ----------- -------------------

 The Board of Directors at any time may elect from its members an Executive
Committee which shall consist of not less than three (3) members. Each member of
such Committee shall hold office during the pleasure of the Board and may be
removed by a majority vote of the whole Board at any time with or without cause.
Vacancies occurring in the Committee may be filled by the Board. The Committee
shall prescribe its own rules for calling and holding meetings, and for
transacting business, subject, however, to any rules prescribed by the Board of
Directors, and the Committee shall keep minutes of its actions. Action by the
Committee may be taken at meetings thereof attended by not less than a majority
thereof, or without a meeting by instrument in writing signed by not less than a
majority of the members. Except as the Committee's powers and duties may be
limited or otherwise prescribed by the Board of Directors, the Committee, during
the intervals between the meetings of the Board, shall possess and may exercise
all of the powers and authority of the Board of Directors, however conferred,
provided, however, that the Committee shall not be empowered to elect the
officers (other than Assistant Secretaries and Assistant Treasurers) or to fill
vacancies in the Board of Directors or in the Executive Committee. Subject to
such exceptions, persons dealing with the Corporation shall be entitled to rely
upon any action of the Committee with the same force and effect as though such
action had been taken by the Board of Directors.

foregoing, by specific action, the Board of Directors may authorize the Chairman
or the President to appoint any person to any office other than Chairman,
President, Corporate Secretary, or Treasurer. Any number of offices may be held
by the same person, and no two offices must be held by the same person. Any of
the offices may be left vacant from time to time as the Board of Directors may
determine. In case of the absence or disability of any officer of the
Corporation or for any other reason deemed sufficient by a majority of the Board
of Directors, the Board of Directors may delegate the absent or disabled
officer's powers or duties to any other officer or to any director.

Section 23. Authority and Duties of Officers.
- ----------- ---------------------------------

 The officers of the Corporation shall have such authority and shall
perform such duties as are customarily incident to their respective offices, or
as may be specified from time to time by the Board of Directors, the Chairman or
the President regardless of whether such authority and duties are customarily
incident to such office.

Section 24. Compensation.
- ----------- -------------

 The compensation of all officers and agents of the Corporation who are
also members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation will be fixed by the
Board of Directors or by a committee of the Board of Directors. The Board of
Directors may fix, or delegate the power to fix, the compensation of the other
officers and agents of the Corporation to the Chief Executive Officer or any
other officer of the Corporation.

Section 25. Succession.
- ----------- ----------

 The officers of the Corporation will hold office until their successors
are elected. Any officer may be removed at any time by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the whole Board. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the
Corporation may be filled by the Board of Directors or by the Chairman or
President as provided in Regulation 22.

Section 26. Delegation of Duties.
- ----------- ---------------------

 The Directors are authorized to delegate the duties of any officers to any
other officer and generally to control the action of the officers and to require
the performance of duties in addition to those mentioned herein.

Section 27. Signing Checks and Other Instruments.
- ----------- -------------------------------------

 The Directors are authorized to determine or provide the method of
determining how checks, notes, bills or exchange and similar instruments shall
be signed, countersigned or endorsed.

CERTIFICATES OF STOCK

Section 28. Contents of Certificates.

[FORM OF BOND OF 2001 CLASS A SERIES A]

 [REVERSE]

 OHIO EDISON COMPANY

 FIRST MORTGAGE BOND CLASS A SERIES A OF 2001 DUE 2031

This bond is one of an issue of bonds of the Company, issuable in series,
and is one of a series known as its First Mortgage Bonds of the series
designated in its title, all issued and to be issued under and equally secured
(except as to any sinking fund established in accordance with the provisions of
the Indenture hereinafter mentioned for the bonds of any particular series) by
an Indenture, dated as of August 1, 1930, executed by the Company to The Bank of
New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by indentures
supplemental thereto, to which Indenture as so amended and supplemented (herein
referred to as the "Indenture") reference is made for a description of the
property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security, the
rights of the holders of the bonds in respect thereof and the terms and
conditions upon which the bonds are secured.

 The Initial Interest Accrual Date for the bonds of this series shall be
the date that interest begins to accrue on the General Mortgage Bonds.

 The Bonds of this series are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or
in part, as the case may be, on each date that General Mortgage Bonds are to be
redeemed. The principal amount of the Bonds of this series to be redeemed on any
such date shall be equal to the principal amount General Mortgage Bonds called
for redemption on that date. All redemption of Bonds of this series shall be at
100 percent of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest to the
redemption date . The Bonds of this series are not otherwise redeemable prior to
their maturity.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bonds of this series shall be deemed to be
paid and no longer outstanding under the Indenture to the extent that General
Mortgage Bonds are paid or deemed to be paid and are no longer outstanding and
the Trustee has been notified to such effect by the Company.

 The Trustee may conclusively presume that the obligation of the Company to
pay the principal of, and interest, if any, on the bonds of this series as the
same shall become due and payable shall have been fully satisfied and discharged
unless and until it shall have received a written notice from the trustee under
the General Mortgage, signed by an authorized officer thereof, stating that any
such principal of or interest on the General Mortgage Bonds has become due and
payable and has not been fully paid and specifying the amount of funds required
to make such payment.

As more fully described in the supplemental indenture establishing the
terms and provisions of the bonds of this series, the Company reserves the
right, without any consent or other action by holders of the bonds of this
series, to amend the Indenture to provide (a) that the Indenture, the rights and
obligations of the Company and the rights of the bondholders may be modified
with the consent of the holders of not less than 60 in principal amount of the
bonds adversely affected; provided, however, that no modification shall (1)
extend the time, or reduce the amount, of any payment on any bond, without the
consent of the holder of each bond so affected, (2) permit the creation of any
lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a parity with the lien of the
Indenture, without the consent of the holders of all bonds then outstanding, or
(3) reduce the above percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of
which are required to approve any such modification without the consent of the
holders of all bonds then outstanding and (b) that (i) additional bonds may be
issued against 70 of the value of the property which forms the basis for such
issuance and (ii) the charge against property subject to a prior lien which is
used to effectuate the release of property under the Indenture be similarly
based.

 The principal hereof may be declared or may become due on the conditions,
in the manner and at the time set forth in the Indenture, upon the occurrence of
a completed default as in the Indenture provided.

 No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest
on this bond against any incorporator or any past, present or future subscriber
to the capital stock, stockholder, officer or director of the Company or of any
predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or
a predecessor or successor corporation, under any rule of law, statute or
constitution or by the enforcement of any assessment or otherwise, all such
liability of incorporators, subscribers, stockholders, officers and directors
being released by the registered owner hereof by the acceptance of this bond and
being likewise waived and released by the terms of the Indenture.

 The bonds of this series are issuable only as registered bonds without
coupons in denominations of 1,000 and any multiple thereof. The Company and the
Trustee may deem and treat the person in whose name this bond is registered as
the absolute owner for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the
principal and interest due hereon and for all other purposes. Registered bonds
of this series shall be exchangeable at said offices or agencies of the Company
for registered bonds of other authorized denominations having the same aggregate
principal amount, in the manner and upon the conditions prescribed in the
Indenture. Notwithstanding any provision of the Indenture, (a) neither the
Company nor the Trustee shall be required to make transfers or exchanges of
bonds of this series during the period between any interest payment date for
such series and the record date next preceding such interest payment date, and
(b) no charge shall be made upon any transfer or exchange of bonds of this
series other than for any tax or taxes or other governmental charge required to
be paid by the Company.

time issued thereunder, amplifying the description of the property mortgaged,

further covenants, conditions, uses and trusts in the Indenture set forth, and
the parties hereto mutually agree as follows:

 SECTION 1. Bonds of 2001 Class A Series A shall mature on June 1, 2031,
and shall be designated as the Company's "First Mortgage Bonds Class A Series A
of 2001 due 2031." Each bond of the 2001 Class A Series A shall bear interest
from the Initial Interest Accrual Date (as defined in the form of such bond
hereinabove set forth) at the rate from time to time borne by the series of the
General Mortgage Bonds referred to in said form; provided, however that in no
event shall the rate of interest borne by the bonds of the 2001 Class A Series A
exceed ten per centum per annum. Principal and interest on the bonds of the 2001
Class A Series A shall be payable in any coin or currency of the United States
of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private
debts, at an office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The
City of New York, N.Y. or in the City of Akron, Ohio.

 Definitive bonds of the 2001 Class A Series A may be issued, originally or
otherwise, only as registered bonds, substantially in the form of bond
hereinbefore recited, and in the denominations of 1,000 and any multiple
thereof. Delivery of a bond of the 2001 Class A Series A to the Trustee for
authentication shall be conclusive evidence that its serial number has been duly
approved by the Company.

 The bonds of the 2001 Class A Series A shall not be redeemable prior to
their maturity.

 SECTION 2. Bonds of the 2001 Class A Series A shall be deemed to be paid
and no longer outstanding under the Indenture to the extent that General
Mortgage Bonds to which they relate are paid or deemed to be paid and are no
longer outstanding and the Trustee has been notified to such effect by the
Company.

 The Trustee may conclusively presume that the obligation of the Company to
pay the principal of, and interest, if any, on the bonds of the 2001 Class A
Series A as the same shall become due and payable shall have been fully
satisfied and discharged unless and until it shall have received a written
notice from the trustee under the General Mortgage, signed by an authorized
officer thereof, stating that any such principal of or interest on the General
Mortgage Bonds to which they relate has become due and payable and has not been
fully paid and specifying the amount of funds required to make such payment.

 SECTION 3. Bonds of the 2001 Class A Series A may be transferred by the
registered owners thereof, in person or by attorney duly authorized, at an
office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New
York, N.Y. or in the City of Akron, Ohio but only in the manner and upon the
conditions prescribed in the Indenture and in the form of bond hereinbefore
recited. Bonds of the 2001 Class A Series A shall be exchangeable for other
registered bonds of the same series, in the manner and upon the conditions
prescribed in the Indenture, and in the form of bond hereinbefore recited, upon
the surrender of such bonds at said offices or agencies of the Company. However,
notwithstanding the provisions of Section 14 or 15 of the Indenture, no charge
shall be made upon any transfer or exchange of bonds of said series other than
for any tax or taxes or other governmental charge required to be paid by the
Company.

SECTION 4. The Company reserves the right, without any consent or other
action by holders of the bonds of the 2001 Class A Series A, or any subsequent
series of bonds, to amend the Indenture by inserting the following language as
Section 115A immediately following current Section 115 of the Indenture:

 With the consent of the holders of not less than sixty per centum
 (60 in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding or their
 attorneys-in-fact duly authorized, or, if the rights of the holders of one
 or more, but not all, series then outstanding are affected, the consent of
 the holders of not less than sixty per centum (60 in aggregate principal
 amount of the bonds at the time outstanding of all affected series, taken
 together, and not any other series, the Company, when authorized by a
 resolution, and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter
 into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of
 adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of
 the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or
 modifying the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the
 holders of any of the bonds and coupons; provided, however, that no such
 supplemental indenture shall (1) extend the maturity of any of the bonds
 or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or
 reduce the amount of the principal thereof, or reduce any premium, payable
 on the redemption thereof or change the coin or currency in which any bond
 or interest thereon is payable, without the consent of the holder of each
 bond so affected, or (2) permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise
 permitted, prior to or on a parity with the lien of this Indenture,
 without the consent of the holders of all of the bonds then outstanding,
 or (3) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the principal amount of bonds
 the holders of which are required to approve any such supplemental
 indenture, without the consent of the holders of all the bonds then
 outstanding. For the purposes of this Section, bonds shall be deemed to be
 affected by a supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture
 adversely affects or diminishes the right of holders thereof against the
 Company or against its property.

 Upon the written request of the Company, accompanied by a resolution
 authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the
 filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of bondholders as
 aforesaid (the instrument or instruments evidencing such consent to be
 dated within one year of such request), the Trustee shall join with the
 Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such
 supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's owns rights, duties or
 immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee
 may in its discretion but shall not be obligated to enter into such
 supplemental indenture. The Trustee shall be entitled to receive and,
 subject to Section 102 of the Indenture and Article Five of the Seventh
 Supplemental Indenture, may rely upon an opinion of counsel as conclusive
 evidence that any such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted
 by the provisions of this Section.

It shall not be necessary for the consent of the bondholders under
 this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental
 indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the
 substance thereof.

 The Company and the Trustee, if they so elect, and either before or
 after such 60 or greater consent has been obtained, may require the
 holder of any bond consenting to the execution of any such supplemental
 indenture to submit his bond to the Trustee or to such bank, banker or
 trust company as may be designated by the Trustee for the purpose, for the
 notation thereon of the fact that the holder of such bond has consented to
 the execution of such supplemental indenture, and in such case such
 notation, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, shall be made upon all
 bonds so submitted, and such bonds bearing such notation shall forthwith
 be returned to the persons entitled thereto. All subsequent holders of
 bonds bearing such notation shall be deemed to have consented to the
 execution of such supplemental indenture, and consent, once given or
 deemed to be given, may not be withdrawn.

 Prior to the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any
 supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the
 Company shall publish a notice, setting forth in general terms the
 substance of such supplemental indenture, at least once in one daily
 newspaper of general circulation in each city in which the principal of
 any of the bonds shall be payable, or, if all bonds outstanding shall be
 registered bonds without coupons or coupon bonds registered as to
 principal, such notice shall be sufficiently given if mailed, first class,
 postage prepaid, and registered if the Company so elects, to each
 registered holder of bonds at the last address of such holder appearing on
 the registry books, such publication or mailing, as the case may be, to be
 made not less than thirty days prior to such execution. Any failure of the
 Company to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in
 any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.

 SECTION 5. The Company reserves the right, without any consent or other
action by the holders of the bonds of the 2001 Class A Series A, or any
subsequent series of bonds, to amend the Indenture by deleting the phrase "sixty
per centum (60 )" in Section 28 of the Indenture and substituting therefor the
phrase "seventy per centum (70 )" and by deleting the phrase "One hundred
sixty-six and two-thirds per cent. (166 2/3 )" in Sections 65 and 67 of the
Indenture and substituting therefor the phrase "One hundred and forty-two and
eighty-six hundredths per cent. (142.86 )".

 SECTION 6. Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, no duties,
responsibilities or liabilities are assumed, or shall be construed to be
assumed, by the Trustee by reason of this Supplemental Indenture; the Trustee
shall not be responsible for the recitals herein or in the bonds (except the
Trustee's authentication certificate), all of which are made by the Company
solely; and this Supplemental Indenture is executed and accepted by the Trustee,
subject to all the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture, as fully to
all intents and purposes as if the terms and conditions of the Indenture were
herein set forth at length.

SECTION 7. As supplemented by this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture
is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and the Indenture as herein defined,
and this Supplemental Indenture, shall be read, taken and construed as one and
the same instrument.

 SECTION 8. Nothing in this Supplemental Indenture contained shall or shall
be construed to confer upon any person other than a holder of bonds issued under
the Indenture, the Company and the Trustee any right or interest to avail
himself of any benefit under any provision of the Indenture or of this
Supplemental Indenture.

 SECTION 9. This Supplemental Indenture may be simultaneously executed in
several counterparts and all such counterparts executed and delivered, each as
an original, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
 ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

This discussion includes forward-looking statements based on
information currently available to management that is subject to certain risks
and uncertainties. Such statements typically contain, but are not limited to,
the terms anticipate, potential, expect, believe, estimate and similar words.
Actual results may differ materially due to the speed and nature of increased
competition and deregulation in the electric utility industry, economic or
weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changes in markets for
energy services, changing energy and commodity market prices, legislative and
regulatory changes (including revised environmental requirements), and the
availability and cost of capital.

Corporate Separation
- --------------------

 Beginning on January 1, 2001, Ohio customers were able to choose
their electricity suppliers as a result of legislation which restructured the
electric utility industry. That legislation required unbundling the price for
electricity into its component elements - including generation, transmission,
distribution and transition charges. Also, Ohio utilities that offer both
competitive and regulated retail electric services were required to implement a
corporate separation plan approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
(PUCO) -- one which provides a clear separation between regulated and
competitive operations. In connection with FirstEnergy's transition plan,
FirstEnergy separated its businesses into three distinct units -- a competitive
services unit, a regulated services unit and a corporate support services unit.
Ohio Edison (OE) and Pennsylvania Power (Penn) are included in the regulated
services unit; they continue to deliver power to homes and businesses through
their existing distribution systems and maintain the "provider of last resort"
(PLR) obligations under their respective rate plans.

 As a result of the transition plan, FirstEnergy's electric utility
operating companies (EUOC) entered into power supply agreements whereby
FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. (FES) purchases all of the EUOC nuclear generation,
as well as generation from leased fossil generating facilities. FirstEnergy
Generation Corp. (FGCO), a wholly owned subsidiary of FES, leases fossil
generating units owned by the EUOC. The Ohio EUOC and Penn are "full
requirements" customers of FES to enable them to meet their PLR responsibilities
in their respective service areas. OE continues to provide power directly to
wholesale customers under previously negotiated contracts as well as to
alternative energy suppliers as part of OE's market support generation of 560
megawatts (552 megawatts committed as of December 31, 2001).

 The effect on the OE's and Penn's (OE Companies) reported results of
operations during 2001 from FirstEnergy's corporate separation plan and the OE
Companies' sale of transmission assets to American Transmission Systems, Inc.
(ATSI) in September 2000, are summarized in the following table:

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

 Earnings on common stock in 2001 increased 4.4 to 339.5 million in
2001 from 325.3 million. Excluding the effects shown in the table above,
earnings on common stock increased by 14.7 in 2001 from 2000, being favorably
affected by reduced operating expenses and taxes, and lower net interest
charges, which were substantially offset by reduced operating revenues. In 2000,
earnings on common stock increased 13.7 to 325.3 million from 286.1 million
primarily due to higher operating revenues, lower fuel expenses and reductions
in general taxes and net interest charges, which were partially offset by higher
nuclear and other operating costs.

 Excluding the effects shown in the table above, operating revenues
decreased by 208.0 million or 7.6 in 2001 from 2000 following a 39.8 million
increase in 2000 from the prior year. Customer choice in Ohio and the influence
of a declining national economy on our regional business activity combined to
lower operating revenues. Electric generation services provided by other
suppliers in the OE Companies' service area increased to 12.5 of total energy
delivered from 1.5 in 2000. Overall, retail generation sales declined in all
customer categories resulting in an overall 13.1 reduction in kilowatt-hour
sales from the prior year. As part of Ohio's electric utility restructuring law,
the implementation of a 5 reduction in generation charges for residential
customers reduced operating revenues by approximately 26.6 million in 2001,
compared to 2000. Distribution deliveries declined 2.3 in 2001 from the prior
year reflecting the impact of a weaker economy that contributed to lower
commercial and industrial kilowatt-hour sales. Operating revenues were also
lower in 2001 from the prior year due to the absence of revenues associated with
the low-income payment plan now administered by the Ohio Department of
Development; there was also a corresponding reduction in other operating costs
associated with that change. Revenues from kilowatt-hour sales to wholesale
customers declined 54.3 million in 2001 from last year, with a corresponding
42.0 reduction in kilowatt-hour sales.

 Additional kilowatt-hour sales to the wholesale market were the
largest source of the increase in operating revenues in 2000, compared to the
prior year, due to additional available generating capacity.
Transmission-related revenues also contributed to the higher operating revenues.
These increases were partially offset by lower retail sales, reflecting a
softening in the service area economy and cooler summer weather during 2000,
compared to the above-normal temperatures experienced in 1999.

2001 and by 30.5 million in 2000 from the prior year. Excluding the effects of
restructuring, total 2001 operating expenses and taxes were 236.7 million lower
than the prior year. The following table presents changes from the prior year by
expense category excluding the impact of restructuring.

 Total operating expenses and taxes.......... (236.7) 30.5
 =====================================================================

The following discussion excludes the effects shown in the preceding
table related to the impact of restructuring.

 The decrease in fuel and purchased power costs in 2001, compared to
2000, reflects the transfer of fossil operations costs to FGCO, with the OE
Companies' power requirements being provided under the PSA. In 2000, lower fuel
expense accounted for almost all of the reduction in fuel and purchased power
costs, declining 56.0 million from 1999, despite an 11.1 increase in output
from our generating units due to additional nuclear generation, the expiration
of an above-market coal contract and continued improvement in coal blending
strategies.

 Nuclear operating costs increased by 14.7 million in 2001 from the
prior year. Both 2001 and 2000 included two refueling outages; however, the
Perry Plant also experienced two forced outages in 2001. In 2000, nuclear
operating costs increased by 54.1 million due to refueling outage costs and
increased ownership of the Beaver Valley Plant following the Duquesne asset swap
in early December 1999. Other operating costs decreased 14.6 million in 2001
from the prior year reflecting a reduction in low-income payment plan customer
costs, lower storm damage costs, (the absence of costs incurred in 2000 related
to the development of a distribution communications system) reduced reserves for
uncollectible accounts and customer program expense, offset in part by the
absence in 2001 of gains from the sale of emission allowances. In 2000, other
operating costs rose 23.8 million, compared to 1999, reflecting the sale of
transmission assets to ATSI in September 2000, which resulted in new charges for
transmission services. The higher transmission costs were offset in part by
income received from ATSI under a ground lease arrangement and interest income
from the promissory note received in connection with the sale. Also contributing
to the increase in other operating costs in 2000 were higher reserves
established for potentially uncollectible accounts of customers in the steel
sector, and the cost of additional leased portable diesel generators. Partially
offsetting those higher operating costs were gains realized from the sale of
emission allowances.

 Depreciation and amortization decreased by 140.8 million in 2001
from the prior year due to lower incremental transition cost amortization and
new deferrals for shopping incentives under FirstEnergy's Ohio transition plan
compared to the accelerated cost recovery in connection with our prior
regulatory plan. Incremental transition costs recovered in 2001 and cost
recovery accelerated under OE's rate plan and Penn's restructuring plan in 2000
and 1999 are summarized by income statement caption in the table below:

 Accelerated Cost Recovery 2001 2000 1999
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (In millions)
 Depreciation and amortization........... 232.4 332.6 333.3
 Income tax amortization & other......... 41.4 42.6 18.7
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Total Accelerations..................... 273.8 375.2 352.0
 ==========================================================================

 General taxes decreased by 52.3 million in 2001 from 2000 due to
reduced property taxes and other state tax changes in connection with the Ohio
electric industry restructuring and the successful resolution of certain pending
tax issues, which resulted in a one-time benefit of 15 million. The reduction
in general taxes was partially offset by 38.0 million of new Ohio franchise
taxes in 2001, which are classified as state income taxes on the Consolidated
Statements of Income.

Other Income

 In 2000, other income increased 10.1 million, compared to the
previous year, principally due to the interest earned on long-term notes from
ATSI and short-term loans to other affiliate companies.

Net Interest Charges

 Net interest charges continued to trend lower, decreasing by 16.6
million in 2001 and by 19.4 million in 2000, compared to the prior year. We
continued to redeem and refinance our outstanding debt and preferred stock
during 2001 -- net redemptions and refinancing activities totaled 19.4 million
and 102.4 million, respectively, and will result in annualized savings of 4.1
million.

Capital Resources and Liquidity
- -------------------------------

 Our improving financial position reflects ongoing efforts to increase
competitiveness and enhance shareholder value. We have continued to strengthen
our financial position over the past five years by improving our fixed charge
coverage ratios. Our corporate indenture ratio, which is used to measure our
ability to issue first mortgage bonds, increased from 6.48 in 1996 to 7.42 in
2001, which enhances our financial flexibility. Over the same period, our
charter ratio, a measure of our ability to issue preferred stock, improved from
2.25 to 3.41 and our common stockholder's equity as a percentage of
capitalization rose from approximately 45 at the end of 1996 to 58 at the end
of 2001. Over the last five years, we have reduced the average cost of long-term
debt from 7.76 in 1996 to 6.21 at the end of 2001.

 We had about 113.2 million of cash and temporary investments and
 245.8 million of short-term indebtedness as of December 31, 2001. Our unused
borrowing capability included 250.0 million under revolving lines of credit and
 34.0 million from unused bank facilities. At the end of 2001, we had the
capability to issue 1.3 billion of additional first

mortgage bonds on the basis of property additions and retired bonds. Based upon
applicable earnings coverage tests and our respective charters, we could issue
 2.3 billion of preferred stock (assuming no additional debt was issued).

 Following approval of the merger of FirstEnergy and GPU by the New
Jersey Board of Public Utilities on September 26, 2001, Standard & Poor's
upgraded the OE Companies' corporate credit ratings from BB+ to BBB, OE's senior
secured debt rating from BB- to BBB and Penn's senior secured debt rating from
BB+ to BBB. Ratings of junior securities were also upgraded to conform to
typical rating relationships. The improved credit ratings resulted from
FirstEnergy's new consolidated credit profile following the merger. The credit
rating outlook of Standard & Poor's and Moody's are both stable for the OE
Companies.

 Our cash requirements in 2002 for operating expenses, construction
expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and preferred stock redemptions are
expected to be met without increasing our net debt and preferred stock
outstanding. Major contractual obligations for future cash payments are
summarized in the following table:

Total......................... 755 365 219 238 92 2,416 4,085
=========================================================================================================

Operating lease payments are net of capital trust receipts of 712.8 million (see Note 2).

Our capital spending for the period 2002-2006 is expected to be about
 510 million (excluding nuclear fuel) of which approximately 128 million
applies to 2002. Investments for additional nuclear fuel during the 2002-2006
period are estimated to be approximately 240 million, of which about 23
million relates to 2002. During the same periods, our nuclear fuel investments
are expected to be reduced by approximately 230 million and 47 million,
respectively, as the nuclear fuel is consumed.

 Off balance sheet obligations primarily consist of sale and leaseback
arrangements involving Perry Unit 1 and the Beaver Valley Unit 2, which are
reflected in the operating lease payments above (see Note 2 - Leases). The
present value as of December 31, 2001, of these sale and leaseback operating
lease commitments, net of trust investments, total 699 million.

Interest Rate Risk
- ------------------

 Our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is reduced
since a significant portion of our debt has fixed interest rates, as noted in
the table below. We are subject to the inherent risks related to refinancing
maturing debt by issuing new debt securities. As discussed in Note 2, our
investment in the PNBV Capital Trust effectively reduces future lease
obligations, also reducing interest rate risk. Changes in the market value of
our nuclear decommissioning trust funds are recognized by making corresponding
changes to the decommissioning liability, as described in Note 1 - Utility Plant
and Depreciation.

average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio, debt
obligations and preferred stock with mandatory redemption provisions.

Outlook
- -------

 Our industry continues to transition to a more competitive
environment. In 2001, all our customers could select alternative energy
suppliers. We continue to deliver power to homes and businesses through our
existing distribution systems, which remain regulated. Customer rates have been
restructured into separate components to support customer choice. In Ohio and
Pennsylvania, we have a continuing responsibility to provide power to those
customers not choosing to receive power from an alternative energy supplier
subject to certain limits. Adopting new approaches to regulation and
experiencing new forms of competition have created new uncertainties.

Regulatory Matters

 Beginning on January 1, 2001 Ohio customers were able to choose their
electricity suppliers. Ohio customer rates were restructured to establish
separate charges for transmission, distribution, transition cost recovery and a
generation-related component. When one of our Ohio customers elects to obtain
power from an alternative supplier, we reduce the customer's bill with a
"generation shopping credit," based on the regulated generation component (plus
an incentive for OE customers), and the customer receives a generation charge
from the alternative supplier. OE has continuing PLR responsibility to its
franchise customers through December 31, 2005.

 The transition cost portion of rates provides for recovery of certain
amounts not otherwise recoverable in a competitive generation market (such as
regulatory assets). Transition costs are paid by all customers whether or not
they choose an alternative supplier. Under the PUCO-approved transition plan, we
assumed the risk of not recovering up to 250 million of transition revenue if
the rate of customers (excluding contracts and full-service accounts) switching
from our service to an alternative supplier does not reach 20 for any
consecutive twelve-month period by December 31, 2005 - the end of the market
development period. As of December 31, 2001, the customer-switching rate, on an
annualized basis, implies that our risk of not recovering transition revenue has
been reduced to approximately 87 million. We are also committed under the
transition agreement to make available 560 MW of our generating capacity to
marketers, brokers, and aggregators at set prices, to be used for sales only to
retail customers in our Ohio service areas. Through December 31, 2001,
approximately 552 MW of the 560 MW supply commitment had been secured by
alternative suppliers. We began accepting customer applications for switching to
alternative suppliers on December 8, 2000; as of December 31, 2001 we had been
notified that over 160,000 of our customers requested generation service from
other authorized suppliers, including FES, an affiliated company.

Environmental Matters

 We are in compliance with the current sulfur dioxide (SO2) and
nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990. In 1998, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized
regulations requiring additional NOx reductions in the future from our Ohio and
Pennsylvania facilities. Various regulatory and judicial actions have since
sought to further define NOx reduction requirements (see Note 5 - Environmental
Matters). We continue to evaluate our compliance plans and other compliance
options.

 Violations of federally approved SO2 regulations can result in
shutdown of the generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of
up to 27,500 for each day a unit is in violation. The EPA has an interim
enforcement policy for SO2 regulations in Ohio that allows for compliance based
on a 30-day averaging period. We cannot predict what action the EPA may take in
the future with respect to the interim enforcement policy.

 In 1999 and 2000, the EPA issued Notices of Violation (NOV) or a
Compliance Order to nine utilities covering 44 power plants, including the W.H.
Sammis Plant. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice filed eight civil
complaints against various investor-owned utilities, which included a complaint
against the OE Companies in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Ohio. The NOV and complaint allege violations of the Clean Air Act (CAA) based
on operation and maintenance of the Sammis Plant dating back to 1984. The
complaint against the OE Companies requests the installation of "best available
control technology" as well as civil penalties of up to 27,500 per day.
Although unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings, we believe the
Sammis Plant is in full compliance with the CAA and that the NOV and complaint
are without merit. Penalties could be imposed if the Sammis Plant continues to
operate without correcting the alleged violations and a court determines that
the allegations are valid. The Sammis Plant continues to operate while these
proceedings are pending.

 In December 2000, the EPA announced it would proceed with the
development of regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants from electric
power plants. The EPA identified mercury as the hazardous air pollutant of
greatest concern. The EPA established a schedule to propose regulations by
December 2003 and issue final regulations by December 2004. The future cost of
compliance with these regulations may be substantial.

 As a result of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as
amended, and the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state
hazardous waste regulations have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel
combustion waste products, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste
disposal requirements pending the EPA's

evaluation of the need for future regulation. The EPA has issued its final
regulatory determination that regulation of coal ash as a hazardous waste is
unnecessary. In April 2000, the EPA announced that it will develop national
standards regulating disposal of coal ash under its authority to regulate
nonhazardous waste.

Legal Matters

 Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to our normal
business operations are pending against FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries. The
most significant applicable to us are described above.

Significant Accounting Policies
- -------------------------------

 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Application of
these principles often requires a high degree of judgment, estimates and
assumptions that affect our financial results. All of our assets are subject to
their own specific risks and uncertainties and are continually reviewed for
impairment. Assets related to the application of the policies discussed below
are similarly reviewed with their risks and uncertainties reflecting those
specific factors. Our more significant accounting policies are described below.

Regulatory Accounting

 The OE Companies are subject to regulation that sets the prices
(rates) we are permitted to charge our customers based on our costs that the
regulatory agencies determine we are permitted to recover. At times, regulators
permit the future recovery through rates of costs that would be currently
charged to expense by an unregulated company. This rate-making process results
in the recording of regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash inflows.
As a result of the changing regulatory framework in Ohio and Pennsylvania, a
significant amount of regulatory assets have been recorded. As of December 31,
2001, the OE Companies' regulatory assets totaled 2.2 billion. We continually
review these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved
regulatory guidelines. Impairment risk associated with these assets relates to
potentially adverse legislative, judicial or regulatory actions in the future.
As disclosed in Note 1 - Regulatory Plans, OE's full recovery of transition
costs is dependent on achieving 20 customer shopping levels in any twelve-month
period by December 31, 2005.

Revenue Recognition

 We follow the accrual method of accounting for revenues, recognizing
revenue for kilowatt-hours that have been delivered but not yet been billed
through the end of the year. The determination of unbilled revenues requires
management to make various estimates including:

 o Net energy generated or purchased for retail load
 o Losses of energy over distribution lines
 o Allocations to distribution companies within the FirstEnergy system
 o Mix of kilowatt-hour usage by residential, commercial and industrial
 customers
 o Kilowatt-hour usage of customers receiving electricity from alternative
 suppliers

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
- ------------------------------------

 In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations." The new statement provides accounting standards
for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets, with
adoption required by January 1, 2003. SFAS 143 requires that the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which
it is incurred. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of
the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. Over time the capitalized costs are
depreciated and the present value of the asset retirement liability increases
resulting in a period expense. Upon retirement, a gain or loss will be recorded
if the cost to settle the retirement obligation differs from the carrying
amount. We are currently assessing the new standard and have not yet determined
the impact on our financial statements.

 In September 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of." The Statement also supersedes the accounting and reporting
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 30, "Reporting the
Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions." Our adoption of this Statement, effective January 1, 2002, will
result in our accounting for any future impairments or disposals of long-lived
assets under the provisions of SFAS 144, but will not change the accounting
principles used in previous asset impairments or disposals. Application of SFAS
144 is not anticipated to have a major impact on the OE Companies' accounting
for impairments or disposal transactions compared to the prior application of
SFAS 121 or APB 30.

The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part
of these statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

 The consolidated financial statements include Ohio Edison Company
(Company) and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Pennsylvania Power Company (Penn)
is the Company's principal operating subsidiary. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated. The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of
FirstEnergy Corp. FirstEnergy holds directly all of the issued and outstanding
common shares of its principal electric utility operating subsidiaries,
including, the Company and The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (CEI),
The Toledo Edison Company (TE), American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI),
Jersey Central Power & Light Company (JCP&L), Metropolitan Edison Company
(Met-Ed) and Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec). JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec
were formerly wholly owned subsidiaries of GPU, Inc. which merged with
FirstEnergy on November 7, 2001.

 The Company and Penn (Companies) follow the accounting policies and
practices prescribed by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC) and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires
management to make periodic estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.

REVENUES-

 The Companies' principal business is providing electric service to
customers in central and northeastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. The
Companies' retail customers are metered on a cycle basis. Revenue is recognized
for unbilled electric service through the end of the year.

 Receivables from customers include sales to residential, commercial
and industrial customers located in the Companies' service area and sales to
wholesale customers. There was no material concentration of receivables at
December 31, 2001 or 2000, with respect to any particular segment of the
Companies' customers.

REGULATORY PLANS-

 Ohio's 1999 electric utility restructuring law allowed Ohio electric
customers to select their generation suppliers beginning January 1, 2001,
provided for a five percent reduction on the generation portion of residential
customers' bills and the opportunity for utilities to recover transition costs,
including regulatory assets. Under this law, the PUCO approved FirstEnergy's
transition plan in 2000 as modified by a settlement agreement with major parties
to the transition plan, which it filed on behalf of the Company, CEI and TE. The
settlement agreement included approval for recovery of the amounts of transition
costs filed in the transition plan through no later than 2006 for the Company,
except where a longer period of recovery is provided for in the settlement
agreement. The settlement also granted preferred access over FirstEnergy's
subsidiaries to nonaffiliated marketers, brokers and aggregators to 560
megawatts of generation capacity through 2005 at established prices for sales to
the Company's retail customers. The Company's base electric rates for
distribution service under its prior regulatory plan were extended from December
31, 2005 through December 31, 2007. The transition rate credits for customers
under its prior regulatory plan was also extended through the Company's
transition cost recovery period.

 The transition plan itemized, or unbundled, the current price of
electricity into its component elements -- including generation, transmission,
distribution and transition charges. As required by the PUCO's rules,
FirstEnergy's transition plan also resulted in the corporate separation of its
regulated and unregulated operations, operational and technical support changes
needed to accommodate customer choice, an education program to inform customers
of their options under the law, and planned changes in how FirstEnergy's
transmission system will be operated to ensure access to all users. Customer
prices are frozen through a five-year market development period (2001-2005),
except for certain limited statutory exceptions including a 5 reduction in the
price of generation for residential customers.

 The Company's customers electing alternative suppliers receive an
additional incentive applied to the shopping credit of 45 for residential
customers, 30 for commercial customers and 15 for industrial customers. The
amount of the incentive serves to reduce the amortization of transition costs
during the market development period and will be recovered through the extension
of the transition cost recovery period. If the customer shopping goals
established in the agreement were not achieved by the end of 2005, the
transition cost recovery period could have been shortened for the Company to
reduce recovery by as much as 250 million, but any such adjustment would be
computed on a class-by-class and pro-rata basis. Based on annualized shopping
levels as of December 31, 2001, the Company believes that the maximum potential
recovery reduction was approximately 87 million.

Pennsylvania enacted its electric utility competition law in 1996
with the phase-in of customer choice for generation suppliers completed as of
January 1, 2001. In 1998, the PPUC authorized a rate restructuring plan for
Penn, which essentially resulted in the deregulation of Penn's generation
business.

 The application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS 71),
to the Company's generation business was discontinued with the issuance of the
PUCO transition plan order and in 1998 to Penn's generation business. The
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued interpretive guidance regarding
asset impairment measurement concluding that any supplemental regulated cash
flows such as a competitive transition charge (CTC) should be excluded from the
cash flows of assets in a portion of the business not subject to regulatory
accounting practices. If those assets are impaired, a regulatory asset should be
established if the costs are recoverable through regulatory cash flows.
Consistent with the SEC guidance, 1.2 billion of impaired plant investments
were recognized by the Company as regulatory assets recoverable as transition
costs through future regulatory cash flows and 227 million were recognized for
Penn related to its 1998 impairment of its nuclear generating unit investments
to be recovered through a CTC over a seven-year transition period.

 Net assets included in utility plant relating to the operations for
which the application of SFAS 71 was discontinued, compared to the respective
company's total assets as of December 31, 2001 were 984 million and 7.218
billion, respectively, for the Company and 88 million and 960 million,
respectively, for Penn.

 All of the Companies' regulatory assets are expected to continue to
be recovered under provisions of the Ohio transition plan and the Pennsylvania
rate restructuring plan. Under the previous regulatory plan, the PUCO had
authorized the Company to recognize additional capital recovery related to its
generating assets (which was reflected as additional depreciation expense) and
additional amortization of regulatory assets during the prior regulatory plan
period of at least 2 billion, and the PPUC had authorized Penn to accelerate at
least 358 million more than the amounts that would have been recognized if the
prior regulatory plans were not in effect. These additional amounts were being
recovered through rates. Under the Company's prior regulatory plan, which was
terminated at the end of 2000, and Penn's rate restructuring plan, the
Companies' cumulative additional capital recovery and regulatory asset
amortization amounted to 1.424 billion.

UTILITY PLANT AND DEPRECIATION-

 Utility plant reflects the original cost of construction (except for
the Companies' nuclear generating units which were adjusted to fair value as
discussed above), including payroll and related costs such as taxes, employee
benefits, administrative and general costs, and interest costs.

 The Companies provide for depreciation on a straight-line basis at
various rates over the estimated lives of property included in plant in service.
The annual composite rate for the Company's electric plant was approximately
2.7 in 2001, 2.8 in 2000 and 3.0 in 1999. The annual composite rate for
Penn's electric plant was approximately 2.9 in 2001, 2.6 in 2000 and 2.5 in
1999.

 Annual depreciation expense in 2001 included approximately 31.5
million for future decommissioning costs applicable to the Companies' ownership
and leasehold interests in three nuclear generating units. The 2001 amounts
reflected an increase of approximately 24 million from implementing the
Company's transition plan in 2001. The Companies' share of the future obligation
to decommission these units is approximately 841 million in current dollars and
(using a 4.0 escalation rate) approximately 1.9 billion in future dollars. The
estimated obligation and the escalation rate were developed based on site
specific studies. Payments for decommissioning are expected to begin in 2016,
when actual decommissioning work is expected to begin. The Companies have
recovered approximately 129 million for decommissioning through their electric
rates from customers through December 31, 2001. The Companies have also
recognized an estimated liability of approximately 14.0 million related to
decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear enrichment facilities operated by
the United States Department of Energy, as required by the Energy Policy Act of
1992.

 In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS
143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The new statement provides
accounting treatment for retirement obligations associated with tangible
long-lived assets with adoption required as of January 1, 2003. SFAS 143
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation
be recorded in the period in which it is incurred. The associated asset
retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset. Over time the capitalized costs are depreciated and the
present value of the asset retirement liability increases, resulting in a period
expense. Upon retirement, a gain or loss will be recorded if the cost to settle
the retirement obligation differs from the carrying amount. Under the new
standard, additional assets and liabilities relating principally to nuclear
decommissioning obligations will be recorded, the pattern of expense recognition
will change and income from the external decommissioning trust will be recorded
as investment income. The Company is currently assessing the new standard and
has not yet quantified the impact on its financial statements.

COMMON OWNERSHIP OF GENERATING FACILITIES-

 The Companies, together with CEI and TE, own and/or lease, as tenants
in common, various power generating facilities. Each of the companies is
obligated to pay a share of the costs associated with any jointly owned facility
in the same proportion as its interest. The Companies' portions of operating
expenses associated with jointly owned facilities are included in the
corresponding operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The
amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under utility plant at
December 31, 2001 include the following:

===============================================================================================================

NUCLEAR FUEL-

 Nuclear fuel is recorded at original cost, which includes material,
enrichment, fabrication and interest costs incurred prior to reactor load. The
Companies amortize the cost of nuclear fuel based on the rate of consumption.

INCOME TAXES-

 Details of the total provision for income taxes are shown on the
Consolidated Statements of Taxes. Deferred income taxes result from timing
differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and accounting
purposes. Investment tax credits, which were deferred when utilized, are being
amortized over the recovery period of the related property. The liability method
is used to account for deferred income taxes. Deferred income tax liabilities
related to tax and accounting basis differences are recognized at the statutory
income tax rates in effect when the liabilities are expected to be paid. The
Companies are included in FirstEnergy's consolidated federal income tax return.
The consolidated tax liability is allocated on a "stand-alone" company basis,
with the Companies recognizing any tax losses or credits they contributed to the
consolidated return.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS-

 FirstEnergy's trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan
covers almost all of the Companies' full-time employees. Upon retirement,
employees receive a monthly pension based on length of service and compensation.
On December 31, 2001, the GPU pension plans were merged with the FirstEnergy
plan. The Companies use the projected unit credit method for funding purposes
and were not required to make pension contributions during the three years ended
December 31, 2001. The assets of the FirstEnergy pension plan consist primarily
of common stocks, United States government bonds and corporate bonds. The
FirstEnergy and GPU postretirement benefit plans are currently separately
maintained; the information shown below is aggregated as of December 31, 2001.

 The Companies provide a minimum amount of noncontributory life
insurance to retired employees in addition to optional contributory insurance.
Health care benefits, which include certain employee deductibles and copayments,
are also available to retired employees, their dependents and, under certain
circumstances, their survivors. The Companies pay insurance premiums to cover a
portion of these benefits in excess of set limits; all amounts up to the limits
are paid by the Companies. The Companies recognize the expected cost of
providing other postretirement benefits to employees and their beneficiaries and
covered dependents from the time employees are hired until they become eligible
to receive those benefits.

 The following sets forth the funded status of the plans and amounts
recognized on FirstEnergy's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31:

The composite health care trend rate assumption is approximately 10 
in 2002, 9 in 2003 and 8 in 2004, trending to 4 -6 in later years. Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported
for the health care plan. An increase in the health care trend rate assumption
by one percentage point would increase the total service and interest cost
components by 14.6 million and the postretirement benefit obligation by 151.2
million. A decrease in the same assumption by one percentage point would
decrease the total service and interest cost components by 12.7 million and the
postretirement benefit obligation by 131.3 million.

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES-

 Operating revenues, operating expenses and other income include
transactions with affiliated companies, primarily CEI, TE, ATSI, FirstEnergy
Solutions Corp. (FES) and FirstEnergy. The Ohio transition plan, as discussed in
the "Regulatory Plans" section, resulted in the corporate separation of
FirstEnergy's regulated and unregulated operations in 2001. Unregulated
operations under FES now operate the generation businesses of the Companies, CEI
and TE. As a result, the Companies entered into power supply agreements (PSA)
whereby FES purchases all of the Companies' nuclear generation and the Companies
purchase their power from FES to meet their "provider of last resort"
obligations. The primary affiliated companies transactions, including the
effects of the PSA beginning in 2001, the sale and leaseback of the Companies'
transmission assets to ATSI in September 2000 and FirstEnergy's providing
support services at cost, are as follows:

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOWS INFORMATION-

 All temporary cash investments purchased with an initial maturity of
three months or less are reported as cash equivalents on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at cost, which approximates their fair market value. Noncash
financing and investing activities included capital lease transactions amounting
to 1.3 million and 1.4 million for the years 2000 and 1999, respectively.
There were no capital lease transactions in 2001. Commercial paper transactions
of OES Fuel, Incorporated (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) that have
initial maturity periods of three months or less are reported net within
financing activities under long-term debt and are reflected as currently payable
long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in anticipation of the
expiration of the related long-term financing agreement in March 2002 (see Note
3F).

 All borrowings with initial maturities of less than one year are
defined as financial instruments under GAAP and are reported on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at cost, which approximates their fair market value. The
following sets forth the approximate fair value and related carrying amounts of
all other long-term debt, preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption and
investments other than cash and cash equivalents as of December 31:

 =======================================================================================================

The fair values of long-term debt and preferred stock reflect the
present value of the cash outflows relating to those securities based on the
current call price, the yield to maturity or the yield to call, as deemed
appropriate at the end of each respective year. The yields assumed were based on
securities with similar characteristics offered by a corporation with credit
ratings similar to the Companies' ratings.

 The fair value of investments other than cash and cash equivalents
represent cost (which approximates fair value) or the present value of the cash
inflows based on the yield to maturity. The yields assumed were based on
financial instruments with similar characteristics and terms. Investments other
than cash and cash equivalents include decommissioning trust investments.
Unrealized gains and losses applicable to the decommissioning trusts have been
recognized in the trust investment with corresponding changes to the
decommissioning liability. The Companies have no securities held for trading
purposes.

REGULATORY ASSETS-

 The Companies recognize, as regulatory assets, costs which the FERC,
PUCO and PPUC have authorized for recovery from customers in future periods.
Without such authorization, the costs would have been charged to income as
incurred. All regulatory assets are expected to continue to be recovered from
customers under the Companies' respective transition and rate restructuring
plans. Based on those plans, the Companies continue to bill and collect
cost-based rates for their transmission and distribution services, which remain
regulated; accordingly, it is appropriate that the Companies continue the
application of SFAS 71 to those operations. The Companies also recognized
additional cost recovery of 270 million in 2000 and 257 million in 1999, as
additional regulatory asset amortization in accordance with their prior Ohio and
current Pennsylvania regulatory plans. The Companies recognized incremental
transition cost recovery aggregating 274 million in 2001 in accordance with the
current Ohio transition plan and Pennsylvania restructuring plan.

 Net regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are
comprised of the following:

2. LEASES

 The Companies lease certain generating facilities, office space and
other property and equipment under cancelable and noncancelable leases.

 The Company sold portions of its ownership interest in Perry Unit 1
and Beaver Valley Unit 2 and entered into operating leases on the portions sold
for basic lease terms of approximately 29 years. During the terms of the leases,
the Company continues to be responsible, to the extent of its individual
combined ownership and leasehold interests, for costs associated with the units
including construction expenditures, operation and maintenance expenses,
insurance, nuclear fuel, property taxes and decommissioning. The Company has the
right, at the end of the respective basic lease terms, to renew the leases for
up to two years. The Company also has the right to purchase the facilities at
the expiration of the basic lease term or renewal term (if elected) at a price
equal to the fair market value of the facilities. The basic rental payments are
adjusted when applicable federal tax law changes.

 OES Finance, Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
maintains deposits pledged as collateral to secure reimbursement obligations
relating to certain letters of credit supporting the Company's obligations to
lessors under the Beaver Valley Unit 2 sale and leaseback arrangements. The
deposits pledged to the financial institution providing those letters of credit
are the sole property of OES Finance. In the event of liquidation, OES Finance,
as a separate corporate entity, would have to satisfy its obligations to
creditors before any of its assets could be made available to the Company as
sole owner of OES Finance common stock.

 Consistent with the regulatory treatment, the rentals for capital and
operating leases are charged to operating expenses on the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Such costs for the three years ended December 31, 2001,
are summarized as follows:

 2001 2000 1999

The Company invested in the PNBV Capital Trust, which was established
to purchase a portion of the lease obligation bonds issued on behalf of lessors
in the Company's Perry Unit 1 and Beaver Valley Unit 2 sale and leaseback
transactions. The PNBV capital trust arrangement effectively reduces lease costs
related to those transactions.

3. CAPITALIZATION:

 (A) RETAINED EARNINGS-

 Under the Company's first mortgage indenture, the Company's
consolidated retained earnings unrestricted for payment of cash dividends on the
Company's common stock were 505.5 million at December 31, 2001.

 (B) EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN-

 FirstEnergy funds the matching contribution for its 401(k) savings
plan through an ESOP Trust. All of the Companies' full-time employees eligible
for participation in the 401(k) savings plan are covered by the ESOP. The ESOP
borrowed 200 million from the Company and acquired 10,654,114 shares of the
Company's common stock (subsequently converted to FirstEnergy common stock)
through market purchases. The ESOP loan is included in Other Property and
Investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2001 and 2000
as an investment with FirstEnergy related to the FirstEnergy savings plan.
Dividends on ESOP shares are used to service the debt. Shares are released from
the ESOP on a pro rata basis as debt service payments are made.

 (C) STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS-

 Employees of the Company participate in the FirstEnergy Executive and
Director Incentive Compensation Plan (FE Plan) administered by FirstEnergy.
Under the FE Plan, total awards cannot exceed 15 million shares of common stock
or their equivalent. Only stock options and restricted stock have been granted,
with vesting periods ranging from six months to seven years.

 Under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, covered employees can
direct a portion of their Annual Incentive Award and/or Long Term Incentive
Award into an unfunded FirstEnergy Stock Account to receive vested stock units.
An additional 20 premium is received in the form of stock units based on the
amount allocated to the FirstEnergy Stock Account. Dividends are calculated
quarterly on stock units outstanding and are paid in the form of additional
stock units. Upon withdrawal, stock units are converted to FirstEnergy shares.
Payout occurs three years from the date of deferral.

 The Company continues to apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." As required by SFAS 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," the Company has determined pro forma
earnings as though the Company had accounted for employee stock options under
the fair value method. The weighted average assumptions used in valuing the
options and their resulting fair values are as follows:

2001 2000 1999
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Valuation assumptions:
 Expected option term (years) 8.3 7.6 6.4
 Expected volatility......... 23.45 21.77 20.03 
 Expected dividend yield..... 5.00 6.68 5.97 
 Risk-free interest rate..... 4.67 5.28 5.97 
 Fair value per option......... 4.97 2.86 3.42
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The following table summarizes the pro forma effect of applying fair
value accounting to the Company's stock options.

 2001 2000 1999
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Earnings on Common Stock (000)
 As Reported................. 339,510 325,332 286,142
 Pro Forma................... 338,866 324,761 285,963
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(D) PREFERRED AND PREFERENCE STOCK-

 Penn's 7.75 series of preferred stock has a restriction which
prevents early redemption prior to July 2003. All other preferred stock may be
redeemed by the Companies in whole, or in part, with 30-60 days' notice.

 The Company has eight million authorized and unissued shares of
preference stock having no par value.

 (E) PREFERRED STOCK SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION-

 Penn's 7.625 series has an annual sinking fund requirement for 7,500
shares beginning on October 1, 2002.

 The Companies' preferred shares are retired at 100 per share plus
accrued dividends. Annual sinking fund requirements are approximately 750,000
in each year 2002-2006.

 (F) COMPANY OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED
 SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY TRUST HOLDING SOLELY COMPANY
 SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES-

 Ohio Edison Financing Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, has issued 120 million of 9 Cumulative Trust Preferred Capital
Securities. The Company purchased all of the Trust's Common Securities and
simultaneously issued to the Trust 123.7 million principal amount of 9 Junior
Subordinated Debentures due 2025 in exchange for the proceeds that the Trust
received from its sale of Preferred and Common Securities. The sole assets of
the Trust are the Subordinated Debentures whose interest and other payment dates
coincide with the distribution and other payment dates on the Trust Securities.
Under certain circumstances the Subordinated Debentures could be distributed to
the holders of the outstanding Trust Securities in the event the Trust is
liquidated. The Subordinated Debentures may be optionally redeemed by the
Company at a redemption price of 25 per Subordinated Debenture plus accrued
interest, in which event the Trust Securities will be redeemed on a pro rata
basis at 25 per share plus accumulated distributions. The Company's obligations
under the Subordinated Debentures along with the related Indenture, amended and
restated Trust Agreement, Guarantee Agreement and the Agreement for expenses and
liabilities, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of
payments due on the Preferred Securities.

 (G) LONG-TERM DEBT-

 The first mortgage indentures and their supplements, which secure all
of the Companies' first mortgage bonds, serve as direct first mortgage liens on
substantially all property and franchises, other than specifically excepted
property, owned by the Companies.

 Based on the amount of bonds authenticated by the Trustees through
December 31, 2001, the Companies' annual sinking and improvement fund
requirements for all bonds issued under the mortgage amounts to 31 million. The
Companies expect to deposit funds in 2002 that will be withdrawn upon the
surrender for cancellation of a like principal amount of bonds, which are
specifically authenticated for such purposes against unfunded property additions
or against previously retired bonds. This method can result in minor increases
in the amount of the annual sinking fund requirement.

 Sinking fund requirements for first mortgage bonds and maturing
long-term debt (excluding capital leases) for the next five years are:

(In millions)
 ----------------------------------------------
 2002................................. 574.8
 2003................................. 379.0
 2004................................. 258.3
 2005................................. 136.8
 2006................................. 5.6
 --------------------------------------------

 The Companies' obligations to repay certain pollution control revenue
bonds are secured by several series of first mortgage bonds. Certain pollution
control revenue bonds are entitled to the benefit of irrevocable bank letters of
credit of 171.5 million and noncancelable municipal bond insurance policies of
 238.9 million to pay principal of, or interest on, the pollution control
revenue bonds. To the extent that drawings are made under the letters of credit,
the Companies are entitled to a credit against their obligation to repay those
bonds. The Companies pay annual fees of 1.10 to 1.375 of the amounts of the
letters of credit to the issuing banks and are obligated to reimburse the banks
for any drawings thereunder.

 The Company has a 250 million long-term revolving credit facility
agreement (with no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2001) which expires
November 18, 2002. The Company must pay an annual fee of 0.20 on the total
credit facility amount. In addition, the credit agreement provides that the
Company maintain unused first mortgage bond capability for the full credit
agreement amount under the Company's indenture as potential security for the
unsecured borrowings.

 Nuclear fuel purchases are financed through the issuance of OES Fuel
commercial paper and loans, both of which are supported by a 141.5 million
long-term bank credit agreement which expires March 31, 2002. The Company does
not anticipate extending the credit agreement. Accordingly, the commercial paper
and loans are reflected as currently payable long-term debt on the December 31,
2001 Consolidated Balance Sheet. OES Fuel must pay an annual facility fee of
0.20 on the total line of credit and an annual commitment fee of 0.0625 on any
unused amount.

4. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND BANK LINES OF CREDIT:

 Short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2001, consisted
of 60.0 million of bank borrowings and 159.8 million of OES Capital,
Incorporated commercial paper. OES Capital is a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company whose borrowings are secured by customer accounts receivable. OES
Capital can borrow up to 170 million under a receivables financing agreement at
rates based on certain bank commercial paper and is required to pay an annual
fee of 0.20 on the amount of the entire finance limit. The receivables
financing agreement expires in 2002. As of December 31, 2001, the Company also
had total short-term borrowings of 26.1 million from its affiliates. The
weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings outstanding as of
December 31, 2001 and 2000, were 2.45 and 6.93 , respectively.

 The Company has lines of credit with domestic banks that provide for
borrowings of up to 34 million under various interest rate options. Short-term
borrowings may be made under these lines of credit on its unsecured notes. To
assure the availability of these lines, the Company is required to pay annual
commitment fees of 0.15 to 0.20 . These lines expire at various times during
2002.

5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES-

 The Companies' current forecasts reflect expenditures of
approximately 510 million for property additions and improvements from
2002-2006, of which approximately 128 million is applicable to 2002.
Investments for additional nuclear fuel during the 2002-2006 period are
estimated to be approximately 240 million, of which approximately 23 million
applies to 2002. During the same periods, the Companies' nuclear fuel
investments are expected to be reduced by approximately 230 million and 47
million, respectively, as the nuclear fuel is consumed.

NUCLEAR INSURANCE-

 The Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability relative to a
single incident at a nuclear power plant to 9.5 billion. The amount is covered
by a combination of private insurance and an industry retrospective rating plan.
Based on their ownership and leasehold interests in the Beaver Valley Station
and the Perry Plant, the Companies' maximum potential assessment under the
industry retrospective rating plan (assuming the other affiliate co-owners
contribute their proportionate shares of any assessments under the retrospective
rating plan) would be 168.2 million per incident but not more than 19.1
million in any one year for each incident.

 The Companies are also insured as to their respective interests in
Beaver Valley and Perry under policies issued to the operating company for each
plant. Under these policies, up to 2.75 billion is provided for property damage
and decontamination and decommissioning costs. The Companies have also obtained
approximately 537 million

of insurance coverage for replacement power costs for their respective interests
in Beaver Valley and Perry. Under these policies, the Companies can be assessed
a maximum of approximately 33.1 million for incidents at any covered nuclear
facility occurring during a policy year which are in excess of accumulated funds
available to the insurer for paying losses.

 The Companies intend to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as
described above as long as it is available. To the extent that replacement
power, property damage, decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement
costs and other such costs arising from a nuclear incident at any of the
Companies' plants exceed the policy limits of the insurance in effect with
respect to that plant, to the extent a nuclear incident is determined not to be
covered by the Companies' insurance policies, or to the extent such insurance
becomes unavailable in the future, the Companies would remain at risk for such
costs.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS-

 Various federal, state and local authorities regulate the Companies
with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters. In
accordance with the Ohio transition plan discussed in "Regulatory Plans" in Note
1, generation operations and any related additional capital expenditures for
environmental compliance are the responsibility of FirstEnergy's competitive
services business unit.

 The Companies are required to meet federally approved sulfur dioxide
(SO2) regulations. Violations of such regulations can result in shutdown of the
generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of up to 27,500 for
each day the unit is in violation. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
an interim enforcement policy for SO2 regulations in Ohio that allows for
compliance based on a 30-day averaging period. The Companies cannot predict what
action the EPA may take in the future with respect to the interim enforcement
policy.

 The Companies are in compliance with the current SO2 and nitrogen
oxides (NOx) reduction requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
SO2 reductions are being achieved by burning lower-sulfur fuel, generating more
electricity from lower-emitting plants, and/or using emission allowances. NOx
reductions are being achieved through combustion controls and the generation of
more electricity at lower-emitting plants. In September 1998, the EPA finalized
regulations requiring additional NOx reductions from the Companies' Ohio and
Pennsylvania facilities. The EPA's NOx Transport Rule imposes uniform reductions
of NOx emissions (an approximate 85 reduction in utility plant NOx emissions
from projected 2007 emissions) across a region of nineteen states and the
District of Columbia, including Ohio and Pennsylvania, based on a conclusion
that such NOx emissions are contributing significantly to ozone pollution in the
eastern United States. State Implementation Plans (SIP) must comply by May 31,
2004 with individual state NOx budgets established by the EPA. Pennsylvania
submitted a SIP that requires compliance with the NOx budgets at the Companies'
Pennsylvania facilities by May 1, 2003 and Ohio submitted a "draft" SIP that
requires compliance with the NOx budgets at the Companies' Ohio facilities by
May 31, 2004. FirstEnergy continues to evaluate its compliance plans and other
compliance options.

 In July 1997, the EPA promulgated changes in the National Ambient Air
Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone emissions and proposed a new NAAQS for
previously unregulated ultra-fine particulate matter. In May 1999, the U.S.
Court of Appeals found constitutional and other defects in the new NAAQS rules.
In February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the new NAAQS rules regulating
ultra-fine particulates but found defects in the new NAAQS rules for ozone and
decided that the EPA must revise those rules. The future cost of compliance with
these regulations may be substantial and will depend if and how they are
ultimately implemented by the states in which the Companies operate affected
facilities.

 In 1999 and 2000, the EPA issued Notices of Violation (NOV) or a
Compliance Order to nine utilities covering 44 power plants, including the W. H.
Sammis Plant. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice filed eight civil
complaints against various investor-owned utilities, which included a complaint
against the Companies in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Ohio. The NOV and complaint allege violations of the Clean Air Act based on
operation and maintenance of the Sammis Plant dating back to 1984. The complaint
requests permanent injunctive relief to require the installation of "best
available control technology" and civil penalties of up to 27,500 per day of
violation. Although unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings, the
Companies believe the Sammis Plant is in full compliance with the Clean Air Act
and the NOV and complaints are without merit. Penalties could be imposed if the
Sammis Plant continues to operate without correcting the alleged violations and
a court determines that the allegations are valid. The Sammis Plant continues to
operate while these proceedings are pending.

 In December 2000, the EPA announced it would proceed with the
development of regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants from electric
power plants. The EPA identified mercury as the hazardous air pollutant of
greatest concern. The EPA established a schedule to propose regulations by
December 2003 and issue final regulations by December 2004. The future cost of
compliance with these regulations may be substantial.

 As a result of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as
amended, and the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state
hazardous waste regulations have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel
combustion waste products, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste
disposal requirements pending the

EPA's evaluation of the need for future regulation. The EPA has issued its final
regulatory determination that regulation of coal ash as a hazardous waste is
unnecessary. In April 2000, the EPA announced that it will develop national
standards regulating disposal of coal ash under its authority to regulate
nonhazardous waste.

LEGAL MATTERS-

 Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to the Companies'
normal business operations are pending against FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries.
The most significant applicable to the Companies are described above.

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Ohio Edison Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
statements of capitalization of Ohio Edison Company (an Ohio corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp.) and subsidiaries as of December
31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, common
stockholder's equity, preferred stock, cash flows and taxes for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Ohio Edison Company and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

electronic or other communications, notice shall be given by personal delivery
or by mail addressed to the shareholder at his last address as it appears on the
records of the Corporation. Any shareholder may waive in writing notice of any

shareholders, the shareholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time,
without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be

the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or

vote or, if a record date is set by the Board of Directors, as of such record
date.

Section 8. Voting by Proxy.
- ---------- ----------------

 At any meeting of the shareholders, any shareholder may be represented and
vote by a proxy or proxies appointed by an instrument in writing or by any other
form of verifiable communication, including any form of electronic or other
communications, to the full extent legally permitted (now or hereafter). In the
event that any such instrument shall designate two or more persons to act as
proxies, a majority of such persons present at the meeting, or, if only one

conferred by such instrument upon all of the persons so designated unless the
instrument shall otherwise provide. No such proxy shall be valid after the
expiration of eleven (11) months from the date of its execution, unless coupled
with an interest, or unless the person executing it specifies therein the length

of time for which it is to continue in force. Subject to the above, any proxy
duly executed is not revoked and continues in full force and effect until an
instrument or verifiable communication revoking it or a duly executed proxy
bearing a later date is filed with the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation.

- ---------- -----------------------------------------

 Any action which may be taken by the vote of the shareholders at a meeting
may be taken without a meeting if authorized by the written consent of the

greater proportion of written consents shall be required. Such written consent
shall be filed with or entered upon the records of the Corporation.

these Regulations directed or required to be exercised or done by the
shareholders.

 (b) Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board

Directors or (b) by action of the Board of Directors at a meeting by the vote of
a majority of the Directors in office at the time or in a writing signed by all
the Directors in office at the time. When so fixed, such number shall continue
to be the authorized number of Directors until changed by the shareholders or
Directors in the manner described above. Any increase in the number of Directors
shall be deemed to create a vacancy or vacancies which may be filled as provided
in Section 14. A reduction in the number of Directors shall not be applied to
remove any Director from office prior to the expiration of his term. Directors
need not be shareholders of the Corporation.

Section 12. Election of Directors.

 At each meeting of the shareholders for the election of Directors, the
persons receiving the greatest number of votes shall be the Directors. Such
elections shall be by ballot whenever requested by any person entitled to vote
at such meeting; but unless so requested, such election may be conducted in any
way approved at such meeting.

Section 13. Term of Office; Removal; Resignations.

 (b) Any Director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed upon the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
Corporation.

 (c) Any Director may resign at any time by giving written notice of his
resignation to the President or Corporate Secretary. Any resignation will be
effective upon actual receipt by such person or, if later, as of the date and
time specified in such written notice.

Section 14. Vacancies.
- ----------- ----------

 Vacancies, including those caused by an increase in the number of
Directors, may be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors though less
than a quorum. When one or more Directors shall give notice of his or their
resignation to the Board, effective at a future date, the Board shall have the
power to fill such vacancy or vacancies to take effect when such resignation or
resignations shall become effective, each Director so appointed to hold office
during the remainder of the term of office of the resigning Director or
Directors. Whenever any vacancy shall occur among the Directors, the remaining
Directors shall constitute the Directors of the Corporation until such vacancy
is filled or until the number of Directors is changed as in Section 11 hereof.

MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

meeting at the same place or at such other time and place as may be fixed by the
shareholders at such meeting, for the purpose of electing officers and
transacting any other business. Notice of such meeting need not be given. If for

each such meeting shall be given to each Director by letter, facsimile,
telegram, telephone, or in person not less than forty-eight (48) hours prior to
such meeting. Notices sent by mail shall be sent postage prepaid and shall be
addressed to each Director at his address as it appears upon the records of the
Corporation. Notice by mail shall be deemed to be given at the time when the
notice is deposited in the mail, and notice by facsimile or telegram shall be
deemed to be given at the time when confirmation of successful transmission is
received. Such notice may be waived in writing by Directors either before or
after the meeting, and such written waivers shall be filed with or entered upon
the records of the meeting. The attendance of any Director at any such meeting
without protesting the lack of proper notice, prior to or at the commencement of

present shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise
specifically provided by statute or by the Articles of Incorporation. Any action
required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Directors may be taken
without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken,
shall be signed by all of the Directors entitled to vote with respect to the
subject matter thereof. Any meeting duly called, whether or not a quorum is
present, may, by vote of a majority of the Directors present, be adjourned from
time to time and place to place within or without the State of Ohio, in which
case no further notice of the adjourned meeting need be given.

 (b) Meetings of the Board of Directors or of any committee of the Board of
Directors may be held through any means of communications equipment if all
persons participating can hear each other, and such participation will
constitute presence in person at such meeting.

Section 19. Committees.
- ----------- -----------

 The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the
Directors, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or
more of the Directors of the Corporation, which, to the extent provided in the
resolution, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of Directors in
the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation. Such committee or

committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time
by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. The committees shall keep
regular minutes of their proceedings and report the same to the Board when
required.

Section 20. Compensation.

 The Directors may be paid their expenses, if any, for attendance at each
meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at
each meeting of the Board of Directors. The sums may be different for different
Directors, and the sum shall be established by resolution of the Board of
Directors and may be changed from time to time by resolution. No such payment

and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees
may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

Section 21. Executive Committee
- ----------- -------------------

 The Board of Directors at any time may elect from its members an Executive
Committee which shall consist of not less than three (3) members. Each member of
such Committee shall hold office during the pleasure of the Board and may be
removed by a majority vote of the whole Board at any time with or without cause.
Vacancies occurring in the Committee may be filled by the Board. The Committee
shall prescribe its own rules for calling and holding meetings, and for
transacting business, subject, however, to any rules prescribed by the Board of
Directors, and the Committee shall keep minutes of its actions. Action by the
Committee may be taken at meetings thereof attended by not less than a majority
thereof, or without a meeting by instrument in writing signed by not less than a
majority of the members. Except as the Committee's powers and duties may be
limited or otherwise prescribed by the Board of Directors, the Committee, during
the intervals between the meetings of the Board, shall possess and may exercise
all of the powers and authority of the Board of Directors, however conferred,
provided, however, that the Committee shall not be empowered to elect the
officers (other than Assistant Secretaries and Assistant Treasurers) or to fill
vacancies in the Board of Directors or in the Executive Committee. Subject to
such exceptions, persons dealing with the Corporation shall be entitled to rely
upon any action of the Committee with the same force and effect as though such
action had been taken by the Board of Directors.

lieu of the actual signatures. In case any officer or officers who shall have
signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used on, any
such certificate or certificates shall cease to be an officer or officers of the
Corporation, whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such
certificate or certificates shall have been delivered by the Corporation, such
certificate or certificates may nevertheless be adopted by the Corporation and

have been used thereon, had not ceased to be an officer or officers of such
Corporation.

lost or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or
certificates, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost or destroyed
certificate or certificates, or his legal representative, to advertise the same

THE CLEVELAND ELECTRIC ILLUMINATING COMPANY

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
 ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

This discussion includes forward-looking statements based on
information currently available to management that is subject to certain risks
and uncertainties. Such statements typically contain, but are not limited to,
the terms anticipate, potential, expect, believe, estimate and similar words.
Actual results may differ materially due to the speed and nature of increased
competition and deregulation in the electric utility industry, economic or
weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changes in markets for
energy services, changing energy and commodity market prices, legislative and
regulatory changes (including revised environmental requirements), and the
availability and cost of capital.

Corporate Separation
- --------------------

 Beginning on January 1, 2001, Ohio customers were able to choose
their electricity suppliers as a result of legislation which restructured the
electric utility industry. That legislation required unbundling the price for
electricity into its component elements - including generation, transmission,
distribution and transition charges. Also, Ohio utilities that offer both
competitive and regulated retail electric services were required to implement a
corporate separation plan approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
(PUCO) -- one which provides a clear separation between regulated and
competitive operations. In connection with FirstEnergy's transition plan,
FirstEnergy separated its businesses into three distinct units -- a competitive
services unit, a regulated services unit and a corporate support services unit.
We are included in the regulated services unit and continue to deliver power to
homes and businesses through our existing distribution system and maintain the
"provider of last resort" (PLR) obligation under our rate plan.

 As a result of the transition plan, FirstEnergy's electric utility
operating companies (EUOC) entered into power supply agreements whereby
FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. (FES) purchases all of the EUOC nuclear generation,
as well as generation from leased fossil generating facilities. FirstEnergy
Generation Corp. (FGCO), a wholly owned subsidiary of FES, leases fossil
generating units owned by the EUOC. We are a "full requirements" customer of FES
to enable us to meet our PLR responsibilities. We continue to provide power
directly to wholesale customers under previously negotiated contracts as well as
to alternative energy suppliers as part of our market support generation of 400
megawatts (351 megawatts committed as of December 31, 2001).

 The effect on our reported results of operations during 2001 from
FirstEnergy's corporate separation plan and our sale of transmission assets to
American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI) in September 2000, are summarized in
the following tables:

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

 Earnings on common stock in 2001 increased 6.1 to 193.2 million in
2001 from 182.1 million in 2000. Excluding the effects shown in the table
above, earnings on common stock increased by 7.4 in 2001 from 2000, being
favorably affected by reduced operating expenses and taxes, and lower net
interest charges, which were substantially offset by reduced operating revenues.
In 2000, earnings on common stock increased 13.4 to 182.1 million from 160.6
million primarily due to higher operating revenues and reduced depreciation and
amortization, net interest charges and preferred stock dividend requirements.

 Excluding the effects shown in the table above, operating revenues
decreased by 206.8 million or 11.0 in 2001 from 2000 following a 22.1 million
increase in 2000 from the prior year. Customer choice in Ohio and the influence
of a declining national economy on our regional business activity combined to
lower operating revenues. Electric generation services provided by other
suppliers in our service area represented 12.9 of total energy delivered in
2001. Retail generation sales declined in all customer categories, resulting in
an overall 14.9 reduction in kilowatt-hour sales from the prior year. As part
of Ohio's electric utility restructuring law, the implementation of a 5 
reduction in generation charges for residential customers reduced operating
revenues by approximately 16.6 million in 2001, compared to 2000. Distribution
deliveries declined 2.4 in 2001 from the prior year, reflecting the impact of a
weaker economy that contributed to lower commercial and industrial kilowatt-hour
sales. Operating revenues were also lower in 2001 from the prior year due to the
absence of revenues associated with the low-income payment plan now administered
by the Ohio Department of Development; there was also a corresponding reduction
in other operating costs associated with that change. Revenues from
kilowatt-hour sales to wholesale customers declined 86.7 million in 2001 from
last year, with a corresponding 76.4 reduction in kilowatt-hour sales.

 Additional kilowatt-hour sales to the wholesale market were the
largest source of the increase in operating revenues in 2000, compared to the
prior year, due in part to additional available generating capacity. Operating
revenues from increased kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers were more than
offset by a reduction in average retail unit prices in 2000, compared to 1999.
While sales to commercial and industrial customers both increased in 2000, sales
to residential customers decreased in part due to the cooler summer weather, as
compared to the above normal temperatures experienced during 1999. Other
electric revenues were also lower in 2000 as a result of the elimination of
steam sales and the absence of joint ownership billings to Duquesne Light
Company in 2000 resulting from an asset swap with Duquesne in early December
1999. The decline in other revenues was partially offset by additional
transmission-related revenues in 2000, compared to the prior year.

2001 and by 26.8 million in 2000 from the prior year. Excluding the effects of
restructuring, total 2001 operating expenses and taxes were 219.4 million lower
than the prior year. The following table presents changes from the prior year by
expense category excluding the impact of restructuring.

 Total operating expenses and taxes.......... (219.4) 26.8
 ====================================================================

The following discussion excludes the effects shown in the preceding
table related to the impact of restructuring.

 The decrease in fuel and purchased power costs in 2001, compared to
2000, reflects the transfer of fossil operations to FGCO, with our power
requirements being provided under the PSA. In 2000, fuel and purchased power
costs increased a moderate 4.8 million, compared to 1999. The slightly higher
costs resulted from a 44.8 million increase in purchased power costs which was
significantly offset by a 40.0 million decrease in fuel expense. Most of the
increase in purchased power costs occurred in the second quarter as generating
unit refueling and maintenance outages reduced internal generation during that
period. The reduction in fuel expense in 2000 from the preceding year occurred
despite a 3.4 increase in internal generation (due to additional lower-cost
nuclear generation), the expiration of an above-market coal contract and
continued improvement in coal blending strategies.

 There was one less nuclear refueling outage in 2001, compared to
2000, resulting in an 11.8 million decrease in nuclear operating costs from the
prior year. In 2000, nuclear operating costs increased 12.9 million, compared
to 1999, primarily due to additional refueling outage costs and increased
ownership of the Perry Plant resulting from the Duquesne asset swap. Other
operating costs decreased 7.1 million in 2001 from the prior year reflecting a
reduction in low-income payment plan customer costs and the absence of voluntary
early retirement costs in 2001, offset in part by additional planned maintenance
work at the Bruce Mansfield Plant and the absence in 2001 of gains from the sale
of emission allowances. In 2000, other operating costs rose 6.7 million,
compared to 1999, with most of the increase resulting from additional leased
portable diesel generators and voluntary early retirement costs. Partially
offsetting these higher costs were increased gains of 7.8 million realized from
the sale of emission allowances in 2000.

 Depreciation and amortization decreased by 20.3 million in 2001 from
the prior year due to new deferrals for shopping incentives under our transition
plan. In 2000, as part of the transition plan, generating plant assets were
reviewed for possible impairment. Impaired nuclear plant investments were
recognized as regulatory assets, for which recovery as transition costs began in
January 2001. This reduction in plant investment resulted in a corresponding
reduction to depreciation expense beginning in July 2000 and accounted for most
of the 10.3 million reduction in depreciation and amortization in 2000 from the
preceding year.

 General taxes decreased by 64.8 million in 2001 from 2000 due to
reduced property taxes and other state tax changes in connection with the Ohio
electric industry restructuring. The reduction in general taxes was partially
offset by 20.1 million of new Ohio franchise taxes in 2001, which are
classified as state income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Higher general taxes in 2000, compared to the prior year, resulted from
favorable Ohio and Pennsylvania property tax settlements in 1999.

Net Interest Charges

 Net interest charges continued to trend lower, decreasing by 9.9
million in 2001 and by 10.1 million in 2000, compared to the prior year. We
continued to redeem and refinance our outstanding debt and preferred stock
during 2001 -- net redemptions and refinancing activities in 2001, totaled
 137.0 million and 100.0 million, respectively, and will result in annualized
savings of 15.2 million.

Preferred Stock Dividend Requirements

 Preferred stock dividend requirements were 12.7 million lower in
2000, compared to the prior year as a result of preferred stock redemptions and
the amortization of fair value adjustments recognized under purchase accounting
in 1997.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

 Through net debt and preferred stock redemptions, we continued to
reduce the cost of debt and preferred stock, and improve our financial position
in 2001. During 2001, we reduced our total debt by approximately 152 million.
Our common stockholder's equity as a percentage of total capitalization
increased to 31 as of December 31, 2001 from 21 at the end of 1997. We have
reduced the average cost of outstanding debt from 8.83 in 1996 to 7.88 in
2001.

 Following approval of the merger of FirstEnergy and GPU by the New
Jersey Board of Public Utilities on September 26, 2001, Standard & Poor's
upgraded our credit ratings. Following a period of review and after the
Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of the merger on October 29, 2001,
Moody's also upgraded our credit ratings. The improved credit ratings result
from FirstEnergy's new consolidated credit profile following the merger. Our
credit rating outlook from Standard & Poor's and Moody's are stable. The
following table summarizes the changes:

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We had about 0.7 million of cash and temporary investments and 97.7
million of short-term indebtedness as of December 31, 2001. Under our first
mortgage indenture, as of December 31, 2001, we had the capability to issue 476
million of additional first mortgage bonds on the basis of property additions
and retired bonds. We have no restrictions on the issuance of preferred stock.

 Our cash requirements in 2002 for operating expenses, construction
expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and preferred stock redemptions are
expected to be met without increasing our net debt and preferred stock
outstanding. Major contractual obligations for future cash payments are
summarized in the following table:

=========================================================================================================

Operating lease payments are net of capital trust receipts of 712.8 million
(see Note 2).

Our capital spending for the period 2002-2006 is expected to be about
 392 million (excluding nuclear fuel) of which approximately 121 million
applies to 2002. Investments for additional nuclear fuel during the 2002-2006
period are estimated to be approximately 176 million, of which about 19
million relates to 2002. During the same periods, our nuclear fuel investments
are expected to be reduced by approximately 163 million and 32 million,
respectively, as the nuclear fuel is consumed.

 Off balance sheet obligations primarily consist of a sale and
leaseback arrangement involving the Bruce Mansfield Plant, which are reflected
in the operating lease payments above (see Note 2 - Leases). The present value
as of December 31, 2001, of these sale and leaseback operating lease
commitments, net of trust investments, total 150 million. We sell
substantially all of our retail customer receivables, which provided 97 million
of off balance sheet financing as of December 31, 2001.

 On November 29, 2001, FirstEnergy reached an agreement to sell three
of our coal-fired power plants (with an aggregate net book value of 393 million
as of December 31, 2001) to NRG Energy Inc. The sale includes our 376 MW
Ashtabula, 1,262 MW Eastlake and 249 MW Lakeshore plants. The net, after-tax
gain from the sale, based on the difference between the sale price of the plants
and their market price used in the Ohio restructuring transition plan, will be
credited to customers by reducing the transition cost recovery period.

Interest Rate Risk
- ------------------

 Our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is reduced
since a significant portion of our debt has fixed interest rates, as noted in
the table below. We are subject to the inherent risks related to refinancing
maturing debt by issuing new debt securities. As discussed in Note 2, our
investment in the Shippingport Capital Trust effectively reduces future lease

Outlook
- -------

 Our industry continues to transition to a more competitive
environment. We continue to deliver power to homes and businesses through our
existing distribution system, which remains regulated. Customer rates have been
restructured into separate components to support customer choice. In Ohio, we
have a continuing responsibility to provide power to those customers not
choosing to receive power from an alternative energy supplier. Adopting new
approaches to regulation and experiencing new forms of competition has created
new uncertainties.

Regulatory Matters

 Beginning on January 1, 2001 Ohio customers were able to choose their
electricity suppliers. Ohio customer rates were restructured to establish
separate charges for transmission, distribution, transition cost recovery and a
generation-related component. When one of our customers elects to obtain power
from an alternative supplier, we reduce the customer's bill with a "generation
shopping credit," based on the regulated generation component plus an incentive,
and the customer receives a generation charge from the alternative supplier. We
have continuing responsibility to provide energy to our franchise customers as
the PLR through December 31, 2005.

 The transition cost portion of rates provides for recovery of certain
amounts not otherwise recoverable in a competitive generation market (such as
regulatory assets). Transition costs are paid by all customers whether or not
they choose an alternative supplier. Under the PUCO-approved transition plan, we
assumed the risk of not recovering up to 170 million of transition revenue if
the rate of customers (excluding contracts and full-service accounts) switching
from our service to an alternative supplier does not reach 20 for any
consecutive twelve-month period by December 31, 2005 - the end of the market
development period. As of December 31, 2001, the customer-switching rate, on an
annualized basis, implies that our risk of not recovering transition revenue has
been reduced to approximately 52 million. We are also committed under the
transition agreement to make available 400 MW of our generating capacity to
marketers, brokers, and aggregators at set prices, to be used for sales only to
retail customers in our service area. Through December 31, 2001, approximately
351 MW of the 400 MW supply commitment had been secured by alternative
suppliers. We began accepting customer applications for switching to alternative
suppliers on December 8, 2000; as of December 31, 2001 we had been notified that
over 365,000 of our customers requested generation service from other authorized
suppliers, including FES, an affiliated company.

Environmental Matters

 We are in compliance with the current sulfur dioxide (SO2) and
nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990. In 1998, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized
regulations requiring additional NOx reductions in the future from our Ohio and
Pennsylvania facilities. Various regulatory and judicial actions have since
sought to further define NOx reduction requirements (see Note 5 - Environmental
Matters). We continue to evaluate our compliance plans and other compliance
options.

 Violations of federally approved SO2 regulations can result in
shutdown of the generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of
up to 27,500 for each day a unit is in violation. The EPA has an interim
enforcement policy for SO2 regulations in Ohio that allows for compliance based
on a 30-day averaging period. We cannot predict what action the EPA may take in
the future with respect to the interim enforcement policy.

 In December 2000, the EPA announced it would proceed with the
development of regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants from electric
power plants. The EPA identified mercury as the hazardous air pollutant of
greatest concern. The EPA established a schedule to propose regulations by
December 2003 and issue final regulations by December 2004. The future cost of
compliance with these regulations may be substantial.

 As a result of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as
amended, and the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state
hazardous waste regulations have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel
combustion waste products, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste
disposal requirements pending the EPA's evaluation of the need for future
regulation. The EPA has issued its final regulatory determination that
regulation of coal ash as a hazardous waste is unnecessary. In April 2000, the
EPA announced that it will develop national standards regulating disposal of
coal ash under its authority to regulate nonhazardous waste.

 We have been named as a "potentially responsible party" (PRP) at
waste disposal sites which may require cleanup under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of
disposal of hazardous substances at historical sites and the liability involved,
are often unsubstantiated and subject to dispute. Federal law provides that all
PRPs for a particular site be held liable on a joint and several basis. We have
accrued a liability of 2.9 million as of December 31, 2001, based on estimates
of the total costs of cleanup, the proportionate responsibility of other PRPs
for such costs and the financial ability of other PRPs to pay. We believe that
waste disposal costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, cash flows, or results of operations.

Legal Matters

 Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to our normal
business operations are pending against FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries. The
most significant applicable to us are described above.

Significant Accounting Policies
- -------------------------------

 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Application of
these principles often requires a high degree of judgment, estimates and
assumptions that affect our financial results. All of our assets are subject to
their own specific risks and uncertainties and are continually reviewed for
impairment. Assets related to the application of the policies discussed below
are similarly reviewed with their risks and uncertainties reflecting these
specific factors. Our more significant accounting policies are described below.

Regulatory Accounting

 We are subject to regulation that sets the prices (rates) we are
permitted to charge our customers based on our costs that the regulatory
agencies determine we are permitted to recover. At times, regulators permit the
future recovery through rates of costs that would be currently charged to
expense by an unregulated company. This rate-making process results in the
recording of regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash inflows. As a
result of the changing regulatory framework in Ohio, significant amounts of
regulatory assets have been recorded -- 874 million as of December 31, 2001. We
continually review these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within
the approved regulatory guidelines. Impairment risk associated with these assets
relates to potentially adverse legislative, judicial or regulatory actions in
the future. As disclosed in Note 1 - Regulatory Plans, our full recovery of
transition costs is dependent on achieving 20 customer shopping levels in any
twelve-month period by December 31, 2005.

Revenue Recognition

 We follow the accrual method of accounting for revenues, recognizing
revenue for kilowatt-hours that have been delivered but not yet been billed
through the end of the year. The determination of unbilled revenues requires
management to make various estimates including:

 o Net energy generated or purchased for retail load
 o Losses of energy over distribution lines
 o Allocations to distribution companies within the FirstEnergy system
 o Mix of kilowatt-hour usage by residential, commercial and industrial
 customers
 o Kilowatt-hour usage of customers receiving electricity from alternative
 suppliers

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
- ------------------------------------

 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approved SFAS 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," on June 29, 2001. Under SFAS 142,
amortization of existing goodwill will cease January 1, 2002. Instead, goodwill
will be tested for impairment at least on an annual basis, and no impairment of
goodwill is anticipated as a result of a preliminary analysis. In 2001, we
amortized about 38 million of goodwill.

 In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. (SFAS) 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The new
statement provides accounting standards for retirement obligations associated
with tangible long-lived assets, with adoption required by January 1, 2003. SFAS
143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred. The associated
asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset. Over time the capitalized costs are depreciated and the
present value of the asset retirement liability increases resulting in a period
expense. Upon retirement, a gain or loss will be recorded if the cost to settle
the retirement obligation differs from the carrying amount. We are currently
assessing the new standard and have not yet determined the impact on our
financial statements.

 In September 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of." The Statement also supersedes the accounting and reporting
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results
of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and
Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions." Our
adoption of this Statement, effective January 1, 2002, will result in our
accounting for any future impairments or disposals of long-lived assets under
the provisions of SFAS 144, but will not change the accounting principles used
in previous asset impairments or disposals. Application of SFAS 144 is not
anticipated to have a major impact on our accounting for impairments or disposal
transactions compared to the prior application of SFAS 121 or APB 30.

The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

 The consolidated financial statements include The Cleveland Electric
Illuminating Company (Company) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Centerior
Funding Corporation (CFC) and Centerior Financing Trust (CFT). All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company is a wholly owned
subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. FirstEnergy holds directly all of the issued and
outstanding common shares of its principal electric utility operating
subsidiaries, including, the Company, Ohio Edison Company (OE), The Toledo
Edison Company (TE), American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI), Jersey Central
Power & Light Company (JCP&L), Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed) and
Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec). JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec were formerly
wholly owned subsidiaries of GPU, Inc. which merged with FirstEnergy on November
7, 2001.

 The Company follows the accounting policies and practices prescribed
by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(GAAP) requires management to make periodic estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

REVENUES-

 The Company's principal business is providing electric service to
customers in northeastern Ohio. The Company's retail customers are metered on a
cycle basis. Revenue is recognized for unbilled electric service through the end
of the year.

 Receivables from customers include sales to residential, commercial
and industrial customers located in the Company's service area and sales to
wholesale customers. There was no material concentration of receivables at
December 31, 2001 or 2000, with respect to any particular segment of the
Company's customers.

 The Company and TE sell substantially all of their retail customer
receivables to CFC. CFC subsequently transfers the receivables to a trust under
an asset-backed securitization agreement. The trust completed private sales of
 50 million and 150 million of receivables-backed investor certificates in 2000
and 2001 respectively, in transactions that qualified for sale accounting
treatment. CFC's creditors are entitled to be satisfied first out of the
proceeds of CFC's assets. The 2001 private sale was used to repay a 1996 public
sale of 150 million of receivables-backed investor certificates which was
replaced under an amended securitization agreement. FirstEnergy's retained
interest in the pool of receivables held by the trust (34 as of December 31,
2001) is stated at fair value reflecting adjustments for anticipated credit
losses. Sensitivity analyses reflecting a 10 and 20 increase in the rate of
anticipated credit losses did not significantly affect FirstEnergy's retained
interest in the pool of receivables. Collections from receivables previously
transferred to the trust were used for the purchase of new receivables from CFC
during 2001 and totaled approximately 2.2 billion. As of December 31, 2001,
receivables recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were reduced by
approximately 97 million due to the sale of 185 million of receivables to the
trust less the Company's retained interest of 88 million. The Company and TE
processed receivables for the trust and received servicing fees of approximately
 4.5 million 3.0 million applicable to the Company) in 2001. Expenses
associated with the factoring discount related to the sale of receivables were
 12 million in 2001.

REGULATORY PLAN-

 Ohio's 1999 electric utility restructuring law allowed Ohio electric
customers to select their generation suppliers beginning January 1, 2001,
provided for a five percent reduction on the generation portion of residential
customers' bills and the opportunity for utilities to recover transition costs,
including regulatory assets. Under this law, the PUCO approved FirstEnergy's
transition plan in 2000 as modified by a settlement agreement with major parties
to the transition plan, which it filed on behalf of the Company, OE and TE. The
settlement agreement included approval for recovery of the amounts of transition
costs filed in the transition plan through no later than 2008 for the Company,
except where a longer period of recovery is provided for in the settlement
agreement. The settlement also granted preferred access over FirstEnergy's
subsidiaries to nonaffiliated marketers, brokers and aggregators to 400
megawatts of generation capacity through 2005 at established prices for sales to
the Company's retail customers. The Company's base electric rates for
distribution service under its prior regulatory plan was extended from December
31, 2005 through December 31, 2007. The transition rate credits for customers
under its prior regulatory plan was also extended through the Company's
transition cost recovery period.

 The transition plan itemized, or unbundled, the current price of
electricity into its component elements -- including generation, transmission,
distribution and transition charges. As required by the PUCO's rules,
FirstEnergy's transition plan also resulted in the corporate separation of its
regulated and unregulated operations, operational and technical support changes
needed to accommodate customer choice, an education program to inform

customers of their options under the law, and planned changes in how
FirstEnergy's transmission system will be operated to ensure access to all
users. Customer prices are frozen through a five-year market development period
(2001-2005), except for certain limited statutory exceptions including a 5 
reduction in the price of generation for residential customers.

 The Company's customers electing alternative suppliers receive an
additional incentive applied to the shopping credit of 45 for residential
customers, 30 for commercial customers and 15 for industrial customers. The
amount of the incentive serves to reduce the amortization of transition costs
during the market development period and will be recovered through the extension
of the transition cost recovery period. If the customer shopping goals
established in the agreement are not achieved by the end of 2005, the transition
cost recovery period could be shortened for the Company to reduce recovery by as
much as 170 million, but any such adjustment would be computed on a
class-by-class and pro-rata basis. Based on annualized shopping levels as of
December 31, 2001, the Company believes that the maximum potential recovery
reduction was approximately 52 million.

 The application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS 71),
to the Company's nonnuclear generation business was discontinued with the
issuance of the PUCO transition plan order. The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) issued interpretive guidance regarding asset impairment
measurement concluding that any supplemental regulated cash flows such as a
competitive transition charge should be excluded from the cash flows of assets
in a portion of the business not subject to regulatory accounting practices. If
those assets are impaired, a regulatory asset should be established if the costs
are recoverable through regulatory cash flows. Consistent with the SEC guidance
 304 million of impaired plant investments were recognized by the Company as
regulatory assets recoverable as transition costs through future regulatory cash
flows. Net assets included in utility plant relating to the operations for which
the application of SFAS 71 was discontinued were 1.425 billion as of December
31, 2001. All of the Company's regulatory assets are expected to continue to be
recovered under provisions of the Ohio transition plan.

UTILITY PLANT AND DEPRECIATION-

 Utility plant reflects the original cost of construction (except for
the Company's nuclear generating units which were adjusted to fair value),
including payroll and related costs such as taxes, employee benefits,
administrative and general costs, and interest costs.

 The Company provides for depreciation on a straight-line basis at
various rates over the estimated lives of property included in plant in service.
The annualized composite rate was approximately 3.2 in 2001 and 3.4 in 2000
and 1999.

 Annual depreciation expense includes approximately 29.0 million for
future decommissioning costs applicable to the Company's ownership interests in
three nuclear generating units. The 2001 amounts reflected an increase of
approximately 17 million from implementing the Company's transition plan in
2001. The Company's share of the future obligation to decommission these units
is approximately 656 million in current dollars and (using a 4.0 escalation
rate) approximately 1.6 billion in future dollars. The estimated obligation and
the escalation rate were developed based on site specific studies. Payments for
decommissioning are expected to begin in 2016, when actual decommissioning work
begins. The Company has recovered approximately 163 million for decommissioning
through its electric rates from customers through December 31, 2001. The Company
has also recognized an estimated liability of approximately 7.6 million related
to decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear enrichment facilities operated
by the United States Department of Energy, as required by the Energy Policy Act
of 1992.

 In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS
143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The new statement provides
accounting treatment for retirement obligations associated with tangible
long-lived assets with adoption required as of January 1, 2003. SFAS 143
requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be
recorded in the period in which it is incurred. The associated asset retirement
costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset.
Over time the capitalized costs are depreciated and the present value of the
asset retirement liability increases, resulting in a period expense. Upon
retirement, a gain or loss will be recorded if the costs to settle the
retirement obligation differs from the carrying amount. Under the new standard,
additional assets and liabilities relating principally to nuclear
decommissioning obligations will be recorded, the pattern of expense recognition
will change and income from the external decommissioning trust will be recorded
as investment income. The Company is currently assessing the new standard and
has not yet quantified the impact on its financial statements.

COMMON OWNERSHIP OF GENERATING FACILITIES-

 The Company, together with TE and OE and its wholly owned subsidiary,
Pennsylvania Power Company (Penn), own and/or lease, as tenants in common,
various power generating facilities. Each of the companies is obligated to pay a
share of the costs associated with any jointly owned facility in the same
proportion as its interest. The Company's portion of operating expenses
associated with jointly owned facilities is included in the corresponding
operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The amounts
reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under utility plant at December 31,
2001 include the following:

 ====================================================================================================

The Bruce Mansfield Plant is being leased through a sale and
leaseback transaction (see Note 2) and the above-related amounts represent
construction expenditures subsequent to the transaction.

NUCLEAR FUEL-

 Nuclear fuel is recorded at original cost, which includes material,
enrichment, fabrication and interest costs incurred prior to reactor load. The
Company amortizes the cost of nuclear fuel based on the rate of consumption.

INCOME TAXES-

 Details of the total provision for income taxes are shown on the
Consolidated Statements of Taxes. Deferred income taxes result from timing
differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and accounting
purposes. Investment tax credits, which were deferred when utilized, are being
amortized over the recovery period of the related property. The liability method
is used to account for deferred income taxes. Deferred income tax liabilities
related to tax and accounting basis differences are recognized at the statutory
income tax rates in effect when the liabilities are expected to be paid. The
Company is included in FirstEnergy's consolidated federal income tax return. The
consolidated tax liability is allocated on a "stand-alone" company basis, with
the Company recognizing any tax losses or credits it contributed to the
consolidated return.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS-

 FirstEnergy's trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan
covers almost all of the Company's full-time employees. Upon retirement,
employees receive a monthly pension based on length of service and compensation.
On December 31, 2001, the GPU pension plans were merged with the FirstEnergy
plan. The Company uses the projected unit credit method for funding purposes and
was not required to make pension contributions during the three years ended
December 31, 2001. The assets of the FirstEnergy pension plan consist primarily
of common stocks, United States government bonds and corporate bonds. The
FirstEnergy and GPU postretirement benefit plans are currently separately
maintained; the information shown below is aggregated as of December 31, 2001.

 The Company provides a minimum amount of noncontributory life
insurance to retired employees in addition to optional contributory insurance.
Health care benefits, which include certain employee deductibles and copayments,
are also available to retired employees, their dependents and, under certain
circumstances, their survivors. The Company pays insurance premiums to cover a
portion of these benefits in excess of set limits; all amounts up to the limits
are paid by the Company. The Company recognizes the expected cost of providing
other postretirement benefits to employees and their beneficiaries and covered
dependents from the time employees are hired until they become eligible to
receive those benefits.

 The following sets forth the funded status of the plans and amounts
recognized on FirstEnergy's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31:

The composite health care trend rate assumption is approximately 10 
in 2002, 9 in 2003 and 8 in 2004, trending to 4 -6 in later years. Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported
for the health care plan. An increase in the health care trend rate assumption
by one percentage point would increase the total service and interest cost
components by 14.6 million and the postretirement benefit obligation by 151.2
million. A decrease in the same assumption by one percentage point would
decrease the total service and interest cost components by 12.7 million and the
postretirement benefit obligation by 131.3 million.

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES-

 Operating revenues, operating expenses and other income include
transactions with affiliated companies, primarily TE, OE, Penn, ATSI,
FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. (FES) and FirstEnergy. The Ohio transition plan, as
discussed in the "Regulatory Plan" section, resulted in the corporate
separation of FirstEnergy's regulated and unregulated operations in 2001.
Unregulated operations under FES now operate the generation businesses of the
Company, TE, OE and Penn. As a result, the Company entered into power supply
agreements (PSA) whereby FES purchases all of the Company's nuclear generation
and the generation from leased fossil generating facilities and the Company
purchases its power from FES to meet its "provider of last resort" obligations.
CFC serves as the transferor in connection with the accounts receivable
securitization for the Company and TE. The primary affiliated companies
transactions, including the

effects of the PSA beginning in 2001, the sale and leaseback of the Company's
transmission assets to ATSI in September 2000 and FirstEnergy's providing
support services at cost, are as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company is buying 150 megawatts of TE's Beaver Valley Unit 2
leased capacity entitlement. Purchased power expense for this transaction was
 97.0 million, 104.0 million and 104.3 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. This purchase is expected to continue through the end of the lease
period (See Note 2).

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOWS INFORMATION-

 All temporary cash investments purchased with an initial maturity of
three months or less are reported as cash equivalents on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at cost, which approximates their fair market value. Noncash
financing and investing activities included capital lease transactions amounting
to 2.1 million, 52.0 million and 26.2 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

 All borrowings with initial maturities of less than one year are
defined as financial instruments under GAAP and are reported on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at cost, which approximates their fair market value. The
following sets forth the approximate fair value and related carrying amounts of
all other long-term debt, preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption and
investments other than cash and cash equivalents as of December 31:

==========================================================================================================

The fair values of long-term debt and preferred stock subject to
mandatory redemption reflect the present value of the cash outflows relating to
those securities based on the current call price, the yield to maturity or the
yield to call, as deemed appropriate at the end of each respective year. The
yields assumed were based on securities with similar characteristics offered by
a corporation with credit ratings similar to the Company's ratings.

 The fair value of investments other than cash and cash equivalents
represent cost (which approximates fair value) or the present value of the cash
inflows based on the yield to maturity. The yields assumed were based on
financial instruments with similar characteristics and terms. Investments other
than cash and cash equivalents include decommissioning trust investments.
Unrealized gains and losses applicable to the decommissioning trusts have been
recognized in the trust investment with corresponding changes to the
decommissioning liability. The Company has no securities held for trading
purposes.

REGULATORY ASSETS-

 The Company recognizes, as regulatory assets, costs which the FERC
and PUCO have authorized for recovery from customers in future periods. Without
such authorization, the costs would have been charged to income as incurred. All
regulatory assets are expected to continue to be recovered from customers under
the Company's transition

plan. Based on that plan, the Company continues to bill and collect cost-based
rates for its transmission and distribution services, which will remain
regulated; accordingly, it is appropriate that the Company continues the
application of SFAS 71 to those operations.

 Net regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are
comprised of the following:

 ========================================================================

2. LEASES:

 The Company leases certain generating facilities, office space and
other property and equipment under cancelable and noncancelable leases.

 The Company and TE sold their ownership interests in Bruce Mansfield
Units 1, 2 and 3 and TE sold a portion of its ownership interest in Beaver
Valley Unit 2. In connection with these sales, which were completed in 1987, the
Company and TE entered into operating leases for lease terms of approximately 30
years as co-lessees. During the terms of the leases, the Company and TE continue
to be responsible, to the extent of their combined ownership and leasehold
interest, for costs associated with the units including construction
expenditures, operation and maintenance expenses, insurance, nuclear fuel,
property taxes and decommissioning. The Company and TE have the right, at the
end of the respective basic lease terms, to renew the leases. The Company and TE
also have the right to purchase the facilities at the expiration of the basic
lease term or renewal term (if elected) at a price equal to the fair market
value of the facilities.

 As co-lessee with TE, the Company is also obligated for TE's lease
payments. If TE is unable to make its payments under the Beaver Valley Unit 2
and Bruce Mansfield Plant leases, the Company would be obligated to make such
payments. No such payments have been made on behalf of TE. (TE's future minimum
lease payments as of December 31, 2001 were approximately 1.1 billion, net of
trust cash receipts.)

 Consistent with the regulatory treatment, the rentals for capital and
operating leases are charged to operating expenses on the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Such costs for the three years ended December 31, 2001 are
summarized as follows:

 2001 2000 1999

The Company and TE refinanced high-cost fixed obligations related to
their 1987 sale and leaseback transaction for the Bruce Mansfield Plant through
a lower cost transaction in June and July 1997. In a June 1997 offering
(Offering), the two companies pledged 720 million aggregate principal amount 575 million for the Company and 145 million for TE) of first mortgage bonds
due through 2007 to a trust as security for the issuance of a like principal
amount of secured notes due through 2007. The obligations of the two companies
under these secured notes are joint and several. Using available cash,
short-term borrowings and the net proceeds from the Offering, the two companies
invested 906.5 million 569.4 million for the Company and 337.1 million for
TE) in a business trust, in June 1997. The trust used these funds in July 1997
to purchase lease notes and redeem all 873.2 million aggregate principal amount
of 10-1/4 and 11-1/8 secured lease obligation bonds (SLOBs) due 2003 and 2016.
The SLOBs were issued by a special-purpose-funding corporation in 1988 on behalf
of lessors in the two companies' 1987 sale and leaseback transaction. The
Shippingport Capital Trust arrangement effectively reduces lease costs related
to that transaction.

3. CAPITALIZATION:

 (A) RETAINED EARNINGS-

 There are no restrictions on retained earnings for payment of cash
dividends on the Company's common stock. The 1997 FirstEnergy merger purchase
accounting adjustments included resetting the retained earnings balance to zero
at the November 8, 1997 merger date.

 (B) STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS-

 Employees of the Company participate in stock based plans
administered by FirstEnergy which include the Centerior Equity Plan (CEI Plan)
and FirstEnergy Executive and Director Incentive Compensation Plan (FE Plan).
All options are fully vested under the CE Plan, and no further awards are
permitted. Outstanding options will expire on or before February 25, 2007. Under
the FE Plan, total awards cannot exceed 15 million shares of common stock or
their equivalent. Only stock options and restricted stock have been granted,
with vesting periods ranging from six months to seven years.

 Under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, covered employees can
direct a portion of their Annual Incentive Award and/or Long Term Incentive
Award into an unfunded FirstEnergy Stock Account to receive vested stock units.
An additional 20 premium is received in the form of stock units based on the
amount allocated to the FirstEnergy Stock Account. Dividends are calculated
quarterly on stock units outstanding and are paid in the form of additional
stock units. Upon withdrawal, stock units are converted to FirstEnergy shares.
Payout occurs three years from the date of deferral.

 The Company continues to apply APB 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees." As required by SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," the Company has determined pro forma earnings as though the
Company had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method.
The weighted average assumptions used in valuing the options and their resulting
fair values are as follows:

 2001 2000 1999
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Valuation assumptions:
 Expected option term (years) 8.3 7.6 6.4
 Expected volatility......... 23.45 21.77 20.03 
 Expected dividend yield..... 5.00 6.68 5.97 
 Risk-free interest rate..... 4.67 5.28 5.97 
 Fair value per option......... 4.97 2.86 3.42
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following table summarizes the pro forma effect of applying fair
value accounting to the Company's stock options.

 2001 2000 1999

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(C) PREFERRED AND PREFERENCE STOCK-

 The Company's 90.00 Series S has no optional redemption provision.
All other preferred stock may be redeemed by the Company in whole, or in part,
with 30-90 days' notice.

 The preferred dividend rate on the Company's Series L fluctuates
based on prevailing interest rates and market conditions. The dividend rate for
this issue was 7 in 2001.

The Company redeemed, pursuant to redemption provisions of its 42.40
Series T issue, all 200,000 shares outstanding on February 1, 2002 at a price of
 500 per share.

 The Company has three million authorized and unissued shares of
preference stock having no par value.

 (D) PREFERRED STOCK SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION-

 Annual sinking fund provisions currently in effect for preferred
stock are as follows:

 Redemption
 Price Per
 Series Shares Share
 --------------------------------------------------------
 7.35 C 10,000 100
 90.00 S 17,750 1,000
 --------------------------------------------------------

Annual sinking fund requirements for the next five years are 18.0
million in 2002 and 1.0 million in each year 2003-2006.

(E) COMPANY OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED
 SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY TRUST HOLDING SOLELY COMPANY
 SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES-

 CFT, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, issued 100 million of
9 Cumulative Trust Preferred Capital Securities in December 2001. The Company
purchased all of the Trust's Common Securities and simultaneously issued to the
Trust 103.1 million principal amount of 9 Junior Subordinated Debentures due
2031 in exchange for the proceeds that the Trust received from its sale of
Preferred and Common Securities. The sole assets of the Trust are the
Subordinated Debentures whose interest and other payment dates coincide with the
distribution and other payment dates on the Trust Securities. Under certain
circumstances, the Subordinated Debentures could be distributed to the holders
of the outstanding Trust Securities in the event the Trust is liquidated.
Beginning in December 2006, the Subordinated Debentures may be optionally
redeemed by the Company at a redemption price of 25 per Subordinated Debenture
plus accrued interest, in which event the Trust Securities will be redeemed on a
pro rata basis at 25 per share plus accumulated distributions. The Company's
obligations under the Subordinated Debentures along with the related Indenture,
Trust Agreement, Guarantee Agreement and the Agreement for expenses and
liabilities, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of
payments due on the Preferred Securities.

 (F) LONG-TERM DEBT-

 The first mortgage indenture and its supplements, which secure all of
the Company's first mortgage bonds, serve as direct first mortgage liens on
substantially all property and franchises, other than specifically excepted
property, owned by the Company.

 Sinking fund requirements for first mortgage bonds and maturing
long-term debt (excluding capital leases) for the next five years are:

 (In millions)
 ---------------------------------------------
 2002................................. 411.4
 2003................................. 196.7
 2004................................. 307.7
 2005................................. 300.0
 2006................................. --
 ---------------------------------------------

 The Company's obligations to repay certain pollution control revenue
bonds are secured by several series of first mortgage bonds. Certain pollution
control revenue bonds are entitled to the benefit of an irrevocable bank letter
of credit of 48.1 million and noncancelable municipal bond insurance policies
of 112.6 million to pay principal of, or interest on, the pollution control
revenue bonds. To the extent that drawings are made under the letter of credit,
the Company is entitled to a credit against its obligation to repay that bond.
The Company pays an annual fee of 1.00 of the amount of the letter of credit to
the issuing bank and is obligated to reimburse the bank for any drawings
thereunder.

 The Company and TE have letters of credit of approximately 222
million in connection with the sale and leaseback of Beaver Valley Unit 2 that
expire in May 2002. The letters of credit are secured by first mortgage bonds of
the Company and TE in the proportion of 40 and 60 , respectively (see Note 2).

4. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS:

 The Company may borrow from its affiliates on a short-term basis. As
of December 31, 2001, the Company had total short-term borrowings of 97.7
million from its affiliates with a weighted average interest rate of
approximately 3.5 .

5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES-

 The Company's current forecast reflects expenditures of approximately
 392 million for property additions and improvements from 2002-2006, of which
approximately 121 million is applicable to 2002. Investments for additional
nuclear fuel during the 2002-2006 period are estimated to be approximately 176
million, of which approximately 19 million applies to 2002. During the same
periods, the Company's nuclear fuel investments are expected to be reduced by
approximately 163 million and 32 million, respectively, as the nuclear fuel is
consumed.

NUCLEAR INSURANCE-

 The Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability relative to a
single incident at a nuclear power plant to 9.5 billion. The amount is covered
by a combination of private insurance and an industry retrospective rating plan.
Based on its ownership and leasehold interests in Beaver Valley Unit 2, the
Davis-Besse Station and the Perry Plant, the Company's maximum potential
assessment under the industry retrospective rating plan (assuming the other
affiliate co-owners contribute their proportionate shares of any assessments
under the retrospective rating plan) would be 106.3 million per incident but
not more than 12.1 million in any one year for each incident.

 The Company is also insured as to its respective interests in Beaver
Valley Unit 2, Davis-Besse and Perry under policies issued to the operating
company for each plant. Under these policies, up to 2.75 billion is provided
for property damage and decontamination and decommissioning costs. The Company
has also obtained approximately 382 million of insurance coverage for
replacement power costs for its respective interests in Beaver Valley Unit 2,
Davis-Besse and Perry. Under these policies, the Company can be assessed a
maximum of approximately 22 million for incidents at any covered nuclear
facility occurring during a policy year which are in excess of accumulated funds
available to the insurer for paying losses.

 The Company intends to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as
described above as long as it is available. To the extent that replacement
power, property damage, decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement
costs and other such costs arising from a nuclear incident at any of the
Company's plants exceed the policy limits of the insurance in effect with
respect to that plant, to the extent a nuclear incident is determined not to be
covered by the Company's insurance policies, or to the extent such insurance
becomes unavailable in the future, the Company would remain at risk for such
costs.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS-

 Various federal, state and local authorities regulate the Company
with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters. In
accordance with the Ohio transition plan discussed in "Regulatory Plans" in Note
1, generation operations and any related additional capital expenditures for
environmental compliance are the responsibility of FirstEnergy's competitive
services business unit.

 The Company is required to meet federally approved sulfur dioxide
(SO2) regulations. Violations of such regulations can result in shutdown of the
generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of up to 27,500 for
each day the unit is in violation. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
an interim enforcement policy for SO2 regulations in Ohio that allows for
compliance based on a 30-day averaging period. The Company cannot predict what
action the EPA may take in the future with respect to the interim enforcement
policy.

 The Company is in compliance with the current SO2 and nitrogen oxides
(NOx) reduction requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. SO2
reductions are being achieved by burning lower-sulfur fuel, generating more
electricity from lower-emitting plants, and/or using emission allowances. NOx
reductions are being achieved through combustion controls and the generation of
more electricity at lower-emitting plants. In September 1998, the EPA finalized
regulations requiring additional NOx reductions from the Company's Ohio and
Pennsylvania facilities. The EPA's NOx Transport Rule imposes uniform reductions
of NOx emissions (an approximate 85 reduction in utility plant NOx emissions
from projected 2007 emissions) across a region of nineteen states and the
District of Columbia, including Ohio and Pennsylvania, based on a conclusion
that such NOx emissions are contributing significantly to ozone pollution in the
eastern United States. State Implementation Plans (SIP) must comply by May 31,
2004 with individual state NOx budgets established by the EPA. Pennsylvania
submitted a SIP that requires compliance with the NOx budgets

at the Company's Pennsylvania facilities by May 1, 2003 and Ohio submitted a
"draft" SIP that requires compliance with the NOx budgets at the Company's Ohio
facilities by May 31, 2004. FirstEnergy continues to evaluate its compliance
plans and other compliance options.

 In July 1997, the EPA promulgated changes in the National Ambient Air
Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone emissions and proposed a new NAAQS for
previously unregulated ultra-fine particulate matter. In May 1999, the U.S.
Court of Appeals found constitutional and other defects in the new NAAQS rules.
In February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the new NAAQS rules regulating
ultra-fine particulates but found defects in the new NAAQS rules for ozone and
decided that the EPA must revise those rules. The future cost of compliance with
these regulations may be substantial and will depend if and how they are
ultimately implemented by the states in which the Company operates affected
facilities.

 In December 2000, the EPA announced it would proceed with the
development of regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants from electric
power plants. The EPA identified mercury as the hazardous air pollutant of
greatest concern. The EPA established a schedule to propose regulations by
December 2003 and issue final regulations by December 2004. The future cost of
compliance with these regulations may be substantial.

 As a result of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as
amended, and the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state
hazardous waste regulations have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel
combustion waste products, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste
disposal requirements pending the EPA's evaluation of the need for future
regulation. The EPA has issued its final regulatory determination that
regulation of coal ash as a hazardous waste is unnecessary. In April 2000, the
EPA announced that it will develop national standards regulating disposal of
coal ash under its authority to regulate nonhazardous waste.

 The Company has been named as a "potentially responsible party" (PRP)
at waste disposal sites which may require cleanup under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of
disposal of hazardous substances at historical sites and the liability involved
are often unsubstantiated and subject to dispute. Federal law provides that all
PRPs for a particular site be held liable on a joint and several basis. The
Company has accrued a liability of 2.9 million as of December 31, 2001, based
on estimates of the total costs of cleanup, the proportionate responsibility of
other PRPs for such costs and the financial ability of other PRPs to pay. The
Company believes that waste disposal costs will not have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

Legal Matters

 Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to the Company's
normal business operations are pending against FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries.
The most significant applicable to the Company are described above.

6. SALE OF GENERATING ASSETS:

 On November 29, 2001, FirstEnergy reached an agreement to sell four
coal-fired power plants (with an aggregate net book value of 539 million as of
December 31, 2001) totaling 2,535 MW to NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) for 1.5 billion 1.355 billion in cash and 145 million in debt assumption). The sale includes
the 376 MW Ashtabula, 1,262 MW Eastlake and 249 MW Lakeshore plants owned by the
Company (with an aggregate net book value of 393 million as of December 31,
2001). The net, after-tax gain from the sale, based on the difference between
the sale price of the plants and their market price used in the Ohio
restructuring transition plan, will be credited to customers by reducing the
transition cost recovery period. FirstEnergy also entered into a power purchase
agreement (PPA) with NRG. Under the terms of the PPA, NRG is obligated to sell
up to 10.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, similar to the
average annual output of the plants, through 2005. The sale is expected to close
in mid-2002.

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of The Cleveland Electric
Illuminating Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
statements of capitalization of The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (an
Ohio corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp.) and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated
statements of income, common stockholder's equity, preferred stock, cash flows
and taxes for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of The Cleveland Electric
Illuminating Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

 (a) When a quorum is present or represented at any meeting, the vote of
the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or
represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting,
unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes or of

shareholder according to the books of the Corporation as of the date of such
vote or, if a record date is set by the Board of Directors, as of such record
date.

Section 8. Voting by Proxy.
- ---------- ----------------

 At any meeting of the shareholders, any shareholder may be represented and
vote by a proxy or proxies appointed by an instrument in writing or by any other
form of verifiable communication, including any form of electronic or other
communications, to the full extent legally permitted (now or hereafter). In the
event that any such instrument shall designate two or more persons to act as
proxies, a majority of such persons present at the meeting, or, if only one
shall be present, then that one shall have and may exercise all of the powers
conferred by such instrument upon all of the persons so designated unless the
instrument shall otherwise provide. No such proxy shall be valid after the
expiration of eleven (11) months from the date of its execution, unless coupled
with an interest, or unless the person executing it specifies therein the

length of time for which it is to continue in force. Subject to the above, any
proxy duly executed is not revoked and continues in full force and effect until
an instrument or verifiable communication revoking it or a duly executed proxy
bearing a later date is filed with the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation.

Section 9. Action by Shareholders Without a Meeting.
- ---------- -----------------------------------------

 Any action which may be taken by the vote of the shareholders at a meeting
may be taken without a meeting if authorized by the written consent of the
shareholders holding at least a majority of the voting power, unless the
provisions of the statutes or of the Articles of Incorporation provide that a
greater proportion of written consents shall be required. Such written consent
shall be filed with or entered upon the records of the Corporation.

DIRECTORS

Section 10. Authority of Directors.
- ----------- -----------------------

 (a) The business of the Corporation shall be managed by its Board of
Directors, which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such
lawful acts and things as are not by statute, the Articles of Incorporation, or
these Regulations directed or required to be exercised or done by the
shareholders.

 (b) Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board
of Directors or any committee of the Board of Directors may be taken without a
meeting if, prior or subsequent to such action, all members of the Board of
Directors or of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing
and such written consents are filed with the Corporate Secretary of the
Corporation.

Section 11. Number; Qualifications.
- ----------- -----------------------

 The number of Directors shall be not less than three (3) and not more than
five (5) (plus any Directors separately elected by the holders of any class of
stock other than the Common Stock as provided in the Articles of Incorporation
as amended from time to time). The number of Directors may be determined (a) by
the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon at
any annual meeting or special meeting called for the purpose of electing
Directors or (b) by action of the Board of Directors at a meeting by the vote of
a majority of the Directors in office at the time or in a writing signed by all
the Directors in office at the time. When so fixed, such number shall continue
to be the authorized number of Directors until changed by the shareholders or
Directors in the manner described above. Any increase in the number of Directors
shall be deemed to create a vacancy or vacancies which may be filled as provided
in Section 14. A reduction in the number of Directors shall not be applied to
remove any Director from office prior to the expiration of his term. Directors
need not be shareholders of the Corporation.

Section 12. Election of Directors.
- ----------- ----------------------

 At each meeting of the shareholders for the election of Directors, the
persons receiving the greatest number of votes shall be the Directors. Such
elections shall be by ballot whenever requested by any person entitled to vote
at such meeting; but unless so requested, such election may be conducted in any
way approved at such meeting.

Section 13. Term of Office; Removal; Resignations.
- ----------- --------------------------------------

 (a) Directors shall hold office until the annual meeting of the
shareholders next following their election and until their respective successors
are elected, or until their earlier resignation, death or removal from office.

 (b) Any Director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed upon the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
Corporation.

 (c) Any Director may resign at any time by giving written notice of his
resignation to the President or Corporate Secretary. Any resignation will be
effective upon actual receipt by such person or, if later, as of the date and
time specified in such written notice.

Section 14. Vacancies.
- ----------- ----------

 Vacancies, including those caused by an increase in the number of
Directors, may be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors though less
than a quorum. When one or more Directors shall give notice of his or their
resignation to the Board, effective at a future date, the Board shall have the
power to fill such vacancy or vacancies to take effect when such resignation or
resignations shall become effective, each Director so appointed to hold office
during the remainder of the term of office of the resigning Director or
Directors. Whenever any vacancy shall occur among the Directors, the remaining
Directors shall constitute the Directors of the Corporation until such vacancy
is filled or until the number of Directors is changed as in Section 11 hereof.

MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Section 15. Organizational Meeting.
- ----------- -----------------------

 Immediately after each annual meeting of the shareholders at which
Directors are elected, or each special meeting held in lieu thereof, the newly
elected Directors, if a quorum thereof is present, shall hold an organizational
meeting at the same place or at such other time and place as may be fixed by the
shareholders at such meeting, for the purpose of electing officers and
transacting any other business. Notice of such meeting need not be given. If for
any reason such organizational meeting is not held at such time, a special
meeting of the Directors for such purpose shall be held as soon thereafter as
practicable.

Section 16. Regular Meetings.
- ----------- -----------------

 Regular meetings of the Directors may be held without notice at such times
and places within or without the State of Ohio as shall be determined by the
Directors from time to time.

Section 17. Special Meetings.
- ----------- -----------------

 Special meetings of the Directors may be held at any time within or
without the State of Ohio upon call by the Chairman of the Board, the President,
or the Corporate Secretary upon the written request of two Directors. Notice of
each such meeting shall be given to each Director by letter, facsimile,
telegram, telephone, or in person not less than forty-eight (48) hours prior to
such meeting. Notices sent by mail shall be sent postage prepaid and shall be
addressed to each Director at his address as it appears upon the records of the
Corporation. Notice by mail shall be deemed to be given at the time when the
notice is deposited in the mail, and notice by facsimile or telegram shall be
deemed to be given at the time when confirmation of successful transmission is
received. Such notice may be waived in writing by Directors either before or
after the meeting, and such written waivers shall be filed with or entered upon
the records of the meeting. The attendance of any Director at any such meeting
without protesting the lack of proper notice, prior to or at the commencement of
the meeting, shall be deemed to be a waiver by the Director of notice of the
meeting. Unless otherwise limited in the notice thereof, any business may be
transacted at any organizational, regular or special meeting.

Section 18. Quorum and Adjournments; Participation by Communications Equipment.

be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act
of a majority of the Directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is
present shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise
specifically provided by statute or by the Articles of Incorporation. Any action
required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Directors may be taken
without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken,
shall be signed by all of the Directors entitled to vote with respect to the
subject matter thereof. Any meeting duly called, whether or not a quorum is
present, may, by vote of a majority of the Directors present, be adjourned from
time to time and place to place within or without the State of Ohio, in which
case no further notice of the adjourned meeting need be given.

 (b) Meetings of the Board of Directors or of any committee of the Board of
Directors may be held through any means of communications equipment if all
persons participating can hear each other, and such participation will
constitute presence in person at such meeting.

Section 19. Committees.
- ----------- -----------

 The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the
Directors, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or
more of the Directors of the Corporation, which, to the extent provided in the
resolution, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of Directors in
the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation. Such committee or

committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time
by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. The committees shall keep
regular minutes of their proceedings and report the same to the Board when
required.

Section 20. Compensation.
- ----------- -------------

 The Directors may be paid their expenses, if any, for attendance at each
meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at
each meeting of the Board of Directors. The sums may be different for different
Directors, and the sum shall be established by resolution of the Board of
Directors and may be changed from time to time by resolution. No such payment
shall preclude any Director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity
and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees
may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

Section 21. Executive Committee.
- ----------- --------------------

 The Board of Directors at any time may elect from its members an Executive
Committee which shall consist of not less than three (3) members. Each member of
such Committee shall hold office during the pleasure of the Board and may be
removed by a majority vote of the whole Board at any time with or without cause.
Vacancies occurring in the Committee may be filled by the Board. The Committee
shall prescribe its own rules for calling and holding meetings, and for
transacting business, subject, however, to any rules prescribed by the Board of
Directors, and the Committee shall keep minutes of its actions. Action by the
Committee may be taken at meetings thereof attended by not less than a majority
thereof, or without a meeting by instrument in writing signed by not less than a
majority of the members. Except as the Committee's powers and duties may be
limited or otherwise prescribed by the Board of Directors, the Committee, during
the intervals between the meetings of the Board, shall possess and may exercise
all of the powers and authority of the Board of Directors, however conferred,
provided, however, that the Committee shall not be empowered to elect the
officers (other than Assistant Secretaries and Assistant Treasurers) or to fill
vacancies in the Board of Directors or in the Executive Committee. Subject to
such exceptions, persons dealing with the Corporation shall be entitled to rely
upon any action of the Committee with the same force and effect as though such
action had been taken by the Board of Directors.

elect a Chief Executive Officer to manage the affairs of the Corporation,
subject to the direction and control of the Board of Directors. All of the
officers shall be elected by the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, by specific action, the Board of Directors may authorize the Chairman
or the President to appoint any person to any office other than Chairman,
President, Corporate Secretary, or Treasurer. Any number of offices may be held
by the same person, and no two offices must be held by the same person. Any of
the offices may be left vacant from time to time as the Board of Directors may
determine. In case of the absence or disability of any officer of the
Corporation or for any other reason deemed sufficient by a majority of the Board
of Directors, the Board of Directors may delegate the absent or disabled
officer's powers or duties to any other officer or to any director.

Section 23. Authority and Duties of Officers.
- ----------- ---------------------------------

 The officers of the Corporation shall have such authority and shall
perform such duties as are customarily incident to their respective offices, or
as may be specified from time to time by the Board of Directors, the Chairman or
the President regardless of whether such authority and duties are customarily
incident to such office.

Section 24. Compensation.
- ----------- ------------

 The compensation of all officers and agents of the Corporation who are
also members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation will be fixed by the
Board of Directors or by a committee of the Board of Directors. The Board of
Directors may fix, or delegate the power to fix, the compensation of the other
officers and agents of the Corporation to the Chief Executive Officer or any
other officer of the Corporation.

Section 25. Succession.
- ---------- ----------

 The officers of the Corporation will hold office until their successors
are elected. Any officer may be removed at any time by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the whole Board. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the
Corporation may be filled by the Board of Directors or by the Chairman or
President as provided in Regulation 22.

Section 26. Delegation of Duties.

other officer and generally to control the action of the officers and to require
the performance of duties in addition to those mentioned herein.

Section 27. Signing Checks and Other Instruments.

 The Directors are authorized to determine or provide the method of
determining how checks, notes, bills or exchange and similar instruments shall
be signed, countersigned or endorsed.

CERTIFICATES OF STOCK

Section 28. Contents of Certificates.
- ----------- -------------------------

 Every shareholder shall be entitled to one or more certificates, signed by
the President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer, an Assistant Treasurer,
the Corporate Secretary, or an Assistant Corporate Secretary of the Corporation,
certifying the number and class of shares owned by him in the Corporation. If
the Corporation is authorized to issue shares of more than one class or more
than one series of any class, there shall be set forth upon the face or back of
the certificate a full or summary statement of the designations, preferences and
relative, participating, optional or other special rights of the various classes
of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions
of such rights, or the certificate shall have a statement that the Corporation
will furnish such information to any shareholders upon request and without
charge. If the Corporation shall be authorized to issue only special stock, such
certificate shall set forth in full or summarize the rights of the holders of
such stock.

Section 29. Countersignature of Authentication by Transfer Agents or Registrars.
- ----------- -------------------------------------------------------------------

 Whenever any certificate is countersigned or otherwise authenticated by a
transfer agent or registrar, then a facsimile of the signatures of such officers
of the Corporation may be engraved, stamped, or printed upon such certificate in
lieu of the actual signatures. In case any officer or officers who shall have
signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used on, any
such certificate or certificates shall cease to be an officer or officers of the
Corporation, whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such
certificate or certificates shall have been delivered by the Corporation, such
certificate or certificates may nevertheless be adopted by the Corporation and
be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed such
certificate or certificates, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall
have been used thereon, had not ceased to be an officer or officers of such
Corporation.

LOST CERTIFICATES

Section 30. Replacement of Lost Certificates.
- ----------- ---------------------------------

 The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate or certificates to be
issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the
Corporation alleged to have been lost or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be
lost or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or
certificates, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost or destroyed
certificate or certificates, or his legal representative, to advertise the same
in such manner as it shall require and/or give the Corporation a bond in such
sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost or
destroyed.

TRANSFER OF STOCK

Section 31. Transfer of Stock.
- ----------- ------------------

 Upon surrender to the Corporation or the transfer agent of the Corporation
of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of
succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the
Corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel
the old certificate and record the transaction on its books.

RECORD DATES AND CLOSING OF TRANSFER BOOKS

Section 32. Record Dates and Closing of Transfer Books.
- ----------- -------------------------------------------

 The Board of Directors may fix a time not exceeding sixty (60) days
preceding the date of any meeting of shareholders or the date fixed for the
payment of any dividend or distribution or the date for the allotment of rights
as the record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice
of or to vote at any such meeting or entitled to receive payment of any such
dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, and in such case only
shareholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to notice of or to
vote at such meeting or to receive payment of such dividend, distribution or
allotment of rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any
shares on the books of the Corporation after any record date so fixed. The Board
of Directors may close the books of the Corporation against transfers of shares
during the whole or any part of the period between such record date and the date
of the event in respect for which such record date was fixed.

REGISTERED SHAREHOLDERS

Section 33. Recognition of Record Ownership.
- ----------- --------------------------------

 The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a
person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and
to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person
registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to
recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on
the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other
notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Ohio.

Company), for value received, hereby promises to pay to
_________________________________, or registered assigns, the principal sum of
_______________________ dollars _________), on September 1, 2033, in any coin
or currency of the United States of America which at the time of such payment
shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, and to pay
interest on the unpaid principal amount hereof in like coin or currency to the
registered owner hereof at such rate per annum on each interest payment date
(hereinafter defined) as shall cause the amount of interest payable on such
interest payment date on the Bonds of this Series (hereinafter defined) to equal
the amount of interest payable on such interest payment date on the Revenue
Bonds (hereinafter defined). Such interest shall be payable on the same dates as
interest is payable on said Revenue Bonds (each such date hereinafter called an
"interest payment date"), until maturity or redemption of this Bond, or, if the
Company shall default in the payment of the principal due on this Bond, until
the Company's obligation with respect to the payment of such principal shall be
discharged as provided in the Indenture (hereinafter defined). The amount of
interest payable on each interest payment date shall be computed on the same
basis as the corresponding amount is computed on the Revenue Bonds, provided,
however, that the aggregate amount of interest payable on any interest payment
date shall not exceed an amount which results in an interest rate of more than
10 per annum on the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds of this Series
outstanding from time to time.

 Except as hereinafter provided, this Bond shall bear interest (a) from the
interest payment date next preceding the date of this Bond to which interest has
been paid, or (b) if the date of this Bond is an interest payment date to which
interest has been paid, then from such date, or (c) if no interest has been paid
on this Bond, then from the date of initial issue.

This Bond is one of the Bonds of the Company, known as its First Mortgage
Bonds, issued and to be issued in one or more series under and equally and
ratably secured (except as any sinking, amortization, improvement or other fund,
established in accordance with the provisions of said Indenture, may afford
additional security for the Bonds of any particular series) by a certain
Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated as of April 1, 1947 (hereinafter
called the "Original Indenture"), made by the Company to The Chase National Bank
of the City of New York (The Chase Manhattan Bank, successor), as Trustee
(hereinafter called the "Trustee"), and by certain indentures supplemental
thereto, including the Fifty-first Supplemental Indenture dated as of September
1, 2000 (the Original Indenture and said indentures supplemental thereto herein
collectively called the "Indenture" and said Fifty-first Supplemental Indenture
hereinafter called the "Supplemental Indenture"), to which Indenture reference
is hereby made for a description of the property mortgaged, the nature and
extent of the security, the rights and limitations of rights of the Company, the
Trustee and the holders of said Bonds and of the coupons appurtenant to coupon
Bonds under the Indenture and the terms and conditions upon which said Bonds are
and are to be issued and secured, to all of the provisions of which Indenture
and of all such supplemental indentures in respect of such security, including
the provisions of the Indenture permitting the issue of Bonds of any series for
property which, under the restrictions and limitations therein specified, may be
subject to liens prior to the lien of the Indenture, the holder, by accepting
this Bond, assents. To the extent permitted by and as provided in the Indenture,
the rights and obligations of the Company and of the holders of said Bonds and
coupons (including those pertaining to any sinking or other fund) may be changed
and modified, with the consent of the Company, by the holders of at least 75 in
aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding, such percentage being
determined as provided in the Indenture; provided, however, that in case such
changes and modifications affect one or more but less than all series of Bonds
then outstanding, they shall be required to be adopted only by the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least 75 in aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Bonds of such one or more series so affected; and further provided, that without
the consent of the holder hereof no such change or modification shall be made
which will extend the time of payment of the principal of, or of the interest or
premium, if any, on this Bond or reduce the principal amount hereof or the rate
of interest or the premium, if any, hereon, or affect any other modification of
the terms of payment of such principal or interest or premium, if any, or will
permit the creation of any lien ranking prior to or on a parity with the lien of
the Indenture on any of the mortgaged property, or will deprive the holder
hereof of the benefit of a lien upon the mortgaged property for the security of
this Bond, or will reduce the percentage of Bonds required for the adoption of
changes or modifications as aforesaid.

 This Bond is one of a series of Bonds designated as the First Mortgage
Bonds, Pledge Series C of 2000 due 2033, of the Company (herein called the
"Bonds of this Series") limited, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture,
in aggregate principal amount to 30,900,000, and is issued under and secured by
the Supplemental Indenture.

The Bonds of this Series have been issued by the Company to the Insurer to
(i) provide for the payment of the Company's obligations to make payments to the
Insurer under the Insurance Agreement and (ii) provide to the Insurer the
benefits of the security provided for the Bonds of this Series. The Insurance
Agreement has been entered into by the Company in connection with the issuance
by the Insurer of a municipal bond insurance policy (the "Policy") in favor of
the Ohio Water Development Authority (the "Authority") insuring the payment of
the principal of and interest on 30,900,000 aggregate amount of the Authority's
Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2000-B (the Toledo Edison
Company Project) (the "Revenue Bonds"). Payments made by the Company of
principal and interest on the Bonds of this Series are intended to be sufficient
to reimburse the Insurer for any payments of principal and interest made by the
Insurer on the Revenue Bonds pursuant to the Policy.

 The Bonds of this Series are not transferable except (i) as required to
effect an assignment to a successor of the Insurer under the Insurance Agreement
or (ii) in compliance with a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction in
connection with any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding of the Company.

 The Company's obligation to make payments with respect to the principal of
and/or interest on the Bonds of this Series shall be fully or partially
satisfied and discharged to the extent that, at the time any such payment shall
be due, the corresponding amount then due of principal of and/or interest on the
Revenue Bonds shall have been fully or partially paid (other than by the
application of the proceeds of any payment by the Insurer under the Policy), as
the case may be, or there shall have been deposited with the Trustee for the
Revenue bonds trust funds sufficient to fully or partially pay, as the case may
be, the corresponding amount then due of principal of and/or interest on the
Revenue Bonds (other than by the application of the proceeds of any payment by
the Insurer under the Policy). Notwithstanding anything contained herein or in
the Indenture to the contrary, the Company shall be obligated to make payments
with respect to the principal of and/or interest on the Bonds of this Series
only to the extent that the Insurer has made a payment with respect to the
Revenue Bonds under the Policy.

 Upon payment of the principal of and interest due on the Revenue Bonds,
whether at maturity or prior to maturity by acceleration, redemption or
otherwise, or upon provision for the payment thereof having been made in
accordance with the indenture under which the Revenue Bonds are issued (other
than by the application of the proceeds of any payment by the Insurer under the
Policy), the Bonds of this Series in a principal amount equal to the principal
amount of Revenue Bonds so paid or for which such provision for payment has been
made shall be deemed fully paid, satisfied and discharged and the obligations of
the Company thereunder shall be terminated and such Bonds of this Series shall
be surrendered to and canceled by the Trustee. From and after the Release Date
(as defined in the Insurance Agreement), the Bonds of this Series shall be
deemed fully paid, satisfied and discharged and the obligation of the Company
thereunder shall be terminated. On the Release Date, the Bonds of this Series
shall be surrendered to and canceled by the Trustee.

The Bonds of this Series are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or
in part, as the case may be, on each date that Revenue Bonds are to be redeemed.
The principal amount of the Bonds of this Series to be redeemed on any such date
shall be equal to the principal amount of Revenue Bonds called for redemption on
that date. All redemptions of Bonds of this Series shall be at 100 of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest to the redemption date.

 The principal of this Bond may be declared or may become due before the
maturity hereof, on the conditions, in the manner and at the times set forth in
the Indenture, upon the happening of a default as therein defined.

 No recourse under or upon any covenant or obligation of the Indenture, or
of any indenture supplemental thereto, or of this Bond, for the payment of the
principal of or the interest on this Bond, or for any claim based thereon, or
otherwise in any manner in respect thereof, shall be had against any
incorporator, subscriber to the capital stock, stockholder, officer or director,
as such, of the Company, whether former, present or future, either directly or
indirectly through the Company or any predecessor or successor corporation or
the Trustee, by the enforcement of any subscription to capital stock, assessment
or otherwise, or by any legal or equitable proceeding by virtue of any
constitution, statute, or otherwise (including, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, any proceeding to enforce any claimed liability of
stockholders of the Company based upon any theory of disregarding the corporate
entity of the Company or upon any theory that the Company was acting as the
agent or instrumentality of the stockholders), any and all such liability of
incorporators, stockholders, subscribers, officers and directors, as such, being
released by the holder hereof, by the acceptance of this Bond, and being
likewise waived and released by the terms of the Indenture.

 This Bond shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until
the certificate of authentication endorsed hereon shall have been signed by The
Chase Manhattan Bank or its successor, as Trustee under the Indenture.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, THE TOLEDO EDISON COMPANY has caused this Bond to be
signed in its name by its President or a Vice-President and its corporate seal
to be impressed or imprinted hereon and attested by its Corporate Secretary or

be issued hereunder and thereunder, as hereinafter provided, as follows:

 ARTICLE I

 CREATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BONDS OF 2000 PLEDGE SERIES C

 SECTION 1. A new series of bonds to be issued under and secured by the
Indenture is hereby created, to be designated as "First Mortgage Bonds, Pledge
Series C of 2000 due 2033" (such bonds herein referred to as the "Bonds of 2000
Pledge Series C"). The Bonds of 2000 Pledge Series C shall be limited to an
aggregate principal amount of 30,900,000. The Bonds of 2000 Pledge Series C
shall be substantially in the form hereinbefore recited.

 SECTION 2. The principal of all Bonds of 2000 Pledge Series C shall be
payable on September 1, 2033, unless earlier redeemed, and shall bear interest
from the time hereinafter provided at such rate per annum on each interest
payment date (hereinafter defined) as shall cause the amount of interest payable
on each interest payment date on the Bonds of 2000 Pledge Series C to equal the
amount of interest payable on such interest payment date on the Revenue Bonds.
Such interest shall be payable on the same dates as interest is payable on the
Revenue Bonds (each such date herein called an "interest payment date"), until
the maturity or redemption of the Bonds of 2000 Pledge Series C, or, in the case
of any default by the Company in the payment of the principal due on any such
Bonds, until the Company's obligation with respect to the payment of such
principal shall be discharged as provided in the Indenture. The amount of
interest payable on each interest payment date shall be computed on the same
basis as the corresponding amount is computed on the Revenue Bonds, provided,
however, that the aggregate amount of interest payable on any interest payment
date shall not exceed an amount which results in an interest rate of more than
10 per annum on the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds of 2000 Pledge
Series C outstanding from time to time.

Except as hereinafter provided, each Bond of 2000 Pledge Series C shall
bear interest (a) from the interest payment date next preceding the date of such
Bond to which interest has been paid, or (b) if the date of such Bond is an
interest payment date to which interest has been paid, then from such date, or
(c) if no interest has been paid thereon, then from the date of initial issue.
The Trustee may rely upon the certification of the Insurer of the interest rate
of, interest payment dates of and basis on which interest is computed for, the
Revenue Bonds as necessary to enable the Trustee to determine for the Bonds of
2000 Pledge Series C their corresponding interest rate, interest payment dates
and basis on which interest shall be computed and with respect to its payments
under the Policy.

 SECTION 3. The Bonds of 2000 Pledge Series C shall be payable as to
principal and interest at the office or agency of the Company in the City of
Akron, State of Ohio; and principal and interest shall be payable in any coin or
currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment shall be
legal tender for the payment of public and private debts.

 SECTION 4. The Bonds of 2000 Pledge Series C shall be issued only as fully
registered Bonds in the denominations of 1,000 or any higher multiple of 1.00.

 SECTION 5. Except as may be necessary to comply with a final order of a
court of competent jurisdiction in connection with any bankruptcy or
reorganization proceeding of the Company, the Bonds of 2000 Pledge Series C
shall be transferable only to a successor to Ambac Assurance Corporation under
the Insurance Agreement in the manner and upon the terms set forth in ss. 2.05

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
 ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

This discussion includes forward-looking statements based on
information currently available to management that is subject to certain risks
and uncertainties. Such statements typically contain, but are not limited to,
the terms anticipate, potential, expect, believe, estimate and similar words.
Actual results may differ materially due to the speed and nature of increased
competition and deregulation in the electric utility industry, economic or
weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changes in markets for
energy services, changing energy and commodity market prices, legislative and
regulatory changes (including revised environmental requirements), and the
availability and cost of capital.

Corporate Separation
- --------------------

 Beginning on January 1, 2001, Ohio customers were able to choose
their electricity suppliers as a result of legislation which restructured the
electric utility industry. That legislation required unbundling the price for
electricity into its component elements - including generation, transmission,
distribution and transition charges. Also, Ohio utilities that offer both
competitive and regulated retail electric services were required to implement a
corporate separation plan approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
(PUCO) -- one which provides a clear separation between regulated and
competitive operations. In connection with FirstEnergy's transition plan,
FirstEnergy separated its businesses into three distinct units -- a competitive
services unit, a utility services unit and a corporate support services unit. We
are included in the utility services unit and continue to deliver power to homes
and businesses through our existing distribution system and maintain the
"provider of last resort" (PLR) obligations under our rate plan.

 As a result of the transition plan, FirstEnergy's electric utility
operating companies (EUOC) entered into power supply agreements whereby
FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. (FES) purchases all of the EUOC nuclear generation,
as well as generation from leased fossil generating facilities. FirstEnergy
Generation Corp. (FGCO), a wholly owned subsidiary of FES, leases fossil
generating units owned by the EUOC. We are a "full requirements" customer of FES
to enable us to meet our PLR responsibilities in our service area. We continue
to provide power directly to wholesale customers under previously negotiated
contracts as well as to alternative energy suppliers as part of our market
support generation of 160 megawatts (129 megawatts committed as of December 31,
2001).

 The effect on our reported results of operations during 2001 from
FirstEnergy's corporate separation plan and our sale of transmission assets to
American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI) in September 2000, are summarized in
the following tables:

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

 Earnings on common stock in 2001 decreased 61 to 46.8 million from
 121.0 million in 2000. Excluding the effects shown in the table above, earnings
on common stock increased by 4.1 in 2001 from 2000, being favorably affected by
reduced operating expenses and taxes, and lower net interest charges, which were
substantially offset by reduced operating revenues. In 2000, earnings on common
stock increased 45 to 121.0 million from 83.7 million in 1999. Results in
2000 were favorably affected by higher operating revenues and lower fuel and
purchased power costs, other operating costs and net interest charges.

 Excluding the effects shown in the table above, operating revenues
decreased by 54.7 million or 5.7 in 2001 from 2000 following a 33.8 million
increase in 2000 from the prior year. Customer choice in Ohio and the influence
of a declining national economy on our regional business activity combined to
lower operating revenues. Sales of electric generation provided by other
suppliers in our service area represented 5.6 of total energy delivered in
2001. Retail generation sales declined in all customer categories resulting in
an overall 4.0 reduction in kilowatt-hour sales from the prior year.
Distribution deliveries increased 1.7 in 2001 from the prior year despite the
weaker national economic environment. As part of Ohio's electric utility
restructuring law, the implementation of a 5 reduction in generation charges
for residential customers reduced operating revenues by approximately 8.0
million in 2001, compared to 2000. Operating revenues were also lower in 2001
from the prior year due to the absence of revenues associated with the
low-income payment plan now administered by the Ohio Department of Development;
there was also a corresponding reduction in other operating costs associated
with that change. Revenues from kilowatt-hour sales to wholesale customers
declined 36.5 million in 2001 from last year, with a corresponding 37.2 
reduction in kilowatt-hour sales.

 In 2000, additional kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers, which
were partially offset by lower average retail unit prices, and sales to the
wholesale market, were the primary contributors to higher operating revenues,
compared to 1999. Sales to wholesale customers in 2000 benefited from additional
available generating capacity. Kilowatt-hour sales to residential, commercial
and industrial customers were all higher in 2000, compared to the preceding
year. Transmission service revenues also contributed to the increase in
operating revenues.

Operating Expenses and Taxes

 Total operating expenses and taxes increased by 227.9 million in
2001 and by 4.2 million in 2000 from the prior year. Excluding the effects of
restructuring, total 2001 operating expenses and taxes were 48.0 million lower
than the prior year. The following table presents changes from the prior year by
expense category excluding the impact of restructuring.

 Operating Expenses and Taxes - Changes 2001 2000
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 Increase (Decrease) (In millions)
 Fuel and purchased power...................... (49.8) (10.1)
 Nuclear operating costs....................... (16.5) 3.0
 Other operating costs......................... 8.9 (15.1)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total operation and maintenance expenses.... 57.4 (22.2)

 General taxes................................. (27.7) 3.0
 Income taxes.................................. 9.1 22.2
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total operating expenses and taxes.......... (48.0) 4.2
 ====================================================================

The following discussion excludes the effects shown in the preceding
table related to the impact of restructuring.

The decrease in fuel and purchased power costs in 2001, compared to
2000, reflects the transfer of fossil operations to FGCO with our power
requirements being provided under the PSA. In 2000, fuel and purchased power
costs decreased 10.1 million, compared to 1999. A 13.2 million reduction in
fuel expense was partially offset by a 3.1 million increase in purchased power
costs. The reduction in fuel expense in 2000 from the preceding year occurred
despite a 1.4 increase in internal generation. Factors contributing to the
lower fuel expense included the expiration of an above-market coal contract at
the end of 1999 and continued improvement in coal blending strategies.

 There was one less nuclear refueling outage in 2001, compared to
2000, resulting in a 16.5 million decrease in nuclear operating costs from the
prior year. In 2000, nuclear operating costs increased slightly by 3.0 million,
compared to 1999. Higher outage-related costs at the Davis-Besse Plant and
Beaver Valley Unit 2 were substantially offset by lower operating costs at the
Perry Plant. Other operating costs increased by 8.9 million in 2001 from the
prior year reflecting planned maintenance work at the Bruce Mansfield Plant and
the absence in 2001 of gains from the sale of emission allowances, offset in
part by a reduction in low-income payment plan customer costs and decreased
storm damage costs. and the absence of costs incurred in 2000 related to the
development of a distribution communications system. In 2000, other operating
costs decreased 15.1 million, compared to 1999, principally due to increased
gains of 18.9 million realized from the sale of emission allowances in 2000.

 Depreciation and amortization increased by 28.0 million in 2001 from
the prior year due to incremental transition cost amortization under our
transition plan, partially offset by new deferrals for shopping incentives.

 General taxes decreased by 27.7 million in 2001 from 2000 due to
reduced property taxes and other state tax changes in connection with the Ohio
electric industry restructuring. The reduction in general taxes was partially
offset by 6.5 million of new Ohio franchise taxes in 2001, which are classified
as state income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Net Interest Charges

 Net interest charges continued to trend lower decreasing by 6.6
million in 2001 and by 11.7 million in 2000, compared to the prior year. We
continued to redeem our outstanding debt during 2001 -- net redemptions totaled
 29.4 million and will result in annualized savings of 2.7 million.

Capital Resources and Liquidity
- -------------------------------

 Through net debt and preferred stock redemptions, we continued to
reduce the cost of debt and preferred stock, and improve our financial position
in 2001. During 2001, we reduced our total debt by approximately 91 million.
Our common stockholder's equity as a percentage of capitalization increased to
45 as of December 31, 2001 from 27 at the end of 1997. We have reduced the
average cost of outstanding debt from 9.13 in 1996 to 7.41 in 2001.

 Following approval of the merger of FirstEnergy and GPU by the New
Jersey Board of Public Utilities on September 26, 2001, Standard & Poor's
upgraded our credit ratings. Following a period of review and after the
Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of the merger on October 29, 2001,
Moody's also upgraded our credit ratings. The following table summarizes the
changes:

We had about 7.9 million of cash and temporary investments and 17.2
million of short-term indebtedness as of December 31, 2001. Under our first
mortgage indenture, as of December 31, 2001, we had the capability to issue 415
million of additional first mortgage bonds on the basis of property additions
and retired bonds. Based on our earnings in 2001 under the earnings coverage
test contained in our charter, we could issue 102.4 million of preferred stock
(assuming no additional debt was issued).

 Our cash requirements in 2002 for operating expenses, construction
expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and preferred stock redemptions are
expected to be met without increasing our net debt and preferred stock
outstanding. Major contractual obligations for future cash payments are
summarized in the following table:

Total......................... 298 195 323 94 82 1,174 2,166
=========================================================================================================

Operating lease payments are net of capital trust receipts of 395.3 million (see Note 2).

Our capital spending for the period 2002-2006 is expected to be about
 228 million (excluding nuclear fuel) of which approximately 72 million applies
to 2002. Investments for additional nuclear fuel during the 2002-2006 period are
estimated to be approximately 120 million, of which about 12 million relates
to 2002. During the same periods, our nuclear fuel investments are expected to
be reduced by approximately 114 million and 22 million, respectively, as the
nuclear fuel is consumed.

 Off balance sheet obligations primarily consist of sale and leaseback
arrangements involving the Bruce Mansfield Plant and Beaver Valley Unit 2, which
is reflected in the operating lease payments above (see Note 2 - Leases). The
present value as of December 31, 2001, of these sale and leaseback operating
lease commitments, net of trust investments, total 621 million. We sell
substantially all of our retail customer receivables, which provided 103
million of off balance sheet financing as of December 31, 2001.

 On November 29, 2001, FirstEnergy reached an agreement to sell our
648 MW Bay Shore Plant (with an aggregate net book value of 80 million as of
December 31, 2001). The net, after-tax gain from the sale, based on the
difference between the sale price of the plant and its fair value as defined in
our Ohio restructuring transition plan, will be credited to customers by
reducing the transition cost recovery period. The sale is expected to close in
mid-2002.

Interest Rate Risk
- ------------------

 Our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is reduced
since a significant portion of our debt has fixed interest rates, as noted in
the table below. We are subject to the inherent risks related to refinancing
maturing debt by issuing new debt securities. As discussed in Note 2, our
investment in the Shippingport Capital Trust effectively reduces future lease
obligations, also reducing interest rate risk. Changes in the market value of
our nuclear decommissioning trust funds are recognized by making corresponding
changes to the decommissioning liability, as described in Note 1 - Utility Plant
and Depreciation.

 The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted
average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt
obligations.

Outlook
- -------

 Our industry continues to transition to a more competitive
environment. We continue to deliver power to homes and businesses through our
existing distribution system, which remains regulated. Customer rates have been
restructured into separate components to support customer choice. In Ohio, we
have a continuing responsibility to provide power to those customers not
choosing to receive power from an alternative energy supplier. Adopting new
approaches to regulation and experiencing new forms of competition has created
new uncertainties.

Regulatory Matters

 Beginning on January 1, 2001 Ohio customers were able to choose their
electricity suppliers. Ohio customer rates were restructured to establish
separate charges for transmission, distribution, transition cost recovery and a
generation-related component. When one of our customers elects to obtain power
from an alternative supplier, we

reduce the customer's bill with a "generation shopping credit," based on the
regulated generation component plus an incentive, and the customer receives a
generation charge from the alternative supplier. We have continuing
responsibility to provide energy to our franchise customers as the PLR through
December 31, 2005.

 The transition cost portion of rates provides for recovery of certain
amounts not otherwise recoverable in a competitive generation market (such as
regulatory assets). Transition costs are paid by all customers whether or not
they choose an alternative supplier. Under the PUCO-approved transition plan, we
assumed the risk of not recovering up to 80 million of transition revenue if
the rate of customers (excluding contracts and full-service accounts) switching
from our service to an alternative supplier does not reach 20 for any
consecutive twelve-month period by December 31, 2005 - the end of the market
development period. As of December 31, 2001, the customer-switching rate, on an
annualized basis, implies that our risk of not recovering transition revenue has
been reduced to approximately 35 million. We are also committed under the
transition agreement to make available 160 MW of our generating capacity to
marketers, brokers, and aggregators at set prices, to be used for sales only to
retail customers in our service area. Through December 31, 2001, approximately
129 MW of the 160 MW supply commitment had been secured by alternative
suppliers. We began accepting customer applications for switching to alternative
suppliers on December 8, 2000; as of December 31, 2001 we had been notified that
almost 93,000 of our customers requested generation service from other
authorized suppliers, including FES, an affiliated company.

Environmental Matters

 We are in compliance with the current sulfur dioxide (SO2) and
nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990. In 1998, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized
regulations requiring additional NOx reductions in the future from our Ohio and
Pennsylvania facilities. Various regulatory and judicial actions have since
sought to further define NOx reduction requirements (see Note 5 - Environmental
Matters). We continue to evaluate our compliance plans and other compliance
options.

 Violations of federally approved SO2 regulations can result in
shutdown of the generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of
up to 27,500 for each day a unit is in violation. The EPA has an interim
enforcement policy for SO2 regulations in Ohio that allows for compliance based
on a 30-day averaging period. We cannot predict what action the EPA may take in
the future with respect to the interim enforcement policy.

 In December 2000, the EPA announced it would proceed with the
development of regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants from electric
power plants. The EPA identified mercury as the hazardous air pollutant of
greatest concern. The EPA established a schedule to propose regulations by
December 2003 and issue final regulations by December 2004. The future cost of
compliance with these regulations may be substantial.

 As a result of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as
amended, and the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state
hazardous waste regulations have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel
combustion waste products, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste
disposal requirements pending the EPA's evaluation of the need for future
regulation. The EPA has issued its final regulatory determination that
regulation of coal ash as a hazardous waste is unnecessary. In April 2000, the
EPA announced that it will develop national standards regulating disposal of
coal ash under its authority to regulate nonhazardous waste.

 We have been named as a "potentially responsible party" (PRP) at
waste disposal sites which may require cleanup under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of
disposal of hazardous substances at historical sites and the liability involved,
are often unsubstantiated and subject to dispute. Federal law provides that all
PRPs for a particular site be held liable on a joint and several basis. We have
accrued a liability of 0.2 million as of December 31, 2001, based on estimates
of the total costs of cleanup, the proportionate responsibility of other PRPs
for such costs and the financial ability of other PRPs to pay. We believe that
waste disposal costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, cash flows, or results of operations.

Legal Matters

 Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to our normal
business operations are pending against FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries. The
most significant applicable to us are described above.

Significant Accounting Policies
- -------------------------------

 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Application of
these principles often requires a high degree of judgment, estimates and
assumptions that affect our financial results. All of our assets are subject to
their own specific risks and uncertainties and are continually reviewed for
impairment. Assets related to the application of the policies discussed below
are similarly

reviewed with their risks and uncertainties reflecting these specific factors.
Our more significant accounting policies are described below.

Regulatory Accounting

 We are subject to regulation that sets the prices (rates) we are
permitted to charge our customers based on our costs that the regulatory
agencies determine we are permitted to recover. At times, regulators permit the
future recovery through rates of costs that would be currently charged to
expense by an unregulated company. This rate-making process results in the
recording of regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash inflows. As a
result of the changing regulatory framework in Ohio, significant amounts of
regulatory assets have been recorded -- 389 million as of December 31, 2001. We
continually review these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within
the approved regulatory guidelines. Impairment risk associated with these assets
relates to potentially adverse legislative, judicial or regulatory actions in
the future. As disclosed in Note 1 - Regulatory Plans, our full recovery of
transition costs is dependent on achieving 20 customer shopping levels in any
twelve-month period by December 31, 2005.

Revenue Recognition

 We follow the accrual method of accounting for revenues, recognizing
revenue for kilowatt-hour that have been delivered but not yet been billed
through the end of the year. The determination of unbilled revenues requires
management to make various estimates including:

 o Net energy generated or purchased for retail load
 o Losses of energy over distribution lines
 o Allocations to distribution companies within the FirstEnergy system
 o Mix of kilowatt-hour usage by residential, commercial and industrial
 customers
 o Kilowatt-hour usage of customers receiving electricity from alternative
 suppliers

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
- ------------------------------------

 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approved SFAS 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," on June 29, 2001. Under SFAS 142,
amortization of existing goodwill will cease January 1, 2002. Instead, goodwill
will be tested for impairment at least on an annual basis, and no impairment of
goodwill is anticipated as a result of a preliminary analysis. In 2001, we
amortized about 12 million of goodwill.

 In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. (SFAS) 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The new
statement provides accounting standards for retirement obligations associated
with tangible long-lived assets, with adoption required by January 1, 2003. SFAS
143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred. The associated
asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset. Over time the capitalized costs are depreciated and the
present value of the asset retirement liability increases resulting in a period
expense. Upon retirement, a gain or loss will be recorded if the cost to settle
the retirement obligation differs from the carrying amount. We are currently
assessing the new standard and have not yet determined the impact on our
financial statements.

 In September 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of." The Statement also supersedes the accounting and reporting
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results
of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and
Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions." Our
adoption of this Statement, effective January 1, 2002, will result in our
accounting for any future impairments or disposals of long-lived assets under
the provisions of SFAS 144, but will not change the accounting principles used
in previous asset impairments or disposals. Application of SFAS 144 is not
anticipated to have a major impact on our accounting for impairments or disposal
transactions compared to the prior application of SFAS 121 or APB 30.

The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

 The consolidated financial statements include The Toledo Edison
Company (Company) and its 90 owned subsidiary, The Toledo Edison Capital
Corporation (TECC). The subsidiary was formed in 1997 to make equity investments
in a business trust in connection with the financing transactions related to the
Bruce Mansfield Plant sale and leaseback (see Note 2). The Cleveland Electric
Illuminating Company (CEI), an affiliate, has a 10 interest in TECC. All
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company is a
wholly owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. FirstEnergy holds directly all of
the issued and outstanding common shares of its principal electric utility
operating subsidiaries, including, the Company, CEI, Ohio Edison Company (OE),
American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI), Jersey Central Power & Light Company
(JCP&L), Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed) and Pennsylvania Electric Company
(Penelec). JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec were formerly wholly owned subsidiaries of
GPU, Inc. which merged with FirstEnergy on November 7, 2001.

 The Company follows the accounting policies and practices prescribed
by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(GAAP) requires management to make periodic estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

REVENUES-

 The Company's principal business is providing electric service to
customers in northwestern Ohio. The Company's retail customers are metered on a
cycle basis. Revenue is recognized for unbilled electric service through the end
of the year.

 Receivables from customers include sales to residential, commercial
and industrial customers located in the Company's service area and sales to
wholesale customers. There was no material concentration of receivables at
December 31, 2001 or 2000, with respect to any particular segment of the
Company's customers.

 The Company and CEI sell substantially all of their retail customer
receivables to Centerior Funding Corp. (CFC), a wholly owned subsidiary of CEI.
CFC subsequently transfers the receivables to a trust under an asset-backed
securitization agreement. The trust completed private sales of 50 million and
 150 million of receivables-backed investor certificates in 2000 and 2001
respectively, in transactions that qualified for sale accounting treatment.
CFC's creditors are entitled to be satisfied first out of the proceeds of
FirstEnergy's assets. The 2001 private sale was used to repay a 1996 public sale
of 150 million of receivables-backed investor certificates which was replaced
under an amended securitization agreement. FirstEnergy's retained interest in
the pool of receivables held by the trust (34 as of December 31, 2001) is
stated at fair value reflecting adjustments for anticipated credit losses.
Sensitivity analyses reflecting a 10 and 20 increase in the rate of
anticipated credit losses did not significantly affect FirstEnergy's retained
interest in the pool of receivables. Collections from receivables previously
transferred to the trust were used for the purchase of new receivables from CFC
during 2001 and totaled approximately 2.2 billion. As of December 31, 2001,
receivables recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were reduced by
approximately 103 million due to receivables sold to the trust. The Company and
CEI processed receivables for the trust and received servicing fees of
approximately 4.5 million 1.5 million applicable to the Company) in 2001.
Expenses associated with the factoring discount related to the sale of
receivables were 12 million in 2001.

REGULATORY PLAN-

 Ohio's 1999 electric utility restructuring law allowed Ohio electric
customers to select their generation suppliers beginning January 1, 2001,
provided for a five percent reduction on the generation portion of residential
customers' bills and the opportunity for utilities to recover transition costs,
including regulatory assets. Under this law, the PUCO approved FirstEnergy's
transition plan in 2000 as modified by a settlement agreement with major parties
to the transition plan, which it filed on behalf of the Company, OE and CEI. The
settlement agreement included approval for recovery of the amounts of transition
costs filed in the transition plan through no later than mid-2007 for the
Company, except where a longer period of recovery is provided for in the
settlement agreement. The settlement also granted preferred access over
FirstEnergy's subsidiaries to nonaffiliated marketers, brokers and aggregators
to 160 megawatts of generation capacity through 2005 at established prices for
sales to the Company's retail customers. The Company's base electric rates for
distribution service under its prior regulatory plan were extended from December
31, 2005 through December 31, 2007. The transition rate credits for customers
under its prior regulatory plan were also extended through the Company's
transition cost recovery period.

The transition plan itemized, or unbundled, the current price of
electricity into its component elements -- including generation, transmission,
distribution and transition charges. As required by the PUCO's rules,
FirstEnergy's transition plan also resulted in the corporate separation of its
regulated and unregulated operations, operational and technical support changes
needed to accommodate customer choice, an education program to inform customers
of their options under the law, and planned changes in how FirstEnergy's
transmission system will be operated to ensure access to all users. Customer
prices are frozen through a five-year market development period (2001-2005),
except for certain limited statutory exceptions including a 5 reduction in the
price of generation for residential customers.

 The Company's customers electing alternative suppliers receive an
additional incentive applied to the shopping credit of 45 for residential
customers, 30 for commercial customers and 15 for industrial customers. The
amount of the incentive serves to reduce the amortization of transition costs
during the market development period and will be recovered through the extension
of the transition cost recovery period. If the customer shopping goal
established in the agreement are not achieved by the end of 2005, the transition
cost recovery period could be shortened for the Company to reduce recovery by as
much as 80 million, but any such adjustment would be computed on a
class-by-class and pro-rata basis. Based on annualized shopping levels as of
December 31, 2001, the Company believes that the maximum potential recovery
reduction was approximately 35 million.

 The application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS 71),
to the Company's generation business was discontinued with the issuance of the
PUCO transition plan order. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued
interpretive guidance regarding asset impairment measurement that concluded any
supplemental regulated cash flows such as a competitive transition charge should
be excluded from the cash flows of assets in a portion of the business not
subject to regulatory accounting practices. If those assets are impaired, a
regulatory asset should be established if the costs are recoverable through
regulatory cash flows. Consistent with the SEC guidance 53 million of impaired
plant investments were recognized by the Company as regulatory assets
recoverable as transition costs through future regulatory cash flows. Net assets
included in utility plant relating to the operations for which the application
of SFAS 71 was discontinued, were 601 million as of December 31, 2001. All of
the Company's regulatory assets are expected to continue to be recovered under
provisions of the Ohio transition plan.

UTILITY PLANT AND DEPRECIATION-

 Utility plant reflects the original cost of construction (except for
the Company's nuclear generating units which were adjusted to fair value),
including payroll and related costs such as taxes, employee benefits,
administrative and general costs, and interest costs.

 The Company provides for depreciation on a straight-line basis at
various rates over the estimated lives of property included in plant in service.
The annualized composite rate was approximately 3.5 in 2001 and 3.4 in 2000
and 1999.

 Annual depreciation expense includes approximately 28.5 million for
future decommissioning costs applicable to the Company's ownership interests in
three nuclear generating units. The 2001 amounts reflected an increase of
approximately 18 million from implementing the Company's transition plan in
2001. The Company's share of the future obligation to decommission these units
is approximately 456 million in current dollars and (using a 4.0 escalation
rate) approximately 1.0 billion in future dollars. The estimated obligation and
the escalation rate were developed based on site specific studies. Payments for
decommissioning are expected to begin in 2016, when actual decommissioning work
begins. The Company has recovered approximately 139 million for decommissioning
through its electric rates from customers through December 31, 2001. The Company
has also recognized an estimated liability of approximately 5.9 million related
to decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear enrichment facilities operated
by the United States Department of Energy, as required by the Energy Policy Act
of 1992.

 In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS
143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The new statement provides
accounting treatment for retirement obligations associated with tangible
long-lived assets with adoption required as of January 1, 2003. SFAS 143
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation
be recorded in the period in which it is incurred. The associated asset
retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset. Over time the capitalized costs are depreciated and the
present value of the asset retirement liability increases, resulting in a period
expense. Upon retirement, a gain or loss will be recorded if the cost to settle
the retirement obligation differs from the carrying amount. Under the new
standard, additional assets and liabilities relating principally to nuclear
decommissioning obligations will be recorded, the pattern of expense recognition
will change and income from the external decommissioning trust will be recorded
as investment income. The Company is currently assessing the new standard and
has not yet quantified the impact on its financial statements.

COMMON OWNERSHIP OF GENERATING FACILITIES-

 The Company, together with CEI and OE and its wholly owned
subsidiary, Pennsylvania Power Company (Penn), own and/or lease, as tenants in
common, various power generating facilities. Each of the companies is obligated
to pay a share of the costs associated with any jointly owned facility in the
same proportion as its interest. The Company's portion of operating expenses
associated with jointly owned facilities is included in the corresponding
operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The amounts
reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under utility plant at December 31,
2001 include the following:

 Utility Accumulated Construction Ownership/

=============================================================================

 The Bruce Mansfield Plant and Beaver Valley Unit 2 are being leased
through sale and leaseback transactions (see Note 2) and the above-related
amounts represent construction expenditures subsequent to the transaction.

NUCLEAR FUEL-

 Nuclear fuel is recorded at original cost, which includes material,
enrichment, fabrication and interest costs incurred prior to reactor load. The
Company amortizes the cost of nuclear fuel based on the rate of consumption.

INCOME TAXES-

 Details of the total provision for income taxes are shown on the
Consolidated Statements of Taxes. Deferred income taxes result from timing
differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and accounting
purposes. Investment tax credits, which were deferred when utilized, are being
amortized over the recovery period of the related property. The liability method
is used to account for deferred income taxes. Deferred income tax liabilities
related to tax and accounting basis differences are recognized at the statutory
income tax rates in effect when the liabilities are expected to be paid. The
Company is included in FirstEnergy's consolidated federal income tax return. The
consolidated tax liability is allocated on a "stand-alone" company basis, with
the Company recognizing any tax losses or credits it contributed to the
consolidated return.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS-

 FirstEnergy's trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan
covers almost all of the Company's full-time employees. Upon retirement,
employees receive a monthly pension based on length of service and compensation.
On December 31, 2001, the GPU pension plans were merged with the FirstEnergy
plan. The Company uses the projected unit credit method for funding purposes and
was not required to make pension contributions during the three years ended
December 31, 2001. The assets of the FirstEnergy pension plan consist primarily
of common stocks, United States government bonds and corporate bonds. The
FirstEnergy and GPU postretirement benefit plans are currently separately
maintained; the information shown below is aggregated as of December 31, 2001.

 The Company provides a minimum amount of noncontributory life
insurance to retired employees in addition to optional contributory insurance.
Health care benefits, which include certain employee deductibles and copayments,
are also available to retired employees, their dependents and, under certain
circumstances, their survivors. The Company pays insurance premiums to cover a
portion of these benefits in excess of set limits; all amounts up to the limits
are paid by the Company. The Company recognizes the expected cost of providing
other postretirement benefits to employees and their beneficiaries and covered
dependents from the time employees are hired until they become eligible to
receive those benefits.

 The following sets forth the funded status of the plans and amounts
recognized on FirstEnergy's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31:

The composite health care trend rate assumption is approximately 10 
in 2002, 9 in 2003 and 8 in 2004, trending to 4 -6 in later years. Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported
for the health care plan. An increase in the health care trend rate assumption
by one percentage point would increase the total service and interest cost
components by 14.6 million and the postretirement benefit obligation by 151.2
million. A decrease in the same assumption by one percentage point would
decrease the total service and interest cost components by 12.7 million and the
postretirement benefit obligation by 131.3 million.

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES-

 Operating revenues, operating expenses and other income include
transactions with affiliated companies, primarily CEI, OE, Penn, ATSI,
FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. (FES) and FirstEnergy. The Ohio transition plan, as
discussed in the "Regulatory Plans" section, resulted in the corporate
separation of FirstEnergy's regulated and unregulated operations in 2001.
Unregulated operations under FES now operate the generation businesses of the
Company, CEI, OE and Penn. As a result, the Company entered into power supply
agreements (PSA) whereby FES purchases all of the Company's nuclear generation
and the generation from leased fossil generating facilities and the Company
purchases its power from FES to meet its "provider of last resort" obligations.
CFC serves as the transferor in connection with the accounts receivable
securitization for the Company and CEI. The primary affiliated companies
transactions, including the effects of the PSA beginning in 2001, the sale and
leaseback of the Company's transmission assets to ATSI in September 2000 and
FirstEnergy's providing support services at cost, are as follows:

2001 2000 1999

Interest income from FES............ 9.7 -- --
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company is selling 150 megawatts of its Beaver Valley Unit 2
leased capacity entitlement to CEI. Operating revenues for this transaction were
 97.0 million, 104.0 million and 104.3 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. This sale is expected to continue through the end of the lease
period. (See Note 2.)

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOWS INFORMATION-

 All temporary cash investments purchased with an initial maturity of
three months or less are reported as cash equivalents on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at cost, which approximates their fair market value. Noncash
financing and investing activities included capital lease transactions amounting
to 1.0 million, 36.1 million and 8.5 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

 All borrowings with initial maturities of less than one year are
defined as financial instruments under GAAP and are reported on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at cost, which approximates their fair market value. The
following sets forth the approximate fair value and related carrying amounts of
all other long-term debt and investments other than cash and cash equivalents as
of December 31:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 581 582 452 447
==========================================================================================================

The fair value of long-term debt reflects the present value of the
cash outflows relating to those securities based on the current call price, the
yield to maturity or the yield to call, as deemed appropriate at the end of each
respective year. The yields assumed were based on securities with similar
characteristics offered by a corporation with credit ratings similar to the
Company's ratings.

 The fair value of investments other than cash and cash equivalents
represent cost (which approximates fair value) or the present value of the cash
inflows based on the yield to maturity. The yields assumed were based on
financial instruments with similar characteristics and terms. Investments other
than cash and cash equivalents include decommissioning trust investments.
Unrealized gains and losses applicable to the decommissioning trusts have been
recognized in the trust investment with corresponding changes to the
decommissioning liability. The Company has no securities held for trading
purposes.

REGULATORY ASSETS-

 The Company recognizes, as regulatory assets, costs which the FERC
and PUCO have authorized for recovery from customers in future periods. Without
such authorization, the costs would have been charged to income as incurred. All
regulatory assets will continue to be recovered from customers under the
Company's transition plan. Based on that plan, the Company continues to bill and
collect cost-based rates for its transmission and distribution services, which
will remain regulated; accordingly, it is appropriate that the Company continues
the application of SFAS 71 to those operations. The Company recognized
incremental transition cost recovery aggregating 37 million in accordance with
the current Ohio transition plan.

Net regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are
comprised of the following:

 ===========================================================================

2. LEASES:

 The Company leases certain generating facilities, office space and
other property and equipment under cancelable and noncancelable leases.

 The Company and CEI sold their ownership interests in Bruce Mansfield
Units 1, 2 and 3 and the Company sold a portion of its ownership interest in
Beaver Valley Unit 2. In connection with these sales, which were completed in
1987, the Company and CEI entered into operating leases for lease terms of
approximately 30 years as co-lessees. During the terms of the leases, the
Company and CEI continue to be responsible, to the extent of their combined
ownership and leasehold interest, for costs associated with the units including
construction expenditures, operation and maintenance expenses, insurance,
nuclear fuel, property taxes and decommissioning. The Company and CEI have the
right, at the end of the respective basic lease terms, to renew the leases. The
Company and CEI also have the right to purchase the facilities at the expiration
of the basic lease term or renewal term (if elected) at a price equal to the
fair market value of the facilities.

 As co-lessee with CEI, the Company is also obligated for CEI's lease
payments. If CEI is unable to make its payments under the Bruce Mansfield Plant
lease, the Company would be obligated to make such payments. No such payments
have been made on behalf of CEI. (CEI's future minimum lease payments as of
December 31, 2001 were approximately 0.2 billion, net of trust cash receipts.)

 Consistent with the regulatory treatment, the rentals for capital and
operating leases are charged to operating expenses on the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Such costs for the three years ended December 31, 2001 are
summarized as follows:

 2001 2000 1999

 ========================================

The Company and CEI refinanced high-cost fixed obligations related to
their 1987 sale and leaseback transaction for the Bruce Mansfield Plant through
a lower cost transaction in June and July 1997. In a June 1997 offering
(Offering), the two companies pledged 720 million aggregate principal amount 145 million for the Company and 575 million for CEI) of first mortgage bonds
due through 2007 to a trust as security for the issuance of a like principal
amount of secured notes due through 2007. The obligations of the two companies
under these secured notes are joint and several. Using available cash,
short-term borrowings and the net proceeds from the Offering, the two companies
invested 906.5 million 337.1 million for the Company and 569.4 million for
CEI) in a business trust, in June 1997. The trust used these funds in July 1997
to purchase lease notes and redeem all 873.2 million aggregate principal amount
of 10-1/4 and 11-1/8 secured lease obligations bonds (SLOBs) due 2003 and
2016. The SLOBs were issued by a special-purpose funding corporation in 1988 on
behalf of lessors in the two companies' 1987 sale and leaseback transaction. The
Shippingport Capital Trust arrangement effectively reduces lease costs related
to that transaction.

3. CAPITALIZATION:

 (A) RETAINED EARNINGS-

 The Company has a provision in its mortgage that requires common
stock dividends to be paid out of its total balance of retained earnings. The
1997 FirstEnergy merger purchase accounting adjustments included resetting the
retained earnings balance to zero at the November 8, 1997 merger date.

 (B) STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS-

 Employees of the Company participate in stock based plans
administered by FirstEnergy which include the Centerior Equity Plan (CE Plan)
and FirstEnergy Executive and Director Incentive Compensation Plan (FE Plan).
All options are fully vested under the CE Plan, and no further awards are
permitted. Outstanding options will expire on or before February 25, 2007. Under
the FE Plan, total awards cannot exceed 15 million shares of common stock or
their equivalent. Only stock options and restricted stock have been granted,
with vesting periods ranging from six months to seven years.

 Under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, covered employees can
direct a portion of their Annual Incentive Award and/or Long Term Incentive
Award into an unfunded FirstEnergy Stock Account to receive vested stock units.
An additional 20 premium is received in the form of stock units based on the
amount allocated to the FirstEnergy Stock Account. Dividends are calculated
quarterly on stock units outstanding and are paid in the form of additional
stock units. Upon withdrawal, stock units are converted to FirstEnergy shares.
Payout occurs three years from the date of deferral.

 The Company continues to apply APB 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees." As required by SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," the Company has determined pro forma earnings as though the
Company had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method.
The weighted average assumptions used in valuing the options and their resulting
fair values are as follows:

 2001 2000 1999
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Valuation assumptions:
 Expected option term (years) 8.3 7.6 6.4
 Expected volatility......... 23.45 21.77 20.03 
 Expected dividend yield..... 5.00 6.68 5.97 
 Risk-free interest rate..... 4.67 5.28 5.97 
Fair value per option......... 4.97 2.86 3.42
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The following table summarizes the pro forma effect of applying fair
value accounting to the Company's stock options.

 2001 2000 1999
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Earnings on Common Stock (000)
 As Reported................. 46,776 120,986 83,707
 Pro Forma................... 46,623 120,778 83,615
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(C) PREFERRED AND PREFERENCE STOCK-

 Preferred stock may be redeemed by the Company in whole, or in part,
with 30-90 days' notice.

 The preferred dividend rates on the Company's Series A and Series B
shares fluctuate based on prevailing interest rates and market conditions. The
dividend rates for these issues averaged 7.00 and 7.05 , respectively, in 2001.

The Company exercised its option to redeem all outstanding shares of
five series of preferred stock on February 1, 2002 as follows:

 Series Outstanding Shares Call Price
 -------------------------------------------------------
 7.76 150,000 102.44
 7.80 150,000 101.65
 8.32 100,000 102.46
 10.00 190,000 101.00
 2.21 1,000,000 25.25
 -------------------------------------------------------

 The Company has five million authorized and unissued shares of 25
par value preference stock.

 (D) LONG-TERM DEBT-

 The first mortgage indenture and its supplements, which secure all of
the Company's first mortgage bonds, serve as direct first mortgage liens on
substantially all property and franchises, other than specifically excepted
property, owned by the Company.

 Based on the amount of bonds authenticated by the Trustee through
December 31, 2001, the Company's annual sinking and improvement fund
requirements for all bonds issued under the mortgage amounts to 0.4 million.
The Company expects to deposit funds in 2002 that will be withdrawn upon the
surrender for cancellation of a like principal amount of bonds, which are
specifically authenticated for such purposes against unfunded property additions
or against previously retired bonds. This method can result in minor increases
in the amount of the annual sinking fund requirement.

 Sinking fund requirements for first mortgage bonds and maturing
long-term debt (excluding capital leases) for the next five years are:

 (In millions)
 ---------------------------------------------
 2002................................. 263.3
 2003................................. 101.9
 2004................................. 268.7
 2005................................. --
 2006................................. --
 ---------------------------------------------

 The Company's obligations to repay certain pollution control revenue
bonds are secured by several series of first mortgage bonds. Certain pollution
control revenue bonds are entitled to the benefit of irrevocable bank letters of
credit of 68.0 million and a noncancelable municipal bond insurance policy of
 30.9 million to pay principal of, or interest on, the pollution control revenue
bonds. To the extent that drawings are made under the letters of credit, the
Company is entitled to a credit against its obligation to repay those bonds. The
Company pays an annual fee of 1.00 of the amounts of the letters of credit to
the issuing bank and is obligated to reimburse the bank for any drawings
thereunder.

 The Company and CEI have letters of credit of approximately 222
million in connection with the sale and leaseback of Beaver Valley Unit 2 that
expire in May 2002. The letters of credit are secured by first mortgage bonds of
the Company and CEI in the proportion of 60 and 40 , respectively (see Note 2).

4. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS:

 The Company may borrow from its affiliates on a short-term basis. As
of December 31, 2001, the Company had total short-term borrowings of 17.2
million from its affiliates with a weighted average interest rate of
approximately 3.6 .

5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES-

 The Company's current forecast reflects expenditures of approximately
 228 million for property additions and improvements from 2002-2006, of which
approximately 72 million is applicable to 2002. Investments for additional
nuclear fuel during the 2002-2006 period are estimated to be approximately 120
million, of which approximately 12 million applies to 2002. During the same
periods, the Company's nuclear fuel investments are expected to be reduced by
approximately 114 million and 22 million, respectively, as the nuclear fuel is
consumed.

NUCLEAR INSURANCE-

 The Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability relative to a
single incident at a nuclear power plant to 9.5 billion. The amount is covered
by a combination of private insurance and an industry retrospective rating plan.
Based on its ownership and leasehold interests in Beaver Valley Unit 2, the
Davis Besse Station and the Perry Plant, the Company's maximum potential
assessment under the industry retrospective rating plan (assuming the other
affiliate co-owners contribute their proportionate shares of any assessments
under the retrospective rating plan) would be 77.9 million per incident but not
more than 8.8 million in any one year for each incident.

 The Company is also insured as to its respective interests in Beaver
Valley Unit 2, Davis-Besse and Perry under policies issued to the operating
company for each plant. Under these policies, up to 2.75 billion is provided
for property damage and decontamination and decommissioning costs. The Company
has also obtained approximately 263.4 million of insurance coverage for
replacement power costs for its respective interests in Beaver Valley Unit 2,
Davis-Besse and Perry. Under these policies, the Company can be assessed a
maximum of approximately 15.1 million for incidents at any covered nuclear
facility occurring during a policy year which are in excess of accumulated funds
available to the insurer for paying losses.

 The Company intends to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as
described above as long as it is available. To the extent that replacement
power, property damage, decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement
costs and other such costs arising from a nuclear incident at any of the
Company's plants exceed the policy limits of the insurance in effect with
respect to that plant, to the extent a nuclear incident is determined not to be
covered by the Company's insurance policies, or to the extent such insurance
becomes unavailable in the future, the Company would remain at risk for such
costs.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS-

 Various federal, state and local authorities regulate the Company
with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters. In
accordance with the Ohio transition plan discussed in "Regulatory Plans" in Note
1, generation operations and any related additional capital expenditures for
environmental compliance are the responsibility of FirstEnergy's competitive
services business unit.

 The Company is required to meet federally approved sulfur dioxide
(SO2) regulations. Violations of such regulations can result in shutdown of the
generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of up to 27,500 for
each day the unit is in violation. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
an interim enforcement policy for SO2 regulations in Ohio that allows for
compliance based on a 30-day averaging period. The Company cannot predict what
action the EPA may take in the future with respect to the interim enforcement
policy.

 The Company is in compliance with the current SO2 and nitrogen oxides
(NOx) reduction requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. SO2
reductions are being achieved by burning lower-sulfur fuel, generating more
electricity from lower-emitting plants, and/or using emission allowances. NOx
reductions are being achieved through combustion controls and the generation of
more electricity at lower-emitting plants. In September 1998, the EPA finalized
regulations requiring additional NOx reductions from the Company's Ohio and
Pennsylvania facilities. The EPA's NOx Transport Rule imposes uniform reductions
of NOx emissions (an approximate 85 reduction in utility plant NOx emissions
from projected 2007 emissions) across a region of nineteen states and the
District of Columbia, including Ohio and Pennsylvania, based on a conclusion
that such NOx emissions are contributing significantly to ozone pollution in the
eastern United States. State Implementation Plans (SIP) must comply by May 31,
2004 with individual state NOx budgets established by the EPA. Pennsylvania
submitted a SIP that requires compliance with the NOx budgets at the Company's
Pennsylvania facilities by May 1, 2003 and Ohio submitted a "draft" SIP that
requires compliance with the NOx budgets at the Company's Ohio facilities by May
31, 2004. FirstEnergy continues to evaluate its compliance plans and other
compliance options.

 In July 1997, the EPA promulgated changes in the National Ambient Air
Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone emissions and proposed a new NAAQS for
previously unregulated ultra-fine particulate matter. In May 1999, the U.S.
Court of Appeals found constitutional and other defects in the new NAAQS rules.
In February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the new NAAQS rules regulating
ultra-fine particulates but found defects in the new NAAQS rules for ozone and
decided that the EPA must revise those rules. The future cost of compliance with
these regulations may be substantial and will depend if and how they are
ultimately implemented by the states in which the Company operates affected
facilities.

 In December 2000, the EPA announced it would proceed with the
development of regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants from electric
power plants. The EPA identified mercury as the hazardous air pollutant of
greatest concern. The EPA established a schedule to propose regulations by
December 2003 and issue final regulations by December 2004. The future cost of
compliance with these regulations may be substantial.

As a result of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as
amended, and the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state
hazardous waste regulations have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel
combustion waste products, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste
disposal requirements pending the EPA's evaluation of the need for future
regulation. The EPA has issued its final regulatory determination that
regulation of coal ash as a hazardous waste is unnecessary. On April 25, 2000,
the EPA announced that it will develop national standards regulating disposal of
coal ash under its authority to regulate nonhazardous waste.

 The Company has been named as a "potentially responsible party" (PRP)
at waste disposal sites which may require cleanup under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of
disposal of hazardous substances at historical sites and the liability involved
are often unsubstantiated and subject to dispute. Federal law provides that all
PRPs for a particular site be held liable on a joint and several basis. The
Company has accrued a liability of 0.2 million as of December 31, 2001, based
on estimates of the total costs of cleanup, the proportionate responsibility of
other PRPs for such costs and the financial ability of other PRPs to pay. The
Company believes that waste disposal costs will not have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS-

 Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to the Company's
normal business operations are pending against FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries.
The most significant applicable to the Company are described above.

6. SALE OF GENERATING ASSETS:

 On November 29, 2001, FirstEnergy reached an agreement to sell four
coal-fired power plants (with an aggregate net book value of 539 million as of
December 31, 2001) totaling 2,535 MW to NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) for 1.5 billion 1.355 billion in cash and 145 million in debt assumption). The sale includes
the 648 MW Bay Shore plant owned by the Company (with an aggregate net book
value of 80 million as of December 31, 2001). The net, after-tax gain from the
sale, based on the difference between the sale price of the plants and their
market price used in our Ohio restructuring transition plan, will be credited to
customers by reducing the transition cost recovery period. FirstEnergy also
entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with NRG. Under the terms of the
PPA, NRG is obligated to sell up to 10.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity
annually, similar to the average annual output of the plants, through 2005. The
sale is expected to close in mid-2002.

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of The Toledo Edison Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
statements of capitalization of The Toledo Edison Company (an Ohio corporation
and wholly owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp.) and subsidiary as of December
31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, common
stockholder's equity, preferred stock, cash flows and taxes for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of The Toledo Edison Company and
subsidiary as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States.

from the shares of all other series and all shares of the Preferred Stock,
irrespective of series, shall be identical except as to the following relative

following relative rights and preferences of the shares thereof may be
determined, by the Board of Directors or by the stockholders, as may be
permitted by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania then applicable:

Section 2. General Provisions for Preferred Stock
 --------------------------------------------------

 The following provisions shall apply to all the Preferred Stock
irrespective of series:

(A) The holders of the Preferred Stock of each series shall be entitled to
receive dividends, payable when and as declared by the Board of Directors, on
such dates and at such rates as shall be determined for the respective series,
from the first day of the current dividend period within which such stock shall
have been originally issued, before any dividends shall be declared or paid upon
or set apart for the Common Stock or any other kind of stock of the Corporation
not having preference over the Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends. Such
dividends shall be cumulative so that if for any dividend period or periods
dividends shall not have been paid or declared and set apart for payment upon
all outstanding Preferred Stock at the rates determined for the respective
series, the deficiency shall be fully paid, or declared and set apart for
payment, before any dividends shall be declared or paid upon the Common Stock or
any other class or kind of stock of the Corporation not having preference over
the Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends. Dividends shall not be declared
and set apart for payment, or paid, on the Preferred Stock of any one series,
for any dividend period, unless dividends have been or are contemporaneously
declared and set apart for payment or paid on the Preferred Stock of all series
for all dividend periods terminating on the same or an earlier date.

 (B) When full cumulative dividends as aforesaid upon the Preferred Stock
of all series then outstanding for all past dividend periods and for the current
dividend periods shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment, the
Board of Directors may declare dividends on the Common Stock or any other class
or kind of stock over which such Preferred Stock has a preference as to payment
of dividends, and no holders of any series of the Preferred Stock as such shall
be entitled to share therein; provided, however, the declaration and payment of
such dividends shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in the following
provisions of this Paragraph (B):

 (1) No dividends (other than dividends paid in stock over which the
 Preferred Stock has preference as to payment of dividends and as to assets
 or dividends paid in cash or property, if presently thereafter there shall
 be paid to the Corporation in cash or property an amount equal to such
 dividends, for shares of, or as a capital contribution with respect to,
 such stock over which the Preferred Stock has such preference) shall be
 paid or any other distribution of assets made, by purchase of shares or
 otherwise, on Common Stock or on any other junior stock, as herein
 defined, except out of accumulated surplus available for distribution to
 stock over which the Preferred Stock has preference as to payment of
 dividends and as to assets, earned subsequent to November 30, 1945, or if,
 at the time of declaration thereof or the making of such distribution
 there shall not remain to the credit of earned surplus account (after
 deducting therefrom the amount of such dividends and distributions), an
 amount at least equal to two and one-half (2-1/2) times the annual
 dividend requirements on all then outstanding shares of the Preferred
 Stock and of all other classes or kinds of stock over which the Preferred
 Stock does not have preference as to the payment of dividends and as to
 assets; and

 (2) The Corporation shall not, unless authorized by the affirmative
 vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3 of the shares of the Preferred

Stock at the time outstanding, pay any junior stock dividend, as herein
 defined (other than a dividend paid in shares of junior stock and other
 than dividends paid in cash if simultaneously therewith or immediately
 thereafter there shall be paid to the Corporation for shares of or as a
 capital contribution with respect to junior stock cash in an amount equal
 to such dividend), in contravention of the following provisions:

 (a) If and so long as the junior stock equity, as herein
 defined, at the end of the calendar month immediately preceding the
 date on which a dividend on junior stock is declared is, or as a
 result of such dividend would become, less than 20 of total
 capitalization, as herein defined, the Corporation shall not declare
 such dividends in an amount which, together with all other dividends
 on junior stock paid within the year ending with and including the
 date on which such dividend is payable, exceeds 50 of the net
 income of the Corporation available for dividends on junior stock
 for the twelve full calendar months immediately preceding the
 calendar month in which such dividends are declared, except in an
 amount not exceeding the aggregate of dividends on junior stock
 which under the restrictions set forth above in this subdivision (a)
 could have been, and have not been declared; and

 (b) If and so long as the junior stock equity at the end of
 the calendar month immediately preceding the date on which a
 dividend on junior stock is declared is, or as a result of such
 dividend would become, less than 25 but not less than 20 of total
 capitalization, the Corporation shall not declare dividends on
 junior stock in an amount which, together with all other dividends
 on junior stock paid within the year ending with and including the
 date on which such dividend is payable, exceeds 75 of the net
 income of the Corporation available for dividends on junior stock
 for the twelve full calendar months immediately preceding the
 calendar month in which such dividends are declared, except in an
 amount not exceeding the aggregate of dividends on junior stock
 which under the restrictions set forth above in subdivision (a) and
 in this subdivision (b) could have been, and have not been,
 declared.

 As used in this Paragraph (B) "junior stock dividend" means any dividend
or distribution of assets in respect of shares of any stock (in this Paragraph
(B) and in Paragraph (F)(3) called "junior stock") of the Corporation over which
the Preferred Stock has preference as to dividends or as to assets and any
purchase or other acquisition of shares of such junior stock.

 As used in this Paragraph (B) and in Paragraph (F)(3) "junior stock
equity" shall mean the aggregate of the par value of, or stated capital
represented by, the outstanding shares of junior stock, all earned surplus,
capital or paid-in surplus, and any premiums on the junior stock then carried on
the books of the Corporation, less

(i) the excess, if any, of the aggregate amount payable on
 involuntary liquidation of the Corporation upon all outstanding shares of
 stock of the Corporation of all classes other than junior stock over the
 sum of (x) the aggregate par or stated value of such shares and (y) any
 premiums thereon;

 (ii) any amounts on the books of the Corporation known, or estimated
 if not known, to represent the excess, if any, or recorded value over
 original cost of used or useful utility plant; and

 (iii) any intangible items set forth on the asset side of the
 balance sheet of the Corporation as the result of accounting convention,
 such as unamortized debt discount and expense;

provided, however, that no deductions shall be required to be made in respect of
items referred to in subdivisions (ii) and (iii) above in cases in which such
items are being amortized or are provided for, or are being provided for, by
reserves.

 As used in this Paragraph (B) "total capitalization" shall mean the
aggregate of

 (i) the principal amount of all outstanding indebtedness of the
 Corporation maturing more than twelve months after the date of issue
 thereof; and

 (ii) the par value or stated capital represented by, and any
 premiums carried on the books of the Corporation in respect of, the
 outstanding shares of all classes of the capital stock of the Corporation,
 earned surplus, and capital or paid-in surplus, less any amounts required
 to be deducted pursuant to subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of the immediately
 preceding paragraph in the determination of junior stock equity.

 (C) Upon any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation,
whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Preferred Stock of each series,
without any preference of the shares of any series of Preferred Stock over the
shares of any other series of Preferred Stock, shall be entitled to receive out
of the assets of the Corporation, whether capital, surplus or other, before any
distribution of the assets to be distributed shall be made to the holders of
Common Stock or of any other class or kind of stock not having preference as to
assets over the Preferred Stock, the amount determined to be payable on the
shares of such series in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, as
the case may be. In case the assets shall not be sufficient to pay in full the
amounts determined to be payable on all the shares of Preferred Stock in the
event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, as the case may be, then the
assets available for such payment shall be distributed to the extent available
as follows: first, to the payment, pro rata, of 100 per share on each share of
Preferred Stock outstanding irrespective of series; second, to the payment of
the accrued dividends on such shares, such payment to be made pro rata in
accordance with the amount of accrued dividends on each such share; and, third,
to the payment of any amounts in excess of 100 per share plus accrued dividends
which shall have been determined to be payable on the shares of any series in

the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, as the case may be, such
payment also to be made pro rata in accordance with the amounts, if any, so
payable on each such share. After payment to the holders of the Preferred Stock
of the full preferential amounts hereinbefore provided for, the holders of the
Preferred Stock as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining
assets of the Corporation, either upon any distribution of such assets or upon
dissolution, liquidation or winding up, and the remaining assets to be
distributed, if any, upon a distribution of such assets or upon dissolution,
liquidation or winding up, may be distributed among the holders of the Common
Stock or of any other class or kind of stock over which the Preferred Stock has
preference as to assets. Without limiting the right of the Corporation to
distribute its assets or to dissolve, liquidate or wind up in connection with
any sale, merger or consolidation, the sale of all the property of the
Corporation to, or the merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with,
any other Corporation shall not be deemed to be a distribution of assets or a
dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this Paragraph (C).

 (D) At the option of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the
Corporation may redeem any series of Preferred Stock determined to be
redeemable, and each said series may be redeemed as a whole or in part, at any
time at the redemption price determined for such series; provided, however, that
not less than thirty nor more than sixty days previous to the date fixed for
redemption a notice of the time and place thereof shall be given to the holders
of record of the Preferred Stock so to be redeemed by mail or publication, in
such manner as may be prescribed by the By-Laws of the Corporation or by
resolution of the Board of Directors, provided that such resolution shall in no
way conflict with the By-Laws; and, provided, further, that, in every case of
redemption of less than all of the outstanding shares of any one series of
Preferred Stock, the shares of such series to be redeemed shall be chosen by lot
in such manner as may be prescribed by resolution of the Board of Directors. At
any time after notice of redemption has been given in the manner prescribed by
the By-Laws of the Corporation or by resolution of the Board of Directors to the
holders of stock so to be redeemed, the Corporation may deposit, or may cause
its nominee to deposit, the aggregate redemption price with some bank or trust
company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, named in such notice,
payable on the date fixed for redemption as aforesaid and in the amounts
aforesaid to the respective orders of the holders of the shares so to be
redeemed, on endorsement to the Corporation or its nominee, or otherwise, as may
be required, and upon surrender of the certificates for such shares. Upon the
deposit of said money as aforesaid, or, if no such deposit is made, upon said
redemption date (unless the Corporation defaults in making payment of the
redemption price as set forth in such notice), such holders shall cease to be
stockholders with respect to said shares, and from and after the making of said
deposit, or, if no such deposit is made, after the redemption date (the
Corporation not having defaulted in making payment of the redemption price as
set forth in such notice), the said holders shall have no interest in or claim
against the Corporation, or its nominee, with respect to said shares, but shall
be entitled only to receive said moneys on the date fixed for redemption as
aforesaid from said bank or trust company, or, if no such deposit is made, from
the Corporation, without interest thereon, upon endorsement, if required, and
surrender of the certificates as aforesaid.

If such deposit shall be made by a nominee of the Corporation as
aforesaid, the previous holders of the shares for the redemption of which such
deposit shall have been made shall, upon such deposit, cease to have any rights
or interest in said shares except as set forth in the foregoing paragraph, and
such nominee shall, upon such deposit, become the owner of the shares with
respect to which such deposit was made and certificates of stock may be issued
to such nominee in evidence of such ownership.

 In case the holder of any such Preferred Stock shall not, within six years
after said deposit, claim the amount deposited as above stated for the
redemption thereof, the Depositary shall upon demand pay over to the Corporation
such amounts so deposited and the Depositary shall thereupon be relieved from
all responsibility to the holder thereof. No interest on such deposit shall be
payable to any such holder.

 Nothing herein contained shall limit any legal right of the Corporation to
purchase any shares of the Preferred Stock; provided, however, that if the
Corporation be in default with respect to any quarterly dividend on any share of
the Preferred Stock, it shall not acquire any shares of the Preferred Stock
(except by redemption of all shares of the Preferred Stock) unless approval is
obtained under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

 (E) So long as any shares of the Preferred Stock are outstanding, the
Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote in favor thereof of the
holders of at least 66-2/3 of the shares of Preferred Stock at the time
outstanding, create or authorize any shares of any class of shares preferred as
to dividends or as to assets over the Preferred Stock or issue any shares of any
such prior ranking stock more than twelve months after the date of such a vote
of the Preferred Stock, or change any of the rights and preferences of the then
outstanding Preferred Stock so as to affect adversely the holders thereof;
provided, however, that nothing in this Paragraph (E) contained shall authorize
any such creation or change by the vote of the holders of a less number of
shares of Preferred Stock, or of any other class of stock, or of all classes of
stock, than is required for such creation or change by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania at the time applicable thereto.

 (F) So long as any shares of the Preferred Stock are outstanding, the
Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote in favor thereof of the
holders of at least a majority of the shares of Preferred Stock at the time
outstanding,

 (1) merge or consolidate with or into any other Corporation or
 Corporations or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of
 its assets unless such merger, consolidation, sale or other disposition,
 or the issuance or assumption of securities in the effectuation thereof,
 shall have been ordered, approved or permitted by a regulatory authority
 of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania having jurisdiction in the premises
 and shall have been ordered or approved under the Public Utility Holding
 Company Act of 1935; provided, however, that nothing in this Paragraph (F)

(1) contained shall authorize any such merger, consolidation, sale or
 other disposition by the vote of the holders of a less number of shares of
 the Preferred Stock, or of any other class of stock, or of all classes of
 stock, than is required for any such merger, consolidation, sale or other
 disposition by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania at the time
 applicable thereto; and provided, further, that the provisions of this
 Paragraph (F) (1) shall not apply to a purchase or other acquisition by
 the Corporation of franchises or assets of another Corporation in any
 manner which does not involve a merger or consolidation;

 (2) issue any unsecured notes, debentures or other securities
 representing unsecured indebtedness, or assume any such unsecured
 securities, for purposes other than the refunding of outstanding
 securities theretofore issued or assumed by the Corporation or the
 redemption or other retirement of all outstanding shares of one or more
 series of the Preferred Stock or of any class or kind of stock over which
 the Preferred Stock does not have preference as to dividends and as to
 assets, if, immediately after such issue or assumption, the total
 principal amount of all unsecured notes, debentures or other securities
 representing unsecured indebtedness issued or assumed by the Corporation
 and then outstanding (including unsecured securities then to be issued or
 assumed) would exceed 10 of the aggregate of (i) the total principal
 amount of all bonds or other securities representing secured indebtedness
 issued or assumed by the Corporation and then to be outstanding and (ii)
 the aggregate, at the time of such issue or assumption, of the par value
 of, or stated capital represented by, the outstanding shares of all
 classes of stock and of the surplus of the Corporation (paid-in, earned
 and other, if any); or

 (3) issue, sell or otherwise dispose of any additional shares, or
 any reacquired shares, of Preferred Stock or of any other class of stock
 over which the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock does not have
 preference as to dividends and as to assets, unless

 (i) the net income of the Corporation available for the
 payment of dividends for a period of twelve consecutive calendar
 months within the fifteen calendar months immediately preceding the
 issuance, sale or disposition of such stock (including, in any case
 in which such stock is to be issued, sold or otherwise disposed of
 in connection with the acquisition of new property, the net income
 of the property to be so acquired, computed on the same basis as the
 net income of the Corporation available for the payment of
 dividends) is at least equal to two and one-half (2-1/2) times the
 annual dividend requirements of all outstanding shares of Preferred
 Stock and of all classes or kinds of stock over which the Preferred
 Stock does not have preference as to dividends and as to assets,
 including the shares proposed to be issued;

 (ii) in a case in which such issuance, sale or
 disposition is for any purpose other than to refinance an equal par

amount or stated value of Preferred Stock or of any other class of
 stock over which the Preferred Stock does not have preference as to
 dividends and as to assets, the gross income of the Corporation
 (after all taxes including taxes based on income), for twelve
 consecutive calendar months within a period of fifteen calendar
 months immediately preceding the calendar month of such issuance
 (including, in any case in which such stock is to be issued in
 connection with the acquisition of new property, the gross income of
 the property to be so acquired, computed on the same basis as the
 gross income of the Corporation) is equal to at least 1-1/2 times
 the aggregate of the annual interest charges on indebtedness of the
 Corporation which will be outstanding immediately after the issuance
 of such shares and the annual dividend requirements on all Preferred
 Stock (including dividend requirements on any class of stock over
 which the shares to be issued do not have preference as to dividends
 and as to assets), which will be outstanding immediately after the
 issuance of such shares;

 (iii) in a case in which such issuance, sale or
 disposition is for any purpose other than to refinance an equal par
 amount or stated value of Preferred Stock or of any other class of
 stock over which the Preferred Stock does not have preference as to
 dividends and as to assets, the aggregate of the junior stock equity
 as defined in Paragraph (B) is at least equal to the aggregate
 amount payable in connection with an involuntary liquidation of the
 Corporation with respect to all shares of the Preferred Stock and
 all shares of any class of stock, if any, over which the Preferred
 Stock does not have preference as to dividends and as to assets,
 which will be outstanding immediately after the issuance of such
 shares; and

 (iv) in the case of Preferred Stock, if the total number
 of shares thereof thereafter issued and outstanding would exceed
 50,000, or in the case of any other class of stock over which the
 outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock does not have preference
 as to dividends and as to assets, in any event, prior thereto or
 simultaneously therewith, the total par value of, or stated capital
 represented by, shares of stock over which the Preferred Stock has
 preference as to dividends and as to assets shall have been
 increased over 4,500,000 by an amount at least equal to 75 for
 each share so to be issued of Preferred Stock in excess of 50,000
 shares or of any class or kind of stock over which the Preferred
 Stock does not have preference as to dividends and as to assets.

 If for the purposes of meeting the requirements of clause (iii) of
 this Paragraph (F) (3) above, it shall have been necessary to take into
 consideration any earned surplus of the Corporation, the Corporation shall
 not thereafter pay any dividends on or make any distributions in respect
 of, or purchase or otherwise acquire for value, junior stock as defined in
 Paragraph (B) which would result in reducing the junior stock equity to an

amount less than the amount payable on involuntary liquidation of the
 Corporation with respect to all shares of Preferred Stock and all shares
 of any class of stock over which the Preferred Stock does not have
 preference as to dividends and as to assets, at the time outstanding.

 If, during the period as of which gross income is to be determined
 for the purposes of this Paragraph (F)(3), the amount, if any, required to
 be expended by the Corporation for property additions pursuant to a
 maintenance and replacement requirement or similar replacement and renewal
 requirement established under its mortgage indenture shall exceed the
 amount deducted in the determination of such gross income on account of
 depreciation and amortization of electric or gas plant acquisition
 adjustments, such excess shall also be deducted in determining such gross
 income.

 (G) The term "accrued dividends" shall be deemed to mean in respect of any
share of the Preferred Stock of any series, as of any given date, the amount, if
any, by which the product of the rate of dividend per annum, determined upon the
shares of such series, multiplied by the number of years and any fractional part
of a year which shall have elapsed from the date after which dividends on such
stock became cumulative to such given date, exceeds the total dividends actually
paid on such stock and the dividends declared and set apart for payment.
Accumulations of dividends shall not bear interest.

 The term "outstanding", whenever used herein with respect to shares of
Preferred Stock or of any other class or kind of stock which are by their terms
redeemable, or with respect to bonds or other evidences of indebtedness, shall
not include any such shares or bonds or evidences of indebtedness which have
been called for redemption in accordance with the provisions applicable thereto,
of which call for redemption notice shall have been given or appropriately
provided for, as required by such provisions, and for the redemption of which a
sum of money sufficient to pay the amount payable on such redemption shall have
been deposited by the Corporation with a bank or trust company, irrevocably in
trust for such purpose, or any bonds or other evidences of indebtedness for the
payment of which at maturity provision has been made in a similar manner.

 The term "net income of the Corporation available for the payment of
dividends" shall mean the balance remaining after deducting from the total gross
earnings of the Corporation from all sources the following: (a) all operating
expenses and taxes, including charges to income for general taxes and for
federal income and excess profits taxes, for retirement or depreciation reserve
and for amortization or other disposition of amounts, if any, classified as
amounts in excess of original cost of utility plant, and (b) all interest
charges and other income deductions, including charges to income for
amortization of debt discount, premium and expense. For the purpose of computing
such net income of the Corporation available for the payment of dividends, there
shall not be deducted any provision made on the books of the Corporation or
otherwise for the amortization of Preferred Stock premium, discount, commission
and expense.

 Section (v) Sinking Fund Requirements

(a) On October 1, 2002 and on each October 1 thereafter
 through and including October 1, 2007 (a `Sinking Fund Payment
 Date'), the Corporation, subject to the applicable provisions of
 Pennsylvania law, shall redeem, at a redemption price per share
 equal to 100 plus accrued dividends to the date of redemption (the
 `Sinking Fund Redemption Price'), as and for a sinking fund for the
 7.625 Preferred Stock, in each year prior to 2007, 7,500 shares of
 the 7.625 Preferred Stock and, in 2007, the remaining outstanding
 shares of the 7.625 Preferred Stock, provided that if, on any
 Sinking Fund Payment Date, the number of outstanding shares of the
 7.625 Preferred Stock shall be less than 7,500, then the number of
 shares to be redeemed as and for the sinking fund created hereby
 shall be equal to such number of outstanding shares of the 7.625 
 Preferred Stock. The obligation of the Corporation to make such
 sinking fund redemptions shall be cumulative, so that all shares of
 the 7.625 Preferred Stock previously required to be redeemed
 pursuant to this subsection (v)(a) on a certain Sinking Fund Payment
 Date but not redeemed on such date shall be added to the number of
 shares of the 7.625 Preferred Stock otherwise required to be
 redeemed on the next succeeding Sinking Fund Payment Date and shall
 also be redeemed on such date, subject to the applicable provisions
 of Pennsylvania law. The Corporation shall redeem the full number of
 shares of 7.625 Preferred Stock required to be redeemed by it
 pursuant to this subsection (v)(a) in each calendar year and all
 prior calendar years before dividends (other than dividends payable
 in Common Stock) shall be paid or any other distribution of assets
 made (by purchase of shares or otherwise), in such calendar year, on
 Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation over which the
 7.625 Preferred Stock has preference as to the payment of dividends
 or as to assets.

 (b) No redemption, acquisition or purchase of any stock
 ranking equally with or junior to the 7.625 Preferred Stock shall
 occur during any period when the mandatory redemption of shares
 described in paragraph (a) of this subsection (a) is in arrears,
 except for payments of arrears through redemptions of shares of
 classes of Preferred Stock and of any kind of stock over which the
 Preferred Stock does not have preference as to the payment of
 dividends and as to assets which the Corporation is then obligated
 to redeem or purchase.

 (c) If on any Sinking Fund Payment Date funds legally
 available therefor are insufficient to permit the Corporation to
 redeem the full number of shares of 7.625 Preferred Stock so
 required to be redeemed on such date, the Corporation shall apply to
 such redemption the proportion of such funds which bears the same
 ratio to the amount required for the redemption of the full number
 of such shares required to be redeemed on such Sinking Fund Payment
 Date as the total amount of such funds bears to the total amount

required for the purchase or redemption of all shares of all classes
 of Preferred Stock and of any kind of stock over which the Preferred
 Stock does not have preference as to the payment of dividends and as
 to assets which the Corporation is then obligated to redeem or
 purchase.

Common Stock

 There shall be a class of stock of the Corporation designated Common Stock
and each share of Common Stock shall be equal to every other share of said stock
in every respect.

Voting Powers

 At all elections of directors of the Corporation, and on all other
matters, except on matters in respect of which the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania shall provide that all stockholders shall have the right to vote
irrespective of whether such right has been relinquished by any of such
stockholders and except as otherwise herein provided, the holders of the Common
Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote; provided, however, that, whenever
and as often as four quarterly dividends payable on the Preferred Stock of any
series shall be in default, in whole or in part, the holders of the Preferred
Stock shall have the exclusive right, voting separately and as a class, to vote
for and to elect the smallest number of directors which shall constitute a
majority of the then authorized number of directors of the Corporation, and, in
all matters other than the election of directors, each holder of one or more
shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share or
stock held by him. In the event of default entitling the Preferred Stock to vote
as aforesaid, the holders of the Common Stock shall have the exclusive right,
voting separately and as a class, to vote for and to elect the greatest number
of directors which shall constitute a minority of the then authorized number of
directors of the Corporation, and, in all matters other than the election of
directors, each holder of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each
such share of stock held by him. The voting rights of the holders of the
Preferred Stock, however, shall cease when all defaults in the payment of
dividends on their stock shall have been cured, and such dividends shall be
declared and paid out of any funds legally available therefor as soon as, in the
judgment of the Board of Directors, is reasonably practicable. The terms of
office of all persons who may be directors of the Corporation at the time when
the right to elect a majority of the directors shall accrue to the holders of
the Preferred Stock, as herein provided, shall terminate upon the election of
their successors at a meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation then
entitled to vote. Such meeting shall be held at any time after the accrual of
such voting power upon notice similar to that provided in the By-Laws of the
Corporation for a meeting of the stockholders at the request in writing of the
holders of not less than 10 of the number of shares of the then outstanding
Preferred Stock entitled to vote addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation
at its principal business office. Any vacancy in the Board of Directors
occurring during any period that the Preferred Stock shall have representatives

on the Board shall be filled by a majority vote of the remaining directors
representing the class of stock theretofore represented by the director causing
the vacancy. Upon the termination of such exclusive right of the holders of the
Preferred Stock to elect a majority of the directors of the Corporation, the
terms of office of all the directors of the Corporation shall terminate upon the
election of their successors at a meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation
then entitled to vote. Such meeting shall be held at any time after the
termination of such exclusive right of the holders of the Preferred Stock to
elect a majority of the directors upon notice similar to that provided in the
By-Laws of the Corporation for a meeting of the stockholders at the request in
writing of the holders of not less than 10 of the number of shares of the then
outstanding Common Stock addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation at its
principal business office.

 At all meetings of the stockholders held for the purpose of electing
directors during such times as the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the
exclusive right to elect a majority of the directors of the Corporation, the
presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock shall be required to constitute a quorum of such class
for the election of directors, and the presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be
required to constitute a quorum of such class for election of directors;
provided, however, that the absence of a quorum of the holders of stock of
either class shall not prevent the election at any such meeting, or adjournment
thereof, of directors by the other class if the necessary quorum of the holders
of stock of such class is present in person or by proxy at such meeting; and
provided, further, that, in the absence of a quorum of the holders of stock of
either class, a majority of those holders of such stock who are present in
person or by proxy shall have the power to adjourn the election of those
directors to be elected by that class from time to time without notice, other
than announcement at the meeting, until the requisite amount of holders of stock
of such class shall be present in person or by proxy. For the purposes of the
foregoing provisions, the Preferred Stock of all series shall be deemed to be a
single class.

 At all elections of directors of the Corporation, each stockholder may
cast the whole number of his votes for one candidate for whom he may vote, or
distribute them among two or more such candidates as he may prefer.

Miscellaneous Provisions

 The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have no preemptive rights to
subscribe to any additional shares of the capital stock of the Corporation of
any kind, or any rights to exchange shares issued for shares to be issued; but,
before issuing or disposing of any shares of Common Stock or any bonds,
debentures, or other obligations or rights or options, which are convertible
into or exchangeable for or which entitle the holder or owner to subscribe for
or purchase any shares of Common Stock, the Board of Directors shall offer to
the holders of the Common Stock at the time outstanding, and the holders thereof
shall be entitled to purchase or subscribe for the shares of Common Stock or the
bonds, debentures, or other obligations or rights or options, which are

convertible into or exchangeable for such stock or which entitle the holder or
owner thereof to subscribe for or purchase such stock, upon terms not less
favorable to the purchaser (without deduction of such reasonable compensation,
allowance or discount for the sale, underwriting or purchase thereof as may be
fixed by the Board of Directors) than those on which the Board of Directors
issue and dispose of such stock, bonds, debentures, obligations or rights to
other than such holders of Common Stock.

 The Corporation may issue and dispose of any of its authorized shares for
such consideration as may be fixed by the Board of Directors subject to the laws
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania then applicable.

 Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the foregoing
Paragraphs (B), (C), (D), and (F)(3) of Section 2 (General Provisions for
Preferred Stock) of this ARTICLE SIXTH, , the Corporation may from time to time,
out of its net profits or surplus earnings, purchase any of its stock
outstanding at such prices as may be fixed by its Board of Directors and
accepted by the holders of the stock purchased but such price shall not exceed
the then applicable redemption price, if any, of the stock purchased.

Seventh: Section 1. Directors and Officers as Fiduciaries.
 ------- ------------------------------------------------

 A director or officer of the Corporation shall stand in a fiduciary
relation to the Corporation and shall perform his or her duties as a director or
officer, including his or her duties as a member of any committee of the board
upon which he or she may serve, in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably
believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation, and with such care,
including reasonable inquiry, skill and diligence, as a person of ordinary
prudence would use under similar circumstances. In performing his or her duties,
a director or officer shall be entitled to rely in good faith on information,
opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other
financial data, in each case prepared or presented by one or more officers or
employees of the Corporation whom the director or officer reasonably believes to
be reliable and competent with respect to the matters presented, counsel, public
accountants or other persons as to matters that the director or officer
reasonably believes to be within the professional or expert competence of such
person, or a committee of the Board of Directors upon which the director or
officer does not serve, duly designated in accordance with law, as to matters
within its designated authority, which committee the director or officer
reasonably believes to merit confidence. A director or officer shall not be
considered to be acting in good faith if he or she has knowledge concerning the
matter in question that would cause his or her reliance to be unwarranted.
Absent breach of fiduciary duty, lack of good faith or self-dealing, actions
taken as a director or officer of the Corporation or any failure to take any
action shall be presumed to be in the best interests of the Corporation.

Section 2. Personal Liability of Directors.
 -------------------------------------------

 A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable, as such, for
monetary damages (including, without limitation, any judgment, amount paid in
settlement, penalty, punitive damages or expense of any nature (including,
without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements)) for any action taken, or
any failure to take any action, unless the director has breached or failed to
perform the duties of his or her office under these Articles of Incorporation,
the By-Laws or applicable provisions of law and the breach or failure to perform
constitutes self-dealing, willful misconduct or recklessness.

 Section 3. Personal Liability of Officers.
 ------------------------------------------

 An officer of the Corporation shall not be personally liable, as such, to
the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages (including, without
limitation, any judgment, amount paid in settlement, penalty, punitive damages
or expense of any nature (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and
disbursements)) for any action taken, or any failure to take any action, unless
the officer has breached or failed to perform the duties of his or her office
under these Articles of Incorporation, the By-Laws or applicable provisions of
law and the breach or failure to perform constitutes self-dealing, willful
misconduct or recklessness.

 Section 4. Interpretation of Article.
 -------------------------------------

The provisions of Sections 2 and 3 of this Seventh Article shall not apply to
the responsibility or liability of a director or officer, as such, pursuant to
any criminal statute or for the payment of taxes pursuant to local, state or
Federal law. The provisions of this Seventh Article have been adopted pursuant
to the authority of section 204A(10) of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation
Law, as amended, and under all amendments and supplements thereto, or any
revision or restatement thereof or any statute enacted to take the place
thereof, shall be deemed to be a contract with each director or officer of the
Corporation who serves as such at any time while this article is in effect, and
each person who serves as a director or officer of the Corporation while this
article is in effect shall be deemed to be doing so in reliance on the
provisions of this article and such provisions are cumulative of and shall be in
addition to and independent of any and all other limitations on the liabilities
of directors or officers of the Corporation, as such, or rights of
indemnification by the Corporation to which a director or officer of the
Corporation may be entitled, whether such limitations or rights arise under or
are created by any statute, rule of law, by-law, agreement, vote of shareholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise. No amendment to or repeal of this
Seventh Article nor the adoption of any provision of these Articles of
Corporation inconsistent with this article, shall apply to or have any effect on
the liability or alleged liability of any director or officer of the Corporation
for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director or officer
occurring prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent
provision. In any action, suit or proceeding involving the application of the
provisions of this Seventh Article, the party or parties challenging the right
of a director or officer to the benefits of this article shall have the burden
of proof.

stating the time, place and purposes thereof shall be given to each stockholder
entitled to notice as provided by law, not less than seven (7) nor more than
sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. Such notice may be given by or
at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Corporate
Secretary. Except to the full extent that notice is legally permitted (now or
hereafter) to be given by any other form of media, including any form of
electronic or other communications, notice shall be given by personal delivery
or by mail addressed to the stockholder at his last address as it appears on the
records of the Corporation. Any stockholder may waive in writing notice of any
meeting, either before or after the holding of such meeting, and, by attending
any meeting without protesting the lack of proper notice, shall be deemed to
have waived notice thereof.

Section 4. Business Transacted at Meetings.
- ---------- --------------------------------

 Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be for
the purposes stated in the notice.

Section 5. Quorum and Adjournments.
- ---------- ------------------------

 The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled
to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a
quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business
except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Articles of Incorporation. If,
however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the
stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time,
without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be
present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be
present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been
transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

Section 6. Required Vote; Inspectors.
- ---------- --------------------------

 (a) When a quorum is present or represented at any meeting, the vote of
the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or
represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting,
unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes or of
the Articles of Incorporation a different vote is required in which case such
express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.

 (b) Inspectors of election may be appointed to act at any meeting of
stockholders in accordance with Pennsylvania law.

Section 7. Voting Power of Stockholders.
- ---------- -----------------------------

 (a) Every stockholder of record of the Corporation shall be entitled at
each meeting of stockholders to one vote for each share of stock held by such
stockholder according to the books of the Corporation as of the date of such
vote or, if a record date is set by the Board of Directors, as of such record
date.

 (b) Whenever the right shall have accrued to the holders of the Preferred
Stock to elect Directors, voting separately as a class, the terms of office, as
Directors, of all persons who may be Directors of the Corporation at the time
shall terminate upon the election of a majority of the Board of Directors by the
holders of the Preferred Stock, except that if the holders of the Common Stock
shall not have elected the remaining Directors of the Corporation, then, and
only in that event, the Directors of the Corporation in office just prior to the
election of a majority of the Board of Directors by the holders of the Preferred
Stock shall elect the remaining Directors of the Corporation. Thereafter while
the majority of the Board of Directors is being elected by the holders of the
Preferred Stock, the remaining Directors, whether elected by Directors as
provided above or whether originally or later elected by the holders of the
Common Stock, shall continue in office until their successors are elected by the
holders of the Common Stock.

Whenever the right shall have accrued to the holders of the Preferred
Stock to elect Directors, voting separately as a class, it shall be the duty of
the President, a Vice President or the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation to
call and cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote at a
meeting to be held at such time as the Corporation's officers may fix, not less
than forty-five nor more than sixty days after the accrual of such right, for
the purpose of electing Directors. The notice so given shall be mailed to each
holder of record of the Preferred Stock at his last known address appearing on
the books of the Corporation and shall set forth, among other things: (i) that
by reason of the fact that dividends payable on the Preferred Stock are in
default in an amount equal to four full quarterly payments or more per share,
the holders of the Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, have the right
to elect the smallest number of Directors necessary to constitute a majority of
the full Board of Directors of the Corporation, (ii) that any holder of the
Preferred Stock has the right, at any reasonable time, to inspect, and make
copies of, the list or lists of holders of the Preferred Stock maintained at the
principal office of the Corporation or at the office of any Transfer Agent of
the Preferred Stock, and (iii) either the entirety of this paragraph or the
substance thereof with respect to the number of shares of the Preferred Stock
required to be represented at any meeting, or adjournment thereof, called for
the election of Directors of the Corporation. At the first meeting of
stockholders held for the purpose of electing Directors during such time as the
holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the special right, voting separately
as a class, to elect Directors, the presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Stock shall be required to
constitute a quorum of such class for the election of Directors, and the
presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Preferred Stock shall be required to constitute a quorum of such class for the
election of Directors; provided, however, that in the absence of a quorum of the
holders of the Preferred Stock, no election of Directors shall be held, but a
majority of the holders of the Preferred Stock who are present in person or by
proxy shall have power to adjourn the election of the Directors to a date not
less than fifteen nor more than fifty days from the giving of the notice of such
adjourned meeting provided below; and provided, further, that at such adjourned
meeting, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of 35 of the
outstanding Preferred Stock shall be required to constitute a quorum of such
class for the election of Directors. In the event such first meeting of
stockholders shall be so adjourned, it shall be the duty of the President, a
Vice President or the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation, within ten days
from the date on which such first meeting shall have been adjourned, to cause
notice of such adjourned meeting to be given to the stockholders entitled to
vote thereat, such adjourned meeting to be held not less than fifteen days nor
more than fifty days from the giving of such second notice. Such second notice
shall be given in the form and manner provided above with respect to the notice
required to be given of such first meeting of stockholders, and shall further
set forth that a quorum was not present at such first meeting and that the
holders of 35 of the outstanding Preferred Stock shall be required to
constitute a quorum of such class for the election of Directors at such
adjourned meeting. If the requisite quorum of holders of the Preferred Stock
shall not be present at said adjourned meeting, then the Directors of the
Corporation then in office shall remain in office until the next annual meeting
of the Corporation, or special meeting in lieu thereof, and until their
successors shall have been elected and shall qualify. Neither such first meeting
nor such adjourned meeting shall be held on a date within sixty days of the date
of the next annual meeting of the Corporation or special meeting in lieu

thereof. At each annual meeting of the Corporation, or special meeting in lieu
thereof, held during such time as the holders of the Preferred Stock, voting
separately as a class, shall have the right to elect a majority of the Board of
Directors, the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall govern such annual
meeting, or special meeting in lieu thereof, as if said annual meeting or
special meeting were the first meeting of stockholders held for the purpose of
electing Directors after the right of the holders of the Preferred Stock, voting
separately as a class, to elect a majority of the Board of Directors, should
have accrued, with the exception that if, at any adjourned annual meeting, or
special meeting in lieu thereof, 35 of the outstanding Preferred Stock is not
present in person or by proxy, all the Directors shall be elected by a vote of
the holders of a majority of the Common Stock of the Corporation present or
represented at the meeting. For the purposes of the foregoing provisions, the
Preferred Stock of all classes shall be deemed to be a single class.

 Any vacancy in the Board of Directors occurring during any period that the
Preferred Stock shall have representatives on the Board shall be filled by a
majority vote of the remaining Directors representing the class of stock
theretofore represented by the Director causing the vacancy or by the remaining
Director representing such class if there be but one.

 In the event that any of the provisions hereof may conflict or be
inconsistent with any other provisions of these By-Laws, then (this By-Law
having been adopted by the vote of the holders of all of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock of the Corporation) the provisions hereof shall govern in so far
as permitted by law.

Section 8. Voting by Proxy.
- ---------- ----------------

 At any meeting of the stockholders, any stockholder may be represented and
vote by a proxy or proxies appointed by an instrument executed or authenticated
by the stockholder or its duly authorized attorney-in-fact to the full extent
permitted by law (now or hereafter) and filed with or transmitted to the
Corporate Secretary or its designated agent. In the event that any such proxy
shall designate two or more persons to act as proxies, a majority of such
persons present at the meeting, or, if only one shall be present, then that one
shall have and may exercise all of the powers conferred by such proxy upon all
of the persons so designated unless the proxy shall otherwise provide. No such
proxy shall be valid after the expiration of thirty-six (36) months from the
date of its execution, authentication or transmission, unless coupled with an
interest, or unless the person executing it specifies therein the length of time
for which it is to continue in force. Subject to the above, any proxy duly
executed is not revoked and continues in full force and effect until an
instrument revoking it or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date is filed or
electronically transmitted to the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation or its
designated agent.

Section 9. Action by Stockholders Without a Meeting.
- ---------- -----------------------------------------

 Any action which may be taken by the vote of the stockholders at a meeting
may be taken without a meeting if authorized by the consent of the stockholders
holding at least a majority of the voting power, unless the provisions of the
statutes or of the Articles of Incorporation provide that a greater proportion
of consents shall be required. Such consents may take such form (written,
electronic or otherwise) as permitted by law (now or hereafter). Such consents
shall be filed with or entered upon the records of the Corporation.

DIRECTORS

Section 10. Authority of Directors.
- ----------- -----------------------

 (a) The business of the Corporation shall be managed by its Board of
Directors, which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such
lawful acts and things as are not by statute, the Articles of Incorporation, or
these By-Laws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

 (b) Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board
of Directors or any committee of the Board of Directors may be taken without a
meeting if, prior or subsequent to such action, all members of the Board of
Directors or of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto. Such
consents may take such form (written, electronic or otherwise) as permitted by
law (now or hereafter). Such consents shall be filed with or entered upon the
records of the Corporate Secretary of the Corporation.

Section 11. Number; Qualifications.
- ----------- -----------------------

 The number of Directors shall be not less than three (3) and not more than
five (5) (plus any Directors separately elected by the holders of any class of
stock other than the Common Stock as provided in the Articles of Incorporation
as amended from time to time). The number of Directors may be determined (a) by
the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon at
any annual meeting or special meeting called for the purpose of electing
Directors or (b) by action of the Board of Directors at a meeting or by consent
by the vote of a majority of the Directors in office at the time. When so fixed,
such number shall continue to be the authorized number of Directors until
changed by the stockholders or Directors in the manner described above. Any
increase in the number of Directors shall be deemed to create a vacancy or
vacancies which may be filled as provided in Section 14. A reduction in the
number of Directors shall not be applied to remove any Director from office
prior to the expiration of his term. Directors need not be stockholders of the
Corporation and need not be United States citizens or residents of Pennsylvania.

Section 12. Election of Directors.
- ----------- ----------------------

 At each meeting of the stockholders for the election of Directors, the
persons receiving the greatest number of votes shall be the Directors. Such
elections shall be by ballot whenever requested by any person entitled to vote
at such meeting; but unless so requested, such election may be conducted in any
way approved at such meeting.

Section 13. Term of Office; Removal; Resignations.
- ----------- --------------------------------------

 (a) Directors shall hold office until the annual meeting of the
stockholders next following their election and until their respective successors
are elected, or until their earlier resignation, death or removal from office.

 (b) Any Director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed upon the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
Corporation.

(c) Any Director may resign at any time by giving written notice of his
resignation to the President or Corporate Secretary. Any resignation will be
effective upon actual receipt by such person or, if later, as of the date and
time specified in such written notice.

Section 14. Vacancies.
- ----------- ----------

 Vacancies, including those caused by an increase in the number of
Directors, may be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors though less
than a quorum. When one or more Directors shall give notice of his or their
resignation to the Board, effective at a future date, the Board shall have the
power to fill such vacancy or vacancies to take effect when such resignation or
resignations shall become effective, each Director so appointed to hold office
during the remainder of the term of office of the resigning Director or
Directors. Whenever any vacancy shall occur among the Directors, the remaining
Directors shall constitute the Directors of the Corporation until such vacancy
is filled or until the number of Directors is changed as in Section 11 hereof.

MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Section 15. Organizational Meeting.

 Immediately after each annual meeting of the stockholders at which
Directors are elected, or each special meeting held in lieu thereof, the newly
elected Directors, if a quorum thereof is present, shall hold an organizational
meeting at the same place or at such other time and place as may be fixed by the
stockholders at such meeting, for the purpose of electing officers and
transacting any other business. Notice of such meeting need not be given. If for
any reason such organizational meeting is not held at such time, a special
meeting of the Directors for such purpose shall be held as soon thereafter as
practicable.

 Special meetings of the Directors may be held at any time within or
without the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania upon call by the Chairman of the Board,
the President, or the Corporate Secretary upon the written request of two
Directors. Notice of each such meeting shall be given to each Director by
letter, facsimile, electronic mail, telegram, telephone, or in person not less
than forty-eight (48) hours prior to such meeting. Notices sent by mail shall be
sent postage prepaid and shall be addressed to each Director at his address as
it appears upon the records of the Corporation. Notice by mail shall be deemed
to be given at the time when the notice is deposited in the mail, and notice by
facsimile, electronic mail or telegram shall be deemed to be given at the time
when confirmation of successful transmission is received. Such notice may be
waived by Directors either before or after the meeting, and such waivers shall

be filed with or entered upon the records of the meeting. The attendance of any
Director at any such meeting without protesting the lack of proper notice, prior
to or at the commencement of the meeting, shall be deemed to be a waiver by the
Director of notice of the meeting. Unless otherwise limited in the notice
thereof, any business may be transacted at any organizational, regular or
special meeting.

 (a) A majority of the Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, shall
be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act
of a majority of the Directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is
present shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise
specifically provided by statute or by the Articles of Incorporation. Any action
required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Directors may be taken
without a meeting if a consent, setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed or authenticated by all of the Directors entitled to vote with respect to
the subject matter thereof. Any meeting duly called, whether or not a quorum is
present, may, by vote of a majority of the Directors present, be adjourned from
time to time and place to place within or without the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, in which case no further notice of the adjourned meeting need be
given.

 (b) Meetings of the Board of Directors or of any committee of the Board of
Directors may be held through any means of communications equipment if all
persons participating can hear each other, and such participation will
constitute presence in person at such meeting.

Section 19. Committees.
- ----------- -----------

 The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the
Directors, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or
more of the Directors of the Corporation, which, to the extent provided in the
resolution, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of Directors in
the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation. Such committee or
committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time
by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. The committees shall keep
regular minutes of their proceedings and report the same to the Board when
required.

Section 20. Compensation.
- ----------- -------------

 The Directors may be paid their expenses, if any, for attendance at each
meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at
each meeting of the Board of Directors. The sums may be different for different
Directors, and the sum shall be established by resolution of the Board of
Directors and may be changed from time to time by resolution. No such payment
shall preclude any Director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity
and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees
may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

Section 21. Executive Committee.
- ----------- --------------------

 The Board of Directors at any time may elect from its members an Executive
Committee which shall consist of not less than three (3) members. Each member of
such Committee shall hold office during the pleasure of the Board and may be
removed by a majority vote of the whole Board at any time with or without cause.
Vacancies occurring in the Committee may be filled by the Board. The Committee
shall prescribe its own rules for calling and holding meetings, and for
transacting business, subject, however, to any rules prescribed by the Board of
Directors, and the Committee shall keep minutes of its actions. Action by the
Committee may be taken at meetings thereof attended by not less than a majority
thereof, or without a meeting by instrument in writing signed by not less than a
majority of the members. Except as the Committee's powers and duties may be
limited or otherwise prescribed by the Board of Directors, the Committee, during
the intervals between the meetings of the Board, shall possess and may exercise
all of the powers and authority of the Board of Directors, however conferred,
provided, however, that the Committee shall not be empowered to elect the
officers (other than Assistant Secretaries and Assistant Treasurers) or to fill
vacancies in the Board of Directors or in the Executive Committee. Subject to
such exceptions, persons dealing with the Corporation shall be entitled to rely
upon any action of the Committee with the same force and effect as though such
action had been taken by the Board of Directors.

OFFICERS

Section 22. Generally.

 PENNSYLVANIA POWER COMPANY

 FIRST MORTGAGE BOND, PLEDGE SERIES A OF 2001 DUE 2021

 This bond is one of the bonds issued and to be issued from time to time
under and in accordance with and all secured by an indenture of mortgage or deed
of trust dated as of November 1, 1945, and indentures supplemental thereto,
given by the Company to Citibank, N.A. (successor to The First National Bank of
The City of New York), as trustee (hereinafter referred to as the "Trustee"), to
which indenture and indentures supplemental thereto (hereinafter referred to
collectively as the "Indenture") reference is hereby made for a description of
the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and
the rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee and the rights of
the holders of the bonds and coupons and of the Trustee and of the Company in
respect of such security, and the limitations on such rights. By the terms of
the Indenture, the bonds to be secured thereby are issuable in series which may
vary as to date, amount, date of maturity, rate of interest, terms of redemption
and in other respects as in the Indenture provided.

 The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee,
with the consent of the holders of not less than seventy-five per centum in
principal amount of the bonds (exclusive of bonds disqualified by reason of the
Company's interest therein) at the time outstanding, including, if more than one
series of bonds shall be at the time outstanding, not less than sixty per centum
in principal amount of each series affected, to effect, by an indenture
supplemental to the Indenture, modifications or alterations of the Indenture and
of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of
the bonds and coupons; provided, however, that no such modification or
alteration shall be made without the written approval or consent of the holder
hereof which will (a) extend the maturity of this bond or reduce the rate or
extend the time of payment of interest hereon or reduce the amount of the
principal hereof or reduce any premium payable on the redemption hereof, or (b)
permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a
parity with the lien of the Indenture, or (c) reduce the percentage of the
principal amount of the bonds upon the approval or consent of the holders of
which modifications or alterations may be made as aforesaid.

 The bonds of this series are issued and to be issued in order to provide
security to Ambac Assurance Corporation, a Wisconsin domiciled stock insurance
corporation ("the Insurer") in connection with its issuance of a financial
guaranty insurance policy (the "Policy") in favor of the holders of the
Authority Bonds pursuant to the Insurance Agreement (the "Insurance Agreement")
dated as of June 27, 2001 between the Insurer and the Company. In order to
provide monies to fund a loan made by the Authority to the Company pursuant to a
Pollution Control Facilities Loan Agreement dated as of June 1, 2001 between the
Authority and the Company (the "Loan Agreement"), the Authority has issued the
Authority Bonds under and pursuant to the Authority Indenture. Payments made by
the Company of principal and interest on the bonds of this series are intended
to be sufficient to reimburse the Insurer for any payments of principal and
interest made by the Insurer on the Authority Bonds pursuant to the Policy.

The bonds of this series are not transferable except (i) as required to
effect an assignment to a successor of the Insurer under the Insurance Agreement
or (ii) in compliance with a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction in
connection with any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding of the Company.

 The "Initial Interest Payment Date" on the bonds of this series shall be
the date one (1) business day following the receipt by the Insurer of written
notification of Nonpayment (as defined in the Policy) of interest on the
Authority Bonds when such interest shall have come Due for Payment (as defined
in the Policy), written notification of which the Insurer shall provide to the
Company and the Trustee, and the "Initial Interest Accrual Date" shall be the
date six months prior to such Initial Interest Payment Date. The next Interest
Payment Date shall be the date six months after the Initial Interest Payment
Date, and each successive Interest Payment Date shall be the date six months
after the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that
the last Interest Payment Date shall be the date of maturity of the bonds of
this series and the interest so payable on such maturity date shall accrue from
the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to but not including such
maturity date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the amount of
interest payable on the bonds of the series on any Interest Payment Date
(including the Initial Interest Payment Date) shall not exceed the amount
actually paid to holders of Authority Bonds by the Insurer under the Policy in
respect of the Nonpayment of interest Due for Payment on the Authority Bonds
over the period from the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to and
including such Interest Payment Date (or if such Interest Payment Date is the
Initial Interest Payment Date, then from the Initial Interest Accrual Date to
such Interest Payment Date).

 The Company's obligation to make payments with respect to the principal of
and/or interest on the bonds of this series shall be fully or partially
satisfied and discharged to the extent that, at the time any such payment shall
be due, the corresponding amount then due of principal of and/or interest on the
Authority Bonds shall have been fully or partially paid (other than by the
application of the proceeds of any payment by the Insurer under the Policy), as
the case may be, or there shall have been deposited with the Authority Trustee
pursuant to the Authority Indenture trust funds sufficient under such indenture
to fully or partially pay, as the case may be, the corresponding amount then due
of principal of and/or interest on the Authority Bonds (other than by the
application of the proceeds of any payment by the Insurer under the Policy).
Notwithstanding anything contained herein or in the Indenture to the contrary,
the Company shall be obligated to make payments with respect to the principal of
and/or interest on the bonds of this series only to the extent that the Insurer
has made a payment with respect to the Authority Bonds under the Policy.

 Upon payment of the principal of and interest due on the Authority Bonds,
whether at maturity or prior to maturity by acceleration, redemption or
otherwise, or upon provision for the payment thereof having been made in
accordance with the Authority Indenture (other than by the application of the
proceeds of any payment by the Insurer under the Policy), the bonds of this
series in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of Authority Bonds so
paid or for which such provision for payment has been made shall be deemed fully
paid, satisfied and discharged and the obligations of the Company thereunder
shall be terminated and such bonds of this series shall be surrendered to and
canceled by the Trustee. From and after the Release Date (as defined in the
Insurance Agreement), the bonds of this series shall be deemed fully paid,
satisfied and discharged and the obligation of the Company thereunder shall be
terminated. On the Release Date, the bonds of this series shall be surrendered
to and canceled by the Trustee.

The bonds of this series are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or
in part, as the case may be, on each date that Authority Bonds are to be
redeemed. The principal amount of the Bonds of this series to be redeemed on any
such date shall be equal to the principal amount of Authority Bonds called for
redemption on that date. All redemptions of bonds of this series shall be at
100 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest to the redemption
date.

 In case of certain defaults as specified in the Indenture, the principal
of this bond may be declared or may become due and payable on the conditions, at
the time, in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

 No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest

 PENNSYLVANIA POWER COMPANY

 FIRST MORTGAGE BOND, PLEDGE SERIES B OF 2001 DUE 2017

 This bond is one of the bonds issued and to be issued from time to time
under and in accordance with and all secured by an indenture of mortgage or deed
of trust dated as of November 1, 1945, and indentures supplemental thereto,
given by the Company to Citibank, N.A. (successor to The First National Bank of
The City of New York), as trustee (hereinafter referred to as the "Trustee"), to
which indenture and indentures supplemental thereto (hereinafter referred to
collectively as the "Indenture") reference is hereby made for a description of
the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and
the rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee and the rights of
the holders of the bonds and coupons and of the Trustee and of the Company in
respect of such security, and the limitations on such rights. By the terms of
the Indenture, the bonds to be secured thereby are issuable in series which may
vary as to date, amount, date of maturity, rate of interest, terms of redemption
and in other respects as in the Indenture provided.

 The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee,
with the consent of the holders of not less than seventy-five per centum in
principal amount of the bonds (exclusive of bonds disqualified by reason of the
Company's interest therein) at the time outstanding, including, if more than one
series of bonds shall be at the time outstanding, not less than sixty per centum
in principal amount of each series affected, to effect, by an indenture
supplemental to the Indenture, modifications or alterations of the Indenture and
of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of
the bonds and coupons; provided, however, that no such modification or
alteration shall be made without the written approval or consent of the holder
hereof which will (a) extend the maturity of this bond or reduce the rate or
extend the time of payment of interest hereon or reduce the amount of the
principal hereof or reduce any premium payable on the redemption hereof, or (b)
permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a
parity with the lien of the Indenture, or (c) reduce the percentage of the
principal amount of the bonds upon the approval or consent of the holders of
which modifications or alterations may be made as aforesaid.

 The bonds of this series are issued and to be issued in order to provide
security to Ambac Assurance Corporation, a Wisconsin domiciled stock insurance
corporation, (the "Insurer") in connection with its issuance of a financial
guaranty insurance policy (the "Policy") in favor of the holders of the
Authority Bonds pursuant to the Insurance Agreement (the "Insurance Agreement")
dated as of June 27, 2001 between the Insurer and the Company. In order to
provide monies to fund a loan made by the Authority to the Company pursuant to a
Pollution Control Facilities Loan Agreement dated as of June 1, 2001 between the
Authority and the Company (the "Loan Agreement"), the Authority has issued the
Authority Bonds under and pursuant to the Authority Indenture. Payments made by
the Company of principal and interest on the bonds of this series are intended
to be sufficient to reimburse the Insurer for any payments of principal and
interest made by the Insurer on the Authority Bonds pursuant to the Policy.

The bonds of this series are not transferable except (i) as required to
effect an assignment to a successor of the Insurer under the Insurance Agreement
or (ii) in compliance with a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction in
connection with any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding of the Company.

 The "Initial Interest Payment Date" on the bonds of this series shall be
the date one (1) business day following the receipt by the Insurer of written
notification of Nonpayment (as defined in the Policy) of interest on the
Authority Bonds when such interest shall have come Due for Payment (as defined
in the Policy), written notification of which the Insurer shall provide to the
Company and the Trustee, and the "Initial Interest Accrual Date" shall be the
date six months prior to such Initial Interest Payment Date. The next Interest
Payment Date shall be the date six months after the Initial Interest Payment
Date, and each successive Interest Payment Date shall be the date six months
after the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that
the last Interest Payment Date shall be the date of maturity of the bonds of
this series and the interest so payable on such maturity date shall accrue from
the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to but not including such
maturity date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the amount of
interest payable on the bonds of the series on any Interest Payment Date
(including the Initial Interest Payment Date) shall not exceed the amount
actually paid to holders of Authority Bonds by the Insurer under the Policy in
respect of the Nonpayment of interest Due for Payment on the Authority Bonds
over the period from the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to and
including such Interest Payment Date (or if such Interest Payment Date is the
Initial Interest Payment Date, then from the Initial Interest Accrual Date to
such Interest Payment Date).

 The Company's obligation to make payments with respect to the principal of
and/or interest on the bonds of this series shall be fully or partially
satisfied and discharged to the extent that, at the time any such payment shall
be due, the corresponding amount then due of principal of and/or interest on the
Authority Bonds shall have been fully or partially paid (other than by the
application of the proceeds of any payment by the Insurer under the Policy), as
the case may be, or there shall have been deposited with the Authority Trustee
pursuant to the Authority Indenture trust funds sufficient under such indenture
to fully or partially pay, as the case may be, the corresponding amount then due
of principal of and/or interest on the Authority Bonds (other than by the
application of the proceeds of any payment by the Insurer under the Policy).
Notwithstanding anything contained herein or in the Indenture to the contrary,
the Company shall be obligated to make payments with respect to the principal of
and/or interest on the bonds of this series only to the extent that the Insurer
has made a payment with respect to the Authority Bonds under the Policy.

 Upon payment of the principal of and interest due on the Authority Bonds,
whether at maturity or prior to maturity by acceleration, redemption or
otherwise, or upon provision for the payment thereof having been made in
accordance with the Authority Indenture (other than by the application of the
proceeds of any payment by the Insurer under the Policy), the bonds of this
series in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of Authority Bonds so
paid or for which such provision for payment has been made shall be deemed fully
paid, satisfied and discharged and the obligations of the Company thereunder
shall be terminated and such bonds of this series shall be surrendered to and
canceled by the Trustee. From and after the Release Date (as defined in the
Insurance Agreement), the bonds of this series shall be deemed fully paid,
satisfied and discharged and the obligation of the Company thereunder shall be
terminated. On the Release Date, the bonds of this series shall be surrendered
to and canceled by the Trustee.

The bonds of this series are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or
in part, as the case may be, on each date that Authority Bonds are to be
redeemed. The principal amount of the Bonds of this series to be redeemed on any
such date shall be equal to the principal amount of Authority Bonds called for
redemption on that date. All redemptions of bonds of this series shall be at
100 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest to the redemption
date.

 In case of certain defaults as specified in the Indenture, the principal
of this bond may be declared or may become due and payable on the conditions, at
the time, in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

 No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest
on this bond, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof or
of the Indenture, to or against any incorporator, stockholder, director or
officer, past, present or future, as such, of the Company, or of any predecessor
or successor company, either directly or through the Company, or such
predecessor or successor company, or otherwise, under any constitution or
statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty, or
otherwise, all such liability of incorporators, stockholders, directors and
officers, as such, being waived and released by the holder and owner hereof by
the acceptance of this bond and being likewise waived and released by the terms
of the Indenture.

 The bonds of this series are issuable only as registered bonds without
coupons in denominations of 1,000 and, if higher, any authorized multiple of
 1,000. Except as may be stated in any legend written on the face of this bond,
this bond is transferable by the registered holder hereof, in person or by
attorney duly authorized, at the corporate trust office of the Trustee, in the
Borough of Manhattan, The City, County and State of New York, or at such other
place or places as the Company may designate by resolution of the Board of
Directors, but only in the manner and upon the conditions prescribed in the
Indenture, upon the surrender and cancellation of this bond and the payment of
charges for transfer, and upon any such transfer a new registered bond or bonds,
without coupons, of the same series and maturity date and for the same aggregate
principal amount, in authorized denominations, will be issued to the transferee
in exchange herefor. The Company, the Trustee and any agent designated to make
transfers or exchanges of bonds of this series may deem and treat the person in
whose name this bond is registered as the absolute owner for all purposes
including the purpose of the receipt of payment. Registered bonds of this series
shall be exchangeable at said corporate trust office of the Trustee, or at such
other place or places as the Company may designate by resolution of the Board of
Directors, for registered bonds of other authorized denominations having the
same aggregate principal amount, in the manner and upon the conditions
prescribed in the Indenture. Neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any other
agent designated for such purpose shall be required to make transfers or
exchanges of bonds of this series during the period between any interest payment
date for such series and the record date next preceding such interest payment
date. Notwithstanding any provisions of the Indenture, no charge shall be made
upon any transfer or exchange of bonds of this series other than for any tax or
taxes or other governmental charge required to be paid by the Company.

PENNSYLVANIA POWER COMPANY

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
 ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

 This discussion includes forward-looking statements based on
information currently available to management that is subject to certain risks
and uncertainties. Such statements typically contain, but are not limited to,
the terms anticipate, potential, expect, believe, estimate and similar words.
Actual results may differ materially due to the speed and nature of increased
competition and deregulation in the electric utility industry, economic or
weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changes in markets for
energy services, changing energy and commodity market prices, legislative and
regulatory changes (including revised environmental requirements), and the
availability and cost of capital.

Corporate Separation
- --------------------

 In connection with FirstEnergy's Ohio transition plan, FirstEnergy
separated its businesses into three distinct units - a competitive services
unit, a regulated services unit and a corporate support services unit. Penn is
included in the regulated services unit which continues to deliver power to
homes and businesses through its existing distribution system and maintains the
"provider of last resort" (PLR) obligation under its rate plan.

 FirstEnergy's electric utility operating companies (EUOC) have
entered into power supply agreements whereby FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. (FES)
purchases all of the EUOC nuclear generation, as well as generation from leased
fossil generation facilities. FirstEnergy Generation Corp. (FGCO), a wholly
owned subsidiary of FES, leases fossil generating units owned by the EUOC. We
are a "full requirements" customer of FES to enable us to meet our PLR
responsibilities in our service area.

 The effect on our reported results of operations in 2001 from
FirstEnergy's corporate separation plan and our sale of transmission assets to
American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI) in September 2000, are summarized in
the following table:

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

 Earnings on common stock in 2001 increased to 37.3 million from
 19.1 million in 2000. Excluding the effects shown in the table above, earnings
on common stock decreased to 6.6 million in 2001 from 2000, being adversely
affected by reduced operating revenues, which were partially offset by reduced
operating expenses and taxes and lower net interest charges. In 2000, earnings
on common stock increased to 19.1 million from 8.3 million in 1999. Results
for 2000 were favorably affected by higher operating revenues which were
partially offset by increased nuclear operating expenses and taxes.

 Excluding the effects shown in the table above, operating revenues
decreased by 57.0 million or 14.9 in 2001 from 2000 following a 53.9 million
increase in 2000 from the prior year. The decrease primarily resulted from a
 56.7 million reduction in wholesale revenues (a 93.3 decrease in wholesale
kilowatt-hour sales) from the prior year due to the substitution of PSA sales
for kilowatt-hour sales to other wholesale customers. Distribution deliveries
declined 2.3 in 2001 from the prior year reflecting the influence of a
declining national economy on our regional business activity that contributed to
lower distribution deliveries to commercial and industrial customers. Partially
offsetting the impact of a weaker economy was an increase in electric generation
revenues reflecting a return of customers previously served by alternative
generation suppliers. Retail generation sales increased in all customer
categories resulting in an overall 4.8 increase in kilowatt-hour sales from the
prior year. Electric generation services provided by other suppliers in our
service area decreased to 4.1 from 10.6 in 2000.

 In 2000, service area growth combined with the return of customers
previously served by alternative generation suppliers to increase retail sales
revenues. Sales to all retail customer groups were substantially higher in 2000,
compared to the preceding year, reflecting a stronger economy in our service
area. The transfer of ownership in Penn Power Energy, Inc. (PPE) to FES in
December 1999, offset a portion of the increased operating revenues in 2000.
Substantial growth in wholesale kilowatt-hour sales, primarily to affiliated
utilities, contributed significantly to the higher operating revenues in 2000.
These sales were possible due to additional available internal generation
resulting from increased nuclear capacity received in a December 1999 exchange
of generating assets with Duquesne Light Company.

and by 46.0 million in 2000 from the respective prior year. Excluding the
effects of restructuring, total 2001 operating expenses and taxes were 30.0
million lower than the prior year. The following table presents changes from the
prior year by expense category excluding the impact of restructuring.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total operating expenses and taxes.......... (30.0) 46.0
 =====================================================================

The following discussion excludes the effects shown in the preceding
table related to the impact of restructuring.

 The decrease in fuel and purchased power costs in 2001, compared to
2000, primarily reflects the transfer of fossil operations to FGCO with our
power requirements being provided under the PSA. In 2000, fuel and purchased
power costs decreased 19.0 million, compared to 1999, primarily due to an 18.6
million reduction in purchased power costs and a slight reduction in fuel
expense. The decrease in purchased power costs in 2000 resulted from a
substantial increase in available internal generation, which reduced the need
for external sources of power, as well as the transfer of ownership in PPE to
FES. Although internal generation increased 76 compared to 1999, fuel expense
was slightly lower due to the absence of a 6.8 million nonrecurring charge
related to the Duquesne asset exchange in 1999, additional nuclear generation,
the expiration of an above-market coal contract and continued improvement in
coal blending strategies.

Nuclear operating costs increased slightly in 2001 from the previous
year. In 2000, nuclear operating costs increased 75.8 million from 1999. The
increase was due to additional costs associated with refueling outages at both
Beaver Valley Plant units and increased ownership of the Beaver Valley Plant for
the entire year following the 1999 asset exchange with Duquesne, compared to
approximately one month of increased ownership in the prior year. Other
operating costs increased slightly in 2001 from the prior year. In 2000, other
operating costs decreased 5.7 million from the prior year primarily due to
increased gains realized from the sale of emission allowances, compared to 1999.

 Depreciation and amortization increased 3.3 million in 2001 from the
prior year. The increase resulted in part from the absence in 2001 of an
adjustment made in the prior year to decommissioning costs. In 2000,
depreciation and amortization decreased 6.2 million from 1999 primarily
reflecting lower accrued decommissioning costs.

 General taxes decreased by 5.2 million in 2001 from 2000 primarily
due to a one-time benefit of 3 million resulting from successfully resolving
certain pending tax issues and the effect of a reduction to the gross receipts
tax rate. In 2000, general taxes decreased by 6.0 million from 1999 primarily
due to favorable property tax law changes and the phase-out of Pennsylvania's
Capital Stock and Franchise Tax.

Net Interest Charges

 Net interest charges continued to trend lower, decreasing by 2.1
million in 2001 and by 1.4 million in 2000, compared to the prior year. We
continue to redeem and refinance our outstanding debt during 2001 -- net
redemptions and refinancing activities totaled 1.0 million and 32.9 million,
respectively, and will result in annualized savings of 872,000.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

 We had about 54.5 million of cash and temporary investments and no
short-term indebtedness as of December 31, 2001. We also had a 2 million bank
facility that provides for borrowings on a short-term basis at the bank's
discretion. At the end of 2001, we had the capability to issue 293 million of
additional first mortgage bonds on the basis of property additions and retired
bonds. Based upon applicable earnings in 2001 under the earnings coverage test
contained in our charter, we could issue 195 million of preferred stock
(assuming no additional debt was issued).

 Following approval of the merger of FirstEnergy and GPU by the New
Jersey Board of Public Utilities on September 26, 2001, Standard & Poor's
upgraded our corporate credit rating and senior secured debt rating from BB+ to
BBB. Ratings of junior securities were also upgraded to conform to typical
rating relationships.

 Our cash requirements in 2002 for operating expenses, construction
expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and preferred stock redemptions are
expected to be met without increasing our net debt and preferred stock
outstanding. Major contractual obligations for future cash payments are
summarized in the following table:

 177 million (excluding nuclear fuel) of which approximately 36 million applies
to 2002. Investments for additional nuclear fuel during the 2002-2006 period are
estimated to be approximately 94 million, of which about 8 million relates to
2002. During the same periods, our nuclear fuel investments are expected to be
reduced by approximately 95 million and 20 million, respectively, as the
nuclear fuel is consumed. We had no material off balance sheet obligations as of
December 31, 2001.

Interest Rate Risk
- ------------------

 Our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is reduced
since a significant portion of our debt has fixed interest rates, as noted in
the table below. We are subject to the inherent risks related to refinancing
maturing debt by issuing new debt securities. Changes in the market value of our
nuclear decommissioning trust funds are recognized by making corresponding
changes to the decommissioning liability, as described in Note 1 - Utility Plant
and Depreciation.

The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted
average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio, debt
obligations and preferred stock with mandatory redemption provisions.

Outlook
- -------

 In 2001, a number of our customers previously electing to be served
by alternative energy providers returned to our system for their energy needs.
We have a continuing responsibility to provide power to those customers not
choosing to receive power from an alternative energy supplier subject to certain
limits. Adopting new approaches to regulation and experiencing new forms of
competition have created new uncertainties. We continue to deliver power to
homes and businesses through our existing distribution system, which remains
regulated.

Environmental Matters

 We are in compliance with the current sulfur dioxide (SO2) and
nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990. In 1998, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized
regulations requiring additional NOx reductions in the future from our Ohio and
Pennsylvania facilities. Various regulatory and judicial actions have since
sought to further define NOx reduction requirements (see Note 5 - Environmental
Matters). We continue to evaluate our compliance plans and other compliance
options.

 Violations of federally approved SO2 regulations can result in
shutdown of the generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of
up to 27,500 for each day a unit is in violation. The EPA has an interim
enforcement policy for SO2 regulations in Ohio that allows for compliance based
on a 30-day averaging period. We cannot predict what action the EPA may take in
the future with respect to the interim enforcement policy.

 In 1999 and 2000, the EPA issued Notices of Violation (NOV) or a
Compliance Order to nine utilities covering 44 power plants, including the W.H.
Sammis Plant. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice filed eight civil
complaints against various investor-owned utilities, which included a complaint
against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. The NOV
and complaint allege violations of the Clean Air Act (CAA) based on operation
and maintenance of the Sammis Plant dating back to 1984. The complaint against
us requests the installation of "best available control technology" as well as
civil penalties of up to 27,500 per day. Although unable to predict the outcome
of these proceedings, we believe the Sammis Plant is in full compliance with the
CAA and that the NOV and complaint are without merit. Penalties could be imposed
if the Sammis Plant continues to operate without correcting the alleged
violations and a court determines that the allegations are valid. The Sammis
Plant continues to operate while these proceedings are pending.

 In December 2000, the EPA announced it would proceed with the
development of regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants from electric
power plants. The EPA identified mercury as the hazardous air pollutant of
greatest concern. The EPA established a schedule to propose regulations by
December 2003 and issue final regulations by December 2004. The future cost of
compliance with these regulations may be substantial.

 As a result of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as
amended, and the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state
hazardous waste regulations have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel
combustion waste products, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste
disposal requirements pending the EPA's evaluation of the need for future
regulation. The EPA has issued its final regulatory determination that
regulation of coal ash as a hazardous waste is unnecessary. In April 2000, the
EPA announced that it will develop national standards regulating disposal of
coal ash under its authority to regulate nonhazardous waste.

Legal Matters-

 Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to our normal
business operations are pending against FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries. The
most significant applicable to us are described above.

Significant Accounting Policies
- -------------------------------

 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Application of
these principles often require a high degree of judgment, estimates and
assumptions that affect our financial results. All of our assets are subject to
their own specific risks and uncertainties and are continually reviewed for
impairment. Assets related to the application of the policies discussed below
are similarly reviewed with their risks and uncertainties reflecting these
specific factors. Our more significant accounting policies are described below.

Regulatory Accounting

 We are subject to regulation that sets the prices (rates) we are
permitted to charge our customers based on our costs that the regulatory
agencies determine we are permitted to recover. At times, regulators permit the
future recovery through rates of costs that would be currently charged to
expense by an unregulated company. This rate-making process results in the
recording of regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash inflows. As a
result of the changing regulatory framework in Pennsylvania, significant amounts
of regulatory assets have been recorded -- 209 million as of December 31, 2001.
We continually review these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability
within the approved regulatory guidelines. Impairment risk associated with these
assets relates to potentially adverse legislative, judicial or regulatory
actions in the future.

Revenue Recognition

 We follow the accrual method of accounting for revenues, recognizing
revenue for kilowatt-hours that have been delivered but have not yet been billed
through the end of the year. The determination of unbilled revenues requires
management to make various estimates including:

 o Net energy generated or purchased for retail load
 o Losses of energy over distribution lines
 o Allocations to distribution companies within the FirstEnergy system
 o Mix of kilowatt-hour usage by residential, commercial and industrial
 customers
 o Kilowatt-hour usage of customers receiving electricity from alternative
 suppliers

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
- ------------------------------------

 In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations." The new statement provides accounting standards
for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets, with
adoption required by January 1, 2003. SFAS 143 requires that the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which
it is incurred. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of
the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. Over time the capitalized costs are
depreciated and the present value of the asset retirement liability increases
resulting in a period expense. Upon retirement, a gain or loss will be recorded
if the cost to settle the retirement obligation differs from the carrying
amount. We are currently assessing the new standard and have not yet determined
the impact on our financial statements.

 In September 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of." The Statement also supersedes the accounting and reporting
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 30, "Reporting the
Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions." Our adoption of this Statement, effective January 1, 2002, will
result in our accounting for any future impairments or disposals of long-lived
assets under the provisions of SFAS 144, but will not change the accounting
principles used in previous asset impairments or disposals. Application of SFAS
144 is not anticipated to have a major impact on our accounting for impairments
or disposal transactions compared to the prior application of SFAS 121 or APB
30.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

 Pennsylvania Power Company (Company), a wholly owned subsidiary of
Ohio Edison Company (OE), follows the accounting policies and practices
prescribed by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC) and the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(GAAP) requires management to make periodic estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

 Results of operations for 1999 include the Company and its former
wholly owned subsidiary, Penn Power Energy, Inc. (PPE). The subsidiary was
formed to market energy products and services coincident with the commencement
of electricity generation customer choice and competition in Pennsylvania in
January 1999. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
The Company transferred its 100 ownership in PPE to a subsidiary of FirstEnergy
Corp., OE's parent company, effective December 31, 1999.

REVENUES-

 The Company's principal business is providing electric service to
customers in western Pennsylvania. The Company's retail customers are metered on
a cycle basis. Revenue is recognized for unbilled electric service through the
end of the year.

 Receivables from customers include sales to residential, commercial
and industrial customers located in the Company's service area and sales to
wholesale customers. There was no material concentration of receivables at
December 31, 2001 or 2000, with respect to any particular segment of the
Company's customers.

REGULATORY PLAN-

 Pennsylvania enacted "The Electricity Generation Customer Choice and
Competition Act" in 1996, which permitted customers, including the Company's
customers, to choose their electric generation supplier, while transmission and
distribution services would continue to be supplied by their current providers.
The phase in of customer choice was completed on January 1, 2001. The Company
continues to deliver power to homes and businesses through its distribution
system, which remains regulated by the PPUC. The Company's rates have been
restructured to establish separate charges for transmission and distribution;
generation, which is subject to competition; and stranded cost recovery. In the
event customers obtain power from an alternative source, the generation portion
of the Company's rates is excluded from their bill and the customers receive a
generation charge from the alternative supplier. The stranded cost recovery
portion of rates provides for recovery of certain amounts not otherwise
considered recoverable in a competitive generation market, including regulatory
assets.

 In 1998, the PPUC authorized the Company's rate restructuring plan,
which essentially resulted in the deregulation of the Company's generation
business. The Company was required to remove from its balance sheet all
regulatory assets and liabilities related to its generation business and assess
all other assets for impairment. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
issued interpretive guidance regarding asset impairment measurement which
concluded that any supplemental regulated cash flows such as a competitive
transition charge (CTC) should be excluded from the cash flows of assets in a
portion of the business not subject to regulatory accounting practices. If those
assets are impaired, a regulatory asset should be established if the costs are
recoverable through regulatory cash flows. Consistent with the SEC guidance, the
Company reduced its nuclear generating unit investments by approximately 305
million, of which approximately 227 million was recognized as a regulatory
asset to be recovered through the CTC over a seven-year transition period; the
remaining net amount of 78 million was written off. The Company is entitled to
recover 236 million of stranded costs through the CTC that began in 1999 and
ends in 2006. The Company's net assets included in utility plant relating to the
operations for which the application of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation"
(SFAS 71) was discontinued were 88 million as of December 31, 2001. All of the
Company's regulatory assets are expected to continue to be recovered under
provisions of the rate restructuring plan.

UTILITY PLANT AND DEPRECIATION-

 Utility plant reflects the original cost of construction (except for
nuclear generating units which were adjusted to fair value as discussed above),
including payroll and related costs such as taxes, employee benefits,
administrative and general costs, and interest costs.

 The Company provides for depreciation on a straight-line basis at
various rates over the estimated lives of property included in plant in service.
The annual composite rate for electric plant was approximately 2.9 in 2001,
2.6 in 2000 and 2.5 in 1999.

Annual depreciation expense includes approximately 1.6 million for
future decommissioning costs applicable to the Company's ownership interest in
three nuclear generating units. The Company's share of the future obligation to
decommission these units is approximately 340 million in current dollars and
(using a 4.0 escalation rate) approximately 695 million in future dollars. The
estimated obligation and the escalation rate were developed based on site
specific studies. Payments for decommissioning are expected to begin in 2016,
when actual decommissioning work begins. The Company has recovered approximately
 16 million for decommissioning through its electric rates from customers
through December 31, 2001. The Company has also recognized an estimated
liability of approximately 7.0 million related to decontamination and
decommissioning of nuclear enrichment facilities operated by the United States
Department of Energy, as required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

 In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS
143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The new statement provides
accounting treatment for retirement obligations associated with tangible
long-lived assets with adoption required as of January 1, 2003. SFAS 143
requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be
recorded in the period in which it is incurred. The associated asset retirement
costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset.
Over time the capitalized costs are depreciated and the present value of the
asset retirement liability increases, resulting in a period expense. Upon
retirement, a gain or loss will be recorded if the costs to settle the
retirement obligation differs from the carrying amount. Under the new standard,
additional assets and liabilities relating principally to nuclear
decommissioning obligations will be recorded, the pattern of expense recognition
will change and income from the external decommissioning trust will be recorded
as investment income. The Company is currently assessing the new standard and
has not yet quantified the impact on its financial statements.

COMMON OWNERSHIP OF GENERATING FACILITIES-

 The Company, together with OE and other affiliated companies, The
Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (CEI) and The Toledo Edison Company
(TE), own, as tenants in common, various power generating facilities. Each of
the companies is obligated to pay a share of the costs associated with any
jointly owned facility in the same proportion as its interest. The Company's
portion of operating expenses associated with jointly owned facilities is
included in the corresponding operating expenses on the Statements of Income.
The amounts reflected on the Balance Sheet under utility plant at December 31,
2001 include the following:

NUCLEAR FUEL-

 OES Fuel, Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of OE, is the sole
lessor for the Company's nuclear fuel requirements. OE anticipates replacing
that lease arrangement with direct ownership and nuclear fuel financing by the
Company and OE. The Company amortizes the cost of nuclear fuel based on the rate
of consumption.

INCOME TAXES-

 Details of the total provision for income taxes are shown on the
Statements of Taxes. Deferred income taxes result from timing differences in the
recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and accounting purposes. Investment
tax credits, which were deferred when utilized, are being amortized over the
recovery period of the related property. The liability method is used to account
for deferred income taxes. Deferred income tax liabilities related to tax and
accounting basis differences are recognized at the statutory income tax rates in
effect when the liabilities are expected to be paid. The Company is included in
FirstEnergy's consolidated federal income tax return. The consolidated tax
liability is allocated on a "stand-alone" company basis, with the Company
recognizing any tax losses or credits it contributed to the consolidated return.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS-

 FirstEnergy's trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan
covers almost all of the Company's full-time employees. Upon retirement,
employees receive a monthly pension based on length of service and compensation.
On December 31, 2001, the FirstEnergy pension plan was merged with the pension
plans of GPU, Inc., which merged with FirstEnergy on November 7, 2001. The
Company uses the projected unit credit method for funding purposes and was not
required to make pension contributions during the three years ended December 31,
2001. The assets of the FirstEnergy pension plan consist primarily of common
stocks, United States government bonds and corporate bonds. The FirstEnergy and
GPU postretirement benefit plans are currently separately maintained; the
information shown below is aggregated as of December 31, 2001.

 The Company provides a minimum amount of noncontributory life
insurance to retired employees in addition to optional contributory insurance.
Health care benefits, which include certain employee deductibles and copayments,
are also available to retired employees, their dependents and, under certain
circumstances, their survivors. The Company pays insurance premiums to cover a
portion of these benefits in excess of set limits; all amounts up to the limits
are paid by the Company. The Company recognizes the expected cost of providing
other postretirement benefits to employees and their beneficiaries and covered
dependents from the time employees are hired until they become eligible to
receive those benefits.

 The following sets forth the funded status of the plans and amounts
recognized on FirstEnergy's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31:

The composite health care trend rate assumption is approximately 10 
in 2002, 9 in 2003 and 8 in 2004, trending to 4 -6 in later years. Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported
for the health care plan. An increase in the health care trend rate assumption
by one percentage point would increase the total service and interest cost
components by 14.6 million and the postretirement benefit obligation by 151.2
million. A decrease in the same assumption by one percentage point would
decrease the total service and interest cost components by 12.7 million and the
postretirement benefit obligation by 131.3 million.

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES-

 Operating revenues, operating expenses and other income include
transactions with affiliated companies, primarily OE, CEI, TE, American
Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI), FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. (FES) and
FirstEnergy. The Ohio transition plan resulted in the corporate separation of
FirstEnergy's regulated and unregulated operations in 2001. Unregulated
operations under FES now operate the generation businesses of the Company, OE,
CEI and TE. As a result, the Company entered into power supply agreements (PSA)
whereby FES purchases all of the Company's nuclear generation and the Company
purchases its power from FES to meet its "provider of last resort" obligations.
The 2001 reduction in revenues for Bruce Mansfield administrative and general
charges and costs for FirstEnergy support services reflects the transfer of
fossil generation operations to FES. The primary affiliated companies
transactions, including the effects of the PSA beginning in 2001, the sale and
leaseback of the Company's transmission assets to ATSI in September 2000 and
FirstEnergy's providing support services at cost, are as follows:

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOWS INFORMATION-

 All temporary cash investments purchased with an initial maturity of
three months or less are reported as cash equivalents on the Balance Sheets at
cost, which approximates their fair market value. Noncash financing and
investing activities included capital lease transactions amounting to 21.6
million, 21.2 million and 27.1 million for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

 All borrowings with initial maturities of less than one year are
defined as financial instruments under GAAP and are reported on the Balance
Sheets at cost, which approximates their fair market value. The following sets
forth the approximate fair value and related carrying amounts of all other
long-term debt, preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption and investments
other than cash and cash equivalents as of December 31:

Preferred stock.................. 15 15 15 15
Investments other than cash and
 cash equivalents................ 160 162 155 153
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fair values of long-term debt and preferred stock reflect the
present value of the cash outflows relating to those securities based on the
current call price, the yield to maturity or the yield to call, as deemed
appropriate at the end of each respective year. The yields assumed were based on
securities with similar characteristics offered by corporations with credit
ratings similar to the Company's ratings.

The fair value of investments other than cash and cash equivalents
represent cost (which approximates fair value) or the present value of the cash
inflows based on the yield to maturity. The yields assumed were based on
financial instruments with similar characteristics and terms. Investments other
than cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of decommissioning trust
investments. Unrealized gains and losses applicable to the decommissioning
trusts have been recognized in the trust investment with a corresponding change
to the decommissioning liability. The Company has no securities held for trading
purposes.

REGULATORY ASSETS-

 The Company recognizes, as regulatory assets, costs which the FERC
and PPUC have authorized for recovery from customers in future periods. Without
such authorization, the costs would have been charged to income as incurred. All
regulatory assets are being recovered from customers under the Company's rate
restructuring plan. Based on the rate restructuring plan, the Company continues
to bill and collect cost-based rates relating to the Company's nongeneration
operations and continues the application of SFAS 71 to these operations.

 Net regulatory assets on the Balance Sheets are comprised of the
following:

2. LEASES

 The Company leases office space and other property and equipment
under cancelable and noncancelable leases. Consistent with the regulatory
treatment, the rentals for capital and operating leases are charged to operating
expenses on the Statements of Income. Such costs for the three years ended
December 31, 2001, are summarized as follows:

3. CAPITALIZATION

 (A) RETAINED EARNINGS-

 Under the Company's Charter, the Company's retained earnings
unrestricted for payment of cash dividends on the Company's common stock were
 26.1 million as of December 31, 2001.

 (B) STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS-

 Employees of the Company participate in the FirstEnergy Executive and
Director Incentive Compensation Plan (FE Plan) administered by FirstEnergy.
Under the FE Plan, total awards cannot exceed 15 million shares of common stock
or their equivalent. Only stock options and restricted stock have been granted,
with vesting periods ranging from six months to seven years.

 Under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, covered employees can
direct a portion of their Annual Incentive Award and/or Long Term Incentive
Award into an unfunded FirstEnergy Stock Account to receive vested stock units.
An additional 20 premium is received in the form of stock units based on the
amount allocated to the FirstEnergy Stock Account. Dividends are calculated
quarterly on stock units outstanding and are paid in the form of additional
stock units. Upon withdrawal, stock units are converted to FirstEnergy shares.
Payout occurs three years from the date of deferral.

 The Company continues to apply APB 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees." As required by SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," the Company has determined pro forma earnings as though the
Company had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method.
The weighted average assumptions used in valuing the options and their resulting
fair values are as follows:

 2001 2000 1999

 (C) PREFERRED STOCK-

 The Company's 7.75 series of preferred stock has a restriction which
prevents early redemption prior to July 2003. All other preferred stock may be
redeemed by the Company in whole, or in part, with 30-60 days' notice.

(D) PREFERRED STOCK SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION-

 The Company's 7.625 series has an annual sinking fund requirement
for 7,500 shares beginning on October 1, 2002.

 (E) LONG-TERM DEBT-

 The first mortgage indenture and its supplements, which secure all of
the Company's first mortgage bonds, serve as a direct first mortgage lien on
substantially all property and franchises, other than specifically excepted
property, owned by the Company.

 Based on the amount of bonds authenticated by the Trustee through
December 31, 2001, the Company's annual sinking and improvement fund
requirements for all bonds issued under the mortgage amounts to 1.0 million.
The Company expects to deposit funds in 2002 that will be withdrawn upon the
surrender for cancellation of a like principal amount of bonds, which are
specifically authenticated for such purposes against unfunded property additions
or against previously retired bonds. This method can result in minor increases
in the amount of the annual sinking fund requirement. Sinking fund requirements
for first mortgage bonds and maturing long-term debt (excluding capital leases)
during the

next five years are 11.3 million in 2002, 41.0 million in 2003, 40.7 million
in 2004 and 1.0 million in each year 2005 and 2006.

 The Company's obligations to repay certain pollution control revenue
bonds are secured by several series of first mortgage bonds. Certain pollution
control revenue bonds are entitled to the benefit of irrevocable bank letters of
credit of 10.4 million and noncancelable municipal bond insurance policies of
 32.9 million to pay principal of, or interest on, the pollution control revenue
bonds. To the extent that drawings are made under the letters of credit, the
Company is entitled to a credit against its obligation to repay the related
bond. The Company pays an annual fee of 1.25 of the amount of the letters of
credit to the issuing bank and is obligated to reimburse the bank for any
drawings thereunder.

4. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS:

 The Company has a credit agreement with OE whereby either company can
borrow funds from the other by issuing unsecured notes at the prevailing prime
or similar interest rate. Under the terms of this agreement, the maximum
borrowing is limited only by the availability of funds; however, the Company's
borrowings under this agreement are currently limited by the PPUC to a total of
 50 million. Either company can terminate the agreement with six months' notice.

5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES-

 The Company's current forecast reflects expenditures of approximately
 177 million for property additions and improvements from 2002-2006, of which
approximately 36 million is applicable to 2002. Investments for additional
nuclear fuel during the 2002-2006 period are estimated to be approximately 94
million, of which approximately 8 million applies to 2002. During the same
periods, the Company's nuclear fuel investments are expected to be reduced by
approximately 95 million and 20 million, respectively, as the nuclear fuel is
consumed.

NUCLEAR INSURANCE-

 The Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability relative to a
single incident at a nuclear power plant to 9.5 billion. The amount is covered
by a combination of private insurance and an industry retrospective rating plan.
Based on its ownership interests in the Beaver Valley Station and the Perry
Plant, the Company's maximum potential assessment under the industry
retrospective rating plan (assuming the other affiliate co-owners contribute
their proportionate shares of any assessments under the retrospective rating
plan) would be 74.0 million per incident but not more than 8.4 million in any
one year for each incident.

 The Company is also insured as to its interest in Beaver Valley and
Perry under policies issued to the operating company for each plant. Under these
policies, up to 2.75 billion is provided for property damage and
decontamination and decommissioning costs. The Company has also obtained
approximately 222.1 million of insurance coverage for replacement power costs
for its interests in Beaver Valley and Perry. Under these policies, the Company
can be assessed a maximum of approximately 13.9 million for incidents at any
covered nuclear facility occurring during a policy year which are in excess of
accumulated funds available to the insurer for paying losses.

 The Company intends to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as
described above as long as it is available. To the extent that replacement
power, property damage, decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement
costs and other such costs arising from a nuclear incident at any of the
Company's plants exceed the policy limits of the insurance in effect with
respect to that plant, to the extent a nuclear incident is determined not to be
covered by the Company's insurance policies, or to the extent such insurance
becomes unavailable in the future, the Company would remain at risk for such
costs.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS-

 Various federal, state and local authorities regulate the Company
with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters. Generation
operations and any related additional capital expenditures for environmental
compliance are the responsibility of FirstEnergy's competitive services business
unit.

 The Company is required to meet federally approved sulfur dioxide
(SO2) regulations. Violations of such regulations can result in shutdown of the
generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of up to 27,500 for
each day the unit is in violation. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
an interim enforcement policy for SO2 regulations in Ohio that allows for
compliance based on a 30-day averaging period. The Company cannot predict what
action the EPA may take in the future with respect to the interim enforcement
policy.

The Company is in compliance with the current SO2 and nitrogen oxides
(NOx) reduction requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. SO2
reductions are being achieved by burning lower-sulfur fuel, generating more
electricity from lower-emitting plants, and/or using emission allowances. NOx
reductions are being achieved through combustion controls and the generation of
more electricity at lower-emitting plants. In September 1998, the EPA finalized
regulations requiring additional NOx reductions from the Company's Pennsylvania
facilities. The EPA's NOx Transport Rule imposes uniform reductions of NOx
emissions (an approximate 85 reduction in utility plant NOx emissions from
projected 2007 emissions) across a region of nineteen states and the District of
Columbia, including Ohio and Pennsylvania, based on a conclusion that such NOx
emissions are contributing significantly to ozone pollution in the eastern
United States. State Implementation Plans (SIP) must comply by May 31, 2004 with
individual state NOx budgets established by the EPA. Pennsylvania submitted a
SIP that requires compliance with the NOx budgets at the Company's Pennsylvania
facilities by May 1, 2003. FirstEnergy continues to evaluate its compliance
plans and other compliance options.

 In July 1997, the EPA promulgated changes in the National Ambient Air
Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone emissions and proposed a new NAAQS for
previously unregulated ultra-fine particulate matter. In May 1999, the U.S.
Court of Appeals found constitutional and other defects in the new NAAQS rules.
In February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the new NAAQS rules regulating
ultra-fine particulates but found defects in the new NAAQS rules for ozone and
decided that the EPA must revise those rules. The future cost of compliance with
these regulations may be substantial and will depend if and how they are
ultimately implemented by the states in which the Company operates affected
facilities.

 In 1999 and 2000, the EPA issued Notices of Violation (NOV) or a
Compliance Order to nine utilities covering 44 power plants, including the W. H.
Sammis Plant. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice filed eight civil
complaints against various investor-owned utilities, which included a complaint
against the Company and OE in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of Ohio. The NOV and complaint allege violations of the Clean Air Act based on
operation and maintenance of the Sammis Plant dating back to 1984. The complaint
requests permanent injunctive relief to require the installation of "best
available control technology" and civil penalties of up to 27,500 per day of
violation. Although unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings, the
Company and OE believe the Sammis Plant is in full compliance with the Clean Air
Act and the NOV and complaint are without merit. Penalties could be imposed if
the Sammis Plant continues to operate without correcting the alleged violations
and a court determines that the allegations are valid. The Sammis Plant
continues to operate while these proceedings are pending.

 In December 2000, the EPA announced it would proceed with the
development of regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants from electric
power plants. The EPA identified mercury as the hazardous air pollutant of
greatest concern. The EPA established a schedule to propose regulations by
December 2003 and issue final regulations by December 2004. The future cost of
compliance with these regulations may be substantial.

 As a result of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as
amended, and the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state
hazardous waste regulations have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel
combustion waste products, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste
disposal requirements pending the EPA's evaluation of the need for future
regulation. The EPA has issued its final regulatory determination that
regulation of coal ash as a hazardous waste is unnecessary. In April 2000, the
EPA announced that it will develop national standards regulating disposal of
coal ash under its authority to regulate nonhazardous waste.

LEGAL MATTERS-

 Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to the Company's
normal business operations are pending against FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries.
The most significant applicable to the Company are described above.

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Pennsylvania Power Company:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization
of Pennsylvania Power Company (a Pennsylvania corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of Ohio Edison Company) as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
related statements of income, common stockholder's equity, preferred stock, cash
flows and taxes for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Pennsylvania Power Company as
of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

JERSEY CENTRAL POWER & LIGHT COMPANY

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of
 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

This discussion includes forward-looking statements based on information
currently available to management that is subject to certain risks and
uncertainties. Such statements typically contain, but are not limited to, the
terms anticipate, potential, expect, believe, estimate and similar words. Actual
results may differ materially due to the speed and nature of increased
competition and deregulation in the electric utility industry, economic or
weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changes in markets for
energy services, changing energy and commodity market prices, legislative and
regulatory changes (including revised environmental requirements), the
availability and cost of capital, ability to accomplish or realize anticipated
benefits from strategic initiatives and other similar factors.

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

 Earnings on common stock decreased 70.9 to 59.3 million in 2001 from
 203.9 million in 2000. Results in 2001 were affected by an after-tax charge of
 177.5 million to reduce deferred costs in accordance with the Stipulation of
Settlement related to the merger of FirstEnergy and GPU, Inc. Also contributing
to lower earnings were higher purchased power costs. Partially offsetting these
were lower nuclear and other operating costs and greater revenues. In 2000,
earnings on common stock increased 25.2 to 203.9 million from 162.9 million
in 1999, primarily due to a gain for the reversal of certain deferred taxes and
realization of an investment tax credit related to the sale of the Oyster Creek
Nuclear Generating Station and the absence of a charge resulting from the
Summary Order issued by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) in
1999. Lower nuclear and other operating costs also positively affected results
for 2000.

 Operating revenues increased by 142.2 million in 2001 following a 38.9
million decrease in 2000. The sources of the changes in operating revenues
during 2001 and 2000, as compared to the prior year, are summarized in the
following table.

 -------------------------------------------------------------
 Increase (Decrease) (In millions)

 Change in kilowatt-hour sales due
 to level of retail customers

 All other changes........................... (7.6) 7.6
 ------------------------------------------------------------

 Net Increase (Decrease) in Operating
 Revenues................................. 142.2 (38.9)
 ==============================================================

Electric Sales

 In 2001, a major source of the increase in operating revenues was the
increase in retail generation kilowatt-hour sales due to a large number of
customers returning to us in 2001 as full service customers, after receiving
their power from alternate suppliers in 2000. Residential and commercial sales
increased while industrial sales decreased. The majority of the increase in
residential sales was weather-related, whereas a greater number of commercial
customers and higher usage contributed almost evenly to the increase in
commercial sales. Industrial sales were lower than the previous year due to both
a decrease in the number of customers and lower usage.

 A large decrease in operating revenues occurred in 2000, as compared to
1999, as customers took advantage of the first full year of customer choice in
New Jersey. In 2000, sales of electric generation provided by other suppliers
accounted for 11.7 of total energy delivered as compared to only 0.2 in 1999.
Partially offsetting the overall decrease in operating revenues was an increase
due to our obligation to refund revenues to customers in 1999 as a result of the
NJBPU's Restructuring Summary Order. The Order required us to refund customers
5 from rates in effect as of April 30, 1997. Changes in kilowatt-hour sales by
customer class in 2001 and 2000 are summarized in the following table:

 2

Changes in Kilowatt-hour Sales 2001 2000
 -------------------------------------------------
 Increase (Decrease)

 Residential.................. 4.7 1.4 
 Commercial................... 5.3 1.1

 Wholesale.................... (4.0) 33.2 
 -------------------------------------------------

 Total Sales.................. 2.6 3.6 
 -------------------------------------------------

Operating Expenses and Taxes

 Total operating expenses and taxes increased 89.0 million in 2001 after
decreasing 44.7 million in 2000, compared to the preceding year. In both 2000
and 2001, greater purchased power costs accounted for the largest increases,
offset by lower nuclear and other operating costs. Depreciation and amortization
expenses also decreased in 2000 from 1999.

 Fuel and purchased power costs increased 177.6 million in 2001,
compared to 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to greater amounts of
power purchased through both two-party agreements and through the PJM Power Pool
as a result of the sale of Oyster Creek and higher customer demand. Also
contributing to the increase was a higher average cost of two-party power
purchases in 2001 than in 2000. These increases were partially offset by lower
fuel costs due to the sale of Oyster Creek.

 In 2000, fuel and purchased power costs increased 39.9 million from the
preceding year due to the need to purchase more power through two-party
agreements and the PJM Power Pool after the sale of our fossil fuel generating
facilities and Unit 1 of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Plant in 1999. The
average cost of these two-party purchases was also higher in 2000 than in 1999.
Additionally, the amortization of non-utility generation (NUG) buyout costs was
greater in 2000 than in 1999. Partially offsetting these increases were lower
fuel costs since Oyster Creek was owned for only part of 2000.

 With the sale of Oyster Creek in August 2000, we no longer have any
nuclear operating costs, which were 78.5 million in 2000. The sale of Oyster
Creek was also responsible for the 71.3 million decrease in nuclear operating
costs in 2000, compared to 1999.

 In 2001, other operating expenses decreased 25.2 million from the
previous year due to lower bad debt expense and pension costs. The sale of our
generating stations in 1999 was primarily responsible for the 29.8 million
decrease in 2000 other operating costs from the preceding year. Also
contributing to the reduction in costs was the receipt of additional cash
distributions in 2000, compared to 1999, related to Oyster Creek property
insurance.

Other Income

 Other income decreased 199.8 million in 2001 from the prior year
primarily due to a charge of 300 million 177.5 million net of tax) to reduce
deferred costs in accordance with the Stipulation of Settlement related to the
merger between FirstEnergy and GPU. In 2000, other income increased 26.1
million from 1999. The increase was primarily due to higher interest income and
the reversal of an estimated 1999 tax penalty.

Net Interest Charges

 Net interest charges decreased by 0.2 million in 2001 following a
decrease of 6.5 million in 2000 as compared to the prior year. In 2001, the
slight decrease was attributed to greater deferred interest income offset by
interest expense on 150 million of senior notes issued in May, and higher
average short-term debt levels. The decrease in 2000 was primarily due to
greater deferred interest income and lower interest expense as a result of the
redemption of 40 million of first mortgage bonds (FMB).

Preferred Stock Dividend Requirements

 Preferred stock dividend requirements decreased 1.7 million and 1.8
million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, due to the redemption of cumulative
preferred stock pursuant to mandatory and optional sinking fund provisions.

Capital Resources and Liquidity
- -------------------------------

 We had approximately 31.4 million of cash and temporary investments and
 18.1 million of short-term indebtedness on December 31, 2001. We may borrow
from our affiliates on a short-term basis. We will not issue FMBs

other than as collateral for senior notes, since our senior note indentures
prohibit (subject to certain exceptions) us from issuing any debt which is
senior to the senior notes. As of December 31, 2001, we had the capability to
issue 257 million of additional senior notes based upon FMB collateral. At year
end 2001, based upon applicable earnings coverage tests and our charter, we
could issue 4.6 billion of preferred stock (assuming no additional debt was
issued).

 At the end of 2001, our common equity as a percentage of capitalization
stood at 69 , as compared to 53 at the end of 2000. This increase resulted from
the allocation of the purchase price in the merger between FirstEnergy and GPU.

 Following approval of the merger of FirstEnergy and GPU by the NJBPU on
September 26, 2001, Standard and Poor's adjusted our corporate credit rating
from A/A1 to BBB/A-2, our senior secured debt rating from A+ to BBB+ and our
preferred stock rating from BBB+ to BB+. The lower credit ratings reflect
Standard & Poor's consolidated rating methodology, which resulted in essentially
the same corporate credit rating for all of FirstEnergy's electric utility
operating companies. The credit rating outlook of both Standard & Poor's and
Moody's is stable.

 Our cash requirements in 2002 for operating expenses, construction
expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and preferred stock redemptions are
expected to be met without increasing our net debt and preferred stock
outstanding. Major contractual obligations for future cash payments are
summarized in the following table:

===========================================================================

Our capital spending for the period 2002-2006 is expected to be about
 572 million, of which approximately 144 million applies to 2002.

Market Risk Information
- -----------------------

 We use various market risk sensitive instruments, including derivative
contracts, primarily to manage the risk of price fluctuations. Our Risk Policy
Committee, comprised of FirstEnergy executive officers, exercises an independent
risk oversight function to ensure compliance with corporate risk management
policies and prudent risk management practices.

Commodity Price Risk

 We are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in
electricity and natural gas prices. To manage the volatility relating to these
exposures, we use a variety of derivative instruments, including forward
contracts, options and futures contracts. These derivatives are used principally
for hedging purposes. The change in the fair value of commodity derivative
contracts related to energy production during 2001 is summarized in the table
below:

 Increase (Decrease)in the Fair Value of Commodity Derivative Contracts

 Settled contracts................... (0.1) (0.1)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 Outstanding as of end of period..... 1.5 4.7
 =====================================================================

While the valuation of derivative contracts is always based on active
market prices when they are available, longer-term contracts can require the use
of model-based estimates of prices in later years due to the absence of
published market prices. Currently, substantially all of our derivatives are
valued based on active market prices.

 4

We perform sensitivity analyses to estimate our exposure to the market
risk of our commodity position. A hypothetical 10 adverse shift in quoted
market prices in the near term on our derivative instruments would not have had
a material effect on our consolidated financial position or cash flows as of
December 31, 2001.

Interest Rate Risk

 Our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is reduced since a
significant portion of our debt has fixed interest rates, as noted in the table
below. We are subject to the inherent interest rate risks related to refinancing
maturing debt by issuing new debt securities. Changes in the market value of our
nuclear decommissioning trust funds are recognized by making corresponding
changes to the decommissioning liability, as described in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Outlook
- -------

 Our industry continues to transition to a more competitive environment.
Beginning in late 1999, all of our customers could select alternative energy
suppliers. We continue to deliver power to homes and businesses through our
existing distribution system, which remains regulated. To support customer
choice, rates were restructured into unbundled service charges and additional
non-bypassable charges to recover stranded costs (confirmed by a NJBPU Final
Decision and Order issued in March 2001). We have a continuing responsibility to
provide power to those customers not choosing to receive power from an
alternative energy supplier, subject to certain limits, referred to as Basic
Generation Service (BGS), until July 31, 2002.

Regulatory Matters

 For the period from August 1, 2002 to July 31, 2003, the NJBPU has
authorized the auctioning of BGS to meet the electric demands of customers who
have not selected an alternative supplier. The auction was successfully
concluded on February 13, 2002, thereby eliminating our obligation to provide
for the energy requirements of BGS during that period. Beginning August 1, 2003,
the approach to be taken in procuring the energy needs for BGS has not been
determined. The NJBPU recently initiated a formal proceeding to decide how BGS
will be handled after the transition period.

 We are permitted to defer for future recovery the amount by which our
reasonable and prudently incurred costs for providing BGS to non-shopping
customers and costs incurred under NUG agreements exceed amounts currently
reflected in our BGS rate and market transition charge rate (for the recovery of
stranded costs). On September 26, 2001, the NJBPU approved the merger of
FirstEnergy and GPU subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a
settlement agreement with major intervenors. As part of the settlement, we
agreed to reduce our costs deferred for future recovery by 300 million, in
order to ensure that customers receive the benefit of future merger savings. We
wrote off 300 million of deferred costs in October 2001 upon receipt of the
final regulatory approval for the merger, which occurred on October 29, 2001.

 On February 6, 2002, we received a Financing Order from the NJBPU with
authorization to issue 320 million of transition bonds to securitize the
recovery of bondable stranded costs associated with the previously divested
Oyster Creek. The Order grants us the right to charge a usage-based,
non-bypassable transition bond charge (TBC) and provided for the transfer of the
bondable transition property relating to the TBC to JCP&L Transition Funding LLC
(Transition Funding), a
 5

wholly owned limited liability corporation. Transition Funding is expected to
issue and sell up to 320 million of transition bonds that will be recognized on
our Consolidated Balance Sheet in the second quarter of 2002, with the TBC
providing recovery of principal, interest and related fees on the transition
bonds.

Supply Plan

 As part of our Restructuring Orders, we are obligated, through July 31,
2002, to supply electricity to customers who do not choose an alternate
supplier. The total forecasted peak of this obligation is 5,400 megawatts (MW).
The successful BGS auction in New Jersey removed our BGS obligation for 5,100 MW
for the period from August 1, 2002 to July 31, 2003. In that auction FirstEnergy
Solutions Corp., an affiliated company, was a successful bidder to provide 1,700
MW during the same period to us and two other electric utilities in New Jersey.
Our current supply portfolio contains approximately 900 MW of long-term
purchases from NUGs and 266 MW of owned generation. Our remaining obligation is
expected to be met through a mix of short-term forward (less than one year)
purchases and spot market purchases.

Environmental Matters

 Various environmental liabilities have been recognized on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2001, based on estimates of the
total costs of cleanup, our proportionate responsibility for such costs and the
financial ability of other nonaffiliated entities to pay. We have been named as
a "potentially responsible party" (PRP) at waste disposal sites which may
require cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of disposal of hazardous substances at
historical sites, and the liability involved, are often unsubstantiated and
subject to dispute. Federal law provides that all PRPs for a particular site be
held liable on a joint and several basis. In addition, we have accrued
liabilities for environmental remediation of former manufactured gas plants in
New Jersey; these costs are being recovered through a non-bypassable societal
benefits charge. We have total accrued liabilities aggregating approximately 52
million as of December 31, 2001. We do not believe environmental remediation
costs will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows
or results of operations.

Legal Matters

 Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to our normal business
operations are pending against us, the most significant of which are described
below.

 We have a 25 ownership interest in Unit 2 of the Three Mile Island
Nuclear Plant (TMI-2), which was damaged during a 1979 accident. As a result of
the accident, claims for alleged personal injury were filed against us,
Metropolitan Edison Company, Pennsylvania Electric Company and GPU in the U.S.
District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. In 1996, the District
Court granted a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants and
dismissed the ten initial "test cases" which had been selected for a test case
trial, as well as all of the remaining 2,100 pending claims. In November 1999,
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the District Court's
dismissal of the ten test cases, but set aside the dismissal of the additional
pending claims, remanding them to the District Court for further proceedings.
Following the resolution of judicial proceedings dealing with admissible
evidence, we have again requested summary judgment of the remaining 2,100 claims
in the District Court. On January 15, 2002, the District Court granted our
motion. On February 14, 2002, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of this
decision (see Note 6 - Other Legal Proceedings). Although unable to predict the
outcome of this litigation, we believe that any liability to which we might be
subject by reason of the TMI-2 accident will not exceed our financial protection
under the Price-Anderson Act.

 In July 1999, the Mid-Atlantic states experienced a severe heat storm
which resulted in power outages throughout the service areas of many electric
utilities, including ours. In an investigation into the causes of the outages
and the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of all four New
Jersey electric utilities, the NJBPU concluded that there was not a prima facie
case demonstrating that, overall, we provided unsafe, inadequate or improper
service to our customers. In July 1999, two class action lawsuits (subsequently
consolidated into a single proceeding) were filed against us and other GPU
companies in New Jersey Superior Court, seeking compensatory and punitive
damages arising from the July 1999 service interruptions in our service
territory. In May 2001, the court denied without prejudice our motion seeking
decertification of the class. Discovery continues in the class action, but no
trial date has been set. The judge has set a schedule under which factual legal
discovery would conclude in March 2002, and expert reports would be exchanged by
June 2002. In October 2001, the court held argument on the plaintiffs' motion
for partial summary judgment, which contends that we are bound to several
findings of the NJBPU investigation. The plaintiffs' motion was denied by the
Court in November 2001 and plaintiffs' motion seeking permission to file an
appeal on this denial of their motion was rejected by the New Jersey Appellate
Division. We have also filed a motion for partial summary judgment that is
currently pending before the Superior Court. We are unable to predict the
outcome of these matters.

Significant Accounting Policies
- -------------------------------

 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Application of
these principles often requires a high degree of judgment, estimates and
assumptions that affect our financial results. All of our assets are subject to
their own specific risks and uncertainties and are continually reviewed for
impairment. Assets related to the application of the policies discussed below
are similarly reviewed with their risks and uncertainties reflecting these
specific factors. Our more significant accounting policies are described below:

Purchase Accounting

 On November 7, 2001, the merger between FirstEnergy and GPU became
effective, and we became a wholly owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy. The merger
was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting, which requires judgment
regarding the allocation of the purchase price based on the fair values of the
assets acquired (including intangible assets) and the liabilities assumed. The
fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were based primarily
on estimates. The adjustments reflected in our records, which are subject to
adjustment in 2002 when finalized, primarily consist of: (1) revaluation of
certain property, plant and equipment; (2) adjusting preferred stock subject to
mandatory redemption and long-term debt to estimated fair value; (3) recognizing
additional obligations related to retirement benefits; and (4) recognizing
estimated severance and other compensation liabilities. The excess of the
purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill, which will be reviewed for
impairment at least annually. As of December 31, 2001, we had recorded goodwill
of approximately 1.9 billion related to the merger.

Regulatory Accounting

 We are subject to regulation that sets the prices (rates) we are
permitted to charge our customers based on costs that the regulatory agencies
determine we are permitted to recover. At times, regulators permit the future
recovery through rates of costs that would be currently charged to expense by an
unregulated company. This rate-making process results in the recording of
regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash inflows. As a result of the
changing regulatory framework in New Jersey, a significant amount of regulatory
assets have been recorded. As of December 31, 2001, we had regulatory assets of
 3.3 billion. We continually review these assets to assess their ultimate
recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines. Impairment risk
associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislation,
judicial or regulatory actions in the future.

Derivative Accounting

 Determination of appropriate accounting for derivative transactions
requires the involvement of management representing operations, finance and risk
assessment. In order to determine the appropriate accounting for derivative
transactions, the provisions of the contract need to be carefully assessed in
accordance with the authoritative accounting literature and management's
intended use of the derivative. New authoritative guidance continues to shape
the application of derivative accounting. Management's expectations and
intentions are key factors in determining the appropriate accounting for a
derivative transaction and, as a result, such expectations and intentions must
be documented. Derivative contracts that are determined to fall within the scope
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, as amended, must
be recorded at their fair value. Active market prices are not always available
to determine the fair value of the later years of a contract, requiring that
various assumptions and estimates be used in their valuation. We continually
monitor our derivative contracts to determine if our activities, expectations,
intentions, assumptions and estimates remain valid. As part of our normal
operations we enter into commodities contracts, which increase the impact of
derivative accounting judgments.

Revenue Recognition

 We follow the accrual method of accounting for revenues, recognizing
revenue for kilowatt-hours that have been delivered but not yet billed through
the end of the year. The determination of unbilled revenues requires management
to make various estimates including:

 - Net energy purchased or generated for retail load
 - Losses of energy over distribution lines
 - Mix of kilowatt-hour usage by residential, commercial and industrial
 customers
 - Kilowatt-hour usage of customers receiving electricity from
 alternative suppliers

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
- ------------------------------------

 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approved SFAS 141,
"Business Combinations," and SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"
on June 29, 2001. SFAS 141 requires that all business combinations

 7

initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using purchase accounting. The
provisions of the new standard relating to the determination of goodwill and
other intangible assets have been applied to our 2001 merger, which was
accounted for as a purchase transaction. Under SFAS 142, amortization of
existing goodwill will cease January 1, 2002. Instead, goodwill will be tested
for impairment at least on an annual basis, and no impairment of goodwill is
anticipated as a result of a preliminary analysis. We did not have any goodwill
prior to our 2001 merger, and we did not amortize goodwill associated with the
merger under the provisions of the new standard.

 In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations." The new statement provides accounting standards for retirement
obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets, with adoption required
by January 1, 2003. SFAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an
asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred.
The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying
amount of the long-lived asset. Over time the capitalized costs are depreciated
and the present value of the asset retirement liability increases, resulting in
a period expense. Upon retirement, a gain or loss will be recorded if the cost
to settle the retirement obligation differs from the carrying amount. We are
currently assessing the new standard and have not yet determined the impact on
our financial statements.

 In September 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of." The Statement also supersedes the accounting and reporting
provisions of APB 30. Our adoption of this Statement, effective January 1, 2002,
will result in our accounting for any future impairments or disposals of
long-lived assets under the provisions of SFAS 144, but will not change the
accounting principles used in previous asset impairments or disposals.
Application of SFAS 144 is not anticipated to have a major impact on accounting
for impairments or disposal transactions compared to the prior application of
SFAS 121 or APB 30.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

 The consolidated financial statements include Jersey Central Power &
Light Company (Company) and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company is a wholly owned
subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. FirstEnergy also holds directly all of the
issued and outstanding common shares of Ohio Edison Company (OE), The Cleveland
Electric Illuminating Company (CEI), The Toledo Edison Company (TE), American
Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI), Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed) and
Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec). The Company, Met-Ed and Penelec were
formerly wholly owned subsidiaries of GPU, Inc., which merged with FirstEnergy
on November 7, 2001. Pre-merger period and post-merger period financial results
are separated by a heavy black line.

 The Company follows the accounting policies and practices prescribed by
the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(GAAP) requires management to make periodic estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ
from these estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform with the current year presentation.

REVENUES-

 The Company's principal business is providing electric service to
customers in New Jersey. The Company's retail customers are metered on a cycle
basis. Revenue is recognized for unbilled electric service through the end of
the year.

 Receivables from customers include sales to residential, commercial and
industrial customers and sales to wholesale customers. There was no material
concentration of receivables as of December 31, 2001 or 2000, with respect to
any particular segment of the Company's customers.

REGULATORY PLAN-

 New Jersey is evolving to a competitive electric utility marketplace.
In March 2001, the NJBPU issued a Final Decision and Order (Final Order) with
respect to the Company's rate unbundling, stranded cost and restructuring
filings, which superseded its 1999 Summary Order. The Final Order confirms rate
reductions set forth in the Summary Order, which remain in effect at increasing
levels through July 2003 with rates after July 31, 2003 to be determined in a
rate case commencing in 2002. The Final Order also confirms the right of
customers to select their generation suppliers effective August 1, 1999, and
includes the deregulation of electric generation service costs. The Final Order
confirms the establishment of a non-bypassable societal benefits charge to
recover costs which include nuclear plant decommissioning and manufactured gas
plant remediation, as well as a non-bypassable market transition charge (MTC)
primarily to recover stranded costs; however, the NJBPU deferred making a final
determination of the net proceeds and stranded costs related to prior generating
asset divestitures until the Company's request for an Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) ruling regarding the treatment of associated federal income tax benefits
is acted upon. Should the IRS ruling support the return of the tax benefits to
ratepayers, the Company would need to record a corresponding charge to income of
approximately 25 million, plus interest.

 The Company has an obligation to provide basic generation service
(BGS), that is, it must act as provider of last resort to non-shopping customers
as a result of the NJBPU's restructuring plans. The Company obtains its supply
of electricity to meet its BGS obligation to non-shopping customers almost
entirely from contracted and open market purchases. The Company is permitted to
defer for future collection from customers the amounts by which its costs of
supplying BGS to non-shopping customers and costs incurred under non-utility
generation agreements exceed amounts collected through BGS and MTC rates. As of
December 31, 2001, the accumulated deferred cost balance totaled approximately
 300 million, after giving effect to the reduction discussed below. The Final
Order provided for the ability to securitize stranded costs associated with the
divested Oyster Creek Nuclear Generation Station. In February 2002, the Company
received NJBPU authorization to issue 320 million of transition bonds to
securitize the recovery of these costs. The NJBPU order also provides for a
usage-based non-bypassable transition bond charge and for the transfer of the
bondable transition property to another entity. The Company plans to sell
transition bonds in the second quarter of 2002, which will be recognized on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Final Order also allows for additional
securitization of the Company's deferred balance to the extent permitted by law
upon application by the Company and a determination by the NJBPU that the
conditions of the New Jersey restructuring legislation are met. There can be no
assurance as to the extent, if any, that the NJBPU will permit such
securitization.

 In June 2001, the four incumbent New Jersey electric distribution
companies, including the Company, filed a joint proposal seeking NJBPU approval
of a competitive bidding process to procure supply for the provision of BGS for
the period August 1, 2002 through July 31, 2003. In December 2001, the NJBPU
authorized the auctioning of BGS to meet

 15

the electric demands of all customers who have not selected an alternative
supplier. BGS for all four companies, for the period August 1, 2002 to July 31,
2003, was simultaneously put out for bid. The auction, which ended on February
13, 2002 and was approved by the NJBPU on February 15, 2002, removed the
Company's BGS obligation of 5,100 megawatts for the period from August 1, 2002
to July 31, 2003. The auction represents a transitional mechanism and a
different model for the procurement of BGS commencing August 1, 2003 may be
adopted.

 On September 26, 2001, the NJBPU approved the merger between FirstEnergy
and GPU, (see Note 2 - Merger) subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
a Stipulation of Settlement which had been signed by the major parties in the
merger discussions. Under this Stipulation of Settlement, FirstEnergy agreed to
reduce the Company's regulatory assets by 300 million, in order to ensure that
customers receive the benefit of future merger savings. The Company wrote off
 300 million of its deferred costs upon receipt of the final regulatory approval
for the merger, which occurred on October 29, 2001.

 The application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," was
discontinued in 1999 with respect to the Company's generation operations. The
Company subsequently divested substantially all of its generating assets. The
Securities and Exchange Commission issued interpretive guidance regarding asset
impairment measurement, concluding that any supplemental regulated cash flows
such as a Competitive Transition Charge should be excluded from the cash flows
of assets in a portion of the business not subject to regulatory accounting
practices. If those assets are impaired, a regulatory asset should be
established if the costs are recoverable through regulatory cash flows. Net
assets included in utility plant relating to the operations for which the
application of SFAS 71 was discontinued were 46 million as of December 31,
2001. All of the Company's regulatory assets are expected to continue to be
recovered under provisions of the Company's regulatory orders.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT-

 As a result of the merger, certain of the Company's property, plant
and equipment have been adjusted to reflect fair value. The majority of the
Company's property, plant and equipment is reflected at original cost since
such assets remain subject to rate regulation on a historical cost basis. In
addition to its wholly owned facilities, the Company holds a 50 ownership
interest in Yards Creek Pumped Storage Facility, and its net book value was
approximately 21.5 million as of December 31, 2001.

 The Company provides for depreciation on a straight-line basis at
various rates over the estimated lives of property included in plant in service.
The annualized composite rate was approximately 3.4 in 2001, 3.3 in 2000 and
2.9 in 1999.

 Annual depreciation expense in 2001 included approximately 27.1 million
for future decommissioning costs applicable to the Company's ownership in Unit 2
of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Plant (TMI-2), a demonstration nuclear reactor
owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (in conjunction with Met-Ed
and Penelec) and decommissioning liabilities for its previously divested nuclear
generating units. The Company's share of the future obligation to decommission
these units is approximately 130.1 million in current dollars and (using a 4.0 
escalation rate) approximately 214.1 million in future dollars. The estimated
obligation and the escalation rate were developed based on site specific
studies. Decommissioning of the demonstration nuclear reactor is expected to be
completed in 2003; payments for decommissioning of TMI-2 are expected to begin
in 2014, when actual decommissioning work is expected to begin. The Company has
recovered approximately 33 million for decommissioning through its electric
rates from customers through December 31, 2001. The Company has also recognized
an estimated liability of approximately 12.1 million related to decontamination
and decommissioning of nuclear enrichment facilities operated by the United
States Department of Energy, as required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

 In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The new statement
provides accounting treatment for retirement obligations associated with
tangible long-lived assets with adoption required as of January 1, 2003. SFAS
143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred. The associated
asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset. Over time the capitalized costs are depreciated and the
present value of the asset retirement liability increases, resulting in a period
expense. Upon retirement, a gain or loss will be recorded if the costs to settle
the retirement obligation differs from the carrying amount. Under the new
standard, additional assets and liabilities relating principally to nuclear
decommissioning obligations will be recorded, the pattern of expense recognition
will change and income from the external decommissioning trusts will be recorded
as investment income. The Company is currently assessing the new standard and
has not yet quantified the impact on its financial statements.

INCOME TAXES-

 Details of the total provision for income taxes are shown on the
Consolidated Statements of Taxes. Deferred income taxes result from timing
differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and accounting
purposes. Investment tax credits, which were deferred when utilized, are being
amortized over the recovery period of the related property. The liability method
is used to account for deferred income taxes. Deferred income tax liabilities
related

 16

to tax and accounting basis differences are recognized at the statutory income
tax rates in effect when the liabilities are expected to be paid. Results for
the period January 1, 2001 through November 6, 2001 are included in the final
consolidated federal income tax return of GPU, and results for the period
November 7, 2001 through December 31, 2001 are included in FirstEnergy's 2001
consolidated federal income tax return. In both cases, the consolidated tax
liability is allocated on a "stand-alone" company basis, with the Company
recognizing the tax benefit for any tax losses or credits it contributed to the
consolidated return.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS-

 Effective December 31, 2001, the Company's defined benefit pension
plan was merged into FirstEnergy's defined benefit pension plan. FirstEnergy's
trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covers almost all of the
Company's full-time employees. Upon retirement, employees receive a monthly
pension based on length of service and compensation. On December 31, 2001, the
GPU pension plans were merged with the FirstEnergy plan. FirstEnergy uses the
projected unit credit method for funding purposes. The assets of the pension
plan consist primarily of common stocks, United States government bonds and
corporate bonds. The FirstEnergy and GPU postretirement benefit plans are
currently separately maintained; the information shown below is aggregated as of
December 31, 2001. Costs for the year 2001 include the former GPU companies'
pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the period November 7, 2001
through December 31, 2001.

 The Company provides a minimum amount of noncontributory life insurance
to retired employees in addition to optional contributory insurance. Health care
benefits, which include certain employee deductibles and copayments, are also
available to retired employees, their dependents and, under certain
circumstances, their survivors. The Company pays insurance premiums to cover a
portion of these benefits in excess of set limits; all amounts up to the limits
are paid by the Company. The Company recognizes the expected cost of providing
other postretirement benefits to employees and their beneficiaries and covered
dependents from the time employees are hired until they become eligible to
receive those benefits.

 The following sets forth the funded status of the plans and amounts
recognized on FirstEnergy's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2001:

 The composite health care trend rate assumption is approximately 10 in
2002, 9 in 2003 and 8 in 2004, trending to 4 -6 in later years. Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported
for the health care plan. An increase in the health care trend rate assumption
by one percentage point would increase FirstEnergy's total service and interest
cost components by 14.6 million and the postretirement benefit obligation by
 151.2 million. A decrease in the same assumption by one percentage point would
decrease the total service and interest cost components by 12.7 million and the
postretirement benefit obligation by 131.3 million.

Pre-Merger

 As of December 31, 2000, the Company's balance sheet included accrued
benefit costs of 1.8 million and 0.1 million, respectively, related to pension
and other postretirement benefit obligations. In addition, for the year ended
December 31, 2000, the Company recognized in income net benefit costs/(credits)
of (0.5) million and 0.04 million, respectively, for pension and other
postretirement benefits, and for the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company
recognized net benefit costs/(credits) of 0.2 million and 0.05 million,
respectively.

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES-

 During the three years ended December 31, 2001, GPU Service, Inc., an
affiliated company, provided legal, accounting, financial and other services to
the Company. In addition, prior to the sales of the Company's generating assets
in 2000 and 1999, affiliated companies GPU Nuclear, Inc. and GPU Generation,
Inc. conducted generation operations for the company. The total cost of services
rendered by affiliates was 279 million, 464 million and 580 million for the
years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Of these amounts, 141 million, 259
million and 393 million were charged to income for the years 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively.

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOWS INFORMATION-

 All temporary cash investments purchased with an initial maturity of
three months or less are reported as cash equivalents on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at cost, which approximates their fair market value.

 All borrowings with initial maturities of less than one year are defined
as financial instruments under GAAP and are reported on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets at cost, which approximates their fair market value. The following sets
forth the approximate fair value and related carrying amounts of all other
long-term debt, preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption and investments
other than cash and cash equivalents as of December 31:

 2001 2000
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair
 Value Value Value Value
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 (In millions)
 Long-term debt.......... 1,246 1,250 1,134 1,125
 Preferred stock......... 176 180 187 188
 Investments other
 than cash and
 cash equivalents...... 253 252 243 243
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 1,675 1,682 1,564 1,556
 ===================================================================

The fair values of long-term debt and preferred stock reflect the
present value of the cash outflows relating to those securities based on the
current call price, the yield to maturity or the yield to call, as deemed
appropriate at the end of each respective year. The yields assumed were based on
securities with similar characteristics offered by corporations with credit
ratings similar to the Company's ratings. Long-term debt and preferred stock
subject to mandatory redemption were recognized at fair value in connection with
the merger.

 The fair value of investments other than cash and cash equivalents
represent cost (which approximates fair value) or the present value of the cash
inflows based on the yield to maturity. The yields assumed were based on

 18

financial instruments with similar characteristics and terms. Investments other
than cash and cash equivalents include decommissioning trust investments.
Unrealized gains and losses applicable to the decommissioning trusts have been
recognized in the trust investment with a corresponding change to the
decommissioning liability. The Company has no securities held for trading
purposes.

 On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS 138,
"Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities --
an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133." The adoption resulted in the
recognition of derivative assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January
1, 2001 in the amount of 21.8 million with offsetting amounts, net of tax,
recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, of 5.1 million, and in
Regulatory Assets, of 13 million.

 The Company is exposed to financial risks resulting from the fluctuation
of commodity prices, including electricity and natural gas. To manage the
volatility relating to these exposures, the Company uses a variety of derivative
instruments, including forward contracts, options and futures contracts. These
derivatives are used principally for hedging purposes. FirstEnergy has a Risk
Policy Committee comprised of executive officers, which exercises an independent
risk oversight function to ensure compliance with corporate risk management
policies and prudent risk management practices.

 The Company uses derivatives to hedge the risk of price fluctuations.
The Company's primary ongoing hedging activity involves cash flow hedges of
electricity and natural gas purchases. The majority of the Company's forward
commodity contracts are considered "normal purchases and sales," as defined by
SFAS 138, and are therefore excluded from the scope of SFAS 138. The forward
contracts, options and futures contracts determined to be within the scope of
SFAS 133 are accounted for as cash flow hedges and expire on various dates
through 2002. Gains and losses from hedges of commodity price risks are included
in net income when the underlying hedged commodities are delivered. There is
currently a net deferred loss of 0.5 million included in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Loss as of December 31, 2001 related to derivative hedging
activity, which will be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months
as hedged transactions occur.

REGULATORY ASSETS-

 The Company recognizes, as regulatory assets, costs which the FERC and
NJBPU have authorized for recovery from customers in future periods. Without
such authorization, the costs would have been charged to income as incurred. All
regulatory assets are expected to continue to be recovered from customers under
the Company's regulatory plan. The Company continues to bill and collect
cost-based rates for its transmission and distribution services, which remain
regulated; accordingly, it is appropriate that the Company continues the
application of SFAS 71 to those operations.

 Net regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are comprised
of the following:

 2001 2000
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 (In millions)

 Regulatory transition charge......... 2,844.7 2,592.7
 Societal benefits charge............. 166.6 206.6
 Property losses and unrecovered
 plant costs........................ 104.1 119.2
 Customer receivables for
 future income taxes................ 52.4 87.6
 Employee postretirement
 benefit costs...................... 36.5 39.8
 Loss on reacquired debt.............. 19.3 21.3
 Spent fuel disposal costs............ 20.2 26.1
 Other................................ 81.0 91.8
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total 3,324.8 3,185.1
 ===================================================================

2. MERGER:

 On November 7, 2001, the merger of FirstEnergy and GPU became effective
pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 8, 2000. As a result
of the merger, GPU's former wholly owned subsidiaries, including the Company,
became wholly owned subsidiaries of FirstEnergy.

 The merger was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. The
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair values
as determined by FirstEnergy's management based on information currently
available and on current assumptions as to future operations. Merger purchase
accounting adjustments recorded in the records of the Company primarily consist
of: (1) revaluation of certain property, plant and equipment; (2) adjusting
preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption and long-term debt to estimated
fair value; (3) recognizing additional obligations related to retirement
benefits; and (4) recognizing estimated severance and other compensation
liabilities. Other assets and liabilities were not adjusted since they remain
subject to rate regulation on a historical cost

 19

basis. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill, which will
not be amortized but will be reviewed for impairment at least annually. As of
December 31, 2001, the Company had recorded goodwill of approximately 1.9
billion related to the merger.

3. LEASES:

 Consistent with regulatory treatment, the rentals for capital and
operating leases are charged to operating expenses on the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Prior to the sale of its nuclear generating facilities
(completed in 2000), the Company's capital lease obligations related primarily
to nuclear fuel lease agreements with nonaffiliated fuel trusts for the plants.
In 2000, total rentals related to these capital leases were 13.0 million,
comprised of an interest element of 1.5 million and other costs of 11.5
million. The Company's most significant operating lease relates to the sale and
leaseback of a portion of its ownership interest in the Merrill Creek Reservoir
project. The interest element related to this lease was 1.2 million and 0.4
million for the years 2001 and 2000, respectively.

 As of December 31, 2001, the future minimum lease payments on the
Company's Merrill Creek operating lease, net of reimbursements from sublessees,
are: 2.3 million, 3.8 million, 1.8 million, 2.3 million and 2.2 million for
the years 2002 through 2006, and 73.4 million for the years thereafter. The
Company is recovering its Merrill Creek lease payments, net of reimbursements,
through distribution rates.

4. CAPITALIZATION:

 (A) RETAINED EARNINGS-

 The merger purchase accounting adjustments included resetting the
retained earnings balance to zero as of the November 7, 2001 merger date.

 In general, the Company's first mortgage bond (FMB) indentures restrict
the payment of dividends or distributions on or with respect to the Company's
common stock to amounts credited to earned surplus since approximately the date
of its indenture. At such date, the Company had a balance of 1.7 million in its
earned surplus account, which would not be available for dividends or other
distributions. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had retained earnings
available to pay common stock dividends of 27.6 million, net of amounts
restricted under the Company's FMB indentures.

(B) PREFERRED AND PREFERENCE STOCK-

 The Company's 7.52 Series K of preferred stock has a restriction which
prevents early redemption prior to June 2002. All other preferred stock may be
redeemed by the Company, in whole or in part, with 30-90 days' notice.

(C) PREFERRED STOCK SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION-

 Annual sinking fund provisions for the Company's preferred stock are as
follows:

 Redemption
 Price Per
 Series Shares Share
 -------------------------------------
 8.65 J 83,333 100
 7.52 K 25,000 100
 -------------------------------------

 Annual sinking fund requirements for the next five years are 10.8
million in each year 2002 through 2004, and 2.5 million in each year 2005 and
2006.

(D) COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF
 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP HOLDING SOLELY COMPANY SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES-

 JCP&L Capital, L.P. is a special-purpose limited partnership in which a
subsidiary of the Company is the sole general partner. The limited partnership
invested the gross proceeds from the sale of 125.0 million at 8.56 of monthly
income preferred securities (MIPS) in 128.9 million of the Company's 8.56 
subordinated debentures. The sole assets of the limited partnership are these
subordinated debentures, which have the same rate and maturity date as the
preferred securities. The Company has effectively provided a full and
unconditional guarantee of its obligations under its limited partnership's MIPS,
to the extent that there is sufficient cash on hand to permit such payments and
funds legally available therefor, and payments on liquidation or redemption with
respect to the MIPS. Distributions on the limited partnership's MIPS (and
interest on the subordinated debentures) may be deferred for up to 60 months,
but the Company may not pay dividends on, or redeem or acquire, any of its
cumulative preferred or common stock until

 20

deferred payments on its subordinated debentures are paid in full. The limited
partnership's MIPS, which mature in 2044 and have a liquidation value of 25.00
per security, are redeemable at the option of the Company at 100 of their
principal amount.

(E) LONG-TERM DEBT-

 The first mortgage indentures and their supplements, which secure all of
the Company's FMBs, serve as direct first mortgage liens on substantially all
property and franchises, other than specifically excepted property, owned by the
Company.

 Based on the amount of bonds authenticated by the Trustee through
December 31, 2001, the Company's annual sinking and improvement fund
requirements for all bonds issued under the mortgage amount to 16.1 million.
The Company expects to fulfill its sinking and improvement fund obligation by
providing retired bonds to the Trustee.

 Sinking fund requirements for FMBs and maturing long-term debt
(excluding capital leases) for the next five years are:

 (In millions)
 -----------------------
 2002........ 50.0
 2003........ 150.0
 2004........ 160.3
 2005........ 50.3
 2006........ 240.3
 ------------------------

 (F) COMPREHENSIVE INCOME-

 Comprehensive income includes net income as reported on the Consolidated
Statements of Income and all other changes in common stockholder's equity except
those resulting from transactions with the Company's parent. As of December 31,
2001, accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of unrealized losses on
derivative instrument hedges of 0.5 million.

5. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS:

 The Company may borrow from its affiliates on a short-term basis. As of
December 31, 2001, the Company had total short-term borrowings of 18.1 million
from its affiliates with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.9 .

6. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES:

 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES-

 The Company's current forecast reflects expenditures of approximately
 572 million for property additions and improvements from 2002-2006, of which
approximately 144 million is applicable to 2002.

NUCLEAR INSURANCE-

 The Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability relative to a single
incident at a nuclear power plant to 9.5 billion. The amount is covered by a
combination of private insurance and an industry retrospective rating plan.
Based on its present ownership interest in TMI-2, the Company is exempt from any
potential assessment under the industry retrospective rating plan.

 The Company is also insured as to its interest in TMI-2 under a policy
issued to the operating company for the plant. Under this policy, 150 million
is provided for property damage and decontamination and decommissioning costs.
Under this policy, the Company can be assessed a maximum of approximately 0.2
million for incidents at any covered nuclear facility occurring during a policy
year which are in excess of accumulated funds available to the insurer for
paying losses.

 The Company intends to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as
described above as long as it is available. To the extent that property damage,
decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement costs and other such
costs arising from a nuclear incident at TMI-2 exceed the policy limits of the
insurance in effect with respect to that plant, to the extent a nuclear incident
is determined not to be covered by the Company's insurance policies, or to the
extent such insurance becomes unavailable in the future, the Company would
remain at risk for such costs.

 21

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS-

 Various environmental liabilities have been recognized on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2001, based on estimates of the
total costs of cleanup, the Company's proportionate responsibility for such
costs and the financial ability of other nonaffiliated entities to pay. The
Company has been named as a "potentially responsible party" (PRP) at waste
disposal sites which may require cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of disposal of
hazardous substances at historical sites, and the liability involved, are often
unsubstantiated and subject to dispute. Federal law provides that all PRPs for a
particular site be held liable on a joint and several basis. In addition, the
Company has accrued liabilities for environmental remediation of former
manufactured gas plants in New Jersey; these costs are being recovered through a
non-bypassable societal benefits charge. The Company has total accrued
liabilities aggregating approximately 52 million as of December 31, 2001. The
Company does not believe environmental remediation costs will have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS-

 Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to the Company's normal
business operations are pending against the Company, the most significant of
which are described below.

 TMI-2, which was damaged during a 1979 accident, is jointly owned by the
Company, Met-Ed and Penelec, with the Company having a 25 ownership percentage.
Claims for alleged personal injury against the Company, Met-Ed, Penelec and GPU
(the defendants) were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District
of Pennsylvania. In 1996, the District Court granted a motion for summary
judgment filed by the defendants and dismissed the ten initial "test cases"
which had been selected for a test case trial, as well as all of the remaining
2,100 pending claims. In November 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit affirmed the District Court's dismissal of the ten "test cases," but set
aside the dismissal of the additional pending claims, remanding them to the
District Court for further proceedings. In September 2000, the defendants filed
for a summary judgment in the District Court. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs appealed
to the Third Circuit for a review of the District Court's decision placing
limitations on the remaining plaintiffs' suit. In April 2001, the Third Circuit
affirmed the District Court's decision. In July 2001, the defendants renewed
their motion for a summary judgment on the remaining 2,100 claims in the
District Court. On January 15, 2002, the District Court granted the defendants'
amended motion for summary judgment. On February 14, 2002, plaintiffs filed a
notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In
addition to the approximately 2,100 claims for which summary judgment has been
granted, there is other pending litigation arising out of the TMI-2 accident.
This litigation consists of the following: eight personal injury cases that were
not consolidated with the above-referenced approximately 2,100 claims; two class
actions brought on behalf of plaintiffs alleging additional injuries diagnosed
after the filing of the complaints in the above-referenced case; a case alleging
exposure during the post-accident cleanup of the TMI-2 plant; and claims by
individual businesses for economic loss resulting from the TMI-2 accident.
Although unable to predict the outcome of this litigation, the Company believes
that any liability to which it might be subject by reason of the TMI-2 accident
will not exceed its financial protection under the Price-Anderson Act.

 In July 1999, the Mid-Atlantic states experienced a severe heat storm
which resulted in power outages throughout the service territories of many
electric utilities, including the Company's territory. In an investigation into
the causes of the outages and the reliability of the transmission and
distribution systems of all four New Jersey electric utilities, the NJBPU
concluded that there was not a prima facie case demonstrating that, overall, the
Company provided unsafe, inadequate or improper service to its customers. In
July 1999, two class action lawsuits (subsequently consolidated into a single
proceeding) were filed against the Company and other GPU companies in New Jersey
Superior Court, seeking compensatory and punitive damages arising from the July
1999 service interruptions in the Company's service territory. In May 2001, the
court denied without prejudice the Company's motion seeking decertification of
the class. Discovery continues in the class action, but no trial date has been
set. The judge has set a schedule under which factual legal discovery would
conclude in March 2002, and expert reports would be exchanged by June 2002. In
October 2001, the court held argument on the plaintiffs' motion for partial
summary judgment, which contends that the Company is bound to several findings
of the NJBPU investigation. The plaintiffs' motion was denied by the Court in
November 2001 and plaintiffs' motion to file an appeal of this decision was
denied by the New Jersey Appellate Division. The Company has also filed a motion
for partial summary judgement that is currently pending before the Superior
Court. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters.

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Jersey Central Power & Light Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and consolidated
statement of capitalization of Jersey Central Power & Light Company (a New
Jersey corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp.) and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 (post-merger), and the related consolidated
statements of income, common stockholder's equity, preferred stock, cash flows
and taxes for the period from January 1, 2001 to November 6, 2001 (pre-merger)
and the period from November 7, 2001 to December 31, 2001 (post-merger). These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit. The financial statements of Jersey Central Power & Light Company and
subsidiary as of December 31, 2000 and for each of the two years in the period
ended December 31, 2000 (pre-merger), were audited by other auditors whose
report dated January 31, 2001, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
statements.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the 2001 financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Jersey Central Power & Light
Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 (post-merger), and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for the period from January 1, 2001 to
November 6, 2001 (pre-merger) and the period from November 7, 2001 to December
31, 2001 (post-merger), in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

METROPOLITAN EDISON COMPANY

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of
 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

This discussion includes forward-looking statements based on information
currently available to management that is subject to certain risks and
uncertainties. Such statements typically contain, but are not limited to, the
terms anticipate, potential, expect, believe, estimate and similar words. Actual
results may differ materially due to the speed and nature of increased
competition and deregulation in the electric utility industry, economic or
weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changes in markets for
energy services, changing energy and commodity market prices, legislative and
regulatory changes (including revised environmental requirements), the
availability and cost of capital, ability to accomplish or realize anticipated
benefits from strategic initiatives and other similar factors.

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

 Earnings on common stock decreased 6.0 to 77.0 million in 2001 from
 81.9 million in 2000. Results in 2001 were unfavorably affected by higher other
operating costs and slightly higher net interest charges partially offset by
greater operating revenues. In 2000, earnings on common stock decreased 13.4 to
 81.9 million from 94.5 million in 1999 primarily due to lower operating
revenues and greater purchased power costs, partially offset by lower nuclear
and other operating costs and net interest charges.

 Operating revenues increased by 126.0 million in 2001 following a 60.5
million decrease in 2000. The sources of changes in operating revenues during
2001 and 2000, as compared to the prior year, are summarized in the following
table.

 Sources of Revenue Changes 2001 2000
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 Increase (Decrease) (In millions)

 Change in kilowatt-hour sales due
 to level of retail customers
 shopping for generation service.......... 142.6 0.6
 Increase in other retail
 kilowatt-hour sales...................... 8.2 32.1
 Decrease in wholesale sales................ (9.4) (92.9)
 All other changes.......................... (15.4) (0.3)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 Net Increase (Decrease) in
 Operating Revenues....................... 126.0 (60.5)
 ===============================================================

Electric Sales

 In 2001, a major source of the increase in operating revenues was the
increase in retail generation kilowatt-hour sales due to a large number of
customers returning to us in 2001 as full service customers, after receiving
their power from alternate suppliers in 2000. In 2001, 83.5 of total retail
sales were to full service customers as compared to 57.5 in 2000. Total retail
sales were relatively flat, with increases in residential and commercial sales
being offset by a decrease in industrial sales.

 The primary source of the decrease in operating revenues in 2000,
compared to the prior year, was lower sales to the wholesale market, as a result
of us having additional power available in 1999 due to the delay of the
divestiture of our generating assets. Partially offsetting that decrease were
higher residential, commercial and industrial sales, all due to greater usage.
The number of residential and commercial customers also increased in 2000 over
1999. Changes in kilowatt-hour sales by customer class in 2001 and 2000 are
summarized in the following table:

 Changes in Kilowatt-hour Sales 2001 2000
 -------------------------------------------------
 Increase (Decrease)

 Residential.................. 2.9 2.6 
 Commercial................... 4.2 6.0 
 Industrial................... (5.5) 8.0 
 --------------------------------------------------

 Total Retail................. 0.3 4.9 
 Wholesale.................... (40.5) (53.9) 
 --------------------------------------------------

 Total Sales.................. (5.6) (11.5)

Operating Expenses and Taxes

 Total operating expenses and taxes increased 141.6 million in 2001
after decreasing 40.9 million in 2000, compared to the preceding year. An
increase in purchased power and other operating costs accounted for the majority
of the increase in 2001. Purchased power costs also increased significantly in
2000 compared to 1999, but were partially offset by lower nuclear and other
operating costs.

 Purchased power costs increased 91.2 million in 2001 compared to 2000.
The change was due to increased amounts of power purchased through two-party
agreements and the PJM Power Pool to meet higher demand resulting from customers
returning to us in 2001 after receiving their power from alternate suppliers in
2000. The average price of power under the two-party agreements was also higher
in 2001 than it was in 2000. Offsetting these increases was the effect of the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission's (PPUC) June 2001 order that allowed us
to defer, for future recovery from customers, energy costs in excess of our
fixed generation tariff rates, retroactive to January 1, 2001, in connection
with our provider of last resort (PLR) obligation.

 In 2000, fuel and purchased power costs increased 246.1 million over
1999. Much of the increase was due to the need to purchase substantially all of
our energy requirements following the sales of generating assets in 1999, and
the absence of deferred accounting treatment for these costs. An offsetting
decrease in fuel costs also resulted from the sales of generating assets. The
sale of Unit 1 of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Plant, completed in December
1999, eliminated essentially all of our nuclear operating costs in 2000.

 Other operating costs increased 47.8 million in 2001 as compared to the
prior year. The majority of the increase was due to the absence in 2001 of a
pension curtailment gain associated with employees who were terminated at the
time of the sale of our generating assets. This gain was realized in 2000 as a
result of the PPUC's Phase II Order. Other operating costs also increased due to
costs related to Voluntary Enhanced Retirement Programs offered to certain
bargaining unit employees. In 2000, other operating costs decreased 183.3
million from 1999. The reason for the decline was a reduction in expenses
associated with the operation of generating stations due to the sale of
essentially all of our remaining generating assets in 1999. Operating costs were
also reduced by the pension curtailment gain discussed above. The sale of
generating assets in 1999 was also the cause for a decrease in depreciation
expense of 20.3 million in 2000 from the previous year.

Other Income

 Other income increased by 11.9 million in 2001 compared to the
previous year. The increase was due to higher competitive transition charge
interest income and the absence in 2001 of the write-down of regulatory assets
for Unit 2 of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Plant (TMI-2) decommissioning,
representing the net realized gain previously recorded on the accident-related
portion of the TMI-2 decommissioning trust. Offsetting these increases was a
charge for a sustainable energy fund in accordance with the Stipulation of
Settlement related to the merger of FirstEnergy and GPU, Inc.

Net Interest Charges

 Net interest charges increased by 1.2 million in 2001 after decreasing
 6.1 million in 2000 compared to the prior year. In 2001, the increase was due
to the September issuance of 100 million of senior notes. In 2000, lower
interest charges were due to the redemption of 50 million of first mortgage
bonds (FMB) in 2000, and the redemption of 100 million of company obligated
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in 1999. Partially offsetting these
reductions were increased preferred dividends associated with the issuance of
 100 million of company obligated preferred securities in 1999.

Capital Resources and Liquidity
- -------------------------------

 We had approximately 25.3 million of cash and temporary investments and
 72 million of short-term indebtedness on December 31, 2001. We may borrow from
our affiliates on a short-term basis. We will not issue FMBs other than as
collateral for senior notes, since our senior note indentures prohibit (subject
to certain exceptions) us from issuing any debt which is senior to the senior
notes. As of December 31, 2001, we had the capability to issue 88 million of
additional senior notes based upon FMB collateral. We have no restrictions on
the issuance of preferred stock.

 At the end of 2001, our common equity as a percentage of capitalization
stood at 66 compared to 47 at the end of 2000. This increase resulted from the
allocation of the purchase price in the merger between FirstEnergy and GPU.

 Following approval of the merger of FirstEnergy and GPU by the New
Jersey Board of Public Utilities on September 26, 2001, Standard and Poor's
adjusted our corporate credit rating from A/A-1 to BBB/A-2, and our senior

 3

secured debt rating from A+ to BBB+. The lower credit ratings reflect Standard &
Poor's consolidated rating methodology, which resulted in essentially the same
corporate credit rating for all of FirstEnergy's electric utility operating
companies. The credit rating outlook of Standard & Poor's is stable. On February
22, 2002, Moody's announced a change in its outlook for our credit ratings from
stable to negative based upon a decision by the Commonwealth Court of
Pennsylvania to reverse the PPUC's decision to grant us rate relief (see
Regulatory Matters).

 Our cash requirements in 2002 for operating expenses, construction
expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and preferred stock redemptions are
expected to be met without increasing our net debt and preferred stock
outstanding. Major contractual obligations for future cash payments are
summarized in the following table:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 396 318 197 211 316 1,760 3,198
==============================================================================

 Our capital spending for the period 2002-2006 is expected to be about
 323 million, of which approximately 66 million applies to 2002.

Market Risk Information
- -----------------------

 We use various market risk sensitive instruments, including derivative
contracts, primarily to manage the risk of price. Our Risk Policy Committee,
comprised of FirstEnergy executive officers, exercises an independent risk
oversight function to ensure compliance with corporate risk management policies
and prudent risk management practices.

Commodity Price Risk

 We are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in
electricity and natural gas prices. To manage the volatility relating to these
exposures, we use a variety of derivative instruments, including options and
futures contracts. These derivatives are used principally for hedging purposes.
The change in the fair value of commodity derivative contracts related to energy
production during 2001 is summarized in the table below:

 Increase (Decrease)in the Fair Value of Commodity Derivative Contracts

 Nov. 7 - Dec. 31 Jan. 1 - Nov. 6
 2001 2001
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 (In millions)

 contracts......................... (4.5) (2.9)
 Change in techniques/assumptions.... -- (21.3)
 Settled contracts................... (0.1) (0.4)
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 Outstanding as of end of period..... 2.3 6.6
 ===================================================================

While the valuation of derivative contracts is always based on active
market prices when they are available, longer-term contracts can require the use
of model-based estimates of prices in later years due to the absence of
published market prices. Currently, substantially all of our derivatives are
valued based on active market prices.

 We perform sensitivity analyses to estimate our exposure to the market
risk of our commodity position. A hypothetical 10 adverse shift in quoted
market prices in the near term on our derivative instruments would not have had
a material effect on our consolidated financial position or cash flows as of
December 31, 2001.

Interest Rate Risk

 Our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is reduced since a
significant portion of our debt has fixed interest rates, as noted in the table
below. We are subject to the inherent interest rate risks related to refinancing
maturing debt by issuing new debt securities. Changes in the market value of our
nuclear decommissioning trust funds are recognized by making corresponding
changes to the decommissioning liability, as described in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Outlook
- -------

 Our industry continues to transition to a more competitive environment.
As of January 1, 1999, our customers could select alternative energy
suppliers. We continue to deliver power to homes and businesses through our
existing distribution system, which remains regulated. The PPUC authorized our
rate restructuring plan, establishing separate charges for transmission,
distribution, generation and stranded cost recovery, which is recovered through
a competitive transition charge (CTC). Customers electing to obtain power from
an alternative supplier have their bills reduced based on the regulated
generation component, and the customers receive a generation charge from the
alternative supplier. We have a continuing responsibility to provide power to
those customers not choosing to receive power from an alternative energy
supplier, subject to certain limits, which is referred to as our PLR obligation.

Regulatory Matters

 In June 2001, we entered into a settlement agreement with major parties
in the combined merger and rate proceedings that, in addition to resolving
certain issues concerning the PPUC's approval of our merger with FirstEnergy,
also addressed our request for PLR relief. We are permitted to defer, for future
recovery, the difference between our actual energy costs and those reflected in
our capped generation rates. Those costs will continue to be deferred through
December 31, 2005. If energy costs incurred during that period are below our
capped generation rates, the difference would be used to reduce our recoverable
deferred costs. Our PLR obligation was extended through December 31, 2010. Our
CTC revenues will be applied first to PLR costs, then to stranded costs other
than for non-utility generation (NUG) and finally to NUG stranded costs through
December 31, 2010. We would be permitted to recover any remaining stranded costs
through a continuation of the CTC after December 31, 2010; however, such
recovery would extend to no later than December 31, 2015. Any amounts not
expected to be recovered by December 31, 2015 would be written off at the time
such nonrecovery becomes probable. Several parties had appealed this PPUC
decision to the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. On February 21, 2002, the
Court affirmed the PPUC decision regarding approval of the merger, remanding the
decision to the PPUC only with respect to the issue of merger savings. The Court
reversed the PPUC's decision regarding our PLR obligation, and denied our
related requests for rate relief. We are considering our response to the Court's
decision, which could include asking the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to review
the decision. We are unable to predict the outcome of these matters.

Supply Plan

 As part of our Restructuring Order, we are obligated to supply
electricity to customers who do not choose an alternate supplier. The total
forecasted peak of this obligation in 2002 is 2,500 megawatts (MW). Our current
supply portfolio contains approximately 300 MW of long-term purchases from NUGs,
and the remaining obligation is expected to be met through a mix of multi-year
forward purchases, short-term forward (less than one year) purchases and spot
market purchases.

Environmental Matters

 Various environmental liabilities have been recognized on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2001, based on estimates of the
total costs of cleanup, our proportionate responsibility for such costs and the
financial ability of other nonaffiliated entities to pay. We have been named as
a "potentially responsible party" (PRP) at waste disposal sites which may
require cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of disposal of hazardous substances at
historical sites, and the liability involved, are

 5

often unsubstantiated and subject to dispute. Federal law provides that all PRPs
for a particular site be held liable on a joint and several basis. We have total
accrued liabilities aggregating approximately 0.1 million as of December 31,
2001. We do not believe environmental remediation costs will have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

Legal Matters

 Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to our normal business
operations are pending against us, the most significant of which is described
below.

 We have a 50 ownership interest in TMI-2, which was damaged during a
1979 accident. As a result of the accident, claims for alleged personal injury
were filed against us, Jersey Central Power & Light Company, Pennsylvania
Electric Company and GPU in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of
Pennsylvania. In 1996, the District Court granted a motion for summary judgment
filed by the defendants and dismissed the ten initial "test cases" which had
been selected for a test case trial, as well as all of the remaining 2,100
pending claims. In November 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit affirmed the District Court's dismissal of the ten test cases, but set
aside the dismissal of the additional pending claims, remanding them to the
District Court for further proceedings. Following the resolution of judicial
proceedings dealing with admissible evidence, we have again requested summary
judgment of the remaining 2,100 claims in the District Court. On January 15,
2002, the District Court granted our motion. On February 14, 2002, the
plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of this decision (see Note 6 - Other Legal
Proceedings). Although unable to predict the outcome of this litigation, we
believe that any liability to which we might be subject by reason of the TMI-2
accident will not exceed our financial protection under the Price-Anderson Act.

Significant Accounting Policies
- -------------------------------

 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Application of
these principles often requires a high degree of judgment, estimates and
assumptions that affect our financial results. All of our assets are subject to
their own specific risks and uncertainties and are continually reviewed for
impairment. Assets related to the application of the policies discussed below
are similarly reviewed with their risks and uncertainties reflecting these
specific factors. Our more significant accounting policies are described below:

Purchase Accounting

 On November 7, 2001, the merger between FirstEnergy and GPU became
effective, and we became a wholly owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy. The merger
was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting, which requires judgment
regarding the allocation of the purchase price based on the fair values of the
assets acquired (including intangible assets) and the liabilities assumed. The
fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were based primarily
on estimates. The adjustments reflected in our records, which are subject to
adjustment in 2002 when finalized, primarily consist of: (1) revaluation of
certain property, plant and equipment; (2) adjusting preferred stock subject to
mandatory redemption and long-term debt to estimated fair value; (3) recognizing
additional obligations related to retirement benefits; and (4) recognizing
estimated severance and other compensation liabilities. The excess of the
purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill, which will be reviewed for
impairment at least annually. As of December 31, 2001, we had recorded goodwill
of approximately 784.4 million related to the merger.

Regulatory Accounting

 We are subject to regulation that sets the prices (rates) we are
permitted to charge our customers based on costs that the regulatory agencies
determine we are permitted to recover. At times, regulators permit the future
recovery through rates of costs that would be currently charged to expense by an
unregulated company. This rate-making process results in the recording of
regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash inflows. As a result of the
changing regulatory framework in Pennsylvania, a significant amount of
regulatory assets have been recorded. As of December 31, 2001, we had regulatory
assets of 1.3 billion. We continually review these assets to assess their
ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines. Impairment
risk associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislation,
judicial or regulatory actions in the future.

Derivative Accounting

 Determination of appropriate accounting for derivative transactions
requires the involvement of management representing operations, finance and risk
assessment. In order to determine the appropriate accounting for derivative
transactions, the provisions of the contract need to be carefully assessed in
accordance with the authoritative accounting literature and management's
intended use of the derivative. New authoritative guidance continues to shape
the application of derivative accounting. Management's expectations and
intentions are key factors in determining the

6

appropriate accounting for a derivative transaction and, as a result, such
expectations and intentions must be documented. Derivative contracts that are
determined to fall within the scope of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 133, as amended, must be recorded at their fair value.
Active market prices are not always available to determine the fair value of the
later years of a contract, requiring that various assumptions and estimates be
used in their valuation. We continually monitor our derivative contracts to
determine if our activities, expectations, intentions, assumptions and estimates
remain valid. As part of our normal operations we enter into commodities
contracts, which increase the impact of derivative accounting judgments.

Revenue Recognition

 We follow the accrual method of accounting for revenues, recognizing
revenue for kilowatt-hours that have been delivered but not yet billed through
the end of the year. The determination of unbilled revenues requires management
to make various estimates including:

 - Net energy purchased or generated for retail load
 - Losses of energy over distribution lines
 - Mix of kilowatt-hour usage by residential, commercial and industrial
 customers
 - Kilowatt-hour usage of customers receiving electricity from
 alternative suppliers

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
- ------------------------------------

 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approved SFAS 141,
"Business Combinations," and SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"
on June 29, 2001. SFAS 141 requires that all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using purchase accounting. The provisions
of the new standard relating to the determination of goodwill and other
intangible assets have been applied to our 2001 merger, which was accounted for
as a purchase transaction. Under SFAS 142, amortization of existing goodwill
will cease January 1, 2002. Instead, goodwill will be tested for impairment at
least on an annual basis, and no impairment of goodwill is anticipated as a
result of a preliminary analysis. We did not have any goodwill prior to our 2001
merger, and we did not amortize goodwill associated with the merger under the
provisions of the new standard.

 In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations." The new statement provides accounting standards for retirement
obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets, with adoption required
by January 1, 2003. SFAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an
asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred.
The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying
amount of the long-lived asset. Over time the capitalized costs are depreciated
and the present value of the asset retirement liability increases, resulting in
a period expense. Upon retirement, a gain or loss will be recorded if the cost
to settle the retirement obligation differs from the carrying amount. We are
currently assessing the new standard and have not yet determined the impact on
our financial statements.

 In September 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of." The Statement also supersedes the accounting and reporting
provisions of APB 30. Our adoption of this Statement, effective January 1, 2002,
will result in our accounting for any future impairments or disposals of
long-lived assets under the provisions of SFAS 144, but will not change the
accounting principles used in previous asset impairments or disposals.
Application of SFAS 144 is not anticipated to have a major impact on accounting
for impairments or disposal transactions compared to the prior application of
SFAS 121 or APB 30.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

 The consolidated financial statements include Metropolitan Edison
Company (Company) and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company is a wholly owned
subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. FirstEnergy also holds directly all of the
issued and outstanding common shares of Ohio Edison Company (OE), The Cleveland
Electric Illuminating Company (CEI), The Toledo Edison Company (TE), American
Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI), Jersey Central Power & Light Company (JCP&L)
and Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec). The Company, JCP&L and Penelec were
formerly wholly owned subsidiaries of GPU, Inc., which merged with FirstEnergy
on November 7, 2001. Pre-merger period and post-merger period financial results
are separated by a heavy black line.

 The Company follows the accounting policies and practices prescribed by
the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC) and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(GAAP) requires management to make periodic estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ
from these estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform with the current year presentation.

 REVENUES-

 The Company's principal business is providing electric service to
customers in Pennsylvania. The Company's retail customers are metered on a cycle
basis. Revenue is recognized for unbilled electric service through the end of
the year.

 Receivables from customers include sales to residential, commercial and
industrial customers and sales to wholesale customers. There was no material
concentration of receivables as of December 31, 2001 or 2000, with respect to
any particular segment of the Company's customers.

 REGULATORY PLAN-

 Pennsylvania enacted its electric utility competition law in 1996 with the
phase-in of customer choice for generation suppliers completed as of January 1,
2001. The PPUC authorized a rate restructuring plan for the Company in 1998
which essentially resulted in the deregulation of the Company's generation
business. The Company has a continuing responsibility to provide power to those
customers not choosing to receive power from an alternative energy supplier,
subject to certain limits, which is referred to as the Company's provider of
last resort (PLR) obligation.

 In 2000, the PPUC disallowed a portion of the requested additional
stranded costs above those amounts granted in the Company's 1998 rate
restructuring plan order. The PPUC required the Company to seek an IRS ruling
regarding the return of certain unamortized investment tax credits and excess
deferred income tax benefits to ratepayers. If the IRS ruling ultimately
supports returning these tax benefits to ratepayers, the Company would then
reduce stranded costs by 12 million plus interest and record a corresponding
charge to income.

 As a result of its generating asset divestitures, the Company obtains
its supply of electricity to meet its PLR obligation almost entirely from
contracted and open market purchases. During 2000, the Company's purchased power
costs substantially exceeded the amounts it could recover under its capped
generation rates, which are in effect for varying periods, pursuant to its 1998
rate restructuring plan. In November 2000, the Company filed a petition with the
PPUC seeking permission to defer for future recovery its energy costs in excess
of amounts reflected in its capped generation rates. In January 2001, the PPUC
consolidated this petition with the FirstEnergy and GPU merger proceeding (see
Note 2 - Merger) for consideration and resolution in accordance with the merger
procedural schedule.

 In June 2001, the Company entered into a Settlement Stipulation with all
of the major parties in the combined merger and rate relief proceedings, that,
in addition to resolving certain issues concerning the PPUC's approval of the
merger, also addressed the Company's request for PLR relief. On June 20, 2001,
the PPUC entered orders approving the Settlement Stipulation, which approved the
merger and provided PLR relief. The Company is permitted to defer for future
recovery the difference between its actual energy costs and those reflected in
its capped generation rates, retroactive to January 1, 2001. Deferral accounting
will continue for such cost differences through December 31, 2005 and, should
energy costs incurred by the Company during that period be below its capped
generation rates, the difference would be used to reduce its recoverable
deferred costs. The Company's PLR obligation has been extended through December
31, 2010. The Company's competitive transition charge (CTC) revenues will be
applied first to PLR costs, then to stranded costs other than for non-utility
generation (NUG) and finally to NUG stranded costs through December 31, 2010.
The Company would be permitted to recover any remaining stranded costs through a
continuation of the CTC after December 31, 2010; however, such recovery would
extend to no later than December 31, 2015. Any amounts not expected to be
recovered by December 31, 2015 would be written off at the time such nonrecovery
becomes probable.

 14

Several parties had filed Petitions for Review with the Commonwealth
Court of Pennsylvania regarding the PPUC's orders. On February 21, 2002, the
Court affirmed the PPUC decision regarding approval of the merger, remanding the
decision to the PPUC only with respect to the issue of merger savings. The Court
reversed the PPUC's decision regarding the Company's PLR obligation, and denied
the Company's related requests for rate relief. The Company is considering its
response to the Court's decision, which could include asking the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court to review the decision. The Company is unable to predict the
outcome of these matters.

 The application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," was
discontinued in 1998 with respect to the Company's generation operations. The
Company subsequently divested substantially all of its generating assets. The
Securities and Exchange Commission issued interpretive guidance regarding asset
impairment measurement, concluding that any supplemental regulated cash flows
such as a CTC should be excluded from the cash flows of assets in a portion of
the business not subject to regulatory accounting practices. If those assets are
impaired, a regulatory asset should be established if the costs are recoverable
through regulatory cash flows. Net assets included in utility plant relating to
the operations for which the application of SFAS 71 was discontinued were 18
million as of December 31, 2001. All of the Company's regulatory assets are
expected to continue to be recovered under provisions of the Company's
regulatory orders.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT-

 As a result of the merger, certain of the Company's property, plant
and equipment have been adjusted to reflect fair value. The majority of the
Company's property, plant and equipment is reflected at original cost since such
assets remain subject to rate regulation on a historical cost basis.

 The Company provides for depreciation on a straight-line basis at
various rates over the estimated lives of property included in plant in service.
The annualized composite rate was approximately 3.0 in 2001, 2.9 in 2000 and
3.0 in 1999.

 Annual depreciation expense in 2001 included approximately 11.1 million
for future decommissioning costs applicable to the Company's ownership in Unit 2
of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Plant (TMI-2), a demonstration nuclear reactor
owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (in conjunction with JCP&L and
Penelec) and decommissioning liabilities for its previously divested nuclear
generating units. The Company's share of the future obligation to decommission
these units is approximately 254.5 million in current dollars and (using a 4.0 
escalation rate) approximately 421.9 million in future dollars. The estimated
obligation and the escalation rate were developed based on site specific
studies. Decommissioning of the demonstration nuclear reactor is expected to be
completed in 2003; payments for decommissioning of TMI-2 are expected to begin
in 2014, when actual decommissioning work is expected to begin. The Company has
recovered approximately 54 million for decommissioning through its electric
rates from customers through December 31, 2001. The Company has also recognized
an estimated liability of approximately 4.6 million related to decontamination
and decommissioning of nuclear enrichment facilities operated by the United
States Department of Energy, as required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

 In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The new statement
provides accounting treatment for retirement obligations associated with
tangible long-lived assets with adoption required as of January 1, 2003. SFAS
143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred. The associated
asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset. Over time the capitalized costs are depreciated and the
present value of the asset retirement liability increases, resulting in a period
expense. Upon retirement, a gain or loss will be recorded if the costs to settle
the retirement obligation differs from the carrying amount. Under the new
standard, additional assets and liabilities relating principally to nuclear
decommissioning obligations will be recorded, the pattern of expense recognition
will change and income from the external decommissioning trusts will be recorded
as investment income. The Company is currently assessing the new standard and
has not yet quantified the impact on its financial statements.

INCOME TAXES-

 Details of the total provision for income taxes are shown on the
Consolidated Statements of Taxes. Deferred income taxes result from timing
differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and accounting
purposes. Investment tax credits, which were deferred when utilized, are being
amortized over the recovery period of the related property. The liability method
is used to account for deferred income taxes. Deferred income tax liabilities
related to tax and accounting basis differences are recognized at the statutory
income tax rates in effect when the liabilities are expected to be paid. Results
for the period January 1, 2001 through November 6, 2001 are included in the
final consolidated federal income tax return of GPU, and results for the period
November 7, 2001 through December 31, 2001 are included in FirstEnergy's 2001
consolidated federal income tax return. In both cases, the consolidated tax
liability is allocated on a "stand-alone" company basis, with the Company
recognizing the tax benefit for any tax losses or credits it contributed to the
consolidated return.

 15

RETIREMENT BENEFITS-

 Effective December 31, 2001, the Company's defined benefit pension
plan was merged into FirstEnergy's defined benefit pension plan. FirstEnergy's
trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covers almost all of the
Company's full-time employees. Upon retirement, employees receive a monthly
pension based on length of service and compensation. On December 31, 2001, the
GPU pension plans were merged with the FirstEnergy plan. FirstEnergy uses the
projected unit credit method for funding purposes. The assets of the pension
plan consist primarily of common stocks, United States government bonds and
corporate bonds. The FirstEnergy and GPU postretirement benefit plans are
currently separately maintained; the information shown below is aggregated as of
December 31, 2001. Costs for the year 2001 include the former GPU companies'
pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the period November 7, 2001
through December 31, 2001.

 The Company provides a minimum amount of noncontributory life insurance
to retired employees in addition to optional contributory insurance. Health care
benefits, which include certain employee deductibles and copayments, are also
available to retired employees, their dependents and, under certain
circumstances, their survivors. The Company pays insurance premiums to cover a
portion of these benefits in excess of set limits; all amounts up to the limits
are paid by the Company. The Company recognizes the expected cost of providing
other postretirement benefits to employees and their beneficiaries and covered
dependents from the time employees are hired until they become eligible to
receive those benefits.

 The following sets forth the funded status of the plans and amounts
recognized on FirstEnergy's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2001:

 Other
 Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits
 ---------------- -----------------------
 (In millions)

 ===========================================================================

 The composite health care trend rate assumption is approximately 10 in
2002, 9 in 2003 and 8 in 2004, trending to 4 -6 in later years. Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported

 16

for the health care plan. An increase in the health care trend rate assumption
by one percentage point would increase FirstEnergy's total service and interest
cost components by 14.6 million and the postretirement benefit obligation by
 151.2 million. A decrease in the same assumption by one percentage point would
decrease the total service and interest cost components by 12.7 million and the
postretirement benefit obligation by 131.3 million.

Pre-Merger

 As of December 31, 2000, the Company had on its balance sheet accrued
benefit costs of 0.9 million and 0.4 million, respectively, related to pension
and other postretirement benefit obligations. In addition, for the year ended
December 31, 2000, the Company recognized in income net benefit costs/(credits)
of 0.1 million and 0.2 million, respectively, for pension and other
postretirement benefits, and for the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company
recognized net benefit costs/(credits) of 0.2 million and 0.3 million,
respectively.

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES-

 During the three years ended December 31, 2001, GPU Service, Inc., an
affiliated company, provided legal, accounting, financial and other services to
the Company. In addition, prior to the sales of the Company's generating assets
in 1999, affiliated companies GPU Nuclear, Inc. and GPU Generation, Inc.
conducted generation operations for the company. The total cost of services
rendered by affiliates was 141 million, 99 million and 350 million for the
years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Of these amounts, 95 million, 77
million and 264 million were charged to income for the years 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively.

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOWS INFORMATION-

 All temporary cash investments purchased with an initial maturity of
three months or less are reported as cash equivalents on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at cost, which approximates their fair market value.

 All borrowings with initial maturities of less than one year are defined
as financial instruments under GAAP and are reported on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets at cost, which approximates their fair market value. The following sets
forth the approximate fair value and related carrying amounts of all other
long-term debt, preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption and investments
other than cash and cash equivalents as of December 31:

 2001 2000
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair
 Value Value Value Value
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 (In millions)
 Long-term debt................. 597 601 497 504
 Preferred stock................ 100 93 100 97
 Investments other than cash
 and cash equivalents........ 159 160 156 156
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 848 854 753 757
 =====================================================================

The fair values of long-term debt and preferred stock reflect the
present value of the cash outflows relating to those securities based on the
current call price, the yield to maturity or the yield to call, as deemed
appropriate at the end of each respective year. The yields assumed were based on
securities with similar characteristics offered by corporations with credit
ratings similar to the Company's ratings. Long-term debt and preferred stock
subject to mandatory redemption were recognized at fair value in connection with
the merger.

 The fair value of investments other than cash and cash equivalents
represent cost (which approximates fair value) or the present value of the cash
inflows based on the yield to maturity. The yields assumed were based on
financial instruments with similar characteristics and terms. Investments other
than cash and cash equivalents include decommissioning trust investments.
Unrealized gains and losses applicable to the decommissioning trusts have been
recognized in the trust investment with a corresponding change to the
decommissioning liability. The Company has no securities held for trading
purposes.

 On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS 138,
"Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities --
an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133." The adoption resulted in the
recognition of derivative assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 1,
2001 in the amount of 13.0 million, with a substantially offsetting amount
recorded in Regulatory Assets of 12.2 million. As of January 1, 2001, a
cumulative effect of accounting change was recognized as an expense in Other
Income (Deductions), Net on the Consolidated Statement of Income in the amount
of 0.1 million.

 17

The Company is exposed to financial risks resulting from the fluctuation
of commodity prices, including electricity and natural gas. To manage the
volatility relating to these exposures, the Company uses a variety of derivative
instruments, including options and futures contracts. These derivatives are used
principally for hedging purposes. FirstEnergy has a Risk Policy Committee
comprised of executive officers, which exercises an independent risk oversight
function to ensure compliance with corporate risk management policies and
prudent risk management practices.

 The Company uses derivatives to hedge the risk of price fluctuations.
The Company's primary ongoing hedging activity involves cash flow hedges of
electricity and natural gas purchases. The majority of the Company's forward
commodity contracts are considered "normal purchases and sales," as defined by
SFAS 133, and are therefore excluded from the scope of SFAS 138. The options and
futures contracts determined to be within the scope of SFAS 133 are accounted
for as cash flow hedges and expire on various dates through 2002. Gains and
losses from hedges of commodity price risks are included in net income when the
underlying hedged commodities are delivered. There is currently a net deferred
loss of 0.01 million included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss as of
December 31, 2001 related to derivative hedging activity, which will be
reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months as hedged transactions
occur.

 REGULATORY ASSETS-

 The Company recognizes, as regulatory assets, costs which the FERC and
PPUC have authorized for recovery from customers in future periods. Without such
authorization, the costs would have been charged to income as incurred. All
regulatory assets are expected to continue to be recovered from customers under
the Company's regulatory plan. The Company continues to bill and collect
cost-based rates for its transmission and distribution services, which remain
regulated; accordingly, it is appropriate that the Company continues the
application of SFAS 71 to those operations.

Net regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are comprised
of the following:

 2001 2000
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 (In millions)

 Regulatory transition charge................... 1,115.9 1,053.1
 Customer receivables for future income taxes... 110.9 114.5
 Nuclear decommissioning costs.................. 34.7 27.6
 Provider of last resort deferrals.............. 32.7 --
 Employee postretirement benefit costs.......... 21.4 23.4
 Loss on reacquired debt........................ 4.8 5.3
 Other.......................................... -- 0.5

 Total...................................... 1,320.4 1,224.4
 ======================================================================

2. MERGER:

 On November 7, 2001, the merger of FirstEnergy and GPU became effective
pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 8, 2000. As a result
of the merger, GPU's former wholly owned subsidiaries, including the Company,
became wholly owned subsidiaries of FirstEnergy.

 The merger was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. The
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair values
as determined by FirstEnergy's management based on information currently
available and on current assumptions as to future operations. Merger purchase
accounting adjustments recorded in the records of the Company primarily consist
of: (1) revaluation of certain property, plant and equipment; (2) adjusting
preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption and long-term debt to estimated
fair value; (3) recognizing additional obligations related to retirement
benefits; and (4) recognizing estimated severance and other compensation
liabilities. Other assets and liabilities were not adjusted since they remain
subject to rate regulation on a historical cost basis. The excess of the
purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill, which will not be amortized but
will be reviewed for impairment at least annually. As of December 31, 2001, the
Company had recorded goodwill of approximately 784.4 million related to the
merger.

3. LEASES:

 Consistent with regulatory treatment, the rentals for capital and
operating leases are charged to operating expenses on the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Prior to the sale of its nuclear generating facility in
December 1999, the Company's capital lease obligations related primarily to
nuclear fuel lease agreements with nonaffiliated fuel trusts for the plant. The
Company's most significant operating lease relates to the sale and leaseback of
a portion of its ownership interest in the Merrill Creek Reservoir project. The
interest element related to this lease was 1.9 million for the years 2001 and
2000.

 18

As of December 31, 2001, the future minimum lease payments on the
Company's Merrill Creek operating lease, net of reimbursements from sublessees,
are: 0.4 million in 2002, 1.3 million in 2003, zero in 2004, 0.2 million in
2005 and in 2006, and 15.0 million for the years thereafter. The Company's
Merrill Creek lease payments were offset against the actual net divestiture
proceeds received from the 1999 sales of its generating assets.

4. CAPITALIZATION:

 (A) RETAINED EARNINGS-

 The merger purchase accounting adjustments included resetting the
retained earnings balance to zero at the November 7, 2001 merger date.

 In general, the Company's first mortgage bond (FMB) indentures restrict
the payment of dividends or distributions on or with respect to the Company's
common stock to amounts credited to earned surplus since approximately the date
of its indenture. At such date, the Company had a balance of 3.4 million in its
earned surplus account, which would not be available for dividends or other
distributions. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had retained earnings
available to pay common stock dividends of 11.2 million, net of amounts
restricted under the Company's FMB indentures.

(B) PREFERRED AND PREFERENCE STOCK-

 The Company's preferred stock authorization consists of 10 million
shares without par value. No preferred shares are currently outstanding.

(C) COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES OF
 SUBSIDIARY TRUST HOLDING SOLELY PARTNERSHIP PREFERRED SECURITIES-

 The Company has formed a statutory business trust, Met-Ed Capital Trust,
which is owned through a wholly-owned limited partnership of the Company, Met-Ed
Capital II, L.P., of which a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company is the sole
general partner. In this transaction, Met-Ed Capital Trust invested the gross
proceeds from the sale of 100.0 million of its 7.35 trust preferred securities
in the preferred securities of Met-Ed Capital II, L.P., which in turn invested
those proceeds in 103.1 million of 7.35 subordinated debentures of the
Company. The sole assets of Met-Ed Capital Trust are the preferred securities of
Met-Ed Capital II, L.P., whose sole assets are the Company's subordinated
debentures with the same rate and maturity date as the preferred securities. The
Company has effectively provided a full and unconditional guarantee of its
obligations under its trust's preferred securities. The trust preferred
securities, which mature in 2039 and have a liquidation value of 25.00 per
security, are redeemable at the option of the Company beginning in May 2004 at
100 of their principal amount. The interest on the subordinated debentures (and
therefore the distributions on the preferred securities) may be deferred for up
to 60 months, but the Company may not pay dividends on, or redeem or acquire,
any of its cumulative preferred or common stock until deferred payments on its
subordinated debentures are paid in full.

(D) LONG-TERM DEBT-

 The first mortgage indentures and their supplements, which secure all of
the Company's FMBs, serve as direct first mortgage liens on substantially all
property and franchises, other than specifically excepted property, owned by the
Company.

 Based on the amount of bonds authenticated by the Trustee through
December 31, 2001, the Company's annual sinking and improvement fund
requirements for all bonds issued under the mortgage amount to 6.7 million. The
Company expects to fulfill its sinking and improvement fund obligation by
providing bondable property additions to the Trustee.

 Sinking fund requirements for FMBs and maturing long-term debt
(excluding capital leases) for the next five years are:

 (In millions)
 ----------------------
 2002........ 30.1
 2003........ 90.5
 2004........ 40.5
 2005........ 50.5
 2006........ 150.5
 ----------------------

 The Company's obligations to repay certain pollution control revenue
bonds are secured by several series of FMBs. Certain pollution control revenue
bonds are entitled to the benefit of noncancelable municipal bond insurance
policies of 42.2 million to pay principal of, or interest on, the pollution
control revenue bonds.

 19

(E) COMPREHENSIVE INCOME-

 Comprehensive income includes net income as reported on the Consolidated
Statements of Income and all other changes in common stockholder's equity except
those resulting from transactions with the Company's parent. As of December 31,
2001, accumulated other comprehensive income consisted of an unrealized gain on
investment of securities available for sale of 0.02 million and unrealized
losses on derivative instrument hedges of 0.01 million.

5. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS:

 The Company may borrow from its affiliates on a short-term basis. As of
December 31, 2001, the Company had total short-term borrowings of 72 million
from its affiliates with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.9 .

6. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES:

 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES-

 The Company's current forecast reflects expenditures of approximately
 323 million for property additions and improvements from 2002-2006, of which
approximately 66 million is applicable to 2002.

NUCLEAR INSURANCE-

 The Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability relative to a single
incident at a nuclear power plant to 9.5 billion. The amount is covered by a
combination of private insurance and an industry retrospective rating plan.
Based on its present ownership interest in TMI-2, the Company is exempt from any
potential assessment under the industry retrospective rating plan.

 The Company is also insured as to its interest in TMI-2 under a policy
issued to the operating company for the plant. Under this policy, 150 million
is provided for property damage and decontamination and decommissioning costs.
Under this policy, the Company can be assessed a maximum of approximately 0.4
million for incidents at any covered nuclear facility occurring during a policy
year which are in excess of accumulated funds available to the insurer for
paying losses.

 The Company intends to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as
described above as long as it is available. To the extent that property damage,
decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement costs and other such
costs arising from a nuclear incident at TMI-2 exceed the policy limits of the
insurance in effect with respect to that plant, to the extent a nuclear incident
is determined not to be covered by the Company's insurance policies, or to the
extent such insurance becomes unavailable in the future, the Company would
remain at risk for such costs.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS-

 Various environmental liabilities have been recognized on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2001, based on estimates of the
total costs of cleanup, the Company's proportionate responsibility for such
costs and the financial ability of other nonaffiliated entities to pay. The
Company has been named as a "potentially responsible party" (PRP) at waste
disposal sites which may require cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of disposal of
hazardous substances at historical sites, and the liability involved, are often
unsubstantiated and subject to dispute. Federal law provides that all PRPs for a
particular site be held liable on a joint and several basis. The Company has
total accrued liabilities aggregating approximately 0.1 million as of December
31, 2001. The Company does not believe environmental remediation costs will have
a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of
operations.

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS-

 Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to the Company's normal
business operations are pending against the Company, the most significant of
which is described below.

 TMI-2, which was damaged during a 1979 accident, is jointly owned by the
Company, JCP&L and Penelec, with the Company having a 50 ownership percentage.
Claims for alleged personal injury against the Company, JCP&L, Penelec and GPU
(the defendants) were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District
of Pennsylvania. In 1996, the District Court granted a motion for summary
judgment filed by the defendants and dismissed the ten initial "test cases"
which had been selected for a test case trial, as well as all of the remaining
2,100 pending claims. In November

 20

1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the District
Court's dismissal of the ten "test cases," but set aside the dismissal of the
additional pending claims, remanding them to the District Court for further
proceedings. In September 2000, the defendants filed for a summary judgment in
the District Court. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs appealed to the Third Circuit for
a review of the District Court's decision placing limitations on the remaining
plaintiffs' suit. In April 2001, the Third Circuit affirmed the District Court's
decision. In July 2001, the defendants renewed their motion for a summary
judgment on the remaining 2,100 claims in the District Court. On January 15,
2002, the District Court granted the defendants' amended motion for summary
judgment. On February 14, 2002, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition to the
approximately 2,100 claims for which summary judgment has been granted, there is
other pending litigation arising out of the TMI-2 accident. This litigation
consists of the following: eight personal injury cases that were not
consolidated with the above-referenced approximately 2,100 claims; two class
actions brought on behalf of plaintiffs alleging additional injuries diagnosed
after the filing of the complaints in the above-referenced case; a case alleging
exposure during the post-accident cleanup of the TMI-2 plant; and claims by
individual businesses for economic loss resulting from the TMI-2 accident.
Although unable to predict the outcome of this litigation, the Company believes
that any liability to which it might be subject by reason of the TMI-2 accident
will not exceed its financial protection under the Price-Anderson Act.

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Metropolitan Edison Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and consolidated
statement of capitalization of Metropolitan Edison Company (a Pennsylvania
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp.) and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2001 (post-merger), and the related consolidated statements
of income, common stockholder's equity, preferred stock, cash flows and taxes
for the period from January 1, 2001 to November 6, 2001 (pre-merger) and the
period from November 7, 2001 to December 31, 2001 (post-merger). These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit. The financial statements of Metropolitan Edison Company and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and for each of the two years in the period
ended December 31, 2000 (pre-merger), were audited by other auditors whose
report dated January 31, 2001, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
statements.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the 2001 financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Metropolitan Edison Company
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 (post-merger), and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the period from January 1, 2001 to November
6, 2001 (pre-merger) and the period from November 7, 2001 to December 31, 2001
(post-merger), in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.

SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, dated as of May 1, 2001, made and entered into by and
between PENNSYLVANIA ELECTRIC COMPANY, a corporation of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania (hereinafter sometimes called the "Company"), party of the first
part, and UNITED STATES TRUST COMPANY OF NEW YORK, a company organized under the
laws of the State of New York (hereinafter sometimes called the "Trustee"), as
successor trustee under the Mortgage and Deed of Trust hereinafter referred to,

Deed of Trust (hereinafter called the "Original Indenture"), dated as of the
first day of January, 1942, to Bankers Trust Company, as trustee, to secure the
First Mortgage Bonds of the Company, unlimited in aggregate principal amount and
issuable in series, from time to time, in the manner and subject to the

WHEREAS, the Mortgage provides for the issuance of bonds thereunder in one

Board of Directors of the Company; and

 WHEREAS, the Company has entered into an Indenture dated as of April 1,

said Senior Note Series Bonds are to be substantially in the form set forth in
Article II hereof with the insertion of numbers, denominations, dated dates,

 ------------------------------------
creates a series of bonds to be issued under and secured by the Mortgage, to be
designated and to be distinguished from bonds of all other series by the title
"First Mortgage Bonds, Senior Note Series due 2002." The aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Note Series Bonds which may be initially authenticated and
delivered shall be limited to Four Hundred Twenty Million Dollars 420,000,000), shall mature on February 1, 2002 and shall be issued only as a
single registered bond without coupons. The serial numbers of bonds of the
Senior Note Series Bonds shall be such as may be approved by any officer of the
Company, the execution thereof by any such officer either manually or by
facsimile signature to be conclusive evidence of such approval. Senior Note
Series Bonds shall bear interest at a rate of 6 per annum, payable upon the
maturity or the redemption thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.03, 2.04,
2.05, 8.03 and 17.04 of the Original Indenture, no Senior Note Series Bonds
shall be authenticated and delivered after such initial issue.

 SECTION 1.03. Payment of Principal and Interest. The principal of and
 -----------------------------------
interest on any Senior Note Series Bond shall be payable, in such coin or
currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be
legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, and shall be payable
at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of
New York. Interest on the Senior Note Series Bonds shall be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.

 The obligation of the Company to pay the principal of and accrued interest
on the Senior Note Series Bonds at or after maturity or redemption (x) shall be
deemed to have been satisfied and discharged in full in the event that all
amounts then due in respect of the Senior Notes shall have been paid or (y)
shall be deemed to remain unsatisfied in an amount equal to the aggregate amount
then due in respect of the Senior Notes and remaining unpaid (not in excess,
however, of the amount otherwise then due in respect of principal of and accrued
interest on the Senior Note Series Bonds);

 The Trustee may at anytime and all times conclusively assume that the
obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of and
interest on the Senior Note Series Bonds, so far as such payments at the time
have become due, has been fully satisfied and discharged unless and until the
Trustee shall have received a written notice from the Senior Note Trustee signed
by one of its officers stating (i) that timely payment of, or interest on, the
Senior Notes has not been so made, (ii) that the Company is in arrears as to the

under the Senior Notes from time to time outstanding under the Senior Note
Indenture.

 ----------------------------------------------------------
Bonds. Except (i) as required to effect an assignment to a successor Trustee

under the Senior Note Indenture, (ii) pursuant to Section 4.03 of the First
Supplemental Indenture, or (iii) in compliance with a final order of a court of
competent jurisdiction in connection with any bankruptcy or reorganization
proceeding of the Company, the Senior Note Series Bonds are not transferable.
The Senior Note Series Bonds shall be exchangeable for other registered bonds of
the same series and for the same aggregate principal amount, in the manner and
upon the conditions prescribed in the Mortgage, upon the surrender of such bonds
at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of
New York. The Company covenants and agrees that, notwithstanding Section 2.03 of
the Original Indenture, it will not charge any sum for or in connection with any
exchange or transfer of any Senior Note Series Bond, but may require the payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or taxes or other governmental charges
incident to any exchange, transfer or registration thereof.

 SECTION 1.06. Redemption of Senior Note Series Bonds. (a) Senior Note
 ----------------------------------------
Series Bonds shall not be redeemable except the Senior Note Series Bonds shall
be immediately redeemable at a redemption price of 100 of the principal amount
thereof, plus interest accrued to the redemption date, in whole, upon a written
demand for redemption by the Senior Note Trustee stating that the principal of

theretofore or subsequently issued under the Senior Note Indenture, and,
pursuant to Section 4.03 of the First Supplemental Indenture, the Senior Note
Trustee shall forthwith deliver the Senior Note Series Bonds to the Company for
cancellation.

 Upon the surrender for cancellation, at any time, of Senior Note Series
Bonds by the Senior Note Trustee or the Escrow Agent to the Trustee, the Senior
Note Series Bonds so surrendered shall be deemed to be satisfied and discharged
and the obligations of the Company thereunder shall be terminated, and such
Senior Note Series Bonds shall be cancelled by the Trustee and delivered to the
Company.

rates, and may otherwise vary as in the Mortgage hereinafter mentioned provided,
and is one of a series known as its First Mortgage Bonds, Senior Note Series due
2002 (herein called the "Senior Note Series Bonds"), all bonds of all series
issued and to be issued under and equally and ratably secured (except insofar as

provisions of the Mortgage hereinafter mentioned, may afford additional security
for the bonds of any particular series) by a Mortgage and Deed of Trust (herein,
together with any indentures supplemental thereto, called the "Mortgage") dated
as of January 1, 1942, executed by the Company to UNITED STATES TRUST COMPANY OF

Trustee shall have received a written notice from the Senior Note Trustee signed

interest on, the Senior Notes, has not been made, (ii) that the Company is in
arrears as to the payments required to be made by it to the Senior Note Trustee

however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the fixed maturity
of any bonds, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest
thereon, or reduce the principal amount thereof, without the consent of the
holder of each bond so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of
bonds, the holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental
indenture without the consent of the holders of all bonds then outstanding. Any
such consent by the registered holder of this bond (unless effectively revoked
as provided in the Mortgage) shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder
and upon all future holders of this bond, irrespective of whether or not any
notation of such waiver or consent is made upon this bond.

be called for redemption, and premium, if any, thereon, and all interest payable
on such bonds to the date on which they become due and payable, at maturity or
upon redemption or otherwise, and complies with the other provisions of the

express date of the maturity hereof on the conditions, in the manner and at the
time set forth in the Mortgage, upon the occurrence of a completed default as in
the Mortgage provided.

assignment to a successor Trustee under the Senior Note Indenture, (ii) pursuant
to Section 4.03 of the First Supplemental Senior Note Indenture, or (iii) in

compliance with a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction in connection
with any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding of the Company. This bond shall
be exchangeable for other registered bonds of the same series and for the same
aggregate principal amount, in the manner and upon the conditions prescribed in
the Mortgage, upon the surrender of such bonds at the office or agency of the
Company in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York. However,

purpose of receiving payment and for all other purposes and neither the Company
nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any bond registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary.

on this bond, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or
based on or in respect of the Mortgage, against any incorporator or any past,
present or future subscriber to the capital stock, stockholder, officer or
director, as such, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either
directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, under any rule of

otherwise, all such liability of incorporators, subscribers, stockholders,
officers and directors, as such, being waived and released by the holder and
owner hereof by the acceptance of this bond and being likewise waived and

 ARTICLE V

 AMENDED PROVISIONS

 Section 5.01 Amended Provisions. (a) Section 4.01(a) of the Original
 -------------------
Indenture is hereby amended to add the following at the end thereof:

 During the Senior Note First Mortgage Bond Period, if the
 Notes are deemed paid and discharged pursuant to this Section
 4.01(a), the obligation of the Company to make payment with respect
 to the principal of, and interest on the Senior Note First Mortgage
 Bonds shall be satisfied and discharged and the Senior Note First
 Mortgage Bonds shall cease to secure the Notes in any manner.

 (a) Clause (v) of Section 5.06 of the Original Indenture is hereby
amended to add the words "or when such Debt consists of Senior Note First
Mortgage Bonds" after the word "above".

 (b) Section 5.09 of the Original Indenture is hereby amended to add
the words "other than the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds" at the end thereof.

 (c) Section 7.01(a) of the Original Indenture is hereby amended by
(i) deleting the word "or" at the end of clause (4) of the first paragraph; (ii)
inserting the word "or" at the end of clause (5) of the first paragraph and
(iii) deleting the provisions thereof following clause (5) of the first
paragraph and substituting therefore the following:

 (6) during the Senior Note First Mortgage Bond Period, a completed
 default (as defined in the First Mortgage) has occurred and is
 continuing; provided, however, that anything in this Indenture to
 the contrary notwithstanding, the waiver or cure of such default
 under the First Mortgage and the rescission and annulment of the
 consequences thereof under the First Mortgage shall constitute a
 waiver of the corresponding Event of Default hereunder and a
 rescission and annulment of the consequences thereof hereunder;

 8

then, unless the principal of all of the Notes shall have already become
 due and payable, either the Trustee or the Holders of a majority in
 aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding, by notice in
 writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by such Holders), may
 declare the principal of and interest on all the Notes to be due and
 payable immediately and upon any such declaration the same shall become
 immediately due and payable, anything in this Indenture or in the Notes
 contained to the contrary notwithstanding and, during the Senior Note
 First Mortgage Bond Period, upon the Notes being declared to be due and
 payable, the Trustee shall immediately file with the Mortgage Trustee a
 written demand for redemption of all Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds to
 the extent provided in the applicable provisions of the First Mortgage.

 The foregoing paragraph, however, is subject to the condition that
 if, at any time after the principal of the Notes shall have been so
 declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the
 payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained or entered as
 hereinafter provided, and during the Senior Note First Mortgage Bond
 Period, prior to the acceleration of all of the first mortgage bonds
 issued and outstanding under the First Mortgage, the Company shall pay or
 shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all matured
 installments of interest upon all of the Notes and the principal of and
 any premium on any and all Notes which shall have become due otherwise
 than by acceleration (with interest on overdue installments of interest,
 to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under
 applicable law, and on such principal and any applicable premium at the
 rate borne by the Notes to the date of such payment or deposit) and all
 sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder, the reasonable
 compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its
 agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section
 8.06 hereof, and any and all defaults under this Indenture, other than the
 non-payment of principal of and accrued interest on Notes which shall have
 become due solely by acceleration of Maturity, shall have been cured or
 waived (including any defaults under the First Mortgage, as evidenced by
 notice thereof from the Mortgage Trustee to the Trustee) -- then and in
 every such case such payment or deposit shall cause an automatic waiver of
 the Event of Default and its consequences (including, if given, the
 written demand for redemption of all Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds) and
 shall cause an automatic rescission and annulment of the acceleration of
 the Notes; but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to
 or shall affect any subsequent default, or shall impair any right
 consequent thereon.

 (d) Article VII of the Original Indenture as hereby amended by
adding a new Section 7.12 thereto as follows:

 Section 7.12 Defaults Under The First Mortgage. In addition to every
 ---------------------------------
 other right and remedy provided herein, during the Senior Note First
 Mortgage Bond Period, the Trustee may exercise any right or remedy
 available to the Trustee in its capacity as owner and holder of Senior
 Note First Mortgage Bonds which arises as a result of a completed default
 under the First Mortgage whether or not an Event of Default under this
 Indenture shall then have occurred and be continuing.

due in respect of interest payable on the Advances shall have been paid and (b)

new note of this series, for the same aggregate principal amount and having the
same stated maturity date, will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor.

manner be exchanged at such office or agency for one or more notes of this
series of the same aggregate principal amount and having the same stated
maturity date and interest rate, all as provided in the Indenture.

interest on this note, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect
hereof or of the Indenture, against any incorporator, shareholder, director or
officer, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any predecessor

limiting the generality of the foregoing, any proceeding to enforce any claimed
liability of shareholders of the Company, based upon any theory of disregarding
the corporate entity of the Company or upon any theory that the Company was

issuance hereof, expressly waived and released by every holder hereof, and being

respect of the notes (except for certain obligations including obligations to
register the transfer or exchange of the notes, replace stolen, lost or
mutilated notes, maintain paying agencies and hold monies for payment in trust,

cash, U.S. Government Obligations which through the payment of interest thereon
and principal thereof in accordance with their terms will provide cash, or a
combination of cash and U.S. Government Obligations, in any event in an amount
sufficient, without reinvestment, to pay all the principal of and any premium
and interest on the notes on the dates such payments are due in accordance with
the terms of the notes.

of the notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect
provided in the Indenture.

Company and the rights of the note holders under the Indenture at any time by
the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes. Any such consent or
waiver by the holder of this note shall be conclusive and binding upon such
holder and upon all future holders of this note and of any note issued upon the
registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof
whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon the note.

 As set forth in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, no
holder of any notes will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect
to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder unless such holder shall have
previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default

amount of the outstanding notes affected by such Event of Default shall have
made written request and offered reasonable indemnity to the Trustee to
institute such proceeding as Trustee and the Trustee shall have failed to

limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the holder hereof for the
enforcement of payment of the principal of and premium or interest on this note
on or after the respective due dates expressed here.

PENNSYLVANIA ELECTRIC COMPANY

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of
 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

This discussion includes forward-looking statements based on information
currently available to management that is subject to certain risks and
uncertainties. Such statements typically contain, but are not limited to, the
terms anticipate, potential, expect, believe, estimate and similar words. Actual
results may differ materially due to the speed and nature of increased
competition and deregulation in the electric utility industry, economic or
weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changes in markets for
energy services, changing energy and commodity market prices, legislative and
regulatory changes (including revised environmental requirements), the
availability and cost of capital, ability to accomplish or realize anticipated
benefits from strategic initiatives and other similar factors.

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

 Earnings on common stock decreased 12.1 to 34.5 million in 2001 from
 39.2 million in 2000. In 2001, earnings were negatively impacted by higher
other operating costs, as well as lower other income. Offsetting this were
higher revenues and lower net interest charges. In 2000, earnings on common
stock decreased 74.1 to 39.2 million from 151.6 million in 1999. The decrease
was primarily due to greater purchased power costs, the absence of a net gain
related to wholesale operations from the sale of substantially all of our
generating facilities in 1999, and, to a lesser extent, higher net interest
charges. Lower other operating costs and depreciation expense positively
affected earnings on common stock in 2000.

 Operating revenues increased by 72.7 million in 2001 following a 20.1
million decrease in 2000. The sources of the changes in operating revenues
during 2001 and 2000, as compared to the prior year, are summarized in the
following table.

 Sources of Revenue Changes 2001 2000
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 Increase (Decrease) (In millions)

 Change in kilowatt-hour sales due
 to level of retail customers
 shopping for generation service.................. 134.5 9.5
 Change in other retail kilowatt-hour sales......... (12.2) 10.1
 Decrease in wholesale sales........................ (50.6) (32.4)
 All other changes.................................. 1.0 (7.3)
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 Net Increase (Decrease) in Operating Revenues...... 72.7 (20.1)
 ====================================================================

Electric Sales

 In 2001, a major source of the increase in operating revenues was the
increase in retail generation kilowatt-hour sales due to a large number of
customers returning to us in 2001 as full service customers, after receiving
their power from alternate suppliers in 2000. In 2001, 85.3 of total retail
sales were to full service customers as compared to 62.7 in 2000. Residential
sales remained relatively flat, while commercial sales were slightly lower in
2001 compared to 2000, primarily due to lower usage. Industrial sales also
decreased in 2001 compared to 2000 due almost evenly to a decrease in the number
of customers and lower usage by existing customers. Sales to wholesale customers
decreased in 2001 compared to 2000 due to a reduction in our available capacity.

 The primary source of the decrease in operating revenues in 2000,
compared to the prior year, was lower sales to the wholesale market, as a result
of us having additional power available in 1999 due to the delay of the
divestiture of our generating assets. Operating revenues also increased due to
higher residential and commercial sales, partially offset by lower industrial
sales. Changes in kilowatt-hour sales by customer class in 2001 and 2000 are
summarized in the following table:

 2

Changes in Kilowatt-hour Sales 2001 2000
 --------------------------------------------------
 Increase (Decrease)

 Residential.................. 0.9 2.2 
 Commercial................... (0.4) 4.4 
 Industrial................... (7.6) (3.4) 
 --------------------------------------------------

 Wholesale.................... (49.5) (31.6) 
 --------------------------------------------------

 Total Sales.................. (11.0) (7.1) 
 --------------------------------------------------

Operating Expenses and Taxes

 Total operating expenses and taxes increased 68.7 million in 2001 and
 40.5 million in 2000, compared to the preceding year. Higher purchased power
costs accounted for the majority of the increased costs in 2001. Purchased power
costs also increased significantly in 2000 but were partially offset by lower
nuclear costs, other operating costs and depreciation expenses.

 Purchased power costs increased 54.5 million in 2001, compared to 2000.
The higher costs resulted from increased quantities of power purchased through
the PJM Power Pool due to a large number of customers returning to us in 2001
after receiving their power from alternate suppliers in 2000, as well as higher
average prices of power purchased under two-party agreements. Also included in
2001 purchased power costs was a 16 million charge related to the termination
of a wholesale energy contract with Allegheny Electric Cooperative. Offsetting
these increases was the effect of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission's
(PPUC) June 2001 order that allowed us to defer, for future rate recovery from
customers, energy costs in excess of our fixed generation tariff rates,
retroactive to January 1, 2001, in connection with our provider of last resort
(PLR) obligation.

 In 2000, fuel and purchased power costs increased 183.2 million over
1999. The majority of the increase was due to the need to purchase substantially
all of our energy requirements following the sales of generating assets in 1999,
and the absence of deferred accounting treatment for these costs. An offsetting
decrease in fuel costs also resulted from the sales of generating assets. The
sale of Unit 1 of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Plant, completed in December
1999, eliminated essentially all of our nuclear operating costs in 2000.

 Other operating costs increased 9.9 million in 2001, compared to 2000,
primarily due the absence in 2001 of a pension curtailment gain associated with
employees who were terminated at the time of the sale of our generating assets.
This gain was realized in 2000 as a result of the PPUC's Phase II Order. Other
operating costs also increased due to costs related to Voluntary Enhanced
Retirement Programs offered to certain bargaining unit employees. In 2000, other
operating costs decreased 68.7 million compared to the previous year. The
primary reason for the decline was a reduction in expenses associated with the
operation of generating stations due to the sale of all our remaining generating
assets in 1999. Other operating costs were also reduced as a result of the net
impact of the PPUC's Phase II Order issued in December 2000, which allowed us to
realize the pension curtailment gain discussed above, offset by a write-off for
the disallowance of a portion of our stranded costs. The sale of generating
assets in 1999 was also the cause for a decrease in depreciation expense of
 21.9 million in 2000 from the previous year.

Other Income

 Other income decreased 10.3 million in 2001 from the previous year. The
decrease was attributed to charges for a sustainable energy fund and renewable
energy projects in accordance with the Stipulation of Settlement related to the
merger of FirstEnergy and GPU, Inc. Also contributing to the decrease was lower
interest income. In 2000, other income decreased 48.9 million from the previous
year. The decrease was due to the absence in 2000 of net gains related to
wholesale operations as a result of the sale of substantially all our generating
stations and lower interest income. Partially offsetting these reductions was
the reversal of an estimated 1999 tax penalty.

Net Interest Charges

 Net interest charges decreased by 1.5 million in 2001 after increasing
 3.7 million in 2000 compared to the prior year. In 2001, the decrease was due
to the absence of prior year expense associated with a federal income tax
deficiency, higher deferred interest income, and lower short-term borrowing
levels. These decreases were partially offset by additional interest expense on
 93 million of senior notes issued during 2000. The issuance of the 93 million
of senior notes during 2000 was also responsible for the increase in interest
expense in 2000 compared to 1999.

Capital Resources and Liquidity
- -------------------------------

 We had approximately 39 million of cash and temporary investments and
 77.6 million of short-term indebtedness on December 31, 2001. We may borrow
from our affiliates on a short-term basis. We will not issue first mortgage
bonds (FMB) other than as collateral for senior notes, since our senior note
indentures prohibit (subject to certain exceptions) us from issuing any debt
which is senior to the senior notes. As of December 31, 2001, we had the
capability to issue 450 million of additional senior notes based upon FMB
collateral. We have no restrictions on the issuance of preferred stock.

 At the end of 2001, our common equity as a percentage of capitalization,
including debt relating to assets held for sale, stood at 70 compared to 43 at
the end of 2000. This increase resulted from the allocation of the purchase
price in the merger between FirstEnergy and GPU.

 Following approval of the merger of FirstEnergy and GPU by the New
Jersey Board of Public Utilities on September 26, 2001, Standard and Poor's
adjusted our corporate credit rating from A/A-1 to BBB/A-2, and our senior
unsecured debt rating from A to BBB. The lower credit ratings reflect Standard &
Poor's consolidated rating methodology, which resulted in essentially the same
corporate credit rating for all of FirstEnergy's electric utility operating
companies. The credit rating outlook of Standard & Poor's is stable. On February
22, 2002, Moody's announced a change in its outlook for our credit ratings from
stable to negative based upon a decision by the Commonwealth Court of
Pennsylvania to reverse the PPUC's decision to grant us rate relief (see
Regulatory Matters).

 Our cash requirements in 2002 for operating expenses, construction
expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and preferred stock redemptions are
expected to be met without increasing our net debt and preferred stock
outstanding. Major contractual obligations for future cash payments are
summarized in the following table:

Contractual Obligations 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Total

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 466 262 325 202 197 2,318 3,770
===============================================================================

Our capital spending for the period 2002-2006 is expected to be about
 375 million, of which approximately 72 million applies to 2002.

Market Risk Information
- -----------------------

 We use various market risk sensitive instruments, including derivative
contracts, primarily to manage the risk of price and interest rate fluctuations.
Our Risk Policy Committee, comprised of FirstEnergy executive officers,
exercises an independent risk oversight function to ensure compliance with
corporate risk management policies and prudent risk management practices.

Commodity Price Risk

 We are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in
electricity and natural gas prices. To manage the volatility relating to these
exposures, we use a variety of derivative instruments, including options,
futures contracts and swaps. These derivatives are used principally for hedging
purposes. The change in the fair value of commodity derivative contracts related
to energy production during 2001 is summarized in the table below:

 Increase (Decrease)in the Fair Value of Commodity Derivative Contracts
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Nov. 7-Dec. 31 Jan. 1-Nov. 6

 Change in techniques/assumptions.............. -- (10.6)
 Settled contracts............................. (0.1) (0.3)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Outstanding as of end of period............... 1.3 3.6
 =======================================================================

 4

While the valuation of derivative contracts is always based on active
market prices when they are available, longer-term contracts can require the use
of model-based estimates of prices in later years due to the absence of
published market prices. Currently, substantially all of our derivatives are
valued based on active market prices.

 We perform sensitivity analyses to estimate our exposure to the market
risk of our commodity position. A hypothetical 10 adverse shift in quoted
market prices in the near term on our derivative instruments would not have had
a material effect on our consolidated financial position or cash flows as of
December 31, 2001.

Interest Rate Risk

 Our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is reduced since a
significant portion of our debt has fixed interest rates, as noted in the table
below. We are subject to the inherent interest rate risks related to refinancing
maturing debt by issuing new debt securities. Changes in the market value of our
nuclear decommissioning trust funds are recognized by making corresponding
changes to the decommissioning liability, as described in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

 We use interest rate swap agreements to manage the risk of increases in
variable interest rates. All of the agreements convert variable rate debt to
fixed rate debt. As of December 31, 2001, interest rate swaps had a weighted
average fixed interest rate of 7.16 . The swap agreements in effect as of
December 31, 2001 had a notional amount of 50 million, a maturity date of 2002
and a fair value of 1.8) million.

Outlook
- -------

 Our industry continues to transition to a more competitive environment.
As of January 1, 1999, all of our customers could select alternative energy
suppliers. We continue to deliver power to homes and businesses through our
existing distribution system, which remains regulated. The PPUC authorized our
rate restructuring plan, establishing separate charges for transmission,
distribution, generation and stranded cost recovery, which is recovered through
a competitive transition charge (CTC). Customers electing to obtain power from
an alternative supplier have their bills reduced based on the regulated
generation component, and the customers receive a generation charge from the
alternative supplier. We have a continuing responsibility to provide power to
those customers not choosing to receive power from an alternative energy
supplier, subject to certain limits, which is referred to as our PLR obligation.

Regulatory Matters

 In June 2001, we entered into a settlement agreement with major parties
in the combined merger and rate proceedings that, in addition to resolving
certain issues concerning the PPUC's approval of our merger with FirstEnergy,
also addressed our request for PLR relief. We are permitted to defer, for future
recovery, the difference between our actual energy costs and those reflected in
our capped generation rates. Those costs will continue to be deferred through
December 31, 2005. If energy costs incurred during that period are below our
capped generation rates, the difference would be used to reduce our recoverable
deferred costs. Our PLR obligation was extended through December 31, 2010. Our
CTC

 5

revenues will be applied first to PLR costs, then to stranded costs other than
for non-utility generation (NUG) and finally to NUG stranded costs through
December 31, 2010. We would be permitted to recover any remaining stranded costs
through a continuation of the CTC after December 31, 2010; however, such
recovery would extend to no later than December 31, 2015. Any amounts not
expected to be recovered by December 31, 2015 would be written off at the time
such nonrecovery becomes probable. Several parties had appealed this PPUC
decision to the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. On February 21, 2002, the
Court affirmed the PPUC decision regarding approval of the merger, remanding the
decision to the PPUC only with respect to the issue of merger savings. The Court
reversed the PPUC's decision regarding our PLR obligation, and denied our
related requests for rate relief. We are considering our response to the Court's
decision, which could include asking the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to review
the decision. We are unable to predict the outcome of these matters.

Supply Plan

 As part of our Restructuring Order, we are obligated to supply
electricity to customers who do not choose an alternate supplier. The total
forecasted peak of this obligation in 2002 is 2,300 megawatts (MW). Our current
supply portfolio contains approximately 400 MW of long-term purchases from NUGs,
and our remaining obligation is expected to be met through a mix of multi-year
forward purchases, short-term forward (less than one year) purchases and spot
market purchases.

Environmental Matters

 Various environmental liabilities have been recognized on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2001, based on estimates of the
total costs of cleanup, our proportionate responsibility for such costs and the
financial ability of other nonaffiliated entities to pay. The Company has been
named as a "potentially responsible party" (PRP) at waste disposal sites which
may require cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of disposal of hazardous substances at
historical sites, and the liability involved, are often unsubstantiated and
subject to dispute. Federal law provides that all PRPs for a particular site be
held liable on a joint and several basis. We have total accrued liabilities
aggregating approximately 1 million as of December 31, 2001. We do not believe
environmental remediation costs will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

Legal Matters

 Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to our normal business
operations are pending against us, the most significant of which is described
below.

 We have a 25 ownership interest in Unit 2 of the Three Mile Island
Nuclear Plant (TMI-2), which was damaged during a 1979 accident. As a result of
the accident, claims for alleged personal injury were filed against us, Jersey
Central Power & Light Company, Metropolitan Edison Company and GPU in the U.S.
District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. In 1996, the District
Court granted a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants and
dismissed the ten initial "test cases" which had been selected for a test case
trial, as well as all of the remaining 2,100 pending claims. In November 1999,
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the District Court's
dismissal of the ten test cases, but set aside the dismissal of the additional
pending claims, remanding them to the District Court for further proceedings.
Following the resolution of judicial proceedings dealing with admissible
evidence, we have again requested summary judgment of the remaining 2,100 claims
in the District Court. On January 15, 2002, the District Court granted our
motion. On February 14, 2002, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of this
decision (see Note 6 - Other Legal Proceedings). Although unable to predict the
outcome of this litigation, we believe that any liability to which we might be
subject by reason of the TMI-2 accident will not exceed our financial protection
under the Price-Anderson Act.

Significant Accounting Policies
- -------------------------------

 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Application of
these principles often requires a high degree of judgment, estimates and
assumptions that affect our financial results. All of our assets are subject to
their own specific risks and uncertainties and are continually reviewed for
impairment. Assets related to the application of the policies discussed below
are similarly reviewed with their risks and uncertainties reflecting these
specific factors. Our more significant accounting policies are described below:

Purchase Accounting

 On November 7, 2001, the merger between FirstEnergy and GPU became
effective, and we became a wholly owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy. The merger
was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting, which requires judgment
regarding the allocation of the purchase price based on the fair values of the
assets acquired (including

6

intangible assets) and the liabilities assumed. The fair values of the acquired
assets and assumed liabilities were based primarily on estimates. The
adjustments reflected in our records, which are subject to adjustment in 2002
when finalized, primarily consist of: (1) revaluation of certain property, plant
and equipment; (2) adjusting preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption and
long-term debt to estimated fair value; (3) recognizing additional obligations
related to retirement benefits; and (4) recognizing estimated severance and
other compensation liabilities. The excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was
recognized as goodwill, which will be reviewed for impairment at least annually.
As of December 31, 2001, we had recorded goodwill of approximately 797.4
million related to the merger.

Regulatory Accounting

 We are subject to regulation that sets the prices (rates) we are
permitted to charge our customers based on costs that the regulatory agencies
determine we are permitted to recover. At times, regulators permit the future
recovery through rates of costs that would be currently charged to expense by an
unregulated company. This rate-making process results in the recording of
regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash inflows. As a result of the
changing regulatory framework in Pennsylvania, a significant amount of
regulatory assets have been recorded. As of December 31, 2001, we had regulatory
assets of 769.8 million. We continually review these assets to assess their
ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines. Impairment
risk associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislation,
judicial or regulatory actions in the future.

Derivative Accounting

 Determination of appropriate accounting for derivative transactions
requires the involvement of management representing operations, finance and risk
assessment. In order to determine the appropriate accounting for derivative
transactions, the provisions of the contract need to be carefully assessed in
accordance with the authoritative accounting literature and management's
intended use of the derivative. New authoritative guidance continues to shape
the application of derivative accounting. Management's expectations and
intentions are key factors in determining the appropriate accounting for a
derivative transaction and, as a result, such expectations and intentions must
be documented. Derivative contracts that are determined to fall within the scope
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, as amended, must
be recorded at their fair value. Active market prices are not always available
to determine the fair value of the later years of a contract, requiring that
various assumptions and estimates be used in their valuation. We continually
monitor our derivative contracts to determine if our activities, expectations,
intentions, assumptions and estimates remain valid. As part of our normal
operations we enter into commodities contracts, which increase the impact of
derivative accounting judgments.

Revenue Recognition

 We follow the accrual method of accounting for revenues, recognizing
revenue for kilowatt-hours that have been delivered but not yet billed through
the end of the year. The determination of unbilled revenues requires management
to make various estimates including:

 - Net energy purchased or generated for retail load
 - Losses of energy over distribution lines
 - Mix of kilowatt-hour usage by residential, commercial and industrial
 customers
 - Kilowatt-hour usage of customers receiving electricity from
 alternative suppliers

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
- ------------------------------------

 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approved SFAS 141,
"Business Combinations," and SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"
on June 29, 2001. SFAS 141 requires that all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using purchase accounting. The provisions
of the new standard relating to the determination of goodwill and other
intangible assets have been applied to our 2001 merger, which was accounted for
as a purchase transaction. Under SFAS 142, amortization of existing goodwill
will cease January 1, 2002. Instead, goodwill will be tested for impairment at
least on an annual basis, and no impairment of goodwill is anticipated as a
result of a preliminary analysis. We did not have any goodwill prior to our 2001
merger, and we did not amortize goodwill associated with the merger under the
provisions of the new standard.

 In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations." The new statement provides accounting standards for retirement
obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets, with adoption required
by January 1, 2003. SFAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an
asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred.
The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying
amount of the long-lived asset. Over time the capitalized costs are depreciated
and the present value of the asset retirement liability increases, resulting in
a period expense. Upon retirement, a gain or loss will be recorded if the cost
to settle the retirement obligation differs from the carrying amount. We are
currently assessing the new standard and have not yet determined the impact on
our financial statements.

 7

In September 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of." The Statement also supersedes the accounting and reporting
provisions of APB 30. Our adoption of this Statement, effective January 1, 2002,
will result in our accounting for any future impairments or disposals of
long-lived assets under the provisions of SFAS 144, but will not change the
accounting principles used in previous asset impairments or disposals.
Application of SFAS 144 is not anticipated to have a major impact on accounting
for impairments or disposal transactions compared to the prior application of
SFAS 121 or APB 30.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

 The consolidated financial statements include Pennsylvania Electric
Company (Company) and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company is a wholly owned
subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. FirstEnergy also holds directly all of the
issued and outstanding common shares of Ohio Edison Company (OE), The Cleveland
Electric Illuminating Company (CEI), The Toledo Edison Company (TE), American
Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI), Jersey Central Power & Light Company (JCP&L)
and Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed). The Company, JCP&L and Met-Ed were
formerly wholly owned subsidiaries of GPU, Inc., which merged with FirstEnergy
on November 7, 2001. Pre-merger period and post-merger period financial results
are separated by a heavy black line.

 The Company follows the accounting policies and practices prescribed by
the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC) and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(GAAP) requires management to make periodic estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ
from these estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform with the current year presentation.

REVENUES-

 The Company's principal business is providing electric service to
customers in Pennsylvania. The Company's retail customers are metered on a cycle
basis. Revenue is recognized for unbilled electric service through the end of
the year.

 Receivables from customers include sales to residential, commercial and
industrial customers and sales to wholesale customers. There was no material
concentration of receivables as of December 31, 2001 or 2000, with respect to
any particular segment of the Company's customers.

REGULATORY PLAN-

 Pennsylvania enacted its electric utility competition law in 1996 with
the phase-in of customer choice for generation suppliers completed as of January
1, 2001. The PPUC authorized a rate restructuring plan for the Company in 1998
which essentially resulted in the deregulation of the Company's generation
business. The Company has a continuing responsibility to provide power to those
customers not choosing to receive power from an alternative energy supplier,
subject to certain limits, which is referred to as the Company's provider of
last resort (PLR) obligation.

 In 2000, the PPUC disallowed a portion of the requested additional
stranded costs above those amounts granted in the Company's 1998 rate
restructuring plan order. The PPUC required the Company to seek an IRS ruling
regarding the return of certain unamortized investment tax credits and excess
deferred income tax benefits to ratepayers. If the IRS ruling ultimately
supports returning these tax benefits to ratepayers, the Company would then
reduce stranded costs by 25 million plus interest and record a corresponding
charge to income.

 As a result of its generating asset divestitures, the Company obtains
its supply of electricity to meet its PLR obligation almost entirely from
contracted and open market purchases. During 2000, the Company's purchased power
costs substantially exceeded the amounts it could recover under its capped
generation rates, which are in effect for varying periods, pursuant to its 1998
rate restructuring plan. In November 2000, the Company filed a petition with the
PPUC seeking permission to defer for future recovery its energy costs in excess
of amounts reflected in its capped generation rates. In January 2001, the PPUC
consolidated this petition with the merger proceeding (see Note 2 - Merger) for
consideration and resolution in accordance with the FirstEnergy and GPU merger
procedural schedule.

In June 2001, the Company entered into a Settlement Stipulation with all of the
major parties in the combined merger and rate relief proceedings, that, in
addition to resolving certain issues concerning the PPUC's approval of the
merger, also addressed the Company's request for PLR relief. On June 20, 2001,
the PPUC entered orders approving the Settlement Stipulation, which approved the
merger and provided PLR relief. The Company is permitted to defer for future
recovery the difference between its actual energy costs and those reflected in
its capped generation rates, retroactive to January 1, 2001. Deferral accounting
will continue for such cost differences through December 31, 2005 and, should
energy costs incurred by the Company during that period be below its capped
generation rates, the difference would be used to reduce its recoverable
deferred costs. The Company's PLR obligation has been extended through December
31, 2010. The Company's competitive transition charge (CTC) revenues will be
applied first to PLR costs, then to stranded costs other than for non-utility
generation (NUG) and finally to NUG stranded costs through December 31, 2010.
The Company would be permitted to recover any remaining stranded costs through a
continuation of the CTC after December 31, 2010; however, such recovery would
extend to no later than December 31, 2015. Any amounts not expected to be
recovered by December 31, 2015 would be written off at the time such nonrecovery
becomes probable.

 15

Several parties had filed Petitions for Review with the Commonwealth
Court of Pennsylvania regarding the PPUC's orders. On February 21, 2002, the
Court affirmed the PPUC decision regarding approval of the merger, remanding the
decision to the PPUC only with respect to the issue of merger savings. The Court
reversed the PPUC's decision regarding the Company's PLR obligation, and denied
the Company's related requests for rate relief. The Company is considering its
response to the Court's decision, which could include asking the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court to review the decision. The Company is unable to predict the
outcome of these matters.

 The application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," was
discontinued in 1998 with respect to the Company's generation operations. The
Company subsequently divested substantially all of its generating assets. The
Securities and Exchange Commission issued interpretive guidance regarding asset
impairment measurement, concluding that any supplemental regulated cash flows
such as a CTC should be excluded from the cash flows of assets in a portion of
the business not subject to regulatory accounting practices. If those assets are
impaired, a regulatory asset should be established if the costs are recoverable
through regulatory cash flows. All of the Company's regulatory assets are
expected to continue to be recovered under provisions of the Company's
regulatory orders.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT-

 As a result of the merger, certain of the Company's property, plant
and equipment have been adjusted to reflect fair value. The majority of the
Company's property, plant and equipment is reflected at original cost since such
assets remain subject to rate regulation on a historical cost basis.

 The Company provides for depreciation on a straight-line basis at
various rates over the estimated lives of property included in plant in service.
The annualized composite rate was approximately 2.9 in 2001, 2.7 in 2000 and
2.8 in 1999.

 Annual depreciation expense in 2001 included approximately 1.5 million
for future decommissioning costs applicable to the Company's ownership in Unit 2
of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Plant (TMI-2), a demonstration nuclear reactor
owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (in conjunction with JCP&L and
Met-Ed) and decommissioning liabilities for its previously divested nuclear
generating units. The Company's share of the future obligation to decommission
these units is approximately 128.1 million in current dollars and (using a 4.0 
escalation rate) approximately 211.8 million in future dollars. The estimated
obligation and the escalation rate were developed based on site specific
studies. Decommissioning of the demonstration nuclear reactor is expected to be
completed in 2003; payments for decommissioning of TMI-2 are expected to begin
in 2014, when actual decommissioning work is expected to begin. The Company has
recovered approximately 50 million for decommissioning through its electric
rates from customers through December 31, 2001. The Company has also recognized
an estimated liability of approximately 2.3 million related to decontamination
and decommissioning of nuclear enrichment facilities operated by the United
States Department of Energy, as required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

 In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." The new statement
provides accounting treatment for retirement obligations associated with
tangible long-lived assets with adoption required as of January 1, 2003. SFAS
143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred. The associated
asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset. Over time the capitalized costs are depreciated and the
present value of the asset retirement liability increases, resulting in a period
expense. Upon retirement, a gain or loss will be recorded if the costs to settle
the retirement obligation differs from the carrying amount. Under the new
standard, additional assets and liabilities relating principally to nuclear
decommissioning obligations will be recorded, the pattern of expense recognition
will change and income from the external decommissioning trusts will be recorded
as investment income. The Company is currently assessing the new standard and
has not yet quantified the impact on its financial statements.

INCOME TAXES-

 Details of the total provision for income taxes are shown on the
Consolidated Statements of Taxes. Deferred income taxes result from timing
differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and accounting
purposes. Investment tax credits, which were deferred when utilized, are being
amortized over the recovery period of the related property. The liability method
is used to account for deferred income taxes. Deferred income tax liabilities
related to tax and accounting basis differences are recognized at the statutory
income tax rates in effect when the liabilities are expected to be paid. Results
for the period January 1, 2001 through November 6, 2001 are included in the
final consolidated federal income tax return of GPU, and results for the period
November 7, 2001 through December 31, 2001 are included in FirstEnergy's 2001
consolidated federal income tax return. In both cases, the consolidated tax
liability is allocated on a "stand-alone" company basis, with the Company
recognizing the tax benefit for any tax losses or credits it contributed to the
consolidated return.

 16

RETIREMENT BENEFITS-

 Effective December 31, 2001, the Company's defined benefit pension
plan was merged into FirstEnergy's defined benefit pension plan. FirstEnergy's
trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covers almost all of the
Company's full-time employees. Upon retirement, employees receive a monthly
pension based on length of service and compensation. On December 31, 2001, the
GPU pension plans were merged with the FirstEnergy plan. FirstEnergy uses the
projected unit credit method for funding purposes. The assets of the pension
plan consist primarily of common stocks, United States government bonds and
corporate bonds. The FirstEnergy and GPU postretirement benefit plans are
currently separately maintained; the information shown below is aggregated as of
December 31, 2001. Costs for the year 2001 include the former GPU companies'
pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the period November 7, 2001
through December 31, 2001.

 The Company provides a minimum amount of noncontributory life insurance
to retired employees in addition to optional contributory insurance. Health care
benefits, which include certain employee deductibles and copayments, are also
available to retired employees, their dependents and, under certain
circumstances, their survivors. The Company pays insurance premiums to cover a
portion of these benefits in excess of set limits; all amounts up to the limits
are paid by the Company. The Company recognizes the expected cost of providing
other postretirement benefits to employees and their beneficiaries and covered
dependents from the time employees are hired until they become eligible to
receive those benefits.

 The following sets forth the funded status of the plans and amounts
recognized on FirstEnergy's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2001:

 Rate of compensation increase....... 4.00 4.00 

FirstEnergy's net pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the
year ended December 31, 2001 were computed as follows:

 Other
 Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits
 ---------------- -----------------------
 (In millions)
 Service cost......................... 34.9 18.3
 Interest cost........................ 133.3 64.4
 Expected return on plan assets (204.8) (9.9)
 Amortization of transition

 Amortization of prior service cost... 8.8 3.2
 Recognized net actuarial loss (gain). -- 4.9
 Voluntary early retirement program... 6.1 2.3
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Net benefit cost..................... (23.8) 92.4
 ==========================================================================

 The composite health care trend rate assumption is approximately 10 in
2002, 9 in 2003 and 8 in 2004, trending to 4 -6 in later years. Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported

 17

for the health care plan. An increase in the health care trend rate assumption
by one percentage point would increase FirstEnergy's total service and interest
cost components by 14.6 million and the postretirement benefit obligation by
 151.2 million. A decrease in the same assumption by one percentage point would
decrease the total service and interest cost components by 12.7 million and the
postretirement benefit obligation by 131.3 million.

Pre-Merger

 As of December 31, 2000, the Company had on its balance sheet accrued
benefit costs of 1.0 million related to pension obligations. In addition, in
each of the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company recognized in
income net benefit costs/(credits) of 0.1 million for pension benefits.

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES-

 During the three years ended December 31, 2001, GPU Service, Inc., an
affiliated company, provided legal, accounting, financial and other services to
the Company. In addition, prior to the sales of the Company's generating assets
in 1999, affiliated companies GPU Nuclear, Inc. and GPU Generation, Inc.
conducted generation operations for the company. The total cost of services
rendered by affiliates was 156 million, 139 million and 337 million for the
years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Of these amounts, 110 million, 109
million and 259 million were charged to income for the years 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively.

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOWS INFORMATION-

 All temporary cash investments purchased with an initial maturity of
three months or less are reported as cash equivalents on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at cost, which approximates their fair market value.

 All borrowings with initial maturities of less than one year are defined
as financial instruments under GAAP and are reported on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets at cost, which approximates their fair market value. The following sets
forth the approximate fair value and related carrying amounts of all other
long-term debt, preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption and investments
other than cash and cash equivalents as of December 31:

 2001 2000
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair
 Value Value Value Value
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 (In millions)
 Long-term debt............... 519 509 518 497
 Preferred stock.............. 92 90 100 97
 Investments other than cash
 and cash equivalents....... 251 251 289 289
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 862 850 907 883
 =====================================================================

 The fair values of long-term debt and preferred stock reflect the
present value of the cash outflows relating to those securities based on the
current call price, the yield to maturity or the yield to call, as deemed
appropriate at the end of each respective year. The yields assumed were based on
securities with similar characteristics offered by corporations with credit
ratings similar to the Company's ratings. Long-term debt and preferred stock
subject to mandatory redemption were recognized at fair value in connection with
the merger.

 The fair value of investments other than cash and cash equivalents
represent cost (which approximates fair value) or the present value of the cash
inflows based on the yield to maturity. The yields assumed were based on
financial instruments with similar characteristics and terms. Investments other
than cash and cash equivalents include decommissioning trust investments.
Unrealized gains and losses applicable to the decommissioning trusts have been
recognized in the trust investment with a corresponding change to the
decommissioning liability. The Company has no securities held for trading
purposes.

 On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS 138,
"Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities --
an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133." The adoption resulted in the
recognition of derivative assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January
1, 2001 in the amount of 26.0 million, with an offsetting amount, net of tax,
recorded in Regulatory Assets of 25.9 million. As of January 1, 2001, the
Company also recorded derivative liabilities in the amount of 1.0 million as a
result of adopting SFAS 133, with a substantially offsetting amount recorded in
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, of 0.5 million. As of January 1, 2001,
a cumulative effect of accounting change was recognized as an expense in Other
Income (Deductions), Net on the Consolidated Statement of Income in the amount
of 0.8 million.

 The Company is exposed to financial risks resulting from the fluctuation
of interest rates and commodity prices, including electricity and natural gas.
To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the Company uses a

 18

variety Of derivative instruments, including options, futures contracts and
swaps. These derivatives are used principally for hedging purposes. FirstEnergy
has a Risk Policy Committee comprised of executive officers, which exercises an
independent risk oversight function to ensure compliance with corporate risk
management policies and prudent risk management practices.

 The Company uses derivatives to hedge the risk of price and interest
rate fluctuations. The Company's primary ongoing hedging activity involves cash
flow hedges of electricity and natural gas purchases. The majority of the
Company's forward commodity contracts are considered "normal purchases and
sales," as defined by SFAS 133, and are therefore excluded from the scope of
SFAS 138. The options and futures contracts determined to be within the scope of
SFAS 133 are accounted for as cash flow hedges and expire on various dates
through 2002. Gains and losses from hedges of commodity price risks are included
in net income when the underlying hedged commodities are delivered. The Company
also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage the risk of increases in
variable interest rates. The interest rate swap agreements, which were entered
into to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt, are accounted for as cash
flow hedges under SFAS 133, and expire on various dates through 2002. There is
currently a net deferred gain of 1.8 million included in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income as of December 31, 2001 related to derivative hedging
activity, which will be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months
as hedged transactions occur.

 REGULATORY ASSETS-

 The Companies recognize, as regulatory assets, costs which the FERC and
PPUC have authorized for recovery from customers in future periods. Without such
authorization, the costs would have been charged to income as incurred. All
regulatory assets are expected to continue to be recovered from customers under
the Company's regulatory plan. The Company continues to bill and collect
cost-based rates for its transmission and distribution services, which remain
regulated; accordingly, it is appropriate that the Company continues the
application of SFAS 71 to those operations.

 Net regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are comprised
of the following:

 2001 2000
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 (In millions)

 Regulatory transition charge...... 515.9 439.4

2. MERGER:

 On November 7, 2001, the merger of FirstEnergy and GPU became effective
pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 8, 2000. As a result
of the merger, GPU's former wholly owned subsidiaries, including the Company,
became wholly owned subsidiaries of FirstEnergy.

 The merger was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. The
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair values
as determined by FirstEnergy's management based on information currently
available and on current assumptions as to future operations. Merger purchase
accounting adjustments recorded in the records of the Company primarily consist
of: (1) revaluation of certain property, plant and equipment; (2) adjusting
preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption and long-term debt to estimated
fair value; (3) recognizing additional obligations related to retirement
benefits; and (4) recognizing estimated severance and other compensation
liabilities. Other assets and liabilities were not adjusted since they remain
subject to rate regulation on a historical cost basis. The excess of the
purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill, which will not be amortized but
will be reviewed for impairment at least annually. As of December 31, 2001, we
had recorded goodwill of approximately 797.4 million related to the merger.

3. LEASES:

 Consistent with regulatory treatment, the rentals for capital leases are
charged to operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The
Company has a capital lease for an operations building, which expires in 2004.
In both 2001 and 2000, total rentals related to this capital lease were 0.7
million, comprised of an interest element of 0.2 million and other costs of
 0.5 million.

 19

As of December 31, 2001, the future minimum lease payments on the
Company's capital lease discussed above are: 0.7 million, 0.7 million and 0.6
million for the years 2002 through 2004. The present value of the net minimum
lease payments is 1.7 million and the total interest portion is 0.3 million.

4. CAPITALIZATION:

 (A) RETAINED EARNINGS-

 The merger purchase accounting adjustments included resetting the
retained earnings balance to zero at the November 7, 2001 merger date.

 In general, the Company's first mortgage bond (FMB) indentures restrict
the payment of dividends or distributions on or with respect to the Company's
common stock to amounts credited to earned surplus since approximately the date
of its indenture. At such date, the Company had a balance of 10.1 million in
its earned surplus account, which would not be available for dividends or other
distributions. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had retained earnings
available to pay common stock dividends of 0.7 million, net of amounts
restricted under the Company's FMB indentures.

(B) PREFERRED AND PREFERENCE STOCK-

 The Company's preferred stock authorization consists of 11.435 million
shares without par value. No preferred shares are currently outstanding.

(C) COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES OF
 SUBSIDIARY TRUST HOLDING SOLELY PARTNERSHIP PREFERRED SECURITIES-

 The Company has formed a statutory business trust, Penelec Capital
Trust, which is owned through a wholly-owned limited partnership of the Company,
Penelec Capital II, L.P., of which a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company is
the sole general partner. In this transaction, Penelec Capital Trust invested
the gross proceeds from the sale of 100.0 million of its 7.34 trust preferred
securities in the preferred securities of Penelec Capital II, L.P., which in
turn invested those proceeds in 103.1 million of 7.34 subordinated debentures
of the Company. The sole assets of Penelec Capital Trust are the preferred
securities of Penelec Capital II, L.P., whose sole assets are the Company's
subordinated debentures with the same rate and maturity date as the preferred
securities. The Company has effectively provided a full and unconditional
guarantee of its obligations under its trust's preferred securities. The trust
preferred securities, which mature in 2039 and have a liquidation value of
 25.00 per security, are redeemable at the option of the Company beginning in
September 2004 at 100 of their principal amount. The interest on the
subordinated debentures (and therefore the distributions on the preferred
securities) may be deferred for up to 60 months, but the Company may not pay
dividends on, or redeem or acquire, any of its cumulative preferred or common
stock until deferred payments on its subordinated debentures are paid in full.

(D) LONG-TERM DEBT-

 The first mortgage indentures and their supplements, which secure all of
the Company's FMBs, serve as direct first mortgage liens on substantially all
property and franchises, other than specifically excepted property, owned by the
Company.

 Based on the amount of bonds authenticated by the Trustee through
December 31, 2001, the Company's annual sinking and improvement fund
requirements for all bonds issued under the mortgage amount to 12.7 million.
The Company expects to fulfill its sinking and improvement fund obligation by
providing bondable property additions to the Trustee.

 Sinking fund requirements for FMBs and maturing long-term debt
(excluding capital leases) for the next five years are:

 (In millions)
 ---------------------
 2002........ 50.2
 2003........ 0.2
 2004........ 125.2
 2005........ 8.2
 2006........ 0.2
 ----------------------

 20

The Company's obligations to repay certain pollution control revenue
bonds are secured by several series of FMBs. Certain pollution control revenue
bonds are entitled to the benefit of noncancelable municipal bond insurance
policies of 69.3 million to pay principal of, or interest on, the pollution
control revenue bonds.

(E) COMPREHENSIVE INCOME-

 Comprehensive income includes net income as reported on the Consolidated
Statements of Income and all other changes in common stockholder's equity except
those resulting from transactions with the Company's parent. As of December 31,
2001, accumulated other comprehensive income consisted primarily of unrealized
gains on derivative instrument hedges of 1.8 million.

5. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS:

 The Company may borrow from its affiliates on a short-term basis. As of
December 31, 2001, the Company had total short-term borrowings of 77.6 million
from its affiliates with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.9 .

6. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES:

 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES-

 The Company's current forecast reflects expenditures of approximately
 375 million for property additions and improvements from 2002-2006, of which
approximately 72 million is applicable to 2002.

NUCLEAR INSURANCE-

 The Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability relative to a single
incident at a nuclear power plant to 9.5 billion. The amount is covered by a
combination of private insurance and an industry retrospective rating plan.
Based on its present ownership interest in TMI-2, the Company is exempt from any
potential assessment under the industry retrospective rating plan.

 The Company is also insured as to its interest in TMI-2 under a policy
issued to the operating company for the plant. Under this policy, 150 million
is provided for property damage and decontamination and decommissioning costs.
Under this policy, the Company can be assessed a maximum of approximately 0.2
million for incidents at any covered nuclear facility occurring during a policy
year which are in excess of accumulated funds available to the insurer for
paying losses.

 The Company intends to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as
described above as long as it is available. To the extent that property damage,
decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement costs and other such
costs arising from a nuclear incident at TMI-2 exceed the policy limits of the
insurance in effect with respect to that plant, to the extent a nuclear incident
is determined not to be covered by the Company's insurance policies, or to the
extent such insurance becomes unavailable in the future, the Company would
remain at risk for such costs.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS-

 Various environmental liabilities have been recognized on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2001, based on estimates of the
total costs of cleanup, the Company's proportionate responsibility for such
costs and the financial ability of other nonaffiliated entities to pay. The
Company has been named as a "potentially responsible party" (PRP) at waste
disposal sites which may require cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of disposal of
hazardous substances at historical sites, and the liability involved, are often
unsubstantiated and subject to dispute. Federal law provides that all PRPs for a
particular site be held liable on a joint and several basis. The Company has
total accrued liabilities aggregating approximately 1 million as of December
31, 2001. The Company does not believe environmental remediation costs will have
a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of
operations.

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS-

 Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to the Company's normal
business operations are pending against the Company, the most significant of
which is described below.

 21

TMI-2, which was damaged during a 1979 accident, is jointly owned by the
Company, JCP&L and Met-Ed, with the Company having a 25 ownership percentage.
Claims for alleged personal injury against the Company, JCP&L, Met-Ed and GPU
(the defendants) were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District
of Pennsylvania. In 1996, the District Court granted a motion for summary
judgment filed by the defendants and dismissed the ten initial "test cases"
which had been selected for a test case trial, as well as all of the remaining
2,100 pending claims. In November 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit affirmed the District Court's dismissal of the ten "test cases," but set
aside the dismissal of the additional pending claims, remanding them to the
District Court for further proceedings. In September 2000, the defendants filed
for a summary judgment in the District Court. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs appealed
to the Third Circuit for a review of the District Court's decision placing
limitations on the remaining plaintiffs' suit. In April 2001, the Third Circuit
affirmed the District Court's decision. In July 2001, the defendants renewed
their motion for a summary judgment on the remaining 2,100 claims in the
District Court. On January 15, 2002, the District Court granted the defendants'
amended motion for summary judgment. On February 14, 2002, plaintiffs filed a
notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In
addition to the approximately 2,100 claims for which summary judgment has been
granted, there is other pending litigation arising out of the TMI-2 accident.
This litigation consists of the following: eight personal injury cases that were
not consolidated with the above-referenced approximately 2,100 claims; two class
actions brought on behalf of plaintiffs alleging additional injuries diagnosed
after the filing of the complaints in the above-referenced case; a case alleging
exposure during the post-accident cleanup of the TMI-2 plant; and claims by
individual businesses for economic loss resulting from the TMI-2 accident.
Although unable to predict the outcome of this litigation, the Company believes
that any liability to which it might be subject by reason of the TMI-2 accident
will not exceed its financial protection under the Price-Anderson Act.

to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the 2001 financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Pennsylvania Electric
Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 (post-merger), and the results

31, 2001 (post-merger), in conformity with accounting principles generally
