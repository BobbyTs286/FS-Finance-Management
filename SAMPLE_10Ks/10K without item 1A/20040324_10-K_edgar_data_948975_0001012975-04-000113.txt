PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

 Atlantic Realty Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (together
with its subsidiary, the "Trust"), was organized pursuant to a Declaration of
Trust dated July 27, 1995 (as amended, the "Declaration of Trust"). The
principal office of the Trust is located at 747 Third Avenue, New York, New York
10017.

 The Trust commenced operations on May 10, 1996 as a result of a spinoff
(the "Spin-Off Transaction") from RPS Realty Trust ("RPS"). The Spin-Off
Transaction was consummated in order to permit RPS to complete an acquisition
(the "Ramco Acquisition") of assets from Ramco Gershenson, Inc. and its
affiliates ("Ramco"), which permitted RPS to become an equity shopping center
real estate investment trust (a "REIT"). RPS undertook the Spin-Off Transaction
because Ramco was unwilling to consummate the Ramco Acquisition if the assets
that were contributed by RPS to the Trust (the "Trust Assets") remained in RPS.
Pursuant to the Spin-Off Transaction, the board of trustees of RPS approved a
distribution of one common share of beneficial interest (the "Shares") of the
Trust for every eight shares of beneficial interest of RPS (the "Distribution").

 Under the provisions of its Declaration of Trust, the Trust was to
continue for a period of 18 months from May 10, 1996, during which time it was
to reduce to cash or cash equivalents the Trust Assets and either (i) make a
liquidating distribution to its shareholders or (ii) agree to merge or combine
operations with another real estate entity, in either case, as soon as
practicable following the Distribution and within such 18-month period. Such
18-month period was subject to extension if (i) the Trust had not achieved its
objective and the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Shares
approved the extension of such date or (ii) a contingent tax liability relating
to RPS that has been assumed by the Trust had not been satisfactorily resolved.
Because the RPS Tax Issues and the Trust Audit (each as defined below) have not
yet been satisfactorily resolved, the Trust has continued its business past such
18-month period. The Trust cannot currently estimate the timing of the future
satisfactory resolution of the Trust Audit. Accordingly, the Trust will continue
until there is a final determination of this issue. Upon obtaining a
satisfactory resolution to the Trust Audit and liquidating the Trust's remaining
assets, any liquidating distribution effected by the Trust would be subject to
the satisfaction of the Trust's liabilities to its creditors. In the event that
at the end of this period, the Trust is unable to achieve its business
objectives, the members (the "Trustees") of the Trust's board of trustees (the
"Board of Trustees") will appoint an independent third party to liquidate the
Trust's remaining assets.

 As a result of the Spin-Off Transaction, the Trust acquired the Trust
Assets. The Trust Assets which have not been disposed of by the Trust are
described below under "-- Description of Trust Assets." The Trust's principal
investment objective is to maximize shareholder value from the reduction of the
Trust Assets to cash or cash equivalents. As part of its plan to liquidate the
Trust Assets to cash or cash equivalents, the Trust intends, among other things,
and subject to the Internal Revenue Service's ("IRS") consideration of the
appeals filed, by RPS and the Trust in connection with the examination reports
issued by the IRS in connection with their audits of RPS and the Trust (as more
fully described below under "-- Tax Contingency") to continue to: (i)

1

contact strategic buyers of the Trust's remaining asset (the Hylan Plaza
Shopping Center, located in Staten Island, New York (the "Hylan Center"))
regarding possible sales transactions and (ii) list the Hylan Center for sale
with qualified real estate brokers. No assurance can be given, however, that
such objective will be achieved. The Trust expects to continue to invest the net
proceeds from sales of the Trust Assets in short-term or temporary investments,
such as certificates of deposit, pass-through mortgage-backed certificates,
mortgage participation certificates and mortgaged-backed securities (or similar
investment products), all or some of which investments may be guaranteed by
Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Unless otherwise approved by the
shareholders, the Trust does not expect that it will make new permanent
investments or raise additional capital. In addition, the Trust does not expect
to acquire additional mortgage loans or properties.

 In addition, the Trust may explore the possibility of merging or entering
into a business combination with another real estate entity. The Trust expects
that it will pursue such a transaction only if it represents an attractive
alternative to the distribution to shareholders of the net proceeds from the
orderly liquidation of the Trust Assets, as described above. The merger
candidates that may be available to the Trust may be limited as a result of the
amount of cash and the nature of the assets which the Trust will hold.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Trust will successfully merge or
combine operations with another real estate entity. Because the Trust has
adopted a policy not to re-invest sales proceeds in additional mortgage loans on
real estate (except to the extent necessary to satisfy applicable REIT
requirements), a merger or other business combination involving the Trust and
another real estate entity may constitute a "roll-up transaction" under
applicable securities laws. In such case, the Trust would be required to comply
with the heightened disclosure rules as well as special rules relating to the
proxy solicitation process and the listing of the securities of the surviving
company on any exchange or the inclusion for quotation of such securities on the
Nasdaq Small Cap Market. Application of the roll-up rules to a company merger or
business combination could delay, defer or prevent such a transaction from
occurring.

 The Trust was organized for the purpose of qualifying as a REIT under
sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
The Trust will elect to qualify as a REIT for the year ended December 31, 2003
and intends to operate so as to continue to qualify as a REIT.

 As of December 31, 2003, the Trust had six employees.

DESCRIPTION OF TRUST ASSETS

 As of December 31, 2003, the Trust owned and operated one real property,
the Hylan Center and held short-term investments in the principal amount of
approximately 22,500,000, consisting primarily of a certificate of deposit at a
major New York bank.

REAL PROPERTY INVESTMENT

 THE HYLAN PLAZA SHOPPING CENTER. At December 31, 2003, the Trust held an
equity investment in one property, the Hylan Center. The Hylan Center is a
one-story community shopping center located in Staten Island, New York which was
acquired by the Trust in April,

2

1996. The Hylan Center contains approximately 359,000 square feet of leasable
space approximately 99 of which was leased and occupied as of December 31,
2003. Major tenants (i.e., tenants who accounted for 10 or more of the leasable
space as of December 31, 2003) include K-Mart Corp., a department store chain
("K-Mart"), Pathmark Stores, Inc. ("Pathmark"), and the Toys "R" Us -- NY
L.L.C., a retail toy store chain ("Toys "R" Us"). These three tenants lease
approximately 104,000, 60,000 and 42,000 square feet, respectively, which
constitutes 29 , 17 and 12 , respectively, of the total leasable space. The
K-Mart lease expires in January 2007 and provides for annual base rental
payments of approximately 235,000; the Pathmark lease expires in January 2007
and provides for annual base rental payments of approximately 579,000; and the
Toys "R" Us lease expires in October 2005 and provides for annual base rental
payments of approximately 90,000. The K-Mart lease contains two 5-year tenant
renewal options; the Pathmark lease contains six 5-year tenant renewal options;
and the Toys "R" Us lease contains one 10-year tenant renewal option. Leases for
approximately 35,000 square feet are due to expire on or prior to December 31,
2004. The approximate base rental revenue as of December 31, 2003 was
approximately 4,422,000. The average base rental revenue per leased square foot
as of December 31, 2003 was 12.33, excluding percentage rent and similar
provisions. The Trust believes the property is adequately covered by insurance.
As of December 31, 2003, the estimated net realizable value of the Hylan Center
was approximately 44,144,000, including estimated cash flows using a
disposition period of 9 months. Realized values may differ depending on actual
disposition results and time periods.

 Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances
and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be
liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances
on, under or in such property. Such laws often impose liability whether or not
the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such
hazardous or toxic substances. In connection with the ownership, operation and
management of the Hylan Center, the Trust may be potentially liable for removal
or remediation costs, as well as certain other related costs, including
governmental fines and injuries to persons and property. Certain environmental
laws and common law principles could also be used to impose liability for
release of an exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing
materials ("ACMs") into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners
or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage
associated with exposure to released hazardous substances, including ACMs. As
the owner of the Hylan Center, the Trust may be potentially liable for any such
costs.

QUALIFICATION AS A REIT

 The Trust intends to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.
If the Trust so qualifies, amounts paid by the Trust as distributions to its
shareholders will not be subject to corporate income taxes. For any year in
which the Trust does not meet the requirements for electing to be taxed as a
REIT, it will be taxed as a corporation.

 The requirements for qualification as a REIT are contained in Sections
856-860 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The following
discussion is a brief summary of some of those requirements. Such requirements
include certain provisions relating to the nature of a REIT's assets, the
sources of its income, the ownership of its stock, and the distribution of its
income. Among other things, at the end of each fiscal quarter, at least 75 of

3

the value of the total assets of the Company must consist of real estate assets
(including interests in mortgage loans secured by real property and interests in
other REITs, as well as cash, cash items and government securities) (the "75 
Asset Test"). There are also certain limitations on the amount of other types of
securities which can be held by a REIT. Additionally, at least 75 of the gross
income of the Company for the taxable year must be derived from certain sources,
which include "rents from real property," and interest secured by mortgages on
real property. An additional 20 of the gross income of the Company must be
derived from these same sources or from dividends, interest from any source, or
gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or any
combination of the foregoing.

 The Trust may invest the proceeds derived from the sale or other
disposition of the Trust Assets in pass-through, mortgage-backed certificates,
mortgage participation certificates and mortgage-backed securities, all or some
of which instruments may be guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
Such instruments produce qualifying income for REIT qualification purposes and
also satisfy the requirements of the 75 Asset Test. A REIT is also required to
distribute at least 90 of its REIT Taxable Income (as defined in the Code) to
its shareholders.

TAX CONTINGENCY

 During the third quarter of 1994, RPS held more than 25 of the value of
its gross assets in overnight Treasury Bill reverse repurchase transactions
which the IRS may view as non-qualifying assets for the purposes of satisfying
an asset qualification test applicable to REITs, based on a Revenue Ruling
published in 1977 (the "Asset Issue"). RPS requested that the IRS enter into a
closing agreement with RPS that the Asset Issue would not impact RPS' status as
a REIT. The IRS declined such request. In February 1995, the IRS initiated an
examination of the 1991-1995 income tax returns of RPS (the "RPS Audit" and,
together with the Asset Issue, the "RPS Tax Issues"). Based on developments in
the law which occurred since 1977, RPS' tax counsel at that time, Battle Fowler
LLP, rendered an opinion that RPS' investment in Treasury Bill repurchase
obligations would not adversely affect its REIT status. However, such opinion is
not binding upon the IRS.

 In connection with the Spin-Off Transaction, the Trust assumed all tax
liability arising out of the RPS Tax Issues (other than liability that relates
to events occurring or actions taken by RPS following the date of the Spin-Off
Transaction) pursuant to a tax agreement, dated May 10, 1996, by and between RPS
and the Trust (the "Tax Agreement"). Such agreement provides that RPS (now named
Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust), under the direction of four trustees, three
of whom are also trustees of the Trust (the "Continuing Trustees") and not the
Trust, will control, conduct and effect the settlement of any tax claims against
RPS relating to the RPS Tax Issues. Accordingly, the Trust did not have any
control as to the timing of the resolution or disposition of any such claims.

 In December 2003, Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust and the Internal
Revenue Service entered into a closing agreement ("Closing Agreement") with
respect to all of the issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service in
connection with RPS Audit. As a condition of the Closing Agreement,
Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust was obligated to pay deficiency dividends
(under Code Sec. 860) with respect to its 1992 and 1993 taxable year in amounts
not less than 1,386,503 with respect to the 1992 taxable year and 809,010 with
respect to the 1993

4

taxable year. In addition, Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust is obligated to pay
a deficiency in its income taxes with respect to the period covered by the RPS
Audit equal to 770,258, plus interest calculated at the statutory rate on the
amount of the deficiency and the amount of the deficiency dividends. The
aggregate amount of the deficiency dividends, income tax deficiency and interest
on these amounts is approximately 7,400,000. Although the Closing Agreement
provides that the election of Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust to be taxed as a
"real estate investment trust" was terminated with respect to its 1994 and 1995
taxable years, it also provides that Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust will be
treated as having reelected to be taxed as a "real estate investment trust" with
respect to its taxable year beginning January 1, 1996 and that the termination
of its election to be taxed as a "real estate investment trust" will not
prohibit it or any successor entity (which includes the Trust) from electing to
be taxed as a "real estate investment trust" on or after January 1, 1996.

 The Trust remains obligated under the Tax Agreement to assume certain
liabilities relating to the RPS Tax Issues. The Trust established a special
committee (the "Special Committee regarding RPS Tax Issues") comprised of the
two Trustees who are not Continuing Trustees or otherwise affiliated with
Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust to act on behalf of the Trust in evaluating
the position of the Trust with respect to the RPS Tax Issues and to represent
the Trust with respect to any claims asserted by Ramco-Gershenson Properties
Trust for contribution arising out of the Closing Agreement. On January 21,
2004, the Trust contributed 2,200,091 in respect of the deficiency dividend
required to be paid pursuant to the Closing Agreement. The Trust will be
obligated to make additional payments with respect to the RPS Tax Issues and the
Closing Agreement as a result of its obligations under the Tax Agreement. In the
event the Trust is presented with further requests or claims for payment or
reimbursement arising in connection with the RPS Tax Issues and the Closing
Agreement, the Special Committee regarding RPS Tax Issues will evaluate the
Trust's further obligations at the time of its receipt of any such claim or
request.

 On February 21, 2003, the IRS issued an examination report to the Trust
with respect to the 1996 and 1997 taxable years of the Trust ("Trust Audit").
This examination report proposes to disallow all of the loss deductions claimed
by the Trust upon the disposition of Trust Assets during that period. In
addition, the examination report proposes to increase the REIT taxable income of
the Trust during 1996 and 1997 on account of two items reported on the Trust's
tax returns for which the Trust did not claim any taxable loss or deduction.
Counsel to the Trust has advised that the examination report contains numerous
errors of fact with respect to the operations of the Trust and that the legal
conclusions in the examination report are not consistent with the applicable
provisions of the Code and the income tax regulations. The Trust timely filed an
administrative appeals (the "Trust Protest") challenging the adjustments
proposed in the examination report.

 Apart from transferring the responsibility of the Trust's appeal of the
examination report to the IRS appeals office having jurisdiction for this case,
no action has yet been taken by the IRS with respect to the Trust's Protest to
the disallowances proposed in the examination report issued to the Trust.

FIRST UNION PROPOSAL

 On January 12, 2004, First Union Real Estate Equity and Mortgage
Investments, an Ohio business trust ("First Union"), and Michael L. Ashner, the
Chief Executive Officer of First Union (together with First Union, the "First
Union Group"), filed a Statement of Beneficial Ownership on Schedule 13D (the
"Schedule 13D") pursuant to which the First Union Group reported, among other
things, that it had made a formal proposal to the Trust to merge the Trust with
and into First Union or one of its subsidiaries (the "First Union Proposal").

 The First Union Proposal contemplates that each share of beneficial
interest in the Trust (a "Trust Share") would receive aggregate consideration of
 16.25 per Trust Share. Such amount would be payable, at the election of each
shareholder of the Trust (a "Trust Shareholder"), in cash or in exchange for
First Union's Series A cumulative convertible redeemable preferred shares of
beneficial interest (the "First Union Preferred Shares") at a rate of 0.65 First
Union Preferred Shares per Trust Share. In the event that Trust Shareholders
holding more than 1,901,760 Trust Shares in the aggregate elect to receive First
Union Preferred Shares, such Trust Shareholders would receive (i) a number of
First Union Preferred Shares equal to (a) 0.65 multiplied by (b) a fraction, the
numerator of which is 1,901,760 and the denominator of which is the total number
of Trust Shares to be exchanged for First Union Preferred Shares and (ii) cash
equal to (x) 16.25 multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of Trust Shares to be exchanged for First Union Preferred Shares less
1,901,760 and the denominator of which is the number of Trust Shares to be
exchanged for First Union Preferred Shares. The consideration payable would be
subject to upward or downward adjustment based on the Trust's projected
post-closing net cash balance, information obtained through First Union's due
diligence process and any stock splits, issuances, repurchases,
reclassifications and other transactions affecting the value of the Trust.

 On January 13, 2004, the Board of Trustees of the Trust (the "Board")
held a meeting to discuss the First Union Proposal and the process it would
undertake to evaluate it. The Board resolved to form a special committee of
disinterested directors consisting of Messrs. Glickman, Blank and Pashcow (the
"Special Committee") to consider any bona fide offer or acquisition proposal
made for the Trust and to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to maximize
shareholder value while having regard to the Trust's existing contractual
obligations. Among other things, the Board instructed the Special Committee to
(i) review, negotiate and make recommendations to the Board with respect to the
First Union Proposal, (ii) conduct such other investigation of the First Union
Proposal, First Union and the Trust as may be necessary to determine whether the
First Union Proposal is in the best interests of Trust Shareholders and (iii)
investigate other strategic alternatives available to the Trust.

 On January 26, 2004, the Special Committee held an organizational meeting
and commenced its evaluation of the First Union Proposal as directed by the
Board. In addition, the Special Committee has retained an independent real
estate brokerage firm to conduct a valuation of the Trust's sole asset, the
Hylan Shopping Center located in Staten Island, New York. In connection with the

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
LIQUIDATION ACTIVITIES.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY -- ATLANTIC REALTY TRUST

 The Trust's primary objective has been to liquidate its assets in an
eighteen-month period from the date of the Spin-Off Transaction while realizing
the maximum values for such assets; however because the RPS Tax Issues had not
been settled within such time and the Trust Audit has not been satisfactorily
resolved, the Trust has continued its business beyond such period. Although the
Trust considers its assumptions and estimates as to the values and timing of
such liquidations to be reasonable, the period of time to liquidate the assets
and distribute the proceeds of such assets is subject to significant business,
economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are
beyond the Trust's control. There can be no assurance that the net values
ultimately realized and costs actually incurred for such assets will not
materially differ from the Trust's estimate. The Trust does not intend to make
new loans or actively engage in either the mortgage lending or the property
acquisition business.

 The Trust believes that cash and cash equivalents on hand, proceeds
generated by the real estate property that it owns and operates (the Hylan
Center) and proceeds from the eventual sale of such property will be sufficient
to support the Trust and meet its obligations. As of December 31, 2003, the
Trust had approximately 23,198,000 in cash and short-term investments.

 The Trust expects that, unless it is sold or merges with another entity,
it will liquidate upon resolution of the RPS Tax Issues, the Trust Audit and any
resolution of any liabilities relating thereto under the Tax Agreement.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2001 TO DECEMBER 31, 2001, JANUARY 1, 2002 TO DECEMBER
31, 2002 AND JANUARY 1, 2003 TO DECEMBER 31, 2003.

 As a result of the spin-off transaction, the Trust has adopted the
liquidation basis of accounting. The liquidation basis of accounting is
appropriate when liquidation appears imminent and the Trust is no longer viewed
as a going concern. The Trust's income or loss is included in the adjustments to
reflect liquidation basis of accounting. Net income for the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was approximately 1,580,000, 2,187,000 and 2,701,000
respectively. The decrease in net assets in liquidation during 2003 is primarily
due to the Trust's accrual of a liability of approximately 7,400,000 to
Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust with regard to the settlement of the RPS Tax
Issues, including obligations arising from the Closing Agreement.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

 As of December 31, 2003, the Trust has approximately 23,198,000 of cash
and short term investments. The earnings from these assets are affected by
changes in market interest rates over which the Trust has no control. Although
changes in market interest rates may significantly

9

affect the earnings on these assets the impact in changes in rates on the
Trust's net assets in liquidation is not expected to be material.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

 See pages F-1 through F-10, which are included herein.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
 FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

 None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 As of the end of period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the
Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of and with the
participation of the Company's management, including the Company's President and
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule
13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon
that evaluation, the President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective (i) to ensure that
material information relating to the Trust is communicated to them on a timely
basis, and (ii) to accomplish the purposes for which they were designed. There
were no material changes made in the Company's internal controls over financial
reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2003 that has
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Trust's
internal control over financial reporting.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Trustees of
Atlantic Realty Trust

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of net assets in
liquidation of Atlantic Realty Trust and subsidiary (the "Trust") as of December
31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of changes in net
assets in liquidation for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2003. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Trust was
formed for the purpose of liquidating the mortgage loan portfolio and certain
other assets and liabilities which were transferred to the Trust from RPS Realty
Trust on May 1, 1996 and liquidating and distributing capital to the Trust's
shareholders. As a result, the Trust adopted the liquidation basis of
accounting, effective May 10, 1996.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the net assets in liquidation of Atlantic Realty Trust and
subsidiary as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the changes in their net assets
in liquidation for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America on the basis described in the preceding paragraph.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, because
of the inherent uncertainty of valuation when an entity is in liquidation, the
amounts ultimately realized from assets disposed and costs incurred to settle
liabilities may differ materially from amounts presented in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

ATLANTIC REALTY TRUST AND SUBSIDIARY
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 (LIQUIDATION BASIS OF ACCOUNTING)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 Atlantic Realty Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the
"Trust"), was formed on July 27, 1995 for the purpose of liquidating its
interests in real properties, its mortgage loan portfolio and certain other
assets and liabilities which were transferred to the Trust from Ramco-Gershenson
Properties Trust (formerly named RPS Realty Trust) ("RPS") on May 10, 1996 (the
"Spin-Off Transaction"). The Trust had no operations from the date of formation
to the date of the Spin-Off Transaction. The Trust adopted the liquidation basis
of accounting as of the date of the Spin-Off Transaction based on its intention
to liquidate its assets or merge or combine operations with another real estate
entity within eighteen months from the date of the Spin-Off Transaction. The
Trust intends to conduct its operations with the intent of meeting the
requirements applicable to a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under
Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"). As a result, the Trust will have no current or deferred income tax
liabilities.

 Liquidation Basis of Accounting -- As a result of the Spin-Off
Transaction, the Trust has adopted the liquidation basis of accounting. The
liquidation basis of accounting is appropriate when liquidation appears imminent
and the Trust is no longer viewed as a going concern. Under this method of
accounting, assets are stated at their estimated net realizable values and
liabilities are stated at the anticipated settlement amounts.

 The valuations presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Net Assets in Liquidation represent the estimates at the dates shown, based on
current facts and circumstances, of the estimated net realizable value of the
assets and estimated costs of liquidating the Trust. In determining the net
realizable values of the assets, the Trust considered each asset's ability to
generate future cash flows, offers to purchase received from third parties, if
any, and other general market information. Such information was considered in
conjunction with operating the Trust's plan for disposition of assets. The
estimated costs of liquidation represent the estimated cost of operating the
Trust through its anticipated termination. These costs primarily include
payroll, consulting and related costs, rent, shareholder relations, legal and
auditing. Changes in these costs during the periods presented are reflected in
the adjustments to reflect liquidation basis of accounting. Computations of net
realizable value necessitate the use of certain assumptions and estimates.
Future events, including economic conditions that relate to real estate markets
in general, may differ from those assumed or estimated at the time such
computations are made. Because of inherent uncertainty of valuation when an
entity is in liquidation, the amounts ultimately realized from assets disposed
and costs incurred to settle liabilities may materially differ from amounts
presented.

 Pursuant to the terms of the Trust's Amended and Restated Declaration of
Trust, the Trust was to continue for a period of 18 months from the date of the
Spin-Off Transaction, subject to, among certain other things, satisfactory
resolution of the RPS Tax Issues (as such term is defined in footnote 6).
Because the RPS Tax Issues have not yet been satisfactorily resolved, the Trust
has continued its business past that date. The Trust cannot currently estimate

F-5

ATLANTIC REALTY TRUST AND SUBSIDIARY
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 (LIQUIDATION BASIS OF ACCOUNTING)

the timing of the future satisfactory resolution of the RPS Tax Issues.
Accordingly, the Trust will continue until there is a final determination of
these issues.

 CONSOLIDATION -- The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Trust and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

5. OTHER ASSETS

 Other assets include the estimated interest income from the Trust's
short-term investments.

6. INCOME TAXES

 During the third quarter of 1994, RPS held more than 25 of the value of
its gross assets in overnight Treasury Bill reverse repurchase transactions
which the IRS may view as non-qualifying assets for the purposes of satisfying
an asset qualification test applicable to REITs, based on a Revenue Ruling
published in 1977 (the "Asset Issue"). RPS requested that the IRS enter into a
closing agreement with RPS that the Asset Issue would not impact RPS' status as
a REIT. The IRS declined such request. In February 1995, the IRS initiated an
examination of the 1991-1995 income tax returns of RPS (the "RPS Audit" and,
together with the Asset Issue, the "RPS Tax Issues"). Based on developments in
the law which occurred since 1977, RPS' tax counsel at that time, Battle Fowler
LLP, rendered an opinion that RPS' investment in Treasury Bill repurchase
obligations would not adversely affect its REIT status. However, such opinion is
not binding upon the IRS.

 In connection with the Spin-Off Transaction, the Trust assumed all tax
liability arising out of the RPS Tax Issues (other than liability that relates
to events occurring or actions taken by RPS following the date of the Spin-Off
Transaction) pursuant to a tax agreement, dated May 10, 1996, by and between RPS
and the Trust (the "Tax Agreement"). Such agreement provides that RPS (now named
Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust), under the direction of four trustees, three
of whom are also trustees of the Trust (the "Continuing Trustees") and not the
Trust, will control, conduct and effect the settlement of any tax claims against
RPS relating to the RPS Tax Issues. Accordingly, the Trust did not have any
control as to the timing of the resolution or disposition of any such claims.

 In December 2003, Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust and the Internal
Revenue Service entered into a Closing Agreement with respect to all of the
issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service in connection with RPS Audit. As a
condition of the Closing Agreement, Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust was
obligated to pay deficiency dividends (under Code Sec. 860) with respect to its
1992 and 1993 taxable year in amounts not less than 1,386,503 with respect to
the 1992 taxable year and 809,010 with respect to the 1993 taxable year. In
addition, Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust is obligated to pay a deficiency in
its income taxes with respect to the period covered by the RPS Audit equal to
 770,258, plus interest calculated at the statutory rate on the amount of the
deficiency and the amount of the deficiency dividends. The aggregate amount of
the deficiency dividends, income tax deficiency and interest on these amounts is
approximately 7,400,000, and because the Trust is required by the Tax Agreement
to reimburse Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust for these items, they are
included in the estimated cost of liquidation as of December 31, 2003. Although
the Closing Agreement provides that the election of Ramco-Gershenson Properties
Trust to be taxed as a "real estate investment trust" was terminated with
respect to its 1994 and 1995 taxable years, it also provides

F-7

ATLANTIC REALTY TRUST AND SUBSIDIARY
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 (LIQUIDATION BASIS OF ACCOUNTING)

that Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust will be treated as having reelected to be
taxed as a "real estate investment trust" with respect to its taxable year
beginning January 1, 1996 and that the termination of its election to be taxed
as a "real estate investment trust" will not prohibit it or any successor entity
(which includes the Trust) from electing to be taxed as a "real estate
investment trust" on or after January 1, 1996.

 The Trust remains obligated under the Tax Agreement to assume certain
liabilities relating to the RPS Tax Issues. The Trust established a special
committee (the "Special Committee regarding RPS Tax Issues") comprised of the
two Trustees who are not Continuing Trustees or otherwise affiliated with
Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust to act on behalf of the Trust in evaluating
the position of the Trust with respect to the RPS Tax Issues and to represent
the Trust with respect to any claims asserted by Ramco-Gershenson Properties
Trust for contribution arising out of the Closing Agreement. On January 21,
2004, the Trust contributed 2,200,091 in respect of the deficiency dividend
required to be paid pursuant to the Closing Agreement. The Trust will be
obligated to make additional payments with respect to the RPS Tax Issues and the
Closing Agreement as a result of its obligations under the Tax Agreement. In the
event the Trust is presented with further requests or claims for payment or
reimbursement arising in connection with the RPS Tax Issues and the Closing
Agreement, the Special Committee regarding RPS Tax Issues will evaluate the
Trust's further obligations at the time of its receipt of any such claim or
request.

 On February 21, 2003, the IRS issued an examination report to the Trust
with respect to the 1996 and 1997 taxable years of the Trust. This examination
report proposes to disallow all of the loss deductions claimed by the Trust upon
the disposition of Trust Assets during that period. In addition, the examination
report proposes to increase the REIT taxable income of the Trust during 1996 and
1997 on account of two items reported on the Trust's tax returns for which the
Trust did not claim any taxable loss or deduction. Counsel to the Trust has
advised that the examination report contains numerous errors of fact with
respect to the operations of the Trust and that the legal conclusions in the
examination report are not consistent with the applicable provisions of the Code
and the income tax regulations. The Trust timely filed an administrative appeals
(the "Trust Protest") challenging the adjustments proposed in the examination
report.

 Apart from transferring the responsibility of the Trust's appeal of the
examination report to the IRS appeals office having jurisdiction for this case,
no action has yet been taken by the IRS with respect to the Trust's Protest to
the disallowances proposed in the examination report issued to the Trust. The
outcome of the Trust Protest is uncertain and the impact of the resolution could
be material to the financial statements.

7. DIVIDENDS/DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

 Under the Internal Revenue Code, a REIT must meet certain qualifications,
including a requirement that it distribute annually to its shareholders at least
90 percent of its REIT taxable income. The Trust's policy is to distribute to
shareholders all taxable income. Dividend distributions for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 are summarized as follows:

December 14, 2001 .76 per share December 27, 2001

The distributions listed in the table above represent ordinary income for income
tax purposes.

8. COMMITMENTS

 The Trust leases approximately 4,100 square feet of office space at 747
Third Avenue, New York, New York at an annual base rent of approximately
 264,000. This lease will expire on October 31, 2004.

9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

 On January 12, 2004, First Union Real Estate Equity and Mortgage
Investments, an Ohio business trust ("First Union"), and Michael L. Ashner, the
Chief Executive Officer of First Union (together with First Union, the "First
Union Group"), filed a Statement of Beneficial Ownership on Schedule 13D (the
"Schedule 13D") pursuant to which the First Union Group reported, among other
things, that it had made a formal proposal to the Trust to merge the Trust with
and into First Union or one of its subsidiaries (the "First Union Proposal").

 The First Union Proposal contemplates that each share of beneficial
interest in the Trust (a "Trust Share") would receive aggregate consideration of
 16.25 per Trust Share. Such amount would be payable, at the election of each
shareholder of the Trust (a "Trust Shareholder"), in cash or in exchange for
First Union's Series A cumulative convertible redeemable preferred shares of
beneficial interest (the "First Union Preferred Shares") at a rate of 0.65 First
Union Preferred Shares per Trust Share. In the event that Trust Shareholders
holding more than 1,901,760 Trust Shares in the aggregate elect to receive First
Union Preferred Shares, such Trust Shareholders would receive (i) a number of
First Union Preferred Shares equal to (a) 0.65 multiplied by (b) a fraction, the
numerator of which is 1,901,760 and the denominator of which is the total number
of Trust Shares to be exchanged for First Union Preferred Shares and (ii) cash
equal to (x) 16.25 multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of Trust Shares to be exchanged for First Union Preferred Shares less
1,901,760 and the denominator of which is the number of Trust Shares to be
exchanged for First Union Preferred Shares. The consideration payable would be
subject to upward or downward adjustment based on the Trust's projected
post-closing net cash balance, information obtained through First

Union's due diligence process and any stock splits, issuances, repurchases,
reclassifications and other transactions affecting the value of the Trust.

 On January 13, 2004, the Board of Trustees of the Trust (the "Board")
held a meeting to discuss the First Union Proposal and the process it would
undertake to evaluate it. The Board resolved to form a special committee of
disinterested directors consisting of Messrs. Glickman, Blank and Pashcow (the
"Special Committee") to consider any bona fide offer or acquisition proposal
made for the Trust and to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to maximize
shareholder value while having regard to the Trust's existing contractual
obligations. Among other things, the Board instructed the Special Committee to
(i) review, negotiate and make recommendations to the Board with respect to the
First Union Proposal, (ii) conduct such other investigation of the First Union
Proposal, First Union and the Trust as may be necessary to determine whether the
First Union Proposal is in the best interests of Trust Shareholders and (iii)
investigate other strategic alternatives available to the Trust.

 On January 26, 2004, the Special Committee held an organizational meeting
and commenced its evaluation of the First Union Proposal as directed by the
Board. In addition, the Special Committee has retained an independent real
estate brokerage firm to conduct a valuation of the Trust's sole asset, the
Hylan Shopping Center located in Staten Island, New York. In connection with the
valuation process that has commenced with respect to the Hylan Shopping Center,
management expects the valuation of the property to be higher than the current
valuation of approximately 44.1 million (based on an appraisal dated October 8,
2002) included in the Trust's Consolidated Statements of Net Assets in
Liquidation.

 As of the date of this filing, the Special Committee has made no
determination as to whether the Trust will or should engage in a transaction of
the type contemplated by the First Union Proposal, whether on the terms of the
First Union Proposal or otherwise, and there can be no assurance that the Trust
will accept any acquisition proposal or that any such proposal, if accepted,
will result in the consummation of a transaction.

operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information; and
