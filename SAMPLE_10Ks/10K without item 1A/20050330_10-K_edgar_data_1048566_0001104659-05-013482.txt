PART I 

 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

 General 

 Fog Cutter Capital Group Inc. FCCG or the Company operates a restaurant business, conducts commercial mortgage lending and
brokerage activities and makes real estate investments. The Company also seeks
to acquire controlling interests in underperforming or undervalued operating
businesses in which the Company s management skills and financial structuring
can create value. 

 The Company was originally
incorporated as Wilshire Real Estate Investment Trust Inc. in the State of
Maryland on October 24, 1997. However, we chose not to elect the tax
status of a real estate investment trust REIT and on January 25, 2001,
we changed our name to Fog Cutter Capital Group Inc. to better reflect the
diversified nature of our business. Our capital stock is traded over the
counter on the Pink Sheets under the ticker symbol FCCG . 

 Available Information 

 Our website is www.fccgi.com. We make our annual report on Form 10-K,
as well as other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable
after they are filed. A copy of our annual report may also be obtained by
writing to us at 1410 SW Jefferson Street, Portland, Oregon 97201, Attn: Investor
Reporting. 

 Business Strategy 

 Our business strategy
consists of developing, strengthening and expanding our restaurant and
commercial real estate mortgage brokerage operations and continuing to identify
and acquire real estate investments with favorable risk-adjusted returns. We
also seek to identify and acquire controlling interests in other operating
businesses in which we feel we can add value. Our operating segments consist of
(i) restaurant operations conducted through our subsidiary, Fatburger
Holdings, Inc. Fatburger ), (ii) commercial real estate mortgage
brokerage activities conducted through our majority-owned subsidiary, George
Elkins Mortgage Banking Company George Elkins and (iii) real estate,
merchant banking and financing activities. The following is a summary of each
of the operating segments: 

 Restaurant Operations 

 Our Fatburger subsidiary
operates 26 hamburger restaurants and franchises 36 additional restaurants
located primarily in California and Nevada. Known for their cook to
order gourmet hamburgers, the 50 s-style restaurants also offer a variety
of side orders and other sandwiches. The first Fatburger stand was opened in
1952 in Los Angeles when fat was used as slang for good. As of December 31,
2004, we owned approximately 71 of the voting control of Fatburger. Fatburger
plans to significantly expand its franchising operations throughout the United
States and has sold the rights to open 220 additional restaurants to
approximately 20 individual franchisees. During the year ended December 31,
2004, franchise rights to open 31 individual Fatburger restaurants were sold. Ten
new restaurants were opened during the period, including 3 company-owned
locations. Royalty revenues were approximately 1.2 million for the year 

 Commercial Real Estate Mortgage Brokerage Operations 

 Our George Elkins
subsidiary provided brokerage services related to the production of over 700
million in commercial real estate mortgages during 2004. George Elkins is
headquartered in Los Angeles, with satellite offices located throughout the
southern California area and in Las Vegas. The mortgage brokerage operation
also manages a commercial loan servicing portfolio in excess of 700 million
for various investors. We own 51 of the voting control of George Elkins. 

2 

Real Estate, Merchant Banking and Financing Operations 

 We invest in or finance
real estate and other real estate-related or finance-related assets. Our
merchant banking and financing operations focus on the acquisition of
controlling interests in businesses in the process of restructuring. This can
take the form of assisting in a management buy-out, refinancing corporate debt
or acquiring the non-core assets of a business.

 The following sections
provide additional information on our principal assets and operations as of December 31,
2004. 

 Restaurant Operation 

 Fatburger. We acquired the
controlling interest in Fatburger in August 2003. Our investment consists
of convertible preferred stock (the Series A Preferred and redeemable
convertible preferred stock (the Series D Preferred ). As a result of our
voting control, we began reporting the operations of Fatburger on a
consolidated basis beginning August 15, 2003. 

 The Series A Preferred is convertible into a 50 
ownership interest of the common stock of Fatburger on a fully diluted basis.
The Company owns approximately 93 of the issued and outstanding Series A
Preferred, and currently holds voting rights equal to 71 of the voting control
of Fatburger. The Series A Preferred is not redeemable and does not pay
dividends. 

 The Series D Preferred has a liquidation
preference and is redeemable by Fatburger for 10.1 million plus accrued but
unpaid dividends. Dividends accrue at a rate of 20 of the redemption value,
compounded annually. The Series D Preferred does not have any voting
rights but may be converted into common stock under certain circumstances. The
Company owns all of the issued and outstanding Series D Preferred. 

 The accompanying
consolidated statements of financial condition include net restaurant property,
plant and equipment of 6.2 million relating to Fatburger operations as of December 31,
2004. Intangible assets, consisting primarily of Fatburger trademarks and
franchises, totaled 5.4 million at year end. The acquisition of Fatburger also
resulted in the recording of goodwill, which at December 31, 2004 totaled
 7.1 million. 

3 

The accompanying
consolidated statements of financial condition also include borrowings and
notes payable of 6.3 million as of December 31, 2004 as a result of the
consolidation of Fatburger. Of this amount, approximately 5.6 million is
secured by substantially all of the assets of Fatburger, bears interest at
rates currently ranging from 5.8 to 6.9 and requires monthly payments of
principal and interest, primarily through 2014. The debt was refinanced in September 2004
and requires adherence to financial covenants and conditions with which
management believes Fatburger was in compliance as of December 31, 2004. Borrowings
and notes payable also include mandatory redeemable preferred stock (the Series B
Preferred with a carrying value of 0.7 million which was issued by Fatburger
to a third party on August 15, 2003. The Series B Preferred is
redeemable by Fatburger for 1.5 million at any time, but must be redeemed by August 15,
2009. Under certain circumstances, the Series B Preferred shareholders may
convert their shares into the common stock of Fatburger in an amount equal to
the redemption price based upon the fair value of the common stock at the time
of conversion. The Series B Preferred is entitled to dividends from
Fatburger equal to 2.5 per annum of the redemption price. The Series B
Preferred does not have voting rights. 

 Commercial Real Estate Mortgage Brokerage Operation 

 George Elkins. We
own a 51 interest in George Elkins and began reporting their operations on a
consolidated basis in May 2002. George Elkins provided brokerage services
related to the production of over 700 million in commercial real estate loans
during 2004 and currently acts as the loan servicer for a portfolio of 700
million in commercial real estate loans. Since George Elkins has a service
based operation, there are no material assets or liabilities relating to the
consolidation of that segment in the accompanying consolidated statements of
financial condition.

 The following is a
brief description of each of the properties set forth in the above table: 

 Freestanding
Retail Properties. We own directly, or through capital
leases, 50 freestanding
retail buildings located throughout the United States. The buildings are
approximately 4,500 square feet each and were originally developed during the
1970 s and 1980 s. The buildings are leased to a variety of tenants including convenience
stores, video rental outlets, shoe stores and other small businesses. As of December 31,
2004, 8 of the buildings were vacant. We also control 44 similar retail locations through operating leases. 

 During 2004, we sold
eight similar properties that had been owned in the same portfolio for 3.7
million. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, we sold two additional
stand-alone retail locations in separate 

4 

transactions for an
aggregate sales price of 1.2 million in cash. We currently are under contract
to sell three additional free-standing retail locations for a combined sales
price of 1.3 million. 

 Eugene Warehouse,90005
Prairie Road, Eugene, Oregon. This building is an 84,000-square-foot warehouse located on 4.5 acres
with access to Interstate Route 5 via Belt Line Road and to the
Eugene-Springfield metropolitan and Gateway areas. The property is within the
West Eugene enterprise zone. This property is being marketed for lease or sale. 

 Barcelona Apartments . This investment consists of
two apartment buildings, consisting of 20 residential units and 4 retail shops
located in Barcelona, Spain. We are converting the units to condominiums and
preparing the individual units for sale. 

 Wilsonville
Land . This
10.9-acre parcel of undeveloped land is located in the city of Wilsonville,
Oregon, and is being held for future development or sale. 

 Indebtedness . When it is beneficial to do
so, our general strategy is to leverage our real estate investments by
incurring borrowings secured by these investments. Set forth below is
information regarding our indebtedness relating to our real estate as of December 31,
2004.

The Wilsonville and Eugene properties are not currently subject to
indebtedness. 

 Loans 

 Our loans are primarily
secured by stock, commercial assets and real estate. Our portfolio consists
primarily of five loans with a total outstanding principal balance of 12.0
million. However, as a result of purchase discounts and other deferred income,
the carrying value of these loans is 6.7 million. One of the loans, with a
carrying value of 1.6 million is secured by substantially all of the common
stock and assets of a corporation that develops and manufactures eyeglass lens
production machinery. One additional loan with a carrying value of 1.1 million
is secured by the stock of a private corporation that has developed and is
marketing a software application. The remaining loans are secured by commercial
or residential real estate. As of December 31, 2004, two of the
Company s loans with a carrying value totaling 2.2 million had been
restructured to provide additional time for repayment by the borrowers in
exchange for various extension fees or other new terms. As a result, these
loans were considered impaired for accounting purposes and were on non-accrual
status. However, no impairment reserves were required on these impaired loans
due to management s expectation that the carrying amounts will be collected. 

 All of the loans mature in 2005. Based upon our carrying value, the
effective aggregate interest rate on these loans at December 31, 2004 was
approximately 8.0 . The effective interest rate is net of the effect of the two
impaired loans which are on non-accrual status, but does not reflect the effect
of points and fees collected. 

 Other Subsidiaries and Investments 

 We also invest in other finance related opportunities,
including the debt or equity of corporations in the process of restructuring
their operations. We have acquired the following subsidiaries and made the
following investments: 

5 

Bourne End. In December 2000,
we organized and led a group of investors to purchase all of the outstanding
capital stock of Bourne End Properties Plc Bourne End ), a specialist
investor in retail property. BEP Acquisitions was incorporated in Jersey,
Channel Islands for the purpose of acquiring Bourne End. BEP Acquisitions is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of BEP Property Holdings Limited BEP ), which is 26 
owned by us, 71 owned by Merrill Lynch (Jersey) Holdings Limited (a subsidiary
of Merrill Lynch Co., Inc.) and 3 owned by the asset manager,
Greenbau Estuary Limited. 

 At the time of the
acquisition, Bourne End had approximately GBP 169.6 million of assets and
GBP 123.1 million of debt. The real estate assets consisted of 1.7 million
square feet in fifteen shopping centers located in the United Kingdom. Bourne
End has sold fourteen of these properties since the acquisition, including one
sale during 2004. The sales are consistent with the investor group s strategy
to reposition each of the centers with the ultimate goal of reselling the
properties. 

 V Model Management. As of December 31,
2004, we have invested approximately 0.6 million in a debt and equity
financing package for V Model Management, a French modeling agency V Model ).
Headquartered in Paris, V Model represents and promotes models for the fashion
industry. Currently, V Model represents approximately 60 male and 60
female models. Our investment included the acquisition of 51 of the
outstanding common stock of V Model. As a result of our voting control, we began
reporting the operations of V Model on a consolidated basis beginning November 20,
2003. 

 Mortgage-Backed
Securities. Mortgage-backed securities are interests in
pools of mortgages that have been securitized and are usually issued in
multiple classes ranging from the most senior to the most subordinate class. Prior
to 2004, investments in mortgage-backed securities were a significant part of
our business. However, during 2002 through 2004, we took advantage of market
opportunities and sold nearly all of our mortgage-backed securities at
significant gains. As a result, at December 31, 2004, we only had one
remaining security with a carrying value of less than 10,000. 

 Funding Sources 

 In order to maximize the
return on our investments, we generally seek to fund acquisitions with
third-party debt and equity financing so that our invested capital represents a
relatively small percentage of the purchase price. Funding sources for real
property assets generally involve capital leases or longer-term traditional
mortgage financing with banks and other financial institutions. Our investments
in corporate restructuring opportunities are often made without third-party
leverage. The principal sources for funding mortgage-backed securities have
historically been repurchase agreements with major investment banks. The

Asset Quality 

 Real Estate. Our
real estate investments are carried at the lower of historical cost (net of
depreciation) or estimated market value. Our estimate of market value is based
upon comparable sales information for similar properties. 

 Loans. Our
loans are secured by real estate, commercial assets and corporate stock. Our
evaluation of the quality of our loans is based upon the underlying value of
the collateral. We also give consideration to the credit performance of these
loans. 

 Employees 

 As of December 31,
2004, we had approximately 599 employees, which included approximately 28
employees of George Elkins and 560 employees of Fatburger. 

 Intellectual
Property 

 We believe our
trademarks and service marks have significant value and are important to our
marketing efforts. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely primarily on a
combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality
agreements with employees and third parties, and protective contractual
provisions such as those contained in license agreements with consultants,
vendors and customers, although we have not signed these agreements in every
case. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized
parties may copy aspects of our products and obtain and use information that we
regard as proprietary. Other parties may breach confidentiality agreements and
other protective contracts we have entered into, and we may not become aware
of, or have adequate remedies in the event of, any breach. Our policy is to
pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any
infringement of these marks. 

 Fatburger is a registered trademark in the United States and in
a number of international jurisdictions. All other trademarks or service marks
appearing in this report are trademarks or service marks of the respective
companies that use them. We pursue the registration of some trademarks and
service marks in the United States and in other countries, but we have not
secured registration of all our marks. In addition, the laws of some foreign
countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the
laws of the United States, and effective copyright, trademark and trade secret
protection may not be available in other jurisdictions. We license trademark
rights to third parties through our franchise agreements. In the event that a
licensee does not abide by compliance and quality control guidelines with
respect to the licensed trademark rights or take actions that fail to
adequately protect these marks, the value of these rights and our use of them
in our business may be negatively impacted.

Competition 

 Restaurant Operations . The
restaurant industry, particularly the fast food segment, is highly competitive
and there are numerous well-established competitors possessing substantially
greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than the company.
In addition, the fast food industry is characterized by the frequent
introduction of new products, accompanied by substantial promotional campaigns.
In recent years, numerous companies in the fast food industry have introduced
products positioned to capitalize on growing consumer preference for food
products which are, or are perceived to be, healthful, nutritious, low in
calories and low in fat content. It can be expected that the company will be
subject to competition from companies whose products or marketing strategies address
these consumer preferences. In addition, the market for suitable restaurant
locations is highly competitive in that fast food companies, major restaurant
companies and non-food companies compete for prime real estate sites. 

 Commercial Real Estate Mortgage
Brokerage Operations . The mortgage brokerage industry
is also highly competitive. There are a number of similar brokerage firms and
direct lenders within the markets that we service which are competing for loan
production. We rely on our relationships with lenders and borrowers to generate
brokerage opportunities, but we are subject to competition relating to interest
rates and underwriting standards being offered in the marketplace. 

 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 

 Our corporate headquarters are located in Portland,
Oregon, where we lease approximately 5,000 square feet of office space under a
lease expiring in December 2009. We also lease executive offices in
London, England. Fatburger leases approximately 6,600 square feet of corporate
office space in Santa Monica, California under a lease that will expire in July 2007.
George Elkins leases approximately 6,800 square feet of office space in Los
Angeles, California under a lease that will expire in June 2005. 

 Fatburger operates 26
restaurant locations in California and Nevada. Two of the restaurant sites in
Nevada are operated from properties owned by Fatburger. The remainder of the
restaurant locations are leased. 

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

 Capital Consultants
LLC 

 As the Company has previously disclosed, the Company s
former Chief Executive Officer and current Chief Strategic Officer, Andrew
Wiederhorn, and former President, Lawrence Mendelsohn, received letters from
the United States Attorney s Office for the District of Oregon USAODO in March 2001
advising them that they were targets of a grand jury investigation (the CCL
Investigation into the failure of Capital Consultants, L.L.C CCL ). CCL was
a lender to Wilshire Credit Corporation WCC and related and affiliated
companies. WCC was a mortgage loan servicing company owned by Mr. Wiederhorn
and Mr. Mendelsohn that provided mortgage loan servicing for Wilshire
Financial Services Group Inc., a public company for which Mr. Wiederhorn
acted as CEO and Mr. Mendelsohn acted as President and which was principally
engaged in banking, loan pool purchasing, and investing in mortgage-backed
securities. As a result of the liquidity crisis in the financial markets in the
fall of 1998, Wilshire Financial Services Group Inc. experienced significant
losses and filed for bankruptcy, which in turn had a significant impact on its
affiliates, including WCC, which could not repay the amounts borrowed from CCL.
At the time, Wilshire Financial Services Group Inc. owned approximately 8.6 of
the Company s common stock and managed the Company s investments under a
management agreement. 

 In August 2002, Mr. Mendelsohn resigned as
President and Director of the Company. In November 2003, Mr. Mendelsohn
entered into an agreement with the USAODO pursuant to which he pled guilty to
filing a false 1998 personal tax return and agreed to cooperate in the CCL
Investigation. 

8 

On June 3, 2004 the Company
 announced that Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board Andrew
Wiederhorn had entered into a settlement with the USAODO regarding its investigation
into CCL (the Settlement and would take a leave of absence from his
corporate positions at the Company. 

 Under the Settlement terms, Mr. Wiederhorn pled
guilty on June 3, 2004 to two federal counts and was sentenced to 18
months incarceration and fined 2.0 million. The first count, a violation of an
ERISA provision, involved a federal law that required no criminal intent and
for which his reliance on the advice of counsel was not a defense. The second
count related to a violation involving a deduction on a personal tax return. The
deduction was structured and approved by Mr. Wiederhorn s tax advisors and
did not reduce Mr. Wiederhorn s tax liability or reduce the government s
tax collections. The charges to which Mr. Wiederhorn has pled guilty
pursuant to the Settlement are not based upon any acts or omission involving the
Company or Mr. Wiederhorn in his capacity as an officer or director of the
Company. 

 In entering into Mr. Wiederhorn s leave of
absence agreement, the Company s Board of Directors considered the nature of
the statutes to which Mr. Wiederhorn pled and the fact that he relied on
the advice of expert legal counsel and a national accounting firm. The Board
also believed it was important to assure Mr. Wiederhorn s return to active
involvement with the Company because of his expertise and knowledge and to
preserve a significant business relationship and the value of the Company s
investments. 

 Under the terms of the leave of absence agreement, Mr. Wiederhorn
will continue to receive his regular salary and bonus pursuant to and as set
forth in his employment agreement. In addition, in consideration of Mr. Wiederhorn s
good will, cooperation, and continuing assistance, and in recognition of Mr. Wiederhorn s
past service to the Company, to help avoid litigation and for the other reasons
stated in the agreement, the Company made a leave of absence payment to Mr. Wiederhorn
in the amount of 2.0 million on June 2, 2004. 

 To address the management transition, the Company
appointed Donald Berchtold as Co-Chief Executive Officer in June 2004. Mr. Berchtold
has been Senior Vice President of Administration at the Company since October 1999
and became a director in March 2004. He currently sits on the board of
directors of Fatburger and has more than 25 years experience in the restaurant
business. Mr. Berchtold is the father-in-law of Mr. Wiederhorn. In
order to further assist the transition, David Dale-Johnson and Don Coleman
serve as co-Chairmen of the Board. Both Mr. Dale-Johnson and Mr. Coleman
have been directors of the Company since October 2001. Mr. Dale-Johnson was the Director of the
Real Estate program at USC s Marshall School of Business and has significant
expertise in real estate, economics and finance. Mr. Coleman has
held prominent executive operating positions in several major companies and is
currently the Chief Operating Officer of Eagle Telephonic Inc. The Company also
appointed Mr. Dale-Johnson as Chief Investment Officer, adding a new
full-time position to the Company s management team. 

 Mr. Wiederhorn began his leave of absence on August 2,
2004 and is expected to remain in that status until October 2, 2005. On August 13,
2004, the Board of Directors adopted a resolution changing the role of Andrew
Wiederhorn from Co-Chief Executive to Chief Strategic Officer during the leave
of absence period. The Board determined that during the leave of absence
period, Mr. Wiederhorn would be in a better position to develop strategies
that would be of future benefit to the Company, while his current status would
significantly limit his ability to perform the full functions of Co-Chief
Executive Officer. All other provisions of the Leave of Absence Agreement and
employment agreement with Mr. Wiederhorn remain in force. On August 13,
2004, Donald J. Berchtold became sole Chief Executive Officer. 

 Mr. Wiederhorn and Mr. Mendelsohn,
pursuant to the terms of their respective employment agreements, may have been
entitled to indemnity from the Company for litigation expenses and personal
losses in connection with the CCL investigations and any related litigation.
Messrs. Wiederhorn and Mendelsohn had notified the Company that, although
they believed they were entitled to primary indemnification from other sources,
they were reserving their rights to seek indemnity from the Company. The
Company did not agree to any indemnity requests. Mr. Wiederhorn released
the Company from any 

9 

and all
claims he may have had relating to the CCL matter as partial consideration for
the leave of absence agreement in June 2004. The USAODO has settled the
CCL matter as it relates to both Mr. Wiederhorn and Mr. Mendelsohn. As
a result, the Company believes that the contingencies relating to the potential
indemnification of these officers or former officers relating to CCL have now
been resolved. 

 Nasdaq Delisting 

 Effective
October 14, 2004, th e Company s Common Stock began trading in the over-the-counter market on the OTC pink
sheets. Prior to that, the Company s Common Stock was quoted on the Nasdaq
National Market. On July 20, 2004, the Company was notified by
Nasdaq of a staff determination to delist the Company s Common Stock effective July 29,
2004. The Company challenged the staff determination and requested an oral
hearing by a Listing Qualifications Panel to review the staff s conclusions. A
hearing was held on September 9, 2004, and, on October 12, 2004, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that the Listing
Qualifications Panel upheld the staff determination and the Company s Common
Stock was delisted from the Nasdaq National Market on October 14, 2004. The
Company requested a review of the Listing Qualifications Panel s decision by
Nasdaq s Listing and Hearing Review Council. On February 16, 2005, the
Company received notice that the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council had
upheld the Panel s decision. The Company is considering whether to continue the
appeal process. There can be no assurance that an appeal will be successful. 

 Derivative Action 

 On July 6, 2004, Jeff
Allen McCoon, derivatively on behalf of the Company, filed a lawsuit in the
Circuit Court for the State of Oregon (Multnomah County Case No. 0407-06900)
which named the Company and
all of its directors as defendants. The lawsuit alleges that members of
the Company s Board of Directors breached their duties to the Company by
entering into the leave of absence agreement with Andrew Wiederhorn. The
lawsuit generally seeks restitution of payments made under the leave of absence
agreement plus attorney fees and costs. The individual defendants have
indemnity agreements with the Company and have asserted the right to
indemnification from the Company under those indemnity agreements. This case is
in the very early pleading stages and motions are pending against the
complaint. The Company may incur expenses under the indemnity agreements and
also may derive benefits if the plaintiff s claims are successful. At this
stage of the case, it is too early to predict the outcome with any certainty.
The complaint is not specific as to the amount of damages it is seeking against
the individual defendants, but it appears to seek at least the return of 2
million paid to Mr. Wiederhorn under the Leave of Absence Agreement. 

 Strouds Acquisition
Corporation 

 On October 6, 2003, the Official Committee of Unsecured
Creditors of Strouds Acquisition Corporation Strouds filed a lawsuit in the
United States Bankruptcy Court (LA 03-23620-ER) which named the Company, among
others, as a defendant. The lawsuit was amended on November 10, 2003 and
limits the complaint against the Company solely in its capacity as collateral
agent for certain secured creditors of Strouds Acquisition Corporation. The
lawsuit, as it pertains to the Company, sought reimbursement of the proceeds
from approximately 3.0 million in funds received in October 2003, which
the Company was holding as collateral agent for other secured creditors. These
funds were not included in the assets of the Company, but were being held in
trust. On July 1, 2004, the lawsuit was settled and the Company
distributed the trust funds, net of legal reimbursements of 0.3 million, in
accordance with the settlement agreement. The Company received a general
release from the parties and considers the matter closed. 

10 

George Elkins 

 On August 11, 2004 the Company received a notice
from the minority shareholders of George Elkins informing the Company that the
minority shareholders believe that a Change in Control Transaction (as defined
in the Operating Agreement) has occurred as a result of the leave of absence of
Mr. Wiederhorn. The notice also indicates that unless the Change in
Control Transaction is corrected within 120 days, the minority shareholders
intend to exercise their rights to purchase the interests held by the Company
in accordance with the formula outlined in the Operating Agreement. 

 The Company disputes the claim that a Change in
Control Transaction has occurred as a result of the leave of absence agreement
with Mr. Wiederhorn. The Company believes that the market value of its
investment is greater than the amount of the buyback formula and intends to
vigorously defend against these claims. However, in the event that the Company
was unsuccessful in defending this position, an analysis of the economic effect
of the buyback formula indicates that the Company would not incur a loss on the
transaction. As a result, no reserves are required due to the receipt of the
notice. 

 The 120 day notice period
has lapsed and the minority shareholders have not sought to exercise their
rights to purchase the interests held by the Company. There can be no assurance
that the minority shareholders will not seek to exercise these rights in the
future. 

 Other Legal
Proceedings 

 The Company is involved in
various other legal proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business
which the Company believes will not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial condition or operations of the Company.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, we
declared four quarterly cash distributions of 0.13 per share, totaling 0.52
per share 4.4 million). During the year ended December 31, 2003, we
declared four quarterly cash dividends of 0.13 per share, totaling 0.52 per
share 4.5 million). On January 26, 2005, the Board of Directors declared
a 0.13 per share dividend for the first quarter of 2005. The dividend was paid
on February 10, 2005 to shareholders of record on February 4, 2005. We
may declare and pay new quarterly dividends on our common stock in 2005,
subject to our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements
and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. 

 On October 18, 2002, we adopted a stockholder
rights plan (the Plan and declared a distribution of one right (a Right to purchase one-tenth of a share of the Company s common stock for each
outstanding share of common stock, payable to the stockholders of record on October 28,
2002. The Board of Directors authorized and directed the issuance of one Right
with respect to each share of common stock issued thereafter until the
Distribution Date. The Plan was adopted as a means of protecting the potential
tax benefits of our net operating loss carry forward NOL ). Under Federal tax
rules, the NOL will be limited if we experience a significant change in
ownership. The Plan dilutes any new 5 holder, or any existing 5 holder that
increases its stake by 1 or more, thereby preserving the Company s NOL. If,
subject to certain exceptions, any person or group commences a tender or
exchange offer to purchase 5 percent or more of the Company s Common Stock,
each right not owned by such person or group will entitle its holder to
purchase, at the right s current exercise price, shares of common stock having
a value of twice the right s current exercise price. If, subject to certain
exceptions, any person or group acquires 5 or more, or any existing 5 holder
increases its stake by 1 or more, of our common stock (an Acquiring Person ),
each right not owned by such person or group will automatically be exercised
and entitle its holder to receive one share of common stock per right (or a
lesser ratio as determined by the Board of Directors, if we do not have
sufficient authorized and unreserved shares) in lieu of paying the purchase
price. This right to purchase common stock at a discount will not be triggered
by a person or group s 

12 

acquisition of 5 or more
of the common stock pursuant to a tender or exchange offer (or other securities
offering by us) which is for all outstanding shares at a price and on terms
that the Board of Directors determines (prior to acquisition) to be adequate
and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. The Board of
Directors also has the discretion in certain circumstances to waive the
triggering of such right in the event that an acquisition will not adversely
effect the Company s NOL carryforward. 

 In addition, if, subject to certain exceptions, we are
acquired by another corporation in a merger or consolidation or more than 50
percent of our assets or earning power is acquired, each right not owned by the
acquirer or affiliates will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right s
current exercise price, common stock of the acquirer having a value of twice
the right s current exercise price. This right will not be triggered, however,
if the acquisition is by a person or group which acquired our common stock at a
price and on terms that the Board of Directors determines (prior to
acquisition) to be adequate and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders. 

 The rights will expire in the year 2012. We may redeem
all of the rights, at the option of the Board of Directors, at a redemption
price of .001 per right or by the issuance of shares of common stock then
equivalent to .001 per right, at any time prior to any person becoming an
Acquiring Person. 

 On February 17, 2004, the Board of Directors of
the Company unanimously resolved, by written resolution effective February 17,
2004, that the Company may purchase shares of its common stock from its
stockholders from time to time, in open market purchases or negotiated
transactions provided that the Company shall only purchase such shares in
accordance with applicable law, including United States federal securities
laws, including the safe harbor provisions of Rule 10b-18 of the
Securities Act of 1934, as amended. 

 Effective March 1,
2004, the Company made an automatic dividend reinvestment plan available to
shareholders through The Bank of New York. The Plan enables shareholders to
reinvest their quarterly cash dividends and make supplemental cash
contributions up to 10,000 per month, with a maximum amount of 60,000 per
year, toward the purchase of the Company s common stock. Participation in the
plan is voluntary.

Our net earnings during 2004, 2003 and 2002 have come
primarily from the sale of mortgage-backed securities and from the sale of real
estate by our Bourne End subsidiary. These assets have now become a less
significant part of our balance sheet and material earnings from the sale of
these assets are not expected to continue. We have reinvested a portion of the
proceeds from the sale of these assets into the acquisition of Fatburger and we
expect to continue to emphasize our restaurant operations and other business
segments. Future earnings will depend upon the success of our existing
operations, such as Fatburger and George Elkins, as well the redeployment of
our cash.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 The following discussion
should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the
Company and notes thereto. 

 GENERAL 

 Our business strategy consists of developing, strengthening and
expanding our restaurant and commercial real estate mortgage brokerage
operations and continuing to identify and acquire real estate investments with
favorable risk-adjusted returns. We also seek to identify and acquire
controlling interests in other operating businesses in which we feel we can add
value. We make acquisitions where our expertise in intensive asset management,
credit analysis and financial structuring can create value and provide an
appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return. We maintain a flexible approach with
respect to the nature of our business, seeking to take advantage of
opportunities as they arise or are developed. 

 Critical Accounting
Policies 

 Accounting For
Equity Investees 

 The equity method of
accounting is used for investments in associated companies which are not
unilaterally controlled by the Company and in which the Company s interest is
generally between 20 and 50 of the outstanding voting rights. The Company s
share of earnings or losses of associated companies in which at least 20 of
the voting securities is owned, is included in the consolidated statement of
operations. 

 Valuation 

 At December 31, 2004,
our largest asset consisted of our portfolio of real estate. We value our real
estate holdings either by independent appraisal or through internally generated
analysis using comparable market data. 

 Sale Recognition 

 During 2004, we were
involved in significant sales of mortgage-backed securities, real estate and
other assets. Our accounting policy calls for the recognition of sales of
financial instruments, including mortgage-backed securities and loans, only
when we have irrevocably surrendered control over these assets. We do not
retain any recourse or performance obligations with respect to our sales of
assets. Our sales of financial instruments were cash sales, and the cash
proceeds were not contingent upon any future event. 

 We recognize gain on sales
of real estate under the full accrual method when (1) a sale is
consummated, (2) the buyer s initial and continuing investments are
adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property, (3) any
receivable from the buyer is not subject to future subordination and (4) the
usual risks and rewards of ownership of the property have been transferred to
the buyer. If any of these conditions are not met, our accounting policy
requires that gain on sale be deferred until all of the conditions have been
satisfied. 

 Fatburger
Restaurant and Franchise Revenue 

 Revenue from the operation
of Fatburger company-owned restaurants are recognized when sales occur. 

 Franchise fee revenue from
the sale of individual Fatburger franchises is recognized only when all
material services or conditions relating to the sales have been substantially
performed or satisfied. The completion of training and the opening of a
location by the franchisee constitute substantial performance on the part of
Fatburger. Nonrefundable deposits collected in relation to the sale of
franchises are 

16 

recorded
as deferred franchise fees until the completion of training and the opening of
the restaurant, at which time the franchise fee revenue is recognized. 

 In addition to franchise
fee revenue, Fatburger collects a royalty ranging from 5 to 6 of gross sales
from restaurants operated by franchisees. Fatburger recognizes royalty fees as
the related sales are made by the franchisees. Costs relating to continuing
franchise support are expensed as incurred. 

 Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets 

 Goodwill represents the
excess of the purchase price and other acquisition related costs over the
estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We do
not amortize goodwill. Intangible assets are stated at the estimated value at
the date of acquisition and include trademarks, operating manuals, franchise
agreements and leasehold interests. Trademarks, which have indefinite lives,
are not subject to amortization. All other intangible assets are amortized over
their estimated useful lives, which range from five to fifteen years. 

 We assess potential
impairments to intangible assets at least annually, or when there is evidence
that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recovered. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment
indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on
operational performance of our acquired businesses, market conditions and other
factors. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators
exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired
businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse
impact on our results of operations. 

 Operating Segments 

 Our operating segments
consist of (i) restaurant operations conducted through our Fatburger
subsidiary, (ii) commercial real estate mortgage brokerage activities
conducted through our majority-owned subsidiary, George Elkins and (iii) real
estate, merchant banking and financing activities. The following is a summary
of each of the operating segments: 

 Restaurant Operations 

 Fatburger operates or
franchises 62 hamburger restaurants located primarily in California and Nevada.
In August 2003, we provided an investment and financing package for
Fatburger which involved our acquisition of the entire class of the Series A-1
Preferred and the Series D Preferred stock of Fatburger. Currently, we own
approximately 71 of the voting control of Fatburger. Fatburger has plans to
open additional restaurants including franchises throughout the United States.
Franchisees currently own and operate 36 of the Fatburger locations and
Fatburger has agreements for approximately 220 new franchise locations. 

 Commercial Real Estate Mortgage Brokerage Operations 

 George Elkins provided
brokerage services related to the production of over 700 million in commercial
real estate mortgages during 2004. George Elkins is headquartered in Los
Angeles, with satellite offices located throughout the southern California area
and in Las Vegas. The mortgage brokerage operation also manages a commercial
loan servicing portfolio in excess of 700 million for various investors. The
Company earned mortgage servicing fees of 0.7 million during 2004, which is
included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations. 

 Real Estate,
Merchant Banking and Financing Operations 

 We invest in or finance
real estate, mortgage-backed securities and other real estate-related or
finance-related assets. Our merchant banking and financing operations focus on
the acquisition of controlling interests in businesses in the process of
restructuring. This can take the form of assisting in a management buy-out,
refinancing corporate debt or acquiring the non-core assets of a business.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 2004 Compared to 2003 

 NET INCOME. Our net loss for the year ended December 31,
2004 amounted to 3.9 million, or 0.46 per share, compared to net income of
 5.4 million, or 0.62 per share for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
net loss for the 2004 period is primarily attributable to operating expenses of
 23.0 million and losses from restaurant operations of 2.7 million, partially
offset by net interest income of 2.7 million, gain on sale of loans and
securities of 2.1 million, loan brokerage fees of 5.8 million, equity in
earnings of equity investees of 4.4 million, and gain on the sale of a prepaid
servicing credit of 1.5 million. 

 Operating expenses were higher than normal during the
year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to a 2.0 million leave of
absence payment to Andrew Wiederhorn and the accrual of 1.8 million of future
expenses associated with the leave of absence. 

 The 2003 net income was primarily the result of gains
on the sale of loans and securities of 12.5 million, and equity in earnings of
equity investees of 4.9 million, which were partially offset by our operating
expenses.

describe the results of operations of our operating segments for the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: 

 Restaurant Segment 

 In addition to operating company owned restaurants,
our strategy with respect to Fatburger is to increase the number of franchises,
thus increasing the franchise fees and future royalty income to the operation. Fatburger
is implementing a nationwide expansion of the franchise and currently has
agreements with approximately 20 franchisees to open approximately 220 new
locations. When Fatburger enters into a franchise agreement, the franchisee
pays a 20,000 per restaurant non-refundable franchise fee. An additional
 20,000 fee per restaurant is collected when the franchisee signs a lease
agreement. These fees are recognized into income upon the opening of the
franchise restaurant. As of December 31, 2004, Fatburger had collected
approximately 4.4 million in franchise fees for future restaurant locations. It
is expected that an additional 4.4 million relating to these locations will be
collected as specific leases are signed. 

 During the year ended December 31, 2004, we
recognized a net loss from our restaurant segment of 2.7 million. This was
primarily the result of a gross margin (sales less cost of goods sold) of 8.8
million and franchise and royalty revenue of 1.4 million, offset by general
and administrative costs of 10.8 million, interest expense of 0.7 million,
and depreciation and amortization of 1.5 million. 

 During the nearly five
months from acquisition through December 31, 2003, we recognized a net
loss from our restaurant segment of 1.1 million. This was primarily the result
of gross margin (sales less cost of goods sold) of 2.9 million and franchise
and royalty revenue of 0.5 million, offset by general and administrative costs
of 3.5 million, interest expense of 0.3 million, depreciation and
amortization of 0.5 million and a provision for income taxes of 0.2 million. 

 Commercial Real
Estate Mortgage Brokerage Segment 

 The Company owns a 51 ownership interest in George
Elkins, a mortgage brokerage operation, which in 2004 provided brokerage
services resulting in the production of over 700 million in commercial real
estate mortgages. George Elkins is headquartered in Los Angeles, with satellite
offices located throughout the southern California area and in Las Vegas. The
mortgage banking operation also manages a commercial loan servicing portfolio
in excess of 700 million for various investors. 

19 

We recognized 0.1 million in net income from the
commercial real estate mortgage brokerage segment for the year ended December 31,
2004, compared to a loss of 0.1 million during the 2003 period. During the
2004 period, we recognized loan brokerage fees of 5.8 million, loan servicing
and other revenue of 0.4 million, which was offset by compensation expense of
 5.2 million and other operating expense of 0.9 million. 

 During the 2003 period, we
recognized loan brokerage fees of 5.4 million, loan servicing and other
revenue of 0.4 million, which was offset by compensation expense of 4.8
million and other operating expense of 1.1 million. 

 Real Estate,
Merchant Banking, and Financing Segment 

 NET INTEREST INCOME. Our net interest income for the year ended December 31,
2004 was 2.7 million, compared with 3.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2003. These results reflect a reduction in interest income on securities of
 1.8 million as the result of the sale or repayment of mortgage-backed
securities. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest
income on loans (reflecting our increased investment in specialty real estate
and other lending) of 0.6 million and a decrease in interest expense of 0.6
million as a result of our repayment of debt related to the mortgage-backed
securities. The following tables set forth information regarding the total
amount of income from interest-earning assets and expense from interest-bearing
liabilities and the resulting average yields and rates:

 REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS. Our real estate
operations represent activity from our direct investment in commercial
property, as well as the operations of our leasehold interests in freestanding
retail buildings. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we realized net
income from real estate operations of 2.3 million, compared with net income
from real estate operations of 0.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2003. The increase during the 2004 period was primarily the result of gains on
sales of real estate of 1.7 million, compared to gains of 0.3 million during
the prior year. The gains on sales during 2004 relate to the sale of eight of
our freestanding retail buildings and from the recognition of the deferred gain
relating to the receipt of the final payment on a real estate sale which was
financed in a prior year. 

 OTHER OPERATING INCOME. Our other operating
income was approximately 10.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2004. This compares to other operating income of 17.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The primary components of our other operating
income include the following: 

 Gain on the Sale of Loans and Securities. During
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we sold loans and securities
to unrelated third parties for approximately 30.3 million and 16.0 million,
respectively, resulting in gains of approximately 2.1 million and 12.5
million, respectively. 

 Equity in Earnings of Equity
Investees . During 2004 and 2003, Bourne End sold
properties and retired indebtedness, a process which began during the fourth
quarter of 2001. For the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, we
recorded 4.4 million and 5.0 million, respectively, in earnings relating to
our share of the net income of Bourne End. 

 Prepaid Loan Servicing Credit . During the year ended December 31, 2004, we sold
our Wilshire Credit Corporation WCC prepaid loan servicing credit (the Loan
Servicing Credit for 1.5 million in cash. The Loan Servicing Credit was
originally acquired by us in 1998, when we were an affiliate of WCC. The Loan
Servicing Credit may be used, subject to certain limitations, to pay for loan
portfolio servicing activities performed by WCC. As a result of the sale, we
recognized a gain in the amount of 1.5 million. 

21 

Other Income. During the
year ended December 31, 2004, our other income included 1.3 million in
gross modeling fees earned by V-Model, 0.3 million in net gains on foreign
currency and 1.0 million in net advisory fees earned in connection with a
third party real estate transaction. During the 2003 period, other revenue
included 0.8 million in net gains on foreign currency and 0.3 million in net
advisory fees earned in connection with third party real estate transactions. 

 OPERATING EXPENSES. During
2004, operating expenses of the real estate, merchant banking and finance
segment were comprised of compensation and employee benefits of 4.9 million,
Leave of Absence costs of 4.8 million, professional fees of 2.5 million,
V-Model operating costs of 1.7 million and other costs of 3.0 million. During
2003, operating expenses comprised of compensation and employee benefits of
 6.9 million, professional fees of 1.8 million and other costs of 2.8
million. 

 RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 2003 Compared to 2002 

 NET INCOME. Our net income for the year ended December 31,
2003 amounted to 5.4 million, or 0.62 per share, compared to net income of
 16.7 million, or 1.69 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2002. The
2003 net income was primarily the result of gains on the sale of loans and
securities of 12.5 million, and equity in earnings of equity investees of 4.9
million, which were partially offset by our operating expenses. The 2002 net
income was primarily the result of gains on the sale of loans and securities of
 28.0 million, partially offset by our operating expenses. 

 The following sections
describe the results of operations of our operating segments for the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002: 

 Restaurant Segment 

 During the nearly
five months from acquisition through December 31, 2003, we recognized a
net loss from our restaurant segment of 1.1 million. This was primarily the
result of gross margins (sales less cost of goods sold) of 2.9 million and
franchise and royalty revenue of 0.5 million, offset by general and
administrative costs of 3.5 million, interest expense of 0.3 million,
depreciation and amortization of 0.5 million and a provision for income taxes
of 0.2 million. 

 Commercial Real
Estate Mortgage Brokerage Segment 

 Our net loss from the commercial
real estate brokerage segment was approximately 0.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. During the seven month period of our ownership of
George Elkins during 2002, our net loss from the commercial real estate
brokerage segment was 0.3 million. During the 2003 period, we recognized loan
brokerage fees of 5.4 million, and loan servicing and other revenue of 0.4
million, which were offset by compensation expense of 4.8 million and other
operating expense of 1.1 million. During the seven month period of our
ownership during 2002, we recognized loan brokerage fees of 2.3 million, loan
servicing and other revenue of 0.4 million, which were offset by compensation
expense of 2.3 million and other operating expense of 0.6 million. 

 Real Estate,
Merchant Banking, and Financing Segment 

 NET INTEREST INCOME. Our net interest income for the year ended December 31,
2003 was 3.4 million, compared with 4.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2002. These results reflect a reduction in interest income on securities of
 2.9 million as the result of the sale or repayment of mortgage-backed
securities. This decrease was offset by an increase in interest income on loans
(reflecting our increased investment in specialty real estate and other
lending) of 0.9 million and a decrease in interest expense of 1.2 million as
a result of our repayment of debt related to the mortgage-backed securities. The

REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS. During the year ended December 31,
2003, we realized a net income from real estate operations of 0.4 million,
compared with a net loss from real estate operations of 0.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002. The increase during the 2003 period was
primarily the result of gains on sales of real estate of 0.3 million. 

 OTHER OPERATING INCOME. Our other operating
income was approximately 17.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2003. This compares to net other operating income of 27.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002. The primary components of our net other operating
income include the following: 

 Gain on the Sale of Loans and Securities. During
the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we sold loans and securities
to unrelated third parties for approximately 16.0 million and 79.5 million,
respectively, resulting in gains of approximately 12.5 million and 28.0
million, respectively. 

 Market Valuation Losses and Impairments. During
the year ended December 31, 2003, and 2002, we incurred market valuation
losses and impairments of 0.8 million and 0.4 million, respectively, on
investments in loans and real estate. 

 Equity in Earnings of Equity
Investees . During 2003 and 2002, Bourne End sold
properties and retired indebtedness, a process which began during the fourth
quarter of 2001. For the years ended December 31, 2003, and 2002, we
recorded 5.0 million and 1.1 million, respectively, in earnings relating to
our share of the net income of Bourne End. 

 OPERATING EXPENSES. During
2003, operating expenses of the real estate merchant banking, and finance
segment were comprised of compensation and employee benefits of 6.9 million,
professional fees of 1.8 million and other costs of 2.8 million. During 2002,
operating expenses of the merchant banking, real estate and finance segment
were comprised of compensation and employee benefits of 6.3 million,
professional fees of 2.0 million and other costs of 2.6 million. 

 CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION 

 GENERAL. Total assets decreased from
approximately 109.0 million at December 31, 2003 to approximately 73.9
million at December 31, 2004. Total liabilities decreased from
approximately 63.6 million at December 31, 2003 to approximately 39.6
million at December 31, 2004. The decline in total assets and liabilities
was primarily the result of sales of our mortgage-backed securities and
repayment of the related borrowings. Stockholders equity decreased in 2004 by
approximately 11.1 million resulting primarily from our net loss of 3.9
million, dividends declared of 4.4 million, the purchase of treasury stock of
 1.7 million and the purchase of a call option of 0.6 million. 

 SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE. The balance of
mortgage-backed securities available for sale decreased from 35.5 million at December 31,
2003 to less than 0.1 million at December 31, 2004. The decrease was
primarily the result of the sale of
mortgage-backed securities with a carrying value of 29.1 million and cash
repayments of securities of 6.9 million, partially offset by increases in
market value of 1.4 million. 

 LOAN PORTFOLIO. We invest in special situation
loans, generally secured by real estate. These loans are typically short-term,
with maturities ranging from 6 to 24 months. Due to the unique circumstances
relating to the loans, the interest rate charged the borrower is significantly
higher than conventional real estate lending. As of December 31, 2004, our
special situation loan portfolio consisted of five individual loans with a
combined carrying value of 6.7 million. Three of the five loans are secured by
real estate consisting of commercial or single-family properties located in
California, Texas, and Nevada. One loan is secured by all of the stock and
assets of a commercial manufacturing business, and one loan is secured by stock
in a software company. The loans have a weighted average interest rate
(including the 

24 

effects of 2.2 million in
impaired loans on non-accrued status and excluding fees and points) of 8.0 and
a weighted average maturity of 4 months. 

 During the year ended December 31, 2004, our loan
portfolio increased by approximately 2.9 million. This was primarily the
result of the acquisition of new loans with a carrying value totaling 10.6
million, partially offset by the sale or repayment of loans totaling 8.2
million. As of December 31, 2004, two of the Company s loans totaling 2.2
million had been restructured to provide additional time for repayment by the
borrowers in exchange for various extension fees or other new terms. As a
result, these loans were considered impaired for accounting purposes, however,
no impairment reserves were required on these loans due to management s
expectation that the carrying amounts will be collected. 

 INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE. Investments in real
estate increased by 4.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2004. The
increase was primarily due to the purchase of the fee interest in three
freestanding retail buildings for 0.9 million, the purchase of two apartment
buildings in Barcelona, Spain for 4.3 million and capital improvements of 2.0
million, partially offset by the sale of eight properties with a net book value
of 2.5 million and depreciation of 0.6 million. 

 LOANS TO SENIOR EXECUTIVES. On February 21,
2002 (prior to the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), we loaned Mr. Wiederhorn
 175,000 to finance the purchase of Common Stock. This loan is full recourse to
Mr. Wiederhorn and is secured by all of Mr. Wiederhorn s rights under
his employment agreement. At Mr. Wiederhorn s direction (in accordance
with the terms of his employment agreement), on February 21, 2002, we
loaned a limited partnership (the LP controlled by Mr. Wiederhorn s
spouse 687,000 to finance the purchase of Common Stock. The loan is secured by
the membership interests of two limited liability companies owned by the LP. The
limited liability companies each own a parcel of real property in Oregon and
have no liabilities. At the time of the loan, the real properties had an
appraised value of 725,000. The loan is also guaranteed by Mr. Wiederhorn.
The Common Stock purchased with the proceeds of these loans does not serve as
security for the loans. The loans are due on February 21, 2007, and bear
interest at the prime rate, as published in the Wall Street Journal, which
interest is added to the principal annually. 

 On July 9, 2002 (prior to the passage of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), we loaned Mr. Wiederhorn 2.0 million. This
loan is full recourse to Mr. Wiederhorn and his spouse and is secured by
trust deeds on two residences located in Oregon. The loan is due on August 1,
2007 and bears interest at 8.5 per annum, payable monthly. 

 Further information on these loans to executives is
included in our proxy statements for 2004 and prior years Annual Meeting of
Stockholders. 

 INVESTMENT IN BOURNE END. Our investment in Bourne End decreased by 0.2
million to 1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2004. The
decrease was primarily the result of our receipt of cash distributions from Bourne
End of 4.6 million; partially offset by the recognition of 4.4 million
of our share of the earnings of Bourne End. 

 RESTAURANT PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET. Our
investment in restaurant property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation,
increased 0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 to a
balance of 6.2 million. The increase was primarily the result of approximately
 1.7 million of additions to equipment, furniture and fixtures relating to new
restaurant openings, less depreciation expense of approximately 1.4 million,
during the period. 

 INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET. Primarily as a result of
the acquisition and consolidation of Fatburger, as of December 31, 2004 we
had intangible assets, net of amortization, of 5.4 million. This consisted of
trademark rights of approximately 4.0 million, franchise agreements of approximately
 1.1 million and other miscellaneous intangible assets of 0.5 million. Intangible
assets decreased 0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2004
primarily as the result of amortization expense. 

25 

GOODWILL. Primarily as a result of the acquisition
and consolidation of Fatburger, we had recorded goodwill of 7.1 million as of December 31,
2004. Goodwill decreased during 2004 by 0.2 million as the result of the
impairment of goodwill relating to the acquisition of V-Model. 

 OTHER
ASSETS. Our other assets consisted of the following:

The capitalized deferred compensation included in
other assets relates to the acquisition of George Elkins. In conjunction with
the acquisition, certain employees of George Elkins entered into long-term
employment agreements. These employees received payments totaling 1.9 million
which we capitalized as deferred compensation. The employees are obligated to
perform under the employment agreements and must repay any unearned deferred
compensation payments upon early termination. The deferred compensation is
earned ratably over the terms of the employment agreements, and we are
amortizing the 1.9 million investment over the contract terms. At December 31,
2004, the remaining contract terms range from 4 to 29 months. 

 The advisory fee receivable of 1.4 million at December 31,
2004, relates to 2.0 million in advisory fees which we earned during December 2004
relating to a third party real estate transaction in Europe. The balance of the
fee was collected during the first quarter of 2005. Our other liabilities
include approximately 1.0 million in commissions payable at December 31,
2004 relating to this transaction. 

 REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, BORROWINGS AND NOTES PAYABLE. Our
repurchase agreements, borrowings and notes payable decreased 25.1 million
during the year ended December 31, 2004 to an ending balance of 8.0
million. This was primarily the result of the repayment of repurchase
agreements upon the sale of mortgage-backed securities. 

 OBLIGATIONS UNDER CAPITAL LEASES. Obligations
under capital leases decreased approximately 0.5 million during the year ended
December 31, 2004. This decrease was primarily the result of the scheduled
amortization of the obligations. 

 DEFERRED INCOME. Franchise fee revenue from the
sales of individual Fatburger franchises is recognized only when all material
services or conditions relating to the sales have been substantially performed
or satisfied. The completion of training and the opening of a location by the
franchisee constitute substantial performance. Fatburger charges 40,000 per
location in franchise fees. One-half of the fees are collected in cash at the
time the franchise rights are granted and the balance is collected at the time
the lease for the location is executed. Nonrefundable deposits collected in
relation to the sale of franchises are recorded as deferred franchise fees
until the completion of training and the opening of the restaurant, at which
time the franchise fee revenue is recognized. As of December 31, 2004, our
deferred income relating to the collection of unearned Fatburger franchise fees
was 4.5 million, an increase of 0.8 million from December 31, 2003. The
increase was primarily the result of the collection of nonrefundable deposits
on new franchises. As of December 31, 2004, nearly all of the deferred
income was comprised of 

26 

the initial 20,000 non-refundable
deposit received per location and the balance of the franchise fee will be
collected in cash as leases on these locations are signed. 

 DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. Our deferred income taxes
decreased 1.2 million to 5.8 million at December 31, 2004. This was
primarily the result of a decrease in the accrued taxes associated with
unrealized gains on mortgage-backed securities. As of December 31, 2004,
we had, for U.S. Federal tax purposes, a net operating loss NOL carryforward of approximately 77.6 million, including 13.5 million relating
to Fatburger. The NOL carryforward may reduce the future cash payment of the
deferred income tax liability. Our NOL begins to expire in 2018. Fatburger s
NOL began to expire in 2004 and is generally subject to an annual limitation
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, Section 382, Limitation on Net
Operating Loss Carryovers and Certain Built-In Losses Following Change in
Control. In addition, to the extent the Fatburger NOL is utilized, the
recognition of the related tax benefits would first reduce goodwill related to
the Fatburger acquisition, then other non-current intangible assets related to
that acquisition, and then income tax expense in accordance with Statement on
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. 

 United States tax regulations impose limitations on
the use of NOL carry forwards following certain changes in ownership. If such a
change were to occur with respect to the Company, the limitation could
significantly reduce the amount of benefits that would be available to offset
future taxable income each year, starting with the year of ownership change. To
reduce the likelihood of such ownership changes, we established a Shareholder
Rights Plan dated as of October 18, 2002, which discourages, under certain
circumstances, ownership changes which would trigger the NOL limitations. 

 STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. Stockholders equity
decreased by approximately 11.1 million resulting primarily from our net loss
of 3.9 million, purchase of treasury stock of 1.7 million, the purchase of a
call option on the Company s stock of 0.6 million and dividends declared of
 4.4 million. 

 In April 2004 we purchased 330,500 shares of our
common stock from Clarence Coleman, an unrelated stockholder who, at the time,
owned approximately 10 of the common stock. The purchase price was 5.40 per
share and the shares were placed in treasury. 

 In April 2004 we
purchased a three year call option (the Call Option from Andrew A.
Wiederhorn, the Company s former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and
current Chief Strategic Officer. The Call Option gives us the right, but not
the obligation, to purchase 423,245 of the Company s outstanding common stock
(the Option Shares from Mr. Wiederhorn for a purchase price of 3.99
per share. The option may be exercised at any time during the three year option
period. We paid 750,000 1.77 per option share) for the Call Option. The Call
Option was exercised on March 14, 2005 for 1.6 million and we placed
423,245 shares in treasury. 

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

 Liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet
potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings,
fund business operations and acquisitions, engage in loan acquisition and lending
activities and for other general business purposes. The primary sources of
funds for liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2004 consisted of
net cash provided by investing activities, including cash repayments related to
our mortgage-backed securities portfolio, cash distributions from BEP and the
sale of mortgage-backed securities. As of December 31, 2004, we had cash
or cash equivalents of 11.9 million which we believe will be sufficient to
meet our current liquidity needs. 

 Our borrowings and the availability of further
borrowings are substantially affected by, among other things, changes in
interest rates, changes in market spreads or decreases in credit quality of our
assets. 

 Fluctuations in interest rates will impact our net
income to the extent our operations and our fixed rate assets are funded by
variable rate debt. We may also be impacted to the extent that our variable
rate 

27 

assets reprice on a
different schedule or in relation to a different index than any floating rate
debt. See Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

 At December 31, 2004, we had total consolidated
secured indebtedness of 20.4 million, as well as 19.2 million of other
liabilities. The consolidated secured indebtedness consisted of (i) 12.4
million outstanding of capital leases maturing between 2010 and 2040 which are
secured by real estate, (ii) mortgage notes payable of 1.6 million
secured by real estate and (iii) notes payable and other debt of Fatburger
of 6.3 million secured by the assets of Fatburger. 

 If our existing liquidity position were to prove
insufficient, and we were unable to repay, renew or replace maturing
indebtedness on terms reasonably satisfactory to us, we may be required to sell
(potentially on short notice) a portion of our assets, and could incur losses
as a result. Also, Fatburger is involved in a nationwide expansion of franchise
and Fatburger owned locations, which will require significant liquidity. If
Fatburger or its franchisees are unsuccessful in obtaining credit lines
sufficient to fund this expansion, the timing of restaurant openings may be
delayed. 

 We consider the sale of assets to be a normal,
recurring part of our operations and we are currently generating adequate cash
flow as a result of these transactions. However, excluding the sale of assets
from time to time, we are currently operating with negative cash flow, since
many of our assets do not generate current cash sufficient to cover current
operating expenses. We believe that our existing sources of funds will be
adequate for purposes of meeting our liquidity needs; however, there can be no
assurance that this will be the case. Material increases in interest expense
from variable-rate funding sources, or material decreases in monthly cash
receipts, generally would negatively impact our liquidity. On the other hand,
material decreases in interest expense from variable-rate funding sources would
positively affect our liquidity. 

 Effective October 14,
2004, the Company s Common Stock began trading in the over-the-counter OTC market
on the OTC pink sheets. Prior to that, the Company s Common Stock was quoted
on the Nasdaq National Market. On July 20, 2004, the Company was notified
by Nasdaq of a staff determination to delist the Company s Common Stock
effective July 29, 2004. The Company challenged the staff determination
and requested an oral hearing by a Listing Qualifications Panel to review the
staff s conclusions. A hearing was held on September 9, 2004, and, on October 12,
2004, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that the Listing Qualifications Panel upheld
the staff determination and the Company s Common Stock was delisted from the
Nasdaq National Market on October 14, 2004. The Company requested a review
of the Listing Qualifications Panel s decision by Nasdaq s Listing and Hearing
Review Council. On February 16, 2005, the Company received notice that the
Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council had upheld the Panel s decision. The
Company is considering whether to continue the appeal process. There can be no
assurance that an appeal will be successful. 

 Trading of our Common
Stock in the OTC pink sheets may reduce the liquidity of our Common Stock
compared to quotation on the Nasdaq National Market. Also, the coverage of the
Company by security analysts and media could be reduced, which could result in
lower prices for our Common Stock than might otherwise prevail and could also
result in increased spreads between the bid and ask prices for the our Common
Stock. Additionally, certain investors will not purchase securities that are
not quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market, which could materially impair our
ability to raise funds through the issuance of Common Stock or other securities
convertible into Common Stock. 

 In addition, if the trading price of the our Common Stock is less
than 5.00 per share, trading in our Common Stock could also be subject to the
requirements of Rule 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. Under that Rule, brokers and dealers who recommend such
low priced securities to persons other than established customers and
accredited investors must satisfy special sales practice requirements,
including a requirement that they make an individualized written suitability
determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written consent
prior to any transaction. The 

28 

Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny
Stock Reform Act of 1990 also requires additional disclosure in connection with
any trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock (generally, according to
regulations adopted by the SEC, any equity security not traded on an exchange
or quoted on Nasdaq that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share,
subject to certain exceptions), including the delivery, prior to any penny
stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market
and the risks associated therewith. Such requirements could severely limit the
market liquidity of our Common Stock. There can be no assurance that our Common
Stock will not become treated as penny stock.

(1) The amount of imputed

million using an effective interest rate of 8.5 . Includes 22.8 million in
payments expected to be made under bargain lease renewals. 

 (2) As
of December 31, 2004, Fatburger was under contract to purchase advertising
for 0.3 million. 

 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

 In order to facilitate the development of franchise
locations, as of December 31, 2004, Fatburger had guaranteed the annual
minimum lease payments of three restaurant sites owned and operated by
franchisees. The amount of the guarantees approximate 1.9 million plus certain
contingent rental payments as defined in the respective leases. These leases
expire at various times though 2008. 

 We did not have any other
off balance sheet arrangements in place as of December 31, 2004. 

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

 Our market risk is primarily the exposure to loss
resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and
commodity prices. Our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations arises from our
UK investment in BEP and our investment in Barcelona real estate. Approximately
15 of the Company s equity is currently invested in net assets located outside
of the United States as of December 31, 2004. These investments are
primarily denominated in British pounds or the Euro. 

29 

Our interest rate risk is sensitive to many factors
beyond our control, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic
and international economic and political considerations, and other factors. Changes
in the general level of interest rates can affect our net income by affecting
the spread between our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing
liabilities and by increasing the cost associated with operating and expanding
our restaurant operation. Changes in the level of interest rates can also
affect, among other things, the value of our interest-earning assets and our
ability to acquire loans. 

 The
following table sets forth information as to the type of funding used to
finance our assets as of December 31, 2004. As indicated by the table, a
large percentage of our assets are generally funded by equity or by fixed-rate
liabilities. This represents a significant decrease in interest rate risk which
resulted from the sale of the remainder of the mortgage-backed securities
portfolio and the associated repayment of the associated repurchase agreements
during 2004.

related to unpredictable factors such as weather and various other market
conditions outside our control. Our ability to recover increased costs through
higher prices is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND
DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

 Ernst Young LLP was previously the
principal accountant for the Company. The firm advised the Company on July 16,
2004 that the firm would resign as the Company s auditors upon completion of
its review of the interim financial information for the second quarter 2004 and
filing of the Company s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ending June 30, 2004. The Company announced the resignation of
Ernest Young LLP on July 23, 2004. The Form 10-Q was
filed on August 16, 2004. 

 During the Company s most recent two fiscal years,
Ernst Young LLP s report on the financial statements did not contain
an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion nor was qualified or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. During the Company s most
recent two fiscal years there were no disagreements with Ernst Young
LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosures, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements if not
resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst Young LLP, would have caused
Ernst Young LLP to make references to the subject matter of the
disagreements in connection with its report. During the Company s most recent
two fiscal years there were no reportable events as such term is defined in
Regulation S-K 304(a)(1)(v). 

 The Company appointed UHY
LLP as its principal accountants on September 7, 2004. The decision to
hire UHY LLP was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Ernst 
Young LLP will continue to provide tax consulting and compliance services for
the Company. 

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

 (A) Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures . Our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the
effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) as of the end of the period covered by this report, have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and
designed to ensure that material information relating to us and our
consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to us by others within these
entities. 

 (B) Changes
in internal control over financial reporting . There
were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 that has materially
affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
financial reporting. 

 (C) Resolution of Reportable Conditions Fatburger. Prior
to our acquisition of Fatburger, the independent auditors determined that
Fatburger had significant deficiencies in internal control which may have
affected its ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data. While
these issues did not constitute a material weakness, we have made improvements
to the internal controls and these issues were resolved as of December 31,
2004. 

 ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION 

 During the fourth quarter
of 2004, there were no disclosures required to be reported on Form 8-K
that were not reported.

of WFSG. Until October 1999, Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Berchtold
were Senior Vice Presidents of WFSG. Mr. Coleman and Mr. Dale-Johnson
were directors of WFSG until July 1999. In order to address liquidity
concerns and to improve WFSG s financial condition, WFSG and an unofficial
committee of holders of a majority of WFSG s outstanding publicly issued notes
agreed to a restructuring of WFSG. In connection with the restructuring, WFSG
filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 

33 

Code
in the Federal Court of Wilmington, Delaware on March 3, 1999. On April 12,
1999, the bankruptcy court approved the restructuring plan. On June 10,
1999, the plan became effective. 

 Mr. Wiederhorn pled
guilty on June 3, 2004 to two federal counts. The first count, a violation
of an ERISA provision, involved a federal law that required no criminal intent
and for which his reliance on the advice of counsel was not a defense. The
second count related to a violation involving a deduction on a personal tax
return. The deduction was structured and approved by Mr. Wiederhorn s tax
advisors and did not reduce Mr. Wiederhorn s tax liability or reduce the
government s tax collections. The charges to which Mr. Wiederhorn has pled
guilty pursuant to the Settlement are not based upon any acts or omission of
the Company or of Mr. Wiederhorn in his capacity as an officer or director
of the Company. See Item 3 Legal Proceedings. 

 AUDIT
COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT 

 The Audit Committee
currently consists of Don H. Coleman, K. Kenneth Kotler, Christopher T. DeWolfe
and M. Ray Mathis, each of whom are independent (as independence is defined in Rule 4200(a) (15)
of the National Association of Securities Dealers listing standards). David
Dale-Johnson was a member of the Audit Committee until June 2004, when he
was appointed Chief Investment Officer. The Audit Committee is responsible for
the appointment and oversight of the independent public accountants, reviews
with the independent public accountants the plans and results of the audit
engagement, approves professional services provided by the independent public
accountants, reviews the independence of the independent public accountants,
considers the range of audit and non-audit fees and reviews the adequacy of the
Company s internal accounting controls. 

 The
Board of Directors has determined that we have at least one Audit Committee
Financial Expert as defined by Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 serving on our audit committee. The directors have determined that Don
Coleman is independent, as that term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of
Schedule 14a under the Securities Exchange Act, and has all of the following
five attributes due to his experience overseeing and assessing the performance
of companies with respect to the preparation and evaluation of financial
statements: 

 An
understanding of GAAP and financial statements; 

 The
ability to assess the general application of such principles in connection with
the accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves; 

 Experience
preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial statements that present
a breadth and level of complexity of accounting issues that are generally
comparable to the breadth and complexity of issues that can reasonably be
expected to be raised by the Company s financial statements, or experience
actively supervising one or more persons engaged in such activities; 

 An
understanding of internal controls and procedures for financial reporting; and 

 An
understanding of audit committee functions. 

 Section 16(a) Beneficial
Ownership Reporting Compliance 

 Based solely on a review
of Forms 3, 4 and 5 and amendments thereto furnished to us for the year ended December 31,
2004, the Company s directors, officers, or beneficial owners of more than 10 
of the Company s Common Stock timely furnished reports on Forms 3, 4 or 5,
except that (i) Mr. Wiederhorn reported seven transactions late on
three Forms 4 filed in 2004 and one Form 5 filed in 2005; (ii) Clarence
B. Coleman reported twenty-three transactions late on one Form 4 and filed
a late Form 3; (iii) Christopher DeWolfe reported three transactions
late on three Forms 4; (iv) Matt Green reported two transactions late on
one Form 4; (v) David Dale-Johnson reported one transaction late on
one Form 4; 

34 

(vi) K.
Kenneth Kotler reported three transactions late on one Form 4 and (vii) M.
Ray Mathis reported five transactions late on one Form 4 filed in 2004 and one Form 5
filed in 2004. 

 Code of Ethics 

 The Board of Directors has
adopted a code of ethics designed, in part, to deter wrongdoing and to promote
honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships,
full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
documents that we file with or submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission
and in our other public communications, compliance with applicable governmental
laws, rules and regulations, the prompt internal reporting of violations
of the code to an appropriate person or persons, as identified in the code and
accountability for adherence to the code. The code of ethics applies to
officers, directors and employees of the Company. A copy of the code is posted in the Management Team section on our
internet website, www.fccgi.com. In addition, we intend to post any future
amendments to or waivers of our code of ethics as it applies to certain persons
on our website.

been continually employed by the Company since the date of award, provided
however, that the Trustees and the Company may agree in writing that the period
of service need not be continuous for an officer or employee that leaves the
Company for a period of not more than 36 months. The Trustees and the Company
have agreed that Andrew Wiederhorn need not provide continuous service and may
leave the Company for a period of not more than 36 months without forfeiting
his beneficial rights under the Trust. Trust allocations were awarded in the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 in the following amounts of shares: Mr. Wiederhorn 117,500;
Mr. Stevenson 50,000; Mr. Berchtold 25,000 and Mr. Green 10,000.
There were no allocations of Trust assets during the year ended December 31,
2003. Trust allocations were awarded in the fiscal year ended December 31,

Mr. Stevenson 25,000; Ms. Colacurcio 5,000; Mr. Berchtold 5,000
and Mr. Green 5,000. The value of such Trust allocations held as of December 31,
2004, calculated by multiplying the number of shares allocated at December 31,
2004, by the closing market price of the Common Stock at December 31,
2004, was as follows: Mr. Wiederhorn 713,000; Mr. Rosen forfeited; Mr. Stevenson 232,500;
Mr. Berchtold - 93,000; Ms. Colacurcio forfeited, and Mr. Green 46,500.

Employment
Agreements 

 The Company has employment agreements with Andrew A.
Wiederhorn and R. Scott Stevenson (each an Executive and collectively, the Executives ). 

 The Company entered into a new employment agreement
with Mr. Wiederhorn effective June 30, 2003. The employment agreement
provides for an initial three-year term commencing July 1, 2003, which is
automatically renewable for successive two-year terms unless either party gives
written notice of termination to the other at least 90 days prior to the
expiration of the then-current employment term. The employment agreement with Mr. Wiederhorn
provides for a base salary of not less than 350,000 annually, plus an annual
bonus as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. 

 Mr. Wiederhorn may terminate his employment
agreement at any time for Good Reason or with or without Good Reason during the
Change in Control Protection Period (if a Change in Control occurs)
(capitalized terms as defined in the employment agreement of Mr. Wiederhorn).
If Mr. Wiederhorn terminates his employment agreement at any time for Good
Reason or with or without Good Reason during the Change in Control Protection
Period (if a Change in Control occurs), or if Mr. Wiederhorn is terminated
by the Company without Cause or the employment agreement is not renewed in
accordance with the employment agreement, Mr. Wiederhorn will be entitled
to receive (i) any unreimbursed business expenses, (ii) any base
salary, bonus, vacation pay or other deferred compensation accrued or earned
but not yet paid at the date of termination, (iii) three years base salary
in effect on the date of termination and (iv) three times the amount of
his annual bonus for the prior fiscal year. Mr. Wiederhorn will also be
entitled to (i) accelerated full vesting under all outstanding
equity-based and long-term incentive plans with options remaining outstanding
as provided under the applicable stock option plan and a pro rata payment under
any long term incentive plans based on actual coverage under such plans payment
being made at the time payments would normally be made under such plans; (ii) any
other amounts or benefits due Mr. Wiederhorn under the then applicable
employee benefit plans of the Company (in accordance with such plan, policy or
practice); (iii) three years of additional service and compensation credit
(at his then compensation level) for pension purposes under any defined benefit
type qualified or nonqualified pension plan or arrangement of the Company,
measured from the date of termination of employment and not credited to the
extent that Mr. Wiederhorn is otherwise entitled to such credit during
such three year period, which payments shall be made through and in accordance
with the terms of the nonqualified defined benefit pension arrangement if any
then exists, or, if not, in an actuarially equivalent lump sum (using the
actuarial factors then applying in the Company s defined benefit plan covering Mr. Wiederhorn);
(iv) three years of the maximum Company contribution (assuming Mr. Wiederhorn
deferred the maximum amount and continued to earn his then current salary)
measured from the date of termination under any type of qualified or
nonqualified 401(k) plan (payable at the end of each such year); and (v) continued
medical coverage for Mr. Wiederhorn, his spouse and dependents for three
years. 

37 

The Company entered into a new employment agreement
with Mr. Stevenson effective June 30, 2003. The employment agreement
provides for an initial one year term commencing July 1, 2003, which is
automatically renewable for successive one year terms unless either party gives
written notice of termination to the other at least 60 days prior to the
expiration of the then-current employment term. The employment agreement with Mr. Stevenson
provides for a base salary of not less than 150,000 annually, plus an annual
bonus as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. 

 The employment agreements also provide that the
Executives may participate in the Company s Stock Plan. 

 The employment agreements provide that during the
employment term and thereafter, the Company will indemnify the Executives to
the fullest extent permitted by law, in connection with any claim against the
Executive as a result of the Executive serving as an officer or director of the
Company or in any capacity at the request of the Company in or with regard to
any other entity, employee benefit plan or enterprise. 

 If termination is the result of an Executive s death,
the Company will pay to the Executive s spouse (or his estate), an amount equal
to (i) any earned but not yet paid compensation (as described in the
agreements), (ii) accelerated full vesting under all outstanding
equity-based and long term incentive plans with options remaining outstanding
as provided under the applicable stock option plan and a pro rata payment under
any long term incentive plans based on actual coverage under such plans at the
time payments normally would be made under such plans, (iii) any other
amounts or benefits due under then applicable employee benefit plans of the
Company (in accordance with such plan, policy or practice), (iv) payment
of six months of base salary to the Executive s spouse or dependents and (vi) in
the case of Mr. Wiederhorn, continued medical coverage for the Executive s
spouse and dependents for the maximum period allowed under COBRA. 

 If an Executive s
employment is terminated by reason of disability, the Executive will be
entitled to receive payments and benefits to which his representatives would be
entitled in the event of his termination by reason of death, provided that the
payment of base salary will be reduced by any long-term disability payments
under any policy maintained by the Company. If the Executive is terminated by
the Company with Cause or the Executive terminates his employment without Good
Reason outside of the Change in Control Protection Period, the Executive will
be entitled to receive only his base salary through the date of termination and
any unreimbursed business expenses. 

 Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 

 The Compensation Committee currently consists of Don
Coleman, Christopher DeWolfe, and K. Kenneth, Kotler. No member of the
Compensation Committee was formerly an officer of the Company. In the year
ended December 31, 2004, no executive officer of the Company served as a
member of the board of directors or the compensation committee of another
entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Compensation Committee of
the Company. 

 Stock Purchase Loans to Officers. Prior to the passage of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we had negotiated employment agreements with senior
executives, which allowed these executives to borrow a specified maximum amount
from us to purchase shares of common stock. These loans are full recourse,
secured loans bearing interest at the prime rate. At December 31, 2004, in
addition to the 2.0 million loan to Mr. Wiederhorn described below, we
had outstanding stock purchase loans to Mr. Wiederhorn including accrued
interest, of approximately 1.0 million. The Company is not obligated to make
additional advances on loans under the employment agreements, and all other
loans to executive officers have been paid in full. The remaining outstanding
loans are described as follows: 

38 

On February 21, 2002, we loaned Mr. Wiederhorn
 175,000 to finance the purchase of common stock. This loan is fully recourse
to Mr. Wiederhorn and is secured by all of Mr. Wiederhorn s rights
under his employment agreement. We are entitled to net amounts payable under
the employment agreement against any amounts payable by Mr. Wiederhorn
upon any default or at maturity of the loan. At Mr. Wiederhorn s direction
(in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement), on February 21,
2002, we loaned a limited partnership controlled by Mr. Wiederhorn s
spouse (the LP 687,000 to finance the purchase of common stock. The loan is
secured by the membership interests of two limited liability companies owned by
the LP. The limited liability companies each own a parcel of real property in
Oregon and have no liabilities. At the time of the loan, the real property had
an appraised value of 725,000. The loan is also guaranteed by Mr. Wiederhorn.
The common stock purchased with the proceeds of these loans does not serve as
security for the loans. The loans are due on February 21, 2007, and bear
interest at the prime rate, as published in the Wall Street Journal, which
interest is added to the principal annually. 

 At December 31, 2004, the total amount of loans
receivable from Mr. Wiederhorn, including compounded interest and the 2
million loan described below, was 3.0 million. Further information on these
loans to Mr. Wiederhorn is included in our annual proxy statement for 2004
and prior years and Mr. Wiederhorn s employment agreement has been
previously filed with the SEC. 

 Loan to Executive Officer . Prior
to the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we had loaned Mr. Wiederhorn
 2.0 million. This loan is fully recourse to Mr. Wiederhorn and is secured
by trust deeds on two residences located in Oregon. The loan is due on August 1,
2007 and bears interest at 8.5 per annum, payable monthly. The Board of
Directors (with Mr. Wiederhorn abstaining) concluded that the terms of the
loan were at least as favorable to the Company as would be available in an arms
length, third party transaction and approved the loan on July 9, 2002. 

 Fog Cutter Long-Term Vesting
Trust . In the fourth quarter of 2000, we established a
trust which purchased 525,000 shares of the Company s common stock from an
unrelated shareholder. Our contribution to the trust of approximately 1.3
million was included in compensation expense for the year ended December 31,
2000. The trust was established for the benefit of our employees and directors
to raise their ownership in the Company, thereby strengthening the mutuality of
interests between them and our shareholders. While these shares are held in trust,
they will be voted ratably with ballots cast by all other shareholders. Using
the retained earnings on trust assets, the trust has subsequently purchased an
additional 169,500 shares of our stock from various shareholders and is
expected to purchase approximately 90,000 additional shares during the second
quarter of 2005. 

 Andrew Wiederhorn, K. Kenneth Kotler and Don H.
Coleman are the trustees for the trust. Pursuant to the terms of the trust, the
trustees will, from time to time, allocate the shares to our employees. An
employee shall not have any rights with respect to any shares allocated to him
unless and until the employee completes five years of continuous service with
the Company, commencing with the date the employee is first allocated such shares,
provided however, that the trustees and the Company may agree in writing that
the period of service need not be continuous for an officer or employee who
leaves the Company for a period of not more than 36 months. The trustees and
the Company have agreed that Andrew Wiederhorn need not provide continuous
service and may leave the Company for a period of not more than 36 months
without forfeiting his beneficial rights under the Trust. Upon the employee s
completion of the vesting period, the trustees shall promptly distribute to
such employee the shares allocated to such employee; provided, however, that
the trustees may, in lieu of distributing the shares, make a cash payment to
the employee equal to the fair market value of the shares allocated to such
employee as of the date immediately prior to the date of distribution or
distribute any combination of cash or shares, as determined by the trustees, in
their sole discretion. 

 As of December 31, 2004, the trustees had
allocated 598,000 shares to our employees and directors. 

39 

Call Option. On March 14,
2005, we exercised an option (the Call Option to acquire 423,245 shares of
the Company s Common Stock from Mr. Wiederhorn, the Company s former Chief
Executive Officer and current Chief Strategic Officer for an exercise price of
 3.99 per share. The Call Option had been acquired from Mr. Wiederhorn on April 27,
2004. The original purchase price for the Call Option was 750,000, resulting
in an all-in cost to the Company on exercise of approximately 5.76 per share.
The aggregate price to the Company on exercise of 5.76 per share represented a
small premium to the Company s book value per share and market price per share
at the time the option was purchased. The strike price for the shares was less
than the Company s book value per share and approximated the recent trading
range of the stock in the marketplace. At the time the Call Option was
purchased, the Company and its directors also considered the following factors:
(1) the potentially negative impact on the Company s share price if the
Option Shares were disposed of publicly; (2) the Company s favorable
liquidity position; (3) the potential reduction in the risk that shares
are transferred in a transaction which would have an adverse impact on its NOL
position; and (4) the reduction in the future expenditure of cash
dividends by the Company once the Company exercises the Call Option. The Board
of Directors reviewed the transaction to confirm that the transaction was in
the best interest of the Company and its other stockholders. 

 Business
Use of Private Aircraft. During 2004, we paid 342,000
to Peninsula Capital Partners LLC Peninsula Capital ), an entity owned by Mr. Wiederhorn,
for the Company s business use of certain private aircraft. The Board of
Directors is aware of the relationship and approved the fees for the use of the
aircraft. The fee paid is a reimbursement of costs to Peninsula Capital for the
Company s use of the aircraft.

 The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
administers the executive compensation programs of the Company. The
Compensation Committee currently consists of Don H. Coleman, Christopher T.
DeWolfe and K. Kenneth Kotler, three non-employee directors. David Dale-Johnson
was a member of the Compensation Committee until August 2004, when he was
appointed Chief Investment Officer and replaced by Christopher T. DeWolfe. All
actions of the Compensation Committee pertaining to executive compensation are
submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. 

 The Company s executive compensation program is
designed to attract, retain, and motivate high caliber executives and to focus
the interests of the executives on objectives that enhance stockholder value. These
goals are attained by emphasizing pay for performance by having a portion of
the executive s compensation dependent upon business results and by providing
equity interests in the Company. The principal elements of the Company s
executive compensation program are base salary, bonus, and stock options. In
addition, the Company recognizes individual contributions as well as overall
business results, using a discretionary bonus program. 

 Base Salary. Base
salaries for the Company s executives are intended to reflect the scope of each
executive s responsibilities, the success of the Company, and contributions of
each executive to that success. Executive salaries are adjusted gradually over
time and only as necessary to meet this objective. Increases in base salary may
be moderated by other considerations, such as geographic or market data,
industry trends or internal fairness within the Company. 

 Bonuses . The
Company paid annual bonuses in 2004. The Committee determined the amount of the
annual discretionary and other bonuses paid by the Company. The bonus for Mr. Green
was based upon a percentage of revenues generated through Mr. Green s
direct efforts. The bonuses for other executive officers were based upon their
contribution and value to the Company. 

 Stock Option Plan . At
its initial public offering in April 1998, the Company adopted the Stock
Plan. The purpose of the Stock Plan is to enable the Company to attract, retain
and motivate key employees and 

40 

directors by providing
them with equity participation in the Company. Accordingly, the Stock Plan
permits the Company to grant stock options, restricted stock and stock
appreciation rights (collectively Awards to employees, directors,
consultants, and vendors of the Company and subsidiaries of the Company. The
Board of Directors has delegated administration of the Stock Plan to the
Compensation Committee. 

 Under the Stock Plan, the Compensation Committee may
grant stock options with an exercise price not less than the fair market value
of the shares covered by the option on the date the option is granted. The
Compensation Committee may also grant Awards of restricted shares of Common
Stock. Each restricted stock Award would specify the number of shares of Common
Stock to be issued to the recipient, the date of issuance, any consideration
for such shares and the restrictions imposed on the shares (including the
conditions of release or lapse of such restrictions). The Compensation
Committee may also grant Awards of stock appreciation rights. A stock
appreciation right entitles the holder to receive from the Company, in cash or
Common Stock, at the time of exercise, the excess of the fair market value at
the date of exercise of a share of Common Stock over a specified price fixed by
the Compensation Committee in the Award, multiplied by the number of shares as
to which the right is being exercised. The specified price fixed by the
Compensation Committee will not be less than the fair market value of shares of
Common Stock at the date the stock appreciation right was granted. In 2004, the
Company issued options to purchase 577,000 shares (net of forfeitures) to
executive officers, directors and employees. 

 In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company established
the Fog Cutter Long-Term Vesting Trust (the Trust ), which purchased 525,000 shares of the Company s
Common Stock from an unrelated stockholder. The Company s contribution to the
Trust of approximately 1.3 million was included in the Company s compensation
expenses in 2000. The Trust was established for the benefit of the Company s
employees and directors to raise their ownership in the Company, thereby
strengthening the mutuality of interests between them and the Company s
stockholders. In December 2002, the Trust purchased an additional 100,000
shares of the Company s Common Stock from an unrelated stockholder. Retained
earnings from the Trust were used to fund the December 2002 purchase. In
addition, during April 2004, the Trust again used its retained earnings
and purchased 69,500 shares of the Company s stock from Clarence Coleman, a
shareholder who, at the time, owned 10 of the common stock. 

 Pursuant to the terms of the Trust, the trustees will,
from time to time, allocate the shares to the Company s employees. An employee
will not have any rights with respect to any shares allocated to him unless and
until the employee completes five years of continuous service with the Company,
commencing with the date the employee is first allocated such shares; provided
however, that the trustees and the Company may agree in writing that the period
of service need not be continuous for an officer or employee who leaves the
Company for a period of not more than 36 months. The trustees and the Company
have agreed that Andrew Wiederhorn need not provide continuous service and may
leave the Company for a period of not more than 36 months without forfeiting
his beneficial rights under the Trust. Prior to the completion of the vesting
period, the trustees will vote the shares ratably with ballots cast by all
other stockholders. Upon the employee s completion of the vesting period, the
trustees shall promptly distribute to such employee the shares allocated to
such employee; provided, however, that the trustees may, in lieu of
distributing the shares, make a cash payment to the employee equal to the fair
market value of the shares allocated to such employee as of the date
immediately prior to the date of distribution or distribute any combination of
cash or shares, as determined by the trustees, in their sole discretion. 

 In September 2002, the trustees allocated 285,500
shares to the Company s employees or directors. During July 2004, the
trustees allocated an additional 367,500 shares to Company s employees and
directors. Of this amount, 55,000 shares previously allocated to former
employees were forfeited. As a result, at December 31, 2004, a total of
598,000 shares have been allocated to employees and directors and 96,500 shares
remain unallocated. 

41 

Policy of Deductibility of
Compensation . Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code limits the Company s tax deduction to 1 million for compensation
paid to the Named Executive Officers, unless certain requirements are met. One
of these requirements is that compensation over 1 million must be performance
based. The Compensation Committee intends to continue to use performance-based
compensation in the future, which should minimize the effect of this deduction
limitation. However, the Compensation Committee strongly believes that its
primary responsibility is to provide a compensation program that will attract,
retain and reward the executive talent necessary to maximize the return to
stockholders, and that the loss of a tax deduction may be necessary in some
circumstances. Base salary does not qualify as performance-based compensation
under IRS regulations. 

 CEO
Compensation and President Compensation . Mr. Wiederhorn
was appointed the Company s Chief Executive Officer at its formation and Mr. Rosen
was appointed as its President in December 2002. The base salaries for Mr. Wiederhorn
and Mr. Rosen for 2004 were determined by the Compensation Committee and
are set forth in their employment agreements, which are described under Employment
Agreements. Mr. Rosen resigned as the Company s President on March 26,
2004. On June 3, 2004, the Company announced that Mr. Wiederhorn
would take a leave of absence from his corporate positions at the Company. To
address the management transition, the Board of Directors appointed Donald J. Berchtold
as Co-Chief Executive Officer in June 2004. Mr. Wiederhorn began his
leave of absence on August 2, 2004. In August 2004, the Board of
Directors, with Mr. Wiederhorn s consent, changed Mr. Wiederhorn s
position from Co-Chief Executive Officer to Chief Strategic Officer, and
changed Mr. Berchtold s position from Co-Chief Executive Officer to sole
Chief Executive Officer.

(the Rosen Agreement by and among Andrew A. Wiederhorn, Robert G. Rosen and
Valerie Rosen, as joint tenant with Robert G. Rosen (Valerie Rosen, together
with Robert G. Rosen, the Rosen Agreement Stockholders ), Robert G. Rosen, as
Agent for the Rosen Agreement Stockholders, and Tiffany Wiederhorn solely with
respect to certain payment obligations. The Rosen Agreement granted Mr. Wiederhorn
the right to vote or direct the vote of all of the shares held by each such
Rosen Agreement Stockholder, which number 423,245 in the aggregate (the Rosen
Shares ). The Rosen Agreement allowed Mr. Wiederhorn to direct the voting
of the Rosen Shares at his discretion at any annual and special meetings of the
stockholders of the Company and in written consents of stockholders in lieu of
a meeting of stockholders. In exchange for the voting rights over the Common
Stock held by the Rosen Agreement Stockholders, Mr. Wiederhorn granted
each Rosen Agreement Stockholder a Put Option (as defined in the Rosen
Agreement) whereupon each Rosen Agreement Stockholder could require Mr. Wiederhorn
to purchase such Rosen Agreement Stockholder s shares in a specified time
period at a price determined from the book value of the Company at the month
end prior to the time of exercise of the Put Option.

Stockholders exercised the Put Option to require Mr. Wiederhorn to
purchase all of the shares subject to the Rosen Agreement. Mr. Wiederhorn

children. On April 27, 2004, Mr. Wiederhorn and his minor children
acquired such 423,245 shares of Common Stock from the Rosen Agreement
Stockholders. On the same day the Company purchased a three year call option
(the Call Option from Mr. Wiederhorn pursuant to a Call Option
Agreement between the Company and Mr. Wiederhorn (the Call Option
Agreement ). The Call Option gives the Company the right, but not the
obligation, to purchase 423,245 shares of outstanding Common Stock from Mr. Wiederhorn
for a purchase price of 3.99 per share. The option may be exercised at any
time from April 27, 2004 to April 27, 2007. The Company paid
 750,000 1.77 per option share) for the Call Option. The premium paid for the
Call Option, together with the strike price, represented a small premium to the
Company s book value per share and market price per share at the time the
option was purchased. 

 On March 14, 2005, the Company exercised the Call
Option to acquire 423,245 shares of the Company s Common Stock from Mr. Wiederhorn

(1) In the fourth quarter of
2000, the Company established the Fog Cutter Long-Term Vesting Trust (the Trust ),
which purchased 525,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock from an unrelated
shareholder. The Company s contribution to the Trust of approximately 1.3
million was included in the Company s compensation expenses for the year ended December 31,
2000. Subsequently, the Trust has used Trust earnings to fund the purchase of
169,500 additional shares of Company stock. 

 The Trust was established for the benefit of the
Company s employees and directors to raise their ownership in the Company,
thereby strengthening the mutuality of interests between them and the Company s
shareholders. While these shares are held in trust, they will be voted ratably
with ballots cast by all other shareholders. 

 Pursuant to the terms of the Trust, the trustees will,
from time to time, allocate the shares to the Company s employees. An employee
will not have any rights with respect to any shares allocated to him unless and
until the employee completes five years of continuous service with the Company,
commencing with the date the employee is first allocated such shares; provided
however, that the trustees and the Company may agree in writing that the period
of service need not be continuous for an officer or employee who leaves the
Company for a period of not more than 36 months. The trustees and the Company
have agreed that Andrew Wiederhorn need not provide continuous service and may
leave the Company for a period of not more than 36 months without forfeiting
his beneficial rights under the Trust. Upon the employee s completion of the
vesting period, the trustees shall promptly distribute to such employee the
shares allocated to such employee; provided, however, that the trustees may, in
lieu of distributing the shares, make a cash payment to the employee equal to
the fair market value of the shares allocated to such employee as of the date
immediately prior to the date of distribution or distribute any combination of
cash or shares, as determined by the trustees, in their sole discretion. 

 As of December 31,
2004, the trustees had allocated 598,000 shares to the Company s employees and
directors. 

 ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND
RELATED TRANSACTIONS 

 Stock Purchase Loans to Officers 

 Prior to the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, we had negotiated employment agreements with senior executives, which
allowed these executives to borrow a specified maximum amount from us to
purchase shares of common stock. These loans are full recourse, secured loans
bearing interest at the prime rate. At December 31, 2004, in addition to
the 2.0 million loan to Mr. Wiederhorn described below, we had
outstanding stock purchase loans to Mr. Wiederhorn including accrued
interest, of approximately 

48 

1.0 million. The Company
is not obligated to make additional advances on loans under the employment
agreements, and all other loans to executive officers have been paid in full. The
remaining outstanding loans are described as follows: 

 On February 21, 2002, we loaned Mr. Wiederhorn
 175,000 to finance the purchase of common stock. This loan is fully recourse
to Mr. Wiederhorn and is secured by all of Mr. Wiederhorn s rights
under his employment agreement. We are entitled to net amounts payable under
the employment agreement against any amounts payable by Mr. Wiederhorn
upon any default or at maturity of the loan. At Mr. Wiederhorn s direction
(in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement), on February 21,
2002, we loaned a limited partnership controlled by Mr. Wiederhorn s
spouse (the LP 687,000 to finance the purchase of common stock. The loan is
secured by the membership interests of two limited liability companies owned by
the LP. The limited liability companies each own a parcel of real property in
Oregon and have no liabilities. At the time of the loan, the real property had
an appraised value of 725,000. The loan is also guaranteed by Mr. Wiederhorn.
The common stock purchased with the proceeds of these loans does not serve as
security for the loans. The loans are due on February 21, 2007, and bear
interest at the prime rate, as published in the Wall Street Journal, which
interest is added to the principal annually. 

 At December 31, 2004,
the total amount of loans receivable from Mr. Wiederhorn, including
compounded interest and the 2 million loan described below, was 3.0 million.
Further information on these loans to Mr. Wiederhorn is included in our
annual proxy statement for 2004 and prior years and Mr. Wiederhorn s
employment agreement has been previously filed with the SEC. 

 Loan to Executive Officer 

 Prior to the passage of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we had loaned Mr. Wiederhorn 2.0 million.
This loan is fully recourse to Mr. Wiederhorn and is secured by trust
deeds on two residences located in Oregon. The loan is due on August 1,
2007 and bears interest at 8.5 per annum, payable monthly. The Board of
Directors (with Mr. Wiederhorn abstaining) concluded that the terms of the
loan were at least as favorable to the Company as would be available in an arms
length, third party transaction and approved the loan on July 9, 2002. 

 Fog Cutter Long-Term Vesting Trust 

 In the fourth quarter of 2000, we established a trust
which purchased 525,000 shares of the Company s common stock from an unrelated
shareholder. Our contribution to the trust of approximately 1.3 million was
included in compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2000. The
trust was established for the benefit of our employees and directors to raise
their ownership in the Company, thereby strengthening the mutuality of
interests between them and our shareholders. While these shares are held in
trust, they will be voted ratably with ballots cast by all other shareholders. Using
the retained earnings on trust assets, the trust has subsequently purchased an
additional 169,500 shares of our stock from various shareholders and is
expected to purchase approximately 90,000 additional shares during the second
quarter of 2005. 

 Andrew Wiederhorn, K. Kenneth Kotler and Don H.
Coleman are the trustees for the trust. Pursuant to the terms of the trust, the
trustees will, from time to time, allocate the shares to our employees. An
employee shall not have any rights with respect to any shares allocated to him
unless and until the employee completes five years of continuous service with
the Company, commencing with the date the employee is first allocated such
shares; provided however, that the trustees and the Company may agree in
writing that the period of service need not be continuous for an officer or
employee who leaves the Company for a period of not more than 36 months. The
trustees and the Company have agreed that Andrew Wiederhorn need not provide
continuous service and may leave the Company for a period of not more than 36
months without forfeiting his beneficial rights under the Trust. Upon the
employee s 

49 

completion of the vesting
period, the trustees shall promptly distribute to such employee the shares
allocated to such employee; provided, however, that the trustees may, in lieu
of distributing the shares, make a cash payment to the employee equal to the
fair market value of the shares allocated to such employee as of the date
immediately prior to the date of distribution or distribute any combination of
cash or shares, as determined by the trustees, in their sole discretion. 

 As of December 31,
2004, the trustees had allocated 598,000 shares to our employees and directors. 

 Call Option 

 On March 14, 2005, we
exercised an option (the Call Option to acquire 423,245 shares of the
Company s Common Stock from Mr. Wiederhorn, the Company s former Chief
Executive Officer and current Chief Strategic Officer for an exercise price of
 3.99 per share. The Call Option had been acquired from Mr. Wiederhorn on April 27,
2004. The original purchase price for the Call Option was 750,000, resulting
in an all-in cost to the Company on exercise of approximately 5.76 per share.
The aggregate price to the Company on exercise of 5.76 per share represented a
small premium to the Company s book value per share and market price per share
at the time the option was purchased. The strike price for the shares was less
than the Company s book value per share and approximated the recent trading
range of the stock in the marketplace. At the time the Call Option was
purchased, the Company and its directors also considered the following factors:
(1) the potentially negative impact on the Company s share price if the
Option Shares were disposed of publicly; (2) the Company s favorable
liquidity position; (3) the potential reduction in the risk that shares
are transferred in a transaction which would have an adverse impact on its NOL
position; and (4) the reduction in the future expenditure of cash
dividends by the Company once the Company exercises the Call Option. The Board
of Directors reviewed the transaction to confirm that the transaction was in
the best interest of the Company and its other stockholders. 

 Business Use of Private Aircraft 

 During 2004, we paid
 342,000 to Peninsula Capital Partners LLC Peninsula Capital ), an entity
owned by Mr. Wiederhorn, for the Company s business use of certain private
aircraft. The Board of Directors is aware of the relationship and approved the
fees for the use of the aircraft. The fee paid is a reimbursement of costs to
Peninsula Capital for the Company s use of the aircraft.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Fog
Cutter Capital Group Inc. 

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated
statement of financial condition of Fog Cutter Capital Group Inc. and subsidiaries
(the Company ), and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2004.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audit. 

 We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,
we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. 

 In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31,
2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash
flows for the year ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

FOG CUTTER CAPITAL GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(Dollars in thousands, except share data and as noted) 

 NOTE
1 ORGANIZATION AND RELATIONSHIPS 

 The Company was originally
incorporated as Wilshire Real Estate Investment Trust Inc. in the State of
Maryland on October 24, 1997. The Company is not a Real Estate Investment
Trust REIT for tax purposes and has never elected to be treated as such. Effective
January 25, 2001, the Company changed its name to Fog Cutter Capital Group
Inc. to better reflect the diversified nature of its business and investments. At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, certain Company officers and directors
controlled, directly or indirectly, a significant voting majority of the
Company. 

 NOTE
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

 Nature
of Operations The Company operates a restaurant
business, conducts commercial mortgage lending and brokerage activities and
makes real estate investments. The Company s primary sources of revenue are
from loans, real estate and earnings from operating subsidiaries. 

 Principles
of Consolidation The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fog
Cutter Capital Group Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Fatburger Holdings, Inc. Fatburger ), WREP 1998-1 LLC, Fog Cutter Servicing Inc., Fog Cap Commercial
Lending Inc., Fog Cutter Capital Markets Inc., Fog Cap Retail Investors LLC,
Fog Cap Acceptance Inc., BEP Islands Limited and Padraig (a French LLC doing
business as V Model Management). Intercompany accounts have been eliminated in
consolidation. 

 Use
of Estimates in the Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Significant
estimates include the determination of fair values of certain financial
instruments for which there is no active market, the allocation of basis
between assets sold and retained, and valuation allowances for loans and real
estate owned. Estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 

 Sale
Recognition The Company
has been involved in significant sales of mortgage-backed securities, real
estate and other assets. The recognition of sales of financial instruments,
including mortgage-backed securities and loans, occur only when the Company has
irrevocably surrendered control over these assets. The Company will recognize
gain on sales of real estate under the full accrual method when (1) a sale
is consummated, (2) the buyer s initial and continuing investments are
adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property, (3) any
receivable from the buyer is not subject to future subordination and (4) the
usual risks and rewards of ownership of the property have been transferred to
the buyer. If any of these conditions are not met, the accounting policy
requires that gain on sale be deferred until all of the conditions have been
satisfied. 

 Fatburger
Restaurant and Franchise Revenue Revenue
from the operation of Fatburger company-owned restaurants are recognized when
sales occur. Franchise fee revenue from the sale of individual Fatburger
franchises is recognized only when all material services or conditions relating
to the sales have been substantially performed or satisfied. The completion of
training and the opening of a location by the franchisee constitute substantial
performance on the part of Fatburger. Nonrefundable deposits collected 

F- 9 

in relation to the sale of
franchises are recorded as deferred franchise fees until the completion of
training and the opening of the restaurant, at which time the franchise fee
revenue is recognized. In addition to franchise fee revenue, Fatburger collects
a royalty ranging from 5 to 6 of gross sales from restaurants operated by
franchisees. Fatburger recognizes royalty fees as the related sales are made by
the franchisees. Costs relating to continuing franchise support are expensed as
incurred. 

 Fatburger operates on a 52-week calendar and its
fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December 31. Consistent with the
industry, Fatburger measures its stores performance based upon 7 day work
weeks. Using the 52-week cycle ensures consistent weekly reporting for
operations and ensures that each week has the same days, since certain days are
more profitable than others. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated
financial statements reflect a Fatburger fiscal year end of December 26,
2004. 

 Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the
purchase price and other acquisition related costs over the estimated fair
value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The Company does not
amortize goodwill. Intangible assets are stated at the estimated fair value at
the date of acquisition and include trademarks, operating manuals, franchise
agreements and leasehold interests. Trademarks, which have indefinite lives,
are not subject to amortization. All other intangible assets are amortized over
their estimated useful lives, which range from five to fifteen years. The
Company assesses potential impairments to intangible assets at least annually,
or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Judgments regarding the
existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible
assets are based on operational performance of the acquired businesses, market
conditions and other factors. 

 Cash
and Cash Equivalents For
purposes of reporting the consolidated financial condition and cash flows, cash
and cash equivalents include non-restricted cash amounts held at banks, shares
in money market funds and time deposits with original maturities of 90 days or
less. 

 Loans Upon loan origination or purchase, the Company classifies
such loan as held for sale or held for investment. Loans held for sale are
carried at the lower of cost (net of purchase discounts or premiums, deferred
fees and deferred origination costs) or fair value. The Company determines the
fair value of its loans by discounting projected future cash flows at estimated
market yields. The payment history and current status of the loans are factors
that are considered when projecting future cash flows. The Company also
considers the collateral value securing the loans and the ability of the
borrowers to continue making payments. 

 Loans are classified as held for investment based on
management s intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or
until their maturity or payoff. All loans held by the Company at December 31,
2004 and 2003 were classified as held for investment. Loans held for investment
are recorded at their unpaid principal balance, net of discounts and premiums,
unamortized net deferred loan origination costs and fees and allowance for loan
losses. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred
and recognized as adjustments to income over the lives of the related loans.
Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to income over the
estimated life of the loan using methods that approximate the interest method. Interest
is recognized as revenue when earned according to the terms of the loans and
when, in the opinion of management, it is collectible. Loans are evaluated for
collectibility and, if appropriate, interest accrual is discontinued and
previously accrued interest is reversed. Based upon the Company s assessment,
no allowance for loan losses was required with respect to its loans held for
investment at December 31, 2004. Specific valuation allowances may be
established for loans that are deemed impaired, if default by the borrower is
deemed probable, and if the fair value of the loan or the collateral is
estimated to be less than the gross carrying value of the loan. The Company
classifies loans as impaired when, based upon current information and events,
it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due, both
principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the loan
agreement. Impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future
cash flows discounted 

F- 10 

at the loan s effective
interest rate, based on a loan s observable market price, or the fair value of
the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Specific factors used in
the impaired loan identification process include, but are not limited to,
delinquency status, loan-to-value ratio, the condition of the underlying
collateral, credit history, and debt coverage. For impaired loans on non-accrual
status, cash receipts are applied, and interest income is recognized, on a cash
basis. For all other impaired loans, cash receipts are applied to principal and
interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan and interest
income is recognized on the accrual basis. Generally, a loan may be returned to
accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest are brought current
in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and certain performance
criteria have been met. 

 Loan
Origination Income Loan origination income represents
fees received in connection with the Company s commercial mortgage loan
brokerage services provided to independent third party lending institutions.
Loan origination income is recognized as earned upon successful origination of
the loan by the third party lender. 

 Investments In Real Estate Real estate purchased directly is originally recorded at
the purchase price. Any excess of net cost basis over the fair value less
estimated selling costs of real estate acquired through foreclosure is charged
to the allowance for loan losses. Any subsequent operating expenses or income,
reductions in estimated fair values, as well as gains or losses on disposition
of such properties, are recorded in current operations. Depreciation on
investments in real estate is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: 

Buildings and
 improvements 

35 years 

Tenant improvements and assets under capital leases 

Lesser of lease term or useful life (typically 30 years) 

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged
to operations as incurred. Significant renovations are capitalized and
amortized over their expected useful lives. Fees and costs incurred in the
successful negotiation of leases are deferred and amortized on a straight-line
basis over the terms of the respective leases. Rental revenue is reported on a
straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. 

 The Company evaluates its real estate properties,
including properties under capital leases, and other similar long-lived assets
at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company first evaluates these
assets for indicators of impairment such as significant decreases in the
estimated market price of a real estate asset, a significant adverse change in
the extent or manner in which a real estate assets is being used or in its
physical condition, or cash flow combined with a history of operating cash flow
losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses
associated with the use of the long-lived asset. When any such indicators of
impairment are noted, the Company compares the carrying amount of these assets
to the future estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the
use and eventual disposition of the assets. If the undiscounted cash flows are
less than the carrying amount, the Company records an impairment charge equal
to the excess of carrying value over the asset s estimated fair value. Fair
value is estimated in consideration of third party value opinions and
comparative similar asset prices, whenever available, or internally developed
discounted cash flow analysis. 

 Any long-lived assets which the Company expects to
sell or dispose in the near term are stated at the lower of their carrying
amounts or fair value less cost to sell, and are evaluated for impairment
throughout the sales process. 

 Investment in Equity Investees The equity method of accounting is used for investments in
associated companies which are not controlled by the Company and in which the
Company s interest is generally 

F- 11 

between 20 and 50 . The
Company s share of earnings or losses of associated companies, in which at
least 20 of the voting securities is owned, is included in the consolidated
statements of operations. 

 Stock Options The Company has a non-qualified stock option plan the
Option Plan which provides for options to purchase shares of the Company s
common stock. The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related interpretations in accounting for the Option Plan. Accordingly, no
compensation expense has been recognized in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations for grants under the Option Plan. Had compensation expense for the
Company s Option Plan been determined based on the fair value at the grant date
consistent with the methods of SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation , the Company s net loss and loss per share for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002 would have been increased comparable to the pro forma
amounts indicated below:

There were no options granted with exercise prices
below the market value of the stock at the grant date. The weighted average
fair value of options granted during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was 0.76, 0.30, and
 0.76, respectively, for options with exercise prices exceeding the market
price of the stock at the grant date. Fair values were estimated using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions
were used to determine the value of the 2004 options granted: 10 dividend
yield, expected volatility of 86 , risk-free interest rate of 2.5 and expected
lives of five years. 

 Income
Taxes The Company
files its income tax returns with the relevant tax authorities in the United
States on a consolidated basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A
valuation allowance is provided when it is not probable that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. 

 Net Income Per Share Basic EPS excludes
dilution and is computed by dividing the net loss available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for
the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted
into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared
in the earnings of the Company. 

 During the year ended December 31, 2004, the
Company experienced a net loss, which resulted in common stock equivalents
having an anti dilutive effect on earnings per share.

Reclassifications Certain items in the consolidated
financial statements for 2003 and 2002 were reclassified to conform to the 2004
presentation. 

 NOTE
3 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

 In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment FAS 123R ), which
requires that the cost resulting for all share-based payment transactions be
recognized in the financial statements. This Statement requires a public entity
to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of
equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with
limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which
an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award--the
requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is
recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the
requisite service. Employee share purchase plans will not result in recognition
of compensation cost if certain conditions are met; those conditions are much
the same as the related conditions in FAS 123. The provisions of FAS 123R are
effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period
that begins after June 15, 2005. The Company has not yet determined the
effect of this new standard on its consolidated financial position and results
of operations. 

 NOTE 4 BUSINESS COMBINATION 

 On August 15, 2003, the Company acquired a
controlling interest in Fatburger Holdings, Inc. Fatburger ), and began
reporting the operations of Fatburger on a consolidated basis as of that date. Fatburger
operates or franchises 62 hamburger restaurants located primarily in
California, and Nevada. Franchisees currently own and operate 36 of the
Fatburger locations and Fatburger has agreements for approximately 220 new
franchise restaurants. The terms of the original acquisition by the Company
were amended on January 12, 2004 and May 12, 2004. Initially, the
Company made a 5.4 million investment and acquired approximately 83 of the
voting control of Fatburger. However, all but 15 of the ownership investment
was redeemable by Fatburger. On May 12, 2004, the Company contributed an
additional 3.0 million, bringing its total investment to 8.4 million. As a result
of this transaction, the Company s voting control of Fatburger was reduced to
approximately 71 , but the Company retained a non-redeemable, fully diluted 47 
ownership interest in Fatburger. The Company s investment consists of the
purchase of convertible preferred stock (the Series A Preferred and
redeemable preferred stock (the Series D Preferred ). 

 The Series A Preferred is convertible into a 50 
ownership interest of the common stock of Fatburger on a fully diluted basis. The
Company owns approximately 93 of the issued and outstanding Series A
Preferred, and currently holds voting rights equal to 71 of the voting control
of Fatburger. The Series A Preferred is not redeemable and does not pay
dividends. 

 The Series D Preferred has a liquidation
preference and is redeemable by Fatburger for 10.1 million plus accrued but
unpaid dividends. Dividends accrue at a rate of 20 of the redemption value,
compounded annually. The Series D Preferred does not have any voting
rights. The Company owns all of the issued and outstanding Series D
Preferred. 

 The primary reason for the acquisition was to finance
a management led buy-out of Fatburger s majority shareholder. The Company
expects to earn preferred dividends on the investment in the Series D
Preferred and convert the Series A-1 Preferred into common stock in order
to participate in potential future increases in the value of Fatburger. The
Company s ability to transfer the Series A-1 Preferred and the Series D
Preferred is subject to certain restrictions. The shares are also entitled to
certain co-sale rights. As a result of the Company s voting control, it began
reporting the operations of Fatburger on a consolidated basis beginning August 15,
2003.

estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The allocation of the purchase
price was based, in part, on third-party valuations of the fair values of
identifiable intangible assets and restaurant property, plant, and equipment.
The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the portion of assets
and liabilities acquired amounted to 7.1 million and was allocated to goodwill.

 NOTE 13 LEASES 

 In October 2002, the Company purchased leasehold
interests in 109 free-standing retail stores located throughout the United
States. The transaction was completed through the Company s wholly-owned
subsidiary, Fog Cap Retail Investors LLC. The stores are free-standing, retail
locations ranging from 4,500-7,000 square feet each. The initial term of the
leasehold interests at the time of acquisition had an average expiration of
approximately 6 years. However, the Company is entitled to exercise extension
options which will allow the Company to control the properties for an
additional 15 to 30 years. 

 In some cases, the Company has the option to terminate
a lease by giving notice to the property owner. The notice to terminate must
include an offer to purchase the property at a price calculated using a
declining percentage of the original fair market value of the property at the
time the original lease was initiated (generally in the 1970 s and 1980 s). The
property owner then has the option to accept the Company s offer to purchase
the property or allow the lease to terminate. 

 Since the acquisition, the Company sold or terminated
7 of the leases. In addition, the Company purchased the entire fee ownership
interests in 23 of the properties which had been part of the lease portfolio. As
a result, as of December 31, 2004, the Company continues to lease 79 of
the original 109 properties. 

 Of these leases, 35 were on terms and conditions that
required capitalization of the obligation. As of December 31, 2004, the
Company had capitalized a 14.1 million investment in real estate as a result
of the transaction, and had a capital lease obligation of 12.0 million. The
remaining 44 leases are classified as operating leases. 

 The leased properties are sublet to a broad tenant mix
including convenience stores, shoe stores, video rental outlets, auto parts
dealers, carpet retailers and other small businesses. The aggregate future
minimum rentals to be received by the Company under non-cancelable subleases as
of December 31, 2004, was 8.7 million for the properties subject to
capital leases and 6.5 million for the properties subject to operating leases.

NOTE 15 INCOME TAXES 

 As of December 31, 2004, the Company had, for
U.S. Federal tax purposes, a net operating loss NOL carry forward of
approximately 77.6 million, including 13.5 million relating to Fatburger. The
Company s NOL begins to expire in 2018. Fatburger s NOL began to expire in 2004
and is subject to an annual limitation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
Section 382, Limitation on Net Operating Loss Carryovers and Certain
Built-In Losses Following Change in Control. In addition, to the extent the
Fatburger NOL is utilized, the recognition of the related tax benefits would
first reduce goodwill related to Fatburger acquisition, then other non-current
intangible assets related to that acquisition, and then income tax expense in
accordance with Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. 

 United States tax regulations impose limitations on
the use of NOL carry forwards following certain changes in ownership. If such a
change were to occur with respect to the Company, the limitation could
significantly reduce the amount of benefits that would be available to offset
future taxable income each year, starting with the year of ownership change. To
reduce the likelihood of such ownership changes, the Company established a
Shareholder Rights Plan dated as of October 18, 2002, which discourages,
under certain circumstances, ownership changes which would trigger the NOL
limitations.

16 COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK 

 CCL Investigation 

 As the Company has previously disclosed, the Company s
former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Wiederhorn, and former
President, Lawrence Mendelsohn, received letters from the United States
Attorney s Office for the District of Oregon USAODO in March 2001
advising them that they were targets of a grand jury investigation (the CCL
Investigation into the failure of Capital Consultants, L.L.C CCL ). 

 In August 2002, Mr. Mendelsohn resigned as
President and Director of the Company. In November 2003, Mr. Mendelsohn
entered into an agreement with the USAODO pursuant to which he pled guilty to
filing a false 1998 personal tax return and agreed to cooperate in the CCL
Investigation. 

 On June 3, 2004, the
Company announced that Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board
Andrew Wiederhorn had entered into a settlement with the USAODO regarding its
investigation into CCL (the Settlement and would take a leave of absence
from his corporate positions at FCCG. Under the Settlement terms, Mr. Wiederhorn
pled guilty on June 3, 2004 to two federal counts and was sentenced to 18-months
incarceration and fined 2.0 million. The charges to which Mr. Wiederhorn
has pled guilty pursuant to the Settlement are not based upon any acts or
omission involving the Company or of Mr. Wiederhorn in his capacity as an
officer or director of the Company. 

 On June 2, 2004, the Company and Mr. Wiederhorn
entered into a leave of absence agreement. In entering into Mr. Wiederhorn s
leave of absence agreement, the Board of Directors considered the nature of the
statutes to which Mr. Wiederhorn pled and the fact that he relied on the
advice of expert legal counsel and a national accounting firm. The Board also
believed it was important to assure Mr. Wiederhorn s return to active
involvement with the Company because of his expertise and knowledge and to
preserve a significant business relationship and the value of the Company s
investments. 

 Mr. Wiederhorn is currently a director and Chief
Strategic Officer of the Company. Under the terms of the leave of absence
agreement, Mr. Wiederhorn will continue to receive his regular salary and
bonus pursuant to and as set forth in his employment agreement. In addition,
for the reasons stated in the agreement, the Company made a leave of absence
payment to Mr. Wiederhorn in the amount of 2.0 million on June, 2, 2004. 

F- 23 

Mr. Wiederhorn began his leave of absence on August 2,
2004 and is expected to remain in that status for a period of 14 to 18 months. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect a charge to earnings of
 4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This is comprised of
the 2.0 million payment made on June 2, 2004 and the accrual of the
expected salary and bonus relating to the leave of absence period. 

 Mr. Wiederhorn and Mr. Mendelsohn, pursuant to the terms
of their respective employment agreements, may have been entitled to indemnity
from the Company for litigation expenses and personal losses in connection with
the CCL investigations and any related litigation. Mr. Wiederhorn and Mr. Mendelsohn
had notified the Company that, although they believed they were entitled to
primary indemnification from other sources, they were reserving their rights to
seek indemnity from the Company. The Company did not agree to any indemnity
requests. Mr. Wiederhorn released the Company from any and all claims he
may have had relating to the CCL matter as partial consideration for the leave
of absence agreement in June 2004. The USAODO has settled the CCL matter
as it relates to both Mr. Wiederhorn and Mr. Mendelsohn. As a result,
the Company believes that the contingencies relating to the potential
indemnification of these officers or former officers have now been resolved. 

 Strouds
Acquisition Corporation 

 On October 6,
2003, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Strouds Acquisition
Corporation Strouds filed a lawsuit in the United States Bankruptcy Court
which named the Company, among others, as a defendant. The lawsuit was amended
on November 10, 2003 and limited the complaint against the Company solely
in its capacity as collateral agent for certain secured creditors of Strouds
Acquisition Corporation. The lawsuit, as it pertained to the Company, sought
reimbursement of the proceeds from approximately 3.0 million in funds received
in October 2003, which the Company was holding as collateral agent for
other secured creditors. These funds were not included in the assets of the
Company, but were being held in trust. On July 1, 2004, the lawsuit was
settled and the Company distributed the trust funds, net of legal
reimbursements of 0.3 million, in accordance with the settlement agreement. The
Company received a general release from the parties and considers the matter
closed. 

 Shareholder
Derivative Complaint 

 On July 6, 2004, Jeff Allen McCoon, derivatively on behalf of
the Company, filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court for the State of Oregon
(Multnomah County case number 0407-06900) which named the Company and all
of its directors as defendants. The lawsuit alleges that members of the Company s
Board of Directors breached their duties to the Company by entering into the
leave of absence agreement with Andrew Wiederhorn. The lawsuit generally seeks
restitution of payments made under the leave of absence agreement plus attorney
fees and costs. The individual defendants have indemnity agreements with the
Company and have asserted the right to indemnification from the Company under
those indemnity agreements. This case is in the very early pleading stages and
motions are pending against the complaint. The Company may incur expenses under
the indemnity agreements and also may derive benefits if the plaintiff s claims
are successful. At this stage of the case, it is too early to predict the
outcome with any certainty. The complaint is not specific as to the amount of
damages it is seeking against the individual defendants, but it appears to seek
at least the return of 2 million paid to Mr. Wiederhorn under the Leave
of Absence Agreement. 

 Other 

 The Company is involved in various other legal
proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business which the Company
believes will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
condition or operations of the Company. 

F- 24 

The Company may utilize a wide variety of off-balance
sheet financial techniques to manage its risk. In hedging the interest rate
and/or exchange rate exposure of a foreign currency denominated asset or
liability, the Company may enter into hedge transactions to counter movements
in interest rates and foreign currencies. These hedges may be in the form of
currency and interest rate swaps, options, and forwards, or combinations
thereof. 

 At December 31, 2004, the Company had no outstanding
derivative instruments held for trading or hedging purposes. 

 In order to facilitate the development of franchise
locations, as of December 31, 2004, Fatburger had guaranteed the annual
minimum lease payments of three restaurant sites owned and operated by
franchisees. The amount of the guarantees total approximately 1.9 million plus
certain contingent rental payments as defined in the respective leases. These
leases expire at various times through 2008. 

 The Company did not have
any other off balance sheet arrangements in place as of December 31, 2004. 

 NOTE
17 ARRANGEMENTS WITH SENIOR OFFICERS 

 The Company has
employment agreements with Andrew A. Wiederhorn (as Chief Executive Officer;
currently Chief Strategic Officer), and R. Scott Stevenson (as Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer) and, prior to his resignation on March 26,
2004, had an employment agreement with Robert G. Rosen (as President) (each an Executive 
and collectively, the Executives ). 

 The Company
entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Wiederhorn effective June 30,
2003. The employment agreement provides for an initial three-year term
commencing July 1, 2003, which is automatically renewable for successive
two-year terms unless either party gives written notice of termination to the
other at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the then-current employment
term. The employment agreement with Mr. Wiederhorn provides for a base
salary of not less than 350,000 annually, plus an annual bonus as determined
by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. 

 Mr. Wiederhorn
is currently on a leave of absence from the Company. Under the terms of the
leave of absence agreement, Mr. Wiederhorn will continue to receive his
regular salary and bonus pursuant to and as set forth in his employment
agreement. 

 The Company
entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Stevenson effective June 30,
2003. The employment agreement provides for an initial one year term commencing
July 1, 2003, which is automatically renewable for successive one year
terms unless either party gives written notice of termination to the other at
least 60 days prior to the expiration of the then-current employment term.
The employment agreement with Mr. Stevenson provides for a base salary of
not less than 150,000 annually, plus an annual bonus as determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. 

 The Company incurred salary and bonus expenses of 7.3
million, 5.0 million, and 4.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, relating to the Executives under current or prior
employment agreements. 

 Prior to the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, Mr. Wiederhorn s employment agreement allowed him to borrow a
specified maximum amount from the Company to purchase shares of common stock. The
loans are full recourse to the borrower and bear interest at the prime rate. 

 Under this program, on February 21, 2002, the
Company loaned Mr. Wiederhorn 175,000 to finance the purchase of common
stock. This loan is fully recourse to Mr. Wiederhorn and is secured by all
of Mr. Wiederhorn s rights under his employment agreement. At Mr. Wiederhorn s
direction (in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement), on February 21,
2002, the Company also loaned a limited partnership controlled by Mr. Wiederhorn s
spouse (the LP 687,000 to finance the purchase of 

F- 25 

common stock. The loan is
secured by the membership interests of two limited liability companies owned by
the LP. The limited liability companies each own a parcel of real property in
Oregon and have no liabilities. At the time of the loan, the real property had
an appraised value of 725,000. The loan is also guaranteed by Mr. Wiederhorn.
The common stock purchased with the proceeds of these loans does not serve as
security for the loans. The loans are due on February 21, 2007, and bear
interest at the prime rate, as published in the Wall Street Journal, which
interest is added to the principal annually. 

 In addition to these loans, prior to the passage of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company had also loaned Mr. Wiederhorn
 2.0 million. This loan is fully recourse to Mr. Wiederhorn and is secured
by trust deeds on two residences located in Oregon. The loan is due on August 1,
2007 and bears interest at 8.5 per annum, payable monthly. 

 At December 31, 2004,
the total amount of loans receivable from Mr. Wiederhorn, including
compounded interest, was 3.0 million. 

 Call Option 

 As of December 31, 2004, the Company owned an
option (the Call Option to acquire 423,245 shares of the Company s Common
Stock from Mr. Wiederhorn for an exercise price of 3.99 per share. The
Call Option had been acquired from Mr. Wiederhorn on April 27, 2004.
The original purchase price for the Call Option was 750,000, resulting in an all-in 
cost to the Company upon exercise of approximately 5.76 per share. The
aggregate price to the Company on exercise of 5.76 per share represented a
small premium to the Company s book value per share and market price per share
at the time the option was purchased. The Board of Directors reviewed the
transaction to confirm that the transaction was in the best interest of the
Company and its other stockholders. 

 On March 14, 2005,
the Company exercised the Call Option and placed 423,245 shares of Common Stock
in treasury. The strike price for the shares was less than the Company s book
value per share and approximated the recent trading range of the stock in the
marketplace at the time of the exercise. 

 NOTE 18 STOCK OPTIONS AND RIGHTS 

 The Company adopted a non-qualified stock option plan the Option Plan which provides for options to purchase shares of the
Company s common stock. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may
be issued pursuant to options granted under the Option Plan is 3,500,000
shares. 

 Newly elected directors receive 5,000 vested options
on the day they join the Board at an exercise price equivalent to the closing
price on that day. In addition, each independent director receives, on the last
day of each quarter, an automatic non-statutory option grant to purchase 1,500
shares of common stock at 110 of the fair market value on that day. Automatic
grants will vest one third on each of the first three anniversaries of the
grant date and expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. Resigning
directors have the right to exercise any options which are vested at the date
of resignation for a period of one year.

On October 18, 2002,
the Company declared a distribution of one right (a Right to purchase one
one-tenth of a share of the Company s Common Stock for each outstanding share
of Common Stock, payable to the stockholders of record on October 28,
2002. 

 NOTE
19 ACQUISITION OF TREASURY STOCK 

 On April 28, 2004,
the Company purchased 330,500 shares of its common stock from a shareholder who
at the time owned greater than 10 of the outstanding shares. The purchase
price was 5.40 per share 1.8 million) and the shares were added to treasury
stock. The purchase price represented a
small premium to the Company s book value per share and market price per share
at the time of the transaction. The Company and its directors considered the
following factors: (1) the potentially negative impact on the Company s
share price if the shares were disposed of publicly; (2) the Company s
favorable liquidity position; (3) the potential reduction in the risk that
shares are transferred in a transaction which would have an adverse impact on
its NOL position; and (4) the reduction in the future expenditure of cash
dividends by the Company. The Board of Directors reviewed and approved the
transaction to confirm that the transaction was in the best 

 interest of the Company and its other stockholders. As a
result of this transaction, the Company recorded treasury stock of 1.7 million
and a charge to earnings of 0.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2004. 

 NOTE 20 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 

 During the year ended December 31, 2004, the
Company funded 2.3 million in loans to two related Spanish entities formed to
purchase, reposition and sell two apartment buildings in Barcelona, Spain. Under
the terms of the loans, the Company receives a preferred 30 return on its
investment, and after a similar return is paid to another minority investor,
the Company receives an 80 share in additional profits generated by the
investment. The investment meets the definition of a Variable Interest Entity VIE under FASB Interpretation 46 FIN 46 and the Company is the primary
beneficiary of the VIE. As a result, the assets and liabilities of the VIE have
been consolidated into the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of
December 31, 2004. 

 The VIE purchased the apartment buildings for 4.2
million. The purchase was funded with bank loans totaling 1.4 million, the
Company s 2.3 million investment and a 0.4 million contribution from the
project managers. Neither the creditors nor the other beneficial interest
holders have recourse to the Company with regard to this investment and, as a
result, the maximum limit of the Company s exposure to loss on this investment
is 2.3 million. 

 As of December 31,
2004, the following assets and liabilities of the VIE were included in the
accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition:

The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair
value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to
estimate that value are explained below: 

 Cash and cash equivalents The
carrying amounts approximate fair values due to the short-term nature of these
instruments. 

 Mortgage-backed securities The
fair values of securities are determined either by market quotes, if available,
or by discounting the anticipated cash flows using certain assumptions (e.g.
prepayment speeds, default rates, severity of losses, and discount rate). 

 Loans The fair value of the
Company s major loans are based upon the present value of the expected cash
flows from the loans. 

 Repurchase
agreements, borrowing and notes payable The fair value of repurchase agreements are deemed to be
their face amount since they reprice monthly. The fair value of notes payable
by Fatburger at December 31, 2004 is based on the contractual amounts from
the recent refinancing. The December 31, 2003 fair value was based on a
review of valuations done in connection with the acquisition. 

 Obligations under capital leases The
fair value of obligations under capital leases is estimated based on current
market rates for similar obligations with similar characteristics. 

 The fair value estimates
presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as
of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Although management is not
aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value
amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of
these financial statements since that date, and therefore, current estimates of
fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. 

 NOTE 23 OPERATING SEGMENTS 

 Operating segments consist
of (i) restaurant operations conducted through Fatburger Holdings, Inc. Fatburger ), (ii) commercial real estate mortgage brokerage activities
conducted through George Elkins Mortgage Banking Company George Elkins and (iii) real
estate, merchant banking and financing activities. The following is a summary
of each of the operating segments: 

F- 30 

Restaurant Operations 

 As of December 31,
2004, Fatburger operates or franchises 62 hamburger restaurants located
primarily in California and Nevada. In August 2003, the Company provided
an investment and financing package for Fatburger which involved the
acquisition of the entire class of the Series A-1 Preferred and the Series D
Preferred stock of Fatburger. Currently, the Company owns approximately 71 of
the voting control of Fatburger. Fatburger has plans to open additional
restaurants, primarily through franchise operations, throughout the United
States. Franchisees currently own and operate approximately 36 of the Fatburger
locations. During the year ended December 31, 2004, franchise rights to
open 31 individual Fatburger restaurants were sold. Ten new restaurants were
opened during the year, including 3 company-owned locations. Royalty
revenues were approximately 1.2 million for the year 

 Commercial Real Estate Mortgage Brokerage Operations 

 The Company holds a 51 
ownership interest in George Elkins, a California mortgage banking operation,
which provides brokerage services related to the production of over 700
million per year in commercial real estate mortgages. George Elkins is
headquartered in Los Angeles, with satellite offices located in Las Vegas and
throughout the southern California area. The mortgage brokerage operation also
manages a commercial loan servicing portfolio in excess of 700 million for
various investors. 

 Real Estate, Merchant Banking and Financing Operations 

 The Company invests in or finance real estate,
mortgage-backed securities and other real estate-related or
finance-related assets. The merchant banking and financing operations focus on
the acquisition of controlling interests in businesses in the process of
restructuring. This can take the form of assisting in a management buy-out,
refinancing corporate debt or acquiring the non-core assets of a business. 

 Each of the segments operates with its own management
and personnel. There are no indirect allocations of overhead or other costs. Minority
interests in earnings, which were immaterial for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, are included in other income (loss) in the following
segment financial results.

NOTE 25 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 Dividends 

 On January 26, 2005,
the Company s Board of Directors declared a 0.13 per share dividend for the
first quarter of 2005. The dividend was paid on February 10, 2005 to
shareholders of record on February 4, 2005. 

 Sale of Real Estate 

 Subsequent to December 31,
2004, the Company sold two stand-alone retail locations in separate
transactions for a sales price of 1.2 million in cash. The Company is
currently under contract to sell 3 additional free-standing retail locations
for a combined sales price of 1.3 million. 

F- 33 

Nasdaq Delisting 

 Effective
October 14, 2004, th e Company s Common Stock began trading in the over-the-counter market on the OTC pink
sheets. Prior to that, the Company s Common Stock was quoted on the Nasdaq
National Market. On July 20, 2004, the Company was notified by
Nasdaq of a staff determination to delist the Company s Common Stock effective July 29,
2004. The Company challenged the staff determination and requested an oral
hearing by a Listing Qualifications Panel to review the staff s conclusions. A
hearing was held on September 9, 2004, and, on October 12, 2004, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that the Listing
Qualifications Panel upheld the staff determination and the Company s Common
Stock was delisted from the Nasdaq National Market on October 14, 2004. The
Company requested a review of the Listing Qualifications Panel s decision by
Nasdaq s Listing and Hearing Review Council. On February 16, 2005, the
Company received notice that the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council had
upheld the Panel s decision. The Company is considering whether to continue the
appeal process. There can be no assurance that an appeal will be successful. 

 Investment in
Variable Interest Entity 

 Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the Company
funded 0.9 million and committed to fund an additional 0.4 million to a
Spanish entity formed to purchase, reposition and sell an apartment building in
Barcelona, Spain. Under the terms of the loan, the Company receives a preferred
30 return on its investment, and after a similar return is paid to another
minority investor, the Company receives an 80 share in additional profits
generated by the investment. The investment meets the definition of a Variable
Interest Entity VIE under FASB Interpretation 46 FIN 46 and the Company
is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. 

 The VIE purchased the
apartment building for 1.5 million. The purchase was funded with bank loans
totaling 0.5 million, the Company s 0.9 million investment and a 0.1 million
contribution from the project managers. Neither the creditors nor the other
beneficial interest holders have recourse to the Company with regard to this
investment and, as a result, the maximum limit of the Company s exposure to
loss on this investment is 1.3 million. 

 Call Option 

 On March 14, 2005, the Company exercised an option
(the Call Option to acquire 423,245 shares of the Company s Common Stock
from Mr. Wiederhorn, the Company s former Chief Executive Officer and
current Chief Strategic Officer for an exercise price of 3.99 per share. The
original purchase price for the Call Option was 750,000, resulting in an all-in 
cost to the Company on exercise of approximately 5.76 per share. The aggregate
price to the Company on exercise of 5.76 per share represented a small premium
to the Company s book value per share and market price per share at the time
the option was purchased. The strike price for the shares was less than the
Company s book value per share and approximated the recent trading range of the
stock in the marketplace. At the time the Call Option was purchased, the
Company and its directors also considered the following factors: (1) the
potentially negative impact on the Company s share price if the Option Shares
were disposed of publicly; (2) the Company s favorable liquidity position;
(3) the potential reduction in the risk that shares are transferred in a
transaction which would have an adverse impact on its NOL position; and (4) the
reduction in the future expenditure of cash dividends by the Company once the
Company exercises the Call Option. The Board of Directors reviewed the
transaction to confirm that the transaction was in the best interest of the
Company and its other stockholders.

NOW
THEREFORE , in consideration of the premises and the mutual
agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows: 

SECTION 1. Definitions . All terms used in this Amendment that are
defined in the Rights Agreement, either directly or by reference therein, have
the meanings assigned to them therein, except to the extent such terms are
defined or modified in this Amendment or the context clearly requires
otherwise. In the event that any term or
provision contained herein shall conflict with or be inconsistent with any term
or provision contained in the Rights Agreement, the terms and provisions of
this Amendment shall govern. 

SECTION 2. Amendments . The definition of Acquiring Person is
hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 

(a) Acquiring Person shall mean (i) any
Person who or which, together with all Affiliates of such Person, shall be the
Beneficial Owner of 5 or more of the then outstanding Common Shares (other
than as a result of a Permitted Offer (as hereinafter defined)) or was such a
Beneficial Owner at any time after the date hereof, whether or not such person
continues to be the Beneficial Owner of 5 or more of the then outstanding

such Person, was the Beneficial Owner of 5 or more of the then outstanding

any Person or entity organized, appointed or established by the Corporation for
or pursuant to the terms of any such plan (including the Fog Cutter Long Term
Vesting Trust), and (B) no Person shall become an Acquiring Person :

reducing the number of Common Shares outstanding, increases the proportional
number of shares beneficially owned by such Person together with all Affiliates
of such Person; provided that if (1) a Person would be or become an Acquiring
Person (but for the operation of this subclause (i)) as a result of the
acquisition of Common Shares by the Corporation, and (2) after such share

exercise any
control over the business affairs or management of the Corporation, including
by means of a proxy solicitation, and (B) is able to rescind a sufficient
number of Common Shares so that such Person not be an Acquiring Person , then
such Person shall not be deemed an Acquiring Person for any purposes of this
Agreement; or 

(iii) if
the Board of Directors determines in good faith that a Person who would
otherwise be an Acquiring Person has become such without materially adversely
impacting the Corporation s tax or NOL position or without exceeding the change
