 BUSINESS 

General 

Christopher
 Banks Corporation is a Minneapolis-based retailer of women s specialty
apparel, which operates retail stores through its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Christopher Banks, Inc., Christopher Banks Company and Christopher
 Banks Services Company, collectively referred to as Christopher 
Banks or the Company. As of April 15,
2005, the Company operated 649 stores in 44 states including 472 Christopher
 Banks stores, 157 C.J. Banks stores and 20 Acorn stores. The Company s Christopher Banks stores
offer distinctive fashions featuring exclusively designed, coordinated
assortments of sportswear and sweaters in sizes four to 16. The Company s C.J.
Banks stores offer similar assortments of women s specialty apparel in sizes 14W
and up. Acorn stores offer upscale women s
fashions along with complementary jewelry and accessories under private and
branded labels. 

Fiscal 2005 Events 

During the fiscal year
ended February 26, 2005 fiscal 2005 ), the Company opened 60 new
Christopher Banks stores, 34 new C.J. Banks stores and acquired 21 Acorn
Stores from Gilmore Brothers, Inc. The
Company closed seven stores during fiscal 2005. 
The Company intends to open approximately 75 new stores in fiscal 2006. Of these new stores, approximately 45 will be
Christopher Banks, 25 will be C.J. Banks and five will be Acorn stores. 

On November 1,
2004, the Company acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of
Gilmore Brothers Inc., a privately held women s specialty retailer operating
stores under the name Acorn, for approximately 7.4 million in cash. The Company funded the purchase from current
cash and short-term investments. Of the
 7.4 million purchase price, 2.3 million was placed in escrow to satisfy
certain obligations of Gilmore Brothers, Inc. not assumed by the Company. The Company plans to continue to operate
Acorn as a division of Christopher Banks. 

In February 2004,
the Company s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program enabling
the Company to purchase up to 25 million of its common stock, subject to
market conditions. On June 28,
2004, the Company announced its Board of Directors authorized an increase in
the stock repurchase program to 40 million. 
The Company completed the repurchase program during the third quarter of
fiscal 2005, repurchasing 2,367,400 shares of its common stock for a total
cost, including commissions, of approximately 40 million. 

Business Strategy 

The Company s business
strategy for its Christopher Banks and C.J. Banks stores is to provide
its target customer with high quality, moderately-priced, coordinated ensembles
that are interchangeable between work and leisure activities; to differentiate
itself from its competitors through its focused merchandising approach,
including an emphasis on private brand merchandise designed and manufactured
exclusively for the Company under its proprietary names; to utilize information
systems to effectively manage its merchandise inventories; and to expand its
store base and maintain updated, attractive store locations. 

The key elements of the
Company s strategy are as follows: 

Focus on a target customer and meet her
needs 

 Deliver a well defined merchandise assortment 

 Use information systems to drive decision
making and maintain disciplined inventory management 

 Expand store base in existing and new
markets 

 Grow through development of new concepts 

Focus on a target customer and
meet her needs. The
target customer for Christopher Banks and C.J. Banks is a 40 to 60 year
old working woman with an annual family income of 50,000 and above. Management believes this target customer leads
a busy life, shops in regional malls and purchases fashions which are suitable
for both work and leisure activities. 

1 

The Company utilizes
point-of-sale inventory tracking to analyze the buying patterns of its
customers. Christopher Banks also uses a product testing program to
identify consumer demand for clothing styles, designs and colors. The Company s
objective is to be recognized by its target customer as offering quality
fashions at moderate prices at its Christopher Banks and C.J. Banks
stores. The Company differentiates itself from other women s specialty apparel
retailers through offering a merchandise assortment that is characterized by
novelty designs, with many items featuring seasonal themes. 

Deliver a well defined
merchandising assortment. In fiscal 2005, the Company s lines
of merchandise at its Christopher Banks and C.J. Banks stores included
two principal categories: sportswear and sweaters. In previous years, the Company also sold
casual dresses. The following table sets
forth the approximate percentage of net sales attributable to each merchandise
group for the past three fiscal years.

The Company has developed
a variety of strategies and programs to distinguish itself from its
competitors. Major elements of its merchandising strategy include: 

Strong Visual Merchandise Presentation. The
Company relies heavily on attracting mall traffic through appealing visual
presentation. Front-of-store displays
are carefully designed to draw customers into its stores. The visual program emphasizes attractive
window displays focusing attention on current merchandise styles and a brightly
lit, open store entrance area. To keep
its fashions fresh, the Company introduces six different color stories each
year. Merchandise from each color story
is featured in the Company s stores for approximately 12 to 16 weeks. Each color story has a two to four week build-up
period in the back of the store. The
color story is then featured in the front of the store for approximately eight
weeks. Remaining merchandise from the
color story is then moved to the back of the store for a two to four week
liquidation phase. 

Direct Import Program. During fiscal 2005, the
Company directly imported approximately 95 of its total merchandise purchases.
The Company anticipates that direct imports, as a percent of total purchases,
will be approximately the same in fiscal 2006. Management believes direct
importing allows Christopher Banks to obtain high quality merchandise at
a lower cost. 

Private Brand Clothing Christopher Banks ,
 C.J. Banks . The use of private brand clothing produced
exclusively for the Company creates a unique store identity and establishes a
competitive point of difference. The Company s design staff, guided by its
merchants, continually develops new designs for the Company s private brand
merchandise. The Company uses its
proprietary names for its private brand clothing. Sales of private brand clothing comprised
substantially all of the Company s sales in fiscal 2005 and 2004. The Company anticipates private brand
clothing will account for substantially all of its sales again in fiscal 2006. 

Key Vendor Relationships . The
Company s ongoing relationships with key vendors have enabled it to exclusively
feature its private brand offerings in order to project a merchandising point
of difference. Key vendor relationships
also allow the Company to execute a timely product testing and reorder program. 

Quality Assurance . The Company employs
a variety of quality control measures including color, fabric and construction
analysis and sizing verification, to ensure that all merchandise meets the
Company s quality standards. 

Use information systems to drive
decision making and maintain disciplined inventory management . The Company s merchandise and financial
information systems are updated daily with information from the Company s
point-of-sale registers. Management
believes these systems provide detailed merchandise planning, sales tracking
and analysis capabilities. The Company also believes the merchandise
information systems provide 

2 

distribution
center processing and planning and allocation features which allow the Company
to efficiently manage its merchandise assortment at its stores. 

The Company also utilizes
a cost-effective program to efficiently deliver merchandise on a daily basis
from the Company s distribution center to each of its stores. Through effective use of its systems,
inventories can be maintained at an efficient level throughout the year, which
ensures a consistent flow of fresh merchandise to the stores and enables the
Company to keep the aging of its inventory current. The Company s retail inventory turnover was 3.9,
4.3 and 4.7 times in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In fiscal 2005 and 2004, the Company planned
inventory levels to support a low single digit increase in same-store
sales. As the Company had a 2 decline
in same-store sales in fiscal 2005 and 2004, its retail inventory turnover has
decreased over time. 

Expand store base in existing and new
markets. The Company
plans to expand its store base by approximately 75 new stores in fiscal 2006. Of these new stores, approximately 45 will be
Christopher Banks stores, 25 will be C.J. Banks stores and five will be
Acorn stores. The majority of the new
stores will be located in states where the Company currently operates. 

Expand through development of new
concepts. The Company
intends to continue to evaluate different growth vehicles and new opportunities
as it deems appropriate. Accordingly, in
fiscal 2001 the Company launched a new concept opening stores under the name
C.J. Banks. These stores serve the women s
large size market by offering coordinated assortments of exclusively designed
sportswear and sweaters in sizes 14W and up. 
In connection with this strategy, the Company developed a new C.J. Banks
store prototype which is similar to, but slightly larger than, its Christopher
 Banks store design. The Company
continued to grow the C.J. Banks concept by opening 36 stores in fiscal 2003, 29
stores in fiscal 2004 and 34 stores in fiscal 2005. As of April 15, 2005, the Company
operated 157 C.J. Banks stores. 

On November 1, 2004,
the Company acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Gilmore
Brothers Inc., a privately held women s specialty retailer operating stores
under the name Acorn. Acorn stores
offer upscale women s fashions along with complementary jewelry and accessories
under private and branded labels. The
Company believes the acquisition will provide a differentiated yet
complementary third retail concept to its business, which will enhance its growth
potential. As of April 15, 2005,
the Company operated 20 Acorn stores in nine states. The Company plans to open five Acorn stores
during fiscal 2006. 

Properties 

The Company has developed
an updated store design which is currently used for approximately 95 of its Christopher
 Banks and C.J. Banks store locations. This store design is open and inviting, which
enables the Company to deliver a focused merchandise presentation to its
customers. With attractive decor and
bright lighting, the Company s customers enjoy a fun and exciting shopping
atmosphere. The Company typically completes
a major or minor remodeling of each store following renewal of its lease. However, during the interim, carpet
replacement, painting and other minor improvements are made as needed. The Company completed 19 store remodels in
fiscal 2005 and plans to complete approximately 15 store remodels in fiscal
2006. 

Store Operations 

The Company manages its
stores in a manner that encourages participation by the store manager and
employees in the execution of the Company s business and operational strategies.
 Each store has a manager who is
responsible for the day-to-day operations of the store. Store managers complete a management training
program and are eligible for Company incentive awards based upon exceeding
planned store sales volume. 

Purchasing/Sources of Supply - Christopher 
Banks, C.J. Banks 

Direct imports accounted
for approximately 95 of the Company s total merchandise purchases for its
Christopher Banks and C.J. Banks stores in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2005, the Company purchased
substantially all of its merchandise from 100 vendors and the Company s ten
largest vendors provided approximately 68 of the Company s purchases. In addition, purchases from the Company s
largest overseas supplier accounted for approximately 36 of total purchases, compared
to 41 in fiscal 2004. Although the
Company believes that its relationship with its largest vendor is good, there
can be no assurance that this relationship can be maintained in the future or
that the vendor will continue to supply merchandise to the Company. If there should be any significant disruption
in the supply of merchandise from this vendor, management believes that it can
shift production to other suppliers so as to continue to secure the required
volume of product. Nevertheless, there
is some potential that any such disruption in supply could have a material
adverse impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations. The Company intends to directly import
approximately 95 of its purchases in fiscal 2006. 

3 

Advertising and Promotion 

Historically,
the Company has not engaged in significant television, radio or print advertising. Instead, the Company capitalizes on mall
traffic at most of its locations. To draw
customers into its stores, the Company emphasizes attractive front-of-store
displays and an open, clean, in-store visual presentation which focus attention
on the Company s merchandise. The Acorn
stores acquired from Gilmore Brothers, Inc. use direct mail and print
advertising, as well as a preferred customer program, to maintain a dialogue
with its customers. The Company intends
to continue these programs. 

The Company maintains websites
at www.christopherandbanks.com, www.cjbanks.com and www.acornstores.com. The websites contain information about the
Company s business and history, investor relations, employment opportunities
and store locations. At this time, the
Company does not offer on-line purchasing of merchandise or gift certificates
through its websites. 

The Company s web site
references above are for textual reference only and are not intended to
incorporate the Company s web sites into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company makes available free of charge,
on or through its web site, its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed
or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically
files such material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 

Seasonality 

The Company s sales show
seasonal variation as sales in the third and fourth quarters, which include the
fall and holiday seasons, have generally been higher than sales in the first
and second quarters. Sales and gross
profit generated during the fall and holiday seasons have a significant impact
on the Company s annual results of operations. 

Competition 

The women s retail
apparel business is highly competitive. The
Company believes that the principal bases upon which it competes are unique
merchandise selection, quality garment construction, store location, visual
merchandise presentation and customer service. The Company competes with a broad range of
national and regional retail chains that sell similar merchandise, including
department stores and specialty stores. Many
of these competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the
Company. The Company believes that its unique
merchandise assortments, strong visual presentation, product quality, and
customer service enable the Company to compete effectively. 

Employees 

As of April 15, 2005,
the Company had approximately 1,900 full-time and 4,100 part-time employees.
The number of part-time employees increases during peak selling periods. None
of the Company s employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a
collective bargaining agreement. The Company has never experienced a work
stoppage and considers its relationship with its employees to be good. 

Trademarks and Service Marks 

The Company, through its
wholly owned subsidiary, Christopher Banks Company, is the owner of the
federally registered trademark and service mark Christopher Banks, 
which is its predominant private brand, and C.J. Banks, its large size
private brand. The Company uses the name
 Acorn for the stores it acquired from Gilmore Brothers, Inc., though it does
not hold the federally registered trademark or service mark for that name.
Common law rights have been established by the Company in other trademarks and
service marks which it considers to be of lesser importance. Christopher 
Banks believes its primary marks are important to its business and are
recognized in the women s retail apparel industry. Accordingly, the Company
intends to maintain its marks and the related registrations. Management is not aware of any challenges to
the Company s right to use its marks in the United States. 

ITEM 2. 

 PROPERTIES 

Store Locations 

The Company s Christopher
 Banks and C.J. Banks stores are located primarily in regional shopping
malls in mid-sized cities and suburban areas, which offer high-traffic by
potential walk-in customers. All of the
Company s stores are company-owned. Approximately 90 of the Company s stores
are located in enclosed 

4 

regional malls
that typically have numerous specialty stores and two or more general
merchandise chains or department stores as anchor tenants. The rest of the Company s Christopher 
Banks and C.J. Banks stores are located in lifestyle, community and strip
shopping centers. The Company attempts
to locate its stores strategically within the mall or shopping center to
attract walk-in customers through attractive visual displays. The Company s 20 Acorn stores are located in
upscale lifestyle centers and other distinctive shopping areas. At April 15, 2005, Christopher 
Banks stores averaged 3,325 square feet, C. J. Banks stores averaged 3,735
square feet and Acorn stores averaged 2,400 square feet. The Company estimates approximately 85 of

Store Leases 

All of the Company s
store locations are leased. Management believes that the current commercial
real estate market, combined with the Company s relationship with
nationally-recognized developers and established operating history, makes the Company
an attractive tenant when negotiating terms with shopping center developers,
owners or management companies. 

Lease terms typically include
a rental period of ten years and may contain a renewal option. Leases generally require payments of fixed minimum
rent and contingent percentage rent, typically calculated at five percent of
sales in excess of a specified level. 
The following table, which covers all of the stores operated by the
Company at April 15, 2005, indicates the number of leases expiring during
the fiscal year indicated and the number of such leases with renewal
options. The number of stores with
leases expiring in fiscal 2006 includes those stores which currently are
operating on month-to-month terms.

Corporate Office and Distribution Center Facility 

In
fiscal 2002, the Company purchased its 210,000 square foot corporate office and
distribution center facility, located in Plymouth, Minnesota. Prior to fiscal 2002, the Company leased this
facility. The Company utilizes
approximately 130,000 square feet of the building for its own corporate offices
and distribution center facility. The
remaining 80,000 square feet of the building are subleased to a third
party. Under the sublease, the Company received
 26,667 per month through August 31, 2003 and will receive 30,000 per
month from September 1, 2003 through May 31, 2005. The subtenant is also required to reimburse
the Company for property taxes, utilities and other operating costs of the
subleased portion of the facility. Upon
expiration of the sublease, the Company plans to utilize the 80,000 square feet
for its own distribution center requirements. 

The Company believes its
headquarters and merchandise distribution center facility are adequate to
accommodate the expansion plans of the Company for the foreseeable future.

 MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
Statements and related Notes of the Company included in Item 8 of this Form
10-K. Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains certain forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company s actual results could materially
differ from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result
of certain factors, including those set forth later in Item 7 under the heading
 Forward Looking Information and Risk. 

Restatement of Financial Statements 

In January 2005,
the Company began a review of its lease accounting practices. As a result of the Company s investigation,
management and the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors
determined that the Company s accounting practices for rent holiday periods and
classification of landlord incentives and the related amortization were
incorrect. The Company has made all
necessary adjustments to correct these errors for all periods presented in this
Form 10-K. 

10 

Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Technical Bulletin No. 88-1, Issues
Related to Accounting for Leases, FTB No. 88-1 requires construction
allowances to be recorded as deferred lease incentives in the liability section of
the balance sheet and allowances received to be recorded as a component of
operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Previously, construction allowances were
treated as reductions of property, equipment, and improvements on the Company s
Consolidated Balance Sheet and as a reduction of capital expenditures within
the investing activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Accordingly, the Company has established the
appropriate deferred lease incentive liability and recorded a corresponding
increase in property, equipment and improvements. Additionally, the amortization of
construction allowances has been classified as a reduction of rent expense as
part of cost of sales, rather then a reduction of depreciation expense in the
Company s Consolidated Income Statement. 

In
determining the proper period over which to recognize rent expense with free
rent periods and/or rent escalation, FTB No. 88-1 considers the lessee s
possession or right to physically control the property, and requires that
straight-line rent expense begin when the lessee takes possession of or
controls the use of the space. The
Company had previously recorded straight-line rent expense beginning on the
earlier of the store opening date or lease commencement date, which had the
effect of excluding the build-out period of its stores from the calculation of
the period over which rent was expensed. 
The Company now considers possession to occur on the date it enters the
space and begins the construction build-out. 
The correcting adjustments are recorded as additional rent expense as
part of cost of sales in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income and
deferred rent obligations in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

See Note 2 in the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for a summary of the
effects of the restatement on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet for the
fiscal year ended February 28, 2004, as well as the Company s Consolidated
Statements of Income, Consolidated Statement of Stockholders Equity and
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended February 28,
2004 and March 1, 2003. See Note 18
for the effects of these corrections and changes on the Company s quarterly
periods for fiscal 2005 and 2004. The
accompanying Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and
Results of Operations gives effect to these corrections. 

Executive Summary - Key Performance Indicators 

The Company s management
evaluates the following items, which are considered key performance indicators,
in assessing the Company s performance: 

Same-store
sales 

The Company s same-store
sales data is calculated based on the change in net sales for stores that have
been open for more than 13 full months and includes stores, if any, that have
been relocated within the same mall. The
Company typically does not expand or relocate stores within a mall. Stores where square footage has been changed
by more than 25 percent are excluded from the same-store sales
calculation. Stores closed during the
year are included in the same-store sales calculation only for the full months
of the year the stores were open. 

Management considers
same-store sales to be an important indicator of the Company s
performance. Same-store sales results
are important in achieving leveraging of costs, including store payroll, store
occupancy, depreciation and other general and administrative expenses. Positive same-store sales contribute to
greater leveraging of costs while negative same-store sales contribute to
deleveraging of costs. Same-store sales
also have a direct impact on the Company s total net sales, cash and cash equivalents
and working capital. 

11 

Gross
profit 

Gross profit measures
whether the Company is appropriately optimizing the price of its
merchandise. Gross profit is the
difference between net sales and costs of sales. Cost of sales include the cost of merchandise,
markdowns, shrink, freight into and out from the Company s distribution center,
buyer and distribution center salaries, buyer travel, rent and other occupancy
related costs, miscellaneous merchandise expenses and other costs related to
the Company s distribution network. Any
inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups or any significant
increase in the Company s markdowns could have an adverse effect on the Company s
gross profit and results of operations. 

Operating
income 

The Company s management
views operating income as a key indicator of the Company s success. The key drivers of operating income are
same-store sales, gross profit and the Company s ability to control operating costs. 

Store
productivity 

Store productivity,
including sales per square foot, average unit retail price, number of
transactions per store and number of units per transaction, is evaluated by
management in assessing the operational performance of the Company. 

Inventory
turnover 

The Company s management
evaluates inventory turnover as a measure of how productively inventory is
bought and sold. Inventory turnover is
important as it can signal slow moving inventory, which can be critical in
determining the need to take markdowns on merchandise. 

Cash flow
and liquidity 

Management evaluates cash
flow from operations, investing activities and financing activities in
determining the sufficiency of the Company s cash position. Cash flow from operations has historically
been sufficient to cover the Company s uses of cash. Management believes that cash flow from
operations will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and
working capital requirements in fiscal 2006.

was incorporated in 1986 to acquire Braun s Fashions, Inc., which had operated
as a family-owned business since 1956. 
On July 26, 2000, the Company s shareholders approved a change in the
Company s name from Braun s Fashions Corporation to Christopher Banks
Corporation. 

The
Company s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest February 28. The fiscal years ended February 26,
2005, February 28, 2004 and March 1, 2003 each consisted of 52 weeks. 

As of April 15,
2005, the Company operated 649 stores in 44 states including 472 Christopher
 Banks stores, 157 C.J. Banks and 20 Acorn stores. The Company s Christopher Banks stores
offer distinctive fashions featuring exclusively designed, coordinated
assortments of sportswear and sweaters in sizes four to 16. The Company s C.J.
Banks stores offer similar assortments of women s specialty apparel in sizes
14W and up. Acorn stores offer upscale
women s fashions along with complementary jewelry and accessories under private
and branded labels. 

On November 1,
2004, the Company acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of
Gilmore Brothers Inc., a privately held women s specialty retailer operating
stores under the name Acorn, for approximately 7.4 million in cash. The Company plans to continue to operate
Acorn as a division of Christopher Banks. 
The Company acquired 21 Acorn stores on November 1, 2004 and
subsequently closed one Acorn store. 
As of April 15, 2005, Acorn operated 20 stores in nine states that
offer upscale women s fashions along with complementary jewelry and accessories
under private and branded labels. The
Company believes the acquisition will provide a differentiated yet
complementary third retail concept to its business, which will enhance its
strategic growth plans by allowing the Company to reach a more upscale
customer. The transaction was accounted
for under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the results of
operations of Acorn have been consolidated in the Company s financial
statements from the date of acquisition. 

12 

During the fiscal year
ended February 26, 2005, the Company opened 60 Christopher Banks
stores, 34 C.J. Banks stores and acquired 21 Acorn stores from Gilmore
Brothers, Inc. The Company closed seven
stores during fiscal 2005. The Company
intends to open approximately 75 new stores in fiscal 2006. 

In February 2004,
the Company s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program enabling
the Company to purchase up to 25 million of its common stock, subject to
market conditions. On June 28,
2004, the Company announced its Board of Directors authorized an increase in
the stock repurchase program to 40 million. 
The Company completed the repurchase program during the third quarter of
fiscal 2005, repurchasing 2,367,400 shares of its common stock for a total
cost, including commissions, of approximately 40 million. 

The common stock
repurchased under the Company s most recent authorization is being held in
treasury and reduced the number of shares of the Company s common stock
outstanding by approximately 6 . All of
the Company s repurchases were executed in the open market and no shares were
repurchased from related parties. In
addition, all of the Company s share repurchases were executed in accordance
with the safe harbor provisions of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. Depending on market
conditions and the Company s cash position, the Company may participate in
additional stock repurchase programs in the future. 

Although the Company did
not meet revenue, gross margin, or same-store sales growth targets in fiscal
2005, overall cash flows remained very strong. 
This has provided the Company the ability to continue to fund growth,
including the Acorn acquisition, and to complete its stock repurchase program
from cash flow from operations and current cash and short-term investment
balances. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon
the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes, which have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used
in the United States of America. The
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during a reporting period. 
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. As a result, actual results could differ
because of the use of these estimates and assumptions. 

The Company s significant
accounting policies can be found in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company believes the following accounting
policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the
Company s reported financial condition and results of operations. 

Revenue
recognition 

Sales are
recognized by the Company at the point of purchase when the customer takes
possession of the merchandise and pays for the purchase, generally with cash or
credit card. Sales from purchases made
with gift certificates or gift cards are also recorded when the customer takes
possession of the merchandise. Gift
certificates and gift cards issued by the Company are recorded as a liability
until they are redeemed. The Company has
established an allowance for sales returns by customers. This allowance has been calculated using
estimates based on historical experience that management believes to be
reasonable. 

Inventory
valuation 

Merchandise
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in,
first-out retail inventory method. Permanent
markdowns of inventory are recorded monthly based on an evaluation by
merchandising management, which includes analyzing inventory levels and aging,
as well as rate of sale. The Company
further reduces the value of inventory by recording an allowance for permanent markdowns
based on inventory levels from the season which immediately precedes the
current season as of the reporting date. 
Permanent markdowns on this merchandise take into account the future
anticipated selling price of the inventory. 
To the extent that management s estimates differ from actual results,
additional markdowns may have to be recorded, which could reduce the Company s
gross margins and adversely affect its financial position and results of
operations. For the fiscal years ended February 26,
2005, February 28, 2004 and March 1, 2003, permanent inventory markdowns
totaled 2,702,444, 1,555,865 and 689,779, respectively. 

13 

Property,
equipment and improvements 

Property,
equipment and improvements are stated at cost. Property and equipment is
depreciated over its estimated useful life; three to five years for computer
hardware and software, seven years for furniture, fixtures and other equipment,
and 25 years for the Company s corporate office and distribution center and
related building improvements. Store
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life or the
term of the related leases, which is typically ten years. Repairs and maintenance which do not extend
an asset s useful life are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or
otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or
amortization are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is
reflected in income or expense for that period. 

The Company
reviews property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate the net book value of an asset may not be recoverable,
but at least annually. An impairment
loss is recognized when the net book value of an asset exceeds the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and
its eventual disposition. The impairment
loss recorded is the excess of the asset s net book value over its fair
value. Fair value is determined based
upon the best information available under the circumstances including quoted
prices or other valuation techniques. 

Cost
of sales 

Cost of
sales include the cost of merchandise, markdowns, shrink, freight in to and out
of the Company s distribution center, buyer and distribution center salaries,
buyer travel, rent and other occupancy related costs, miscellaneous merchandise
expenses and other costs related to the Company s distribution network. Cost of sales excludes all depreciation and
amortization expense. The Company s
gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities. The Company includes all costs related to its distribution
network in cost of sales, while other entities exclude a portion of these
expenses from cost of sales and include them in selling, general and
administrative expenses. 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses include all salaries with the exception of
buyer and distribution center salaries, employee benefits, advertising, store
supplies, credit card processing fees, information technology related costs,
insurance, professional services, non-buyer travel and miscellaneous other
selling and administrative related expenses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses exclude all depreciation
and amortization expense. 

Rent
expense and deferred rent obligations 

Rent expense under
non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or free rent
periods is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term,
beginning on the date of initial possession, which is generally when the
Company enters the space and begins the construction build-out. Most of the Company s lease agreements for
retail space include escalation clauses in minimum base rent. For leases that contain predetermined fixed
escalations of minimum rent, the Company recognizes the related rent expense on
a straight-line basis and records the difference between the recognized rent
expense and amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent obligations. 

In addition, the
Company has a limited number of other lease agreements for retail space which
include escalation in minimum rent based on increases in the Consumer Price
Index, not to exceed 2.0 . For purposes
of calculating rent expense and future minimum lease payments, the Company
utilizes the maximum annual increase of 2.0 . 
The Company also recognizes the related rent expense for these leases on
a straight-line basis and records the difference between the recognized rent
expense and amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent obligations. 

Deferred
lease incentives 

The Company
accounts for construction allowances received from landlords in accordance with
SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, and Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Technical Bulletin 88-1, Issues Relating to Accounting for Leases. Accordingly, all amounts received from
landlords to fund leasehold improvements are recorded as a deferred liability,
which is amortized over the related store s lease term. See Note 2 for additional information
regarding deferred lease incentives. 

14 

Income
Taxes 

Income taxes are recorded
following the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the
difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax basis. 
Realization of deferred tax assets is ultimately dependent upon future
taxable income. Inherent in the measurement
of deferred balances are certain judgements and interpretations of tax laws and
published guidance with respect to the Company s operations. No valuation allowance has been provided for
deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of net deferred
tax assets will be realized. The
effective tax rate utilized by the Company reflects management s estimation of
the expected tax liabilities within various taxing jurisdictions. 

Stock-based
employee compensation 

The Company discloses stock-based
compensation information in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 SFAS No. 123 ), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation 
and No. 148 SFAS No. 148 ), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure . SFAS No.
148, an amendment of SFAS No. 123, does not amend the provisions of SFAS No.
123 that permit entities to account for stock-based compensation under the
intrinsic value method set forth by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB No. 25 ), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company has elected to continue to
recognize compensation cost for its stock-based compensation plans in
accordance with APB No. 25. Generally,
no compensation expense is recognized for stock options with exercise prices
equal to the market value of the underlying shares of stock at the date of
grant. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based
Payments, and plans to adopt it in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.

Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 

Net
Sales. Net sales
for the year ended February 26, 2005 were 438.9 million, an increase of
 48.2 million or 12.3 , from net sales of 390.7 million for the year ended February 28,
2004. The increase in net sales was attributable
to an increase in the number of stores operated by the Company during the year,
partially offset by a 2 decline in same-store sales. The Company operated 642 stores at February 26,
2005 compared to 534 stores at February 28, 2004. Management believes the 2 decline in
same-store sales was attributable to a softer than expected customer response
to the Company s merchandise assortment, continued economic weakness affecting
the spending patterns of the moderate income consumer and a very competitive
apparel retail environment. 

15 

The Company s same-store
sales data is calculated based on the change in net sales for stores that have
been open for more than 13 full months and includes stores, if any, that have
been relocated within the same mall. The
Company typically does not expand or relocate stores within a mall. Stores where square footage has been changed
by more than 25 percent are excluded from the same-store sales calculation. Stores closed during the year are included in
the same-store sales calculation only for the full months of the year the
stores were open. 

Sales from the Acorn
stores acquired by the Company on November 1, 2004 will be excluded from
the calculation of same-stores sales until the Company has operated these
stores for 13 full months. 

Gross
Profit, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. Gross profit, which is net sales less the
cost of merchandise, buying expenses and occupancy costs, exclusive of
depreciation and amortization, was 167.9 million, or 38.3 of net sales, in
fiscal 2005, compared to 165.2 million, or 42.3 of net sales, in fiscal 2004. The decline in gross profit as a percent of
net sales was mainly attributable to lower merchandise margins, primarily due
to higher markdowns, as well as approximately 100 basis points of negative
leveraging of store rent expense. The
negative leveraging of store rent expense resulted from a 2 decline in same-store
sales combined with operating more stores in fiscal 2005 which were still in
the buildup phase of their sales curve. 

The Company s gross
profit may not be comparable to that of other entities. The Company includes all costs related to its
distribution network in cost of sales, while other entities exclude a portion
of these expenses from cost of sales and include them in selling, general and
administrative expenses. Please see Note
1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K for
further detail regarding which expenses the Company includes in cost of sales
and selling, general and administrative expenses. 

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses. Selling,
general and administrative expenses were 108.9 million, or 24.8 of net sales,
in fiscal 2005 compared to 89.3 million, or 22.9 of net sales, in fiscal 2004. The approximate 200 basis point increase in
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily
the result of increased store salaries expense, self insured medical costs,
asset impairment charges and other administrative costs that could not be
leveraged with a 2 decline in same-store sales, partially offset by a decrease
in store supplies expense. 

Depreciation
and Amortization. Depreciation
and amortization was 16.2 million, or 3.7 of net sales, in fiscal 2005
compared to 13.6 million, or 3.5 of net sales, in fiscal 2004. The increase in the amount of depreciation
and amortization expense was a result of capital expenditures made during the
past year. The Company opened 94 new
stores, acquired 21 Acorn stores and remodeled 19 stores during the year ended February 26,
2005. 

Operating
Income. As a
result of the foregoing factors, operating income for the year ended February 26,
2005 was 42.9 million, or 9.8 of net sales, compared to operating income of 62.3
million, or 15.9 of net sales, for the year ended February 28, 2004. 

Interest Income. For the year ended February 26,
2005, net interest income increased to 1,038,408 from 873,574 for the year
ended February 28, 2004. The
increase was a result of higher interest rates on short-term investments in
fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. 

Income
Taxes. The
provision for income taxes was 16.9 million in fiscal 2005, with an effective
tax rate of 38.5 , compared to 24.4 million, with an effective tax rate of
38.6 , in fiscal 2004. 

Net
Income. As a
result of the foregoing factors, net income for the year ended February 26,
2005 was 27.0 million, or 6.2 of net sales and 0.73 per diluted share,
compared to net income of 38.8 million, or 9.9 of net sales and 1.01 per
diluted share for the year ended February 28, 2004. In fiscal 2005, earnings of approximately 0.03
per diluted share can be attributed to the Company s repurchase of 2,367,400
shares of its common stock in February 2004 and the first nine months of
fiscal 2005. 

Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 

Net
Sales. Net sales for the year ended February 28,
2004 were 390.7 million, an increase of 51.9 million or 15.3 , from net sales
of 338.8 million for the year ended March 1, 2003. The increase in net sales was attributable to
an increase in the number of stores operated by the Company during the year,
partially offset by a 2 decline in same-store sales. The Company operated 534 stores at February 28,
2004 compared to 438 stores at March 1, 2003. The 2 decline in same-store sales was
primarily due to a challenging retail environment, as well as weakness in the
Company s sweater business, particularly in the fourth quarter. For the year, the Company s stores opened in
fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003 generated flat same-store sales, while the Company s
mature base of stores, opened in fiscal 2000 and earlier, recorded a 4 decline
in same-store sales. 

16 

The Company s same-store
sales data is calculated based on the change in net sales for stores that have
been open for more than 13 full months and includes stores, if any, that have
been relocated within the same mall. The
Company typically does not expand or relocate stores within a mall. Stores where square footage has been changed
by more than 25 percent are excluded from the same-store sales
calculation. Stores closed during the
year are included in the same-store sales calculation only for the full months
of the year the stores were open. 

Gross
Profit, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. Gross profit, which is net sales less the
cost of merchandise, buying expenses and occupancy costs, exclusive of
depreciation and amortization, was 165.2 million, or 42.3 of net sales, in
fiscal 2004, compared to 148.3 million, or 43.8 of net sales, in fiscal
2003. The decline in gross profit as a
percent of net sales was mainly the result of approximately 140 basis points of
negative leveraging of store rent expense. 
The negative leveraging of store rent expense resulted from a 2 decline
in same-store sales combined with operating more stores in fiscal 2004 which
were still in the buildup phase of their sales curve. In addition, improved pricing obtained from
suppliers was substantially offset by increased markdowns expense resulting
from the heavily promotional retail environment. 

The Company s gross
profit may not be comparable to that of other entities. The Company includes all costs related to its
distribution network in cost of sales, while other entities exclude a portion
of these expenses from cost of sales and include them in selling, general and
administrative expenses. Please see Note
1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K for
further detail regarding which expenses the Company includes in cost of sales
and selling, general and administrative expenses. 

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses. Selling,
general and administrative expenses were 89.3 million, or 22.9 of net sales,
in fiscal 2004 compared to 76.7 million, or 22.6 of net sales, in fiscal
2003. The increase in selling, general
and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily the result
of increased store salaries expense that could not be leveraged with a 2 
decline in same-store sales, partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense
and store supplies expense. 

Depreciation
and Amortization. Depreciation
and amortization was 13.6 million, or 3.5 of net sales, in fiscal 2004
compared to 10.9 million, or 3.2 of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The increase in the amount of depreciation
and amortization expense was a result of capital expenditures made during the
past year. The Company opened 97 new stores
and remodeled 18 stores during the year ended February 28, 2004. 

Operating
Income. As a
result of the foregoing factors, operating income for the year ended February 28,
2004 was 62.3 million, or 15.9 of net sales, compared to operating income of
 60.7 million, or 18.0 of net sales, for the year ended March 1, 2003. 

Interest
Income. For the
year ended February 28, 2004, net interest income decreased to 873,574
from 894,955 for the year ended March 1, 2003. The decrease was a result of lower interest
rates on short-term investments in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003,
partially offset by a higher average cash and short-term investment balance in
fiscal 2004 than in fiscal 2003. 

Income
Taxes. The
provision for income taxes was 24.4 million in fiscal 2004, with an effective
tax rate of 38.6 , compared to 23.7 million, with an effective tax rate of
38.4 , in fiscal 2003. The slight
increase in the effective tax rate was due to increased state income taxes. 

Net
Income. As a
result of the foregoing factors, net income for the year ended February 28,
2004 was 38.8 million, or 9.9 of net sales and 1.01 per diluted share,
compared to net income of 37.9 million, or 11.2 of net sales and 0.95 per
diluted share for the year ended March 1, 2003. In fiscal 2004, earnings of approximately
 0.04 per diluted share can be attributed to the Company s repurchase of
1,608,000 shares of its common stock in February and March 2003 and
294,000 shares of its common stock in February 2004. 

The Company imports substantially all of its
merchandise through ports on the West Coast of the United States. Company management estimates that missed
sales, increased markdown pressure from late deliveries of merchandise and
increased freight costs, due to the port closure from September 28, 2002
through October 8, 2002, negatively impacted the results of operations for
the year ended March 1, 2003 by approximately 0.02 per share in the third
quarter and 0.01 per share in the fourth quarter. 

17 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company s principal
on-going cash requirements are to finance the construction of new stores and
the remodeling of certain existing stores, to purchase merchandise inventory
and to fund other working capital requirements. Merchandise purchases vary on a
seasonal basis, peaking in the fall. As
a result, the Company s cash requirements historically reach their peak in October and
November. Conversely, cash balances peak in January, after the holiday season
is completed. 

Net cash provided by
operating activities totaled 49.7 million in fiscal 2005, down from prior
years due primarily to the Company s decline in earnings. Net cash used in investing activities
included 30.5 million of capital expenditures and 7.4 million of cash paid
for the acquisition of Acorn, partially offset by approximately 26.1 million
of net redemptions of short-term investments. 
The Company opened 94 new stores and completed 19 store remodels during
fiscal 2005. 

Net cash of 39.8 million
was used by the Company for financing activities in fiscal 2005. The Company repurchased 2,088,236 shares of
the Company s common stock at a total cost, including commissions, of
approximately 35.4 million. The common
stock purchased is being held in treasury. 
Quarterly cash dividends, which together totaled approximately 5.8
million, were paid by the Company in fiscal 2005. The Company received 1.4 million of cash in
fiscal 2005 when the Company s officers, directors and key employees exercised
stock options. 

The Company plans to spend
approximately 22 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 to open
approximately 45 new Christopher Banks stores, 25 new C.J. Banks stores
and five new Acorn stores and to complete approximately 15 store remodels and
to make various capital improvements at its headquarters and distribution
center facility. The Company expects its
cash and short-term investments, combined with cash flows from operations, to
be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure, working capital and other
requirements for liquidity during fiscal 2006. 

The Company maintains an
Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement with Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association (the Wells Fargo Revolver which expires June 30,
2006. The Wells Fargo Revolver provides
the Company with revolving credit loans and letters of credit of up to 40
million, subject to a borrowing base formula based on inventory levels. In October 2004, the Wells Fargo
Revolver was amended to allow, among other things, the formation of a new
subsidiary, Christopher Banks Services Company, in conjunction with the
acquisition of Acorn. 

Loans under the Wells
Fargo Revolver bear interest at Wells Fargo s base rate, 5.5 as of February 26,
2005, plus 0.25 . Interest is payable
monthly in arrears. The Wells Fargo Revolver carries a facility fee of 0.25 
based on the unused portion as defined in the agreement. Facility fees totaled 5,128 in fiscal 2005. The credit facility is collateralized by the
Company s equipment, general intangibles, inventory, inventory letters of
credit and letter of credit rights. The
Company had no revolving credit loan borrowings under the Wells Fargo Revolver during
fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2004. 
Historically, the Wells Fargo Revolver has been utilized by the Company
only to open letters of credit to facilitate the import of merchandise. The borrowing base at February 26, 2005
was 32.3 million. As of February 26,
2005, the Company had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of 21.7
million. Accordingly, the availability
of revolving credit loans under the Wells Fargo Revolver was 10.6 million at
that date. 

The Wells Fargo Revolver
contains certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring
additional indebtedness and limitations on certain types of investments, as well
as requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios. As of February 26, 2005, the most recent
measurement date, the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Wells
Fargo Revolver.

The Company s contractual
obligations include operating leases for each of its retail store locations and
vehicles and purchase obligations consisting of 21.7 million of open purchase
orders for goods currently in production with foreign suppliers. These open purchase orders are secured by
letters of credit for which the Company is contingently liable. As of February 26, 2005, the Company had
no other contractual obligations relating to short or long-term debt, capital
leases or non-cancelable purchase obligations. 
In addition, the Company had no contractual obligations relating to the
other liabilities recorded in the Company s balance sheet under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As of February 26, 2005, the Company s
other liabilities consisted of deferred rent, deferred lease incentives, deferred
revenue and deferred income taxes. 

The Company does not have
relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as
entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities,
which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance
sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited
purposes. As such, the Company is not
materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that
could arise if the Company had engaged in such relationships. 

The Company s related
party transactions are limited to employment agreements with certain
officers. In addition, the Company does
not maintain any long-term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase
merchandise from any of its suppliers. 

Merchandise Sourcing 

The Company directly
imported approximately 95 of its total merchandise purchases in fiscal 2005. This reliance on sourcing from foreign
countries may cause the Company to be exposed to certain risks. Import restrictions, including tariffs and
quotas, and changes in such restrictions, could affect the import of apparel
and might result in increased costs, delays in merchandise receipts or reduced
supplies of apparel available to the Company and could possibly have an adverse
effect on the Company s business, financial condition and/or results of
operations. The Company s merchandise
flow could also be adversely affected by political or financial instability in
any of the countries where its merchandise is manufactured or by changes in the
United States governmental policies toward such foreign countries. In addition, merchandise receipts could be
delayed due to interruptions in air, ocean and ground shipments. 

Substantially all of the Company s
directly imported merchandise is manufactured in Southeast Asia. The majority of these goods are produced in
China, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Singapore. 
The Company is not currently importing merchandise produced in the
Middle East. 

19 

The Company did not
experience any significant disruption or delays in the production or shipment of
merchandise resulting from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami which struck
parts of Indonesia and other countries surrounding the Indian Ocean on December 26,
2004. 

During fiscal 2005, the
Company purchased substantially all of its merchandise for its Christopher
 Banks and C.J. Banks stores from approximately 100 vendors and the Company s
ten largest vendors represented approximately 68 of the Company s
purchases. Further, purchases from the
Company s largest overseas supplier accounted for 36 of total purchases in
fiscal 2005, compared to 41 in fiscal 2004. 
Although the Company believes that its relationship with this particular
vendor is good, there can be no assurance that this relationship can be
maintained in the future or that the vendor will continue to supply merchandise
to the Company. If there should be any significant
disruption in the supply of merchandise from this vendor, management believes
that it can shift production to other suppliers so as to continue to secure the
required volume of product. 
Nevertheless, there is some potential that any such disruption in supply
could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial position and
results of operations. The Company
intends to directly import approximately 95 of its purchases in fiscal 2006. 

Quota Restrictions 

On December 31,
2004, quota restrictions expired on the importing of apparel in the United
States from foreign countries which are members of the World Trade
Organization. The effect this quota
expiration will have on global sourcing patterns is uncertain, but is likely to
cause further retail price deflation. 
Management believes it can adjust to potential shifts in the
availability of apparel following the expiration of these quotas. However, the Company s sourcing operations
may be adversely effected by trade limits or political and financial
instability resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries. 

Quarterly Results and Seasonality 

The Company s sales reflect
seasonal variation as sales in the third and fourth quarters, which include the
fall and holiday seasons, generally have been higher than sales in the first
and second quarters. Sales and gross profit generated during the fall and
holiday seasons have a significant impact on the Company s annual results of
operations. Quarterly results may fluctuate significantly depending on a number
of factors including timing of new store openings, adverse weather conditions,
shifts in the timing of certain holidays and customer response to the Company s
seasonal merchandise mix. 

The Company s restated unaudited
quarterly operating results for each quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2004 are
presented in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Inflation 

Although the operations
of the Company are influenced by general economic conditions, the Company does
not believe that inflation had a material effect on the results of operations
during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

On October 22,
2004, the President signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act ). The Act provides a deduction for income from
qualified domestic production activities, which will be phased in from 2005
through 2010. In return, the Act also
provides for a two-year phase out of the existing extraterritorial income
exclusion ETI for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with
international trade protocols by the European Union. Under the guidance in the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Staff Position No. 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, 
to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the deduction will be treated as
a special deduction as described in the FASB Statement No. 109. As such, the special deduction has no effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date. Rather, the impact of this deduction will be
reported in the period which the deduction is claimed on the Company s tax
return. 

20 

In December 2004,
the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based
Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees. SFAS No. 123R requires
all share-based payment transactions, including stock options, restricted stock
plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee stock
purchase plans, to be recognized as compensation expense in the financial
statements. The cost will be measured
based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments on the date
issued. On April 14, 2005, the
Securities Exchange Commission announced it would provide for a phased-in
implementation process for SFAS No. 123R. 
The SEC will require that registrants that are not small business
issuers adopt SFAS No. 123R for the first annual period beginning after June 15,
2005. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact this statement will have on its financial statements and will
adopt SFAS No. 123R effective the first quarter of fiscal 2007. 

In November 2004,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs. This Statement amends the guidance in
Accounting Research Bulletin ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to
clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs, and wasted material. 
SFAS No. 151 requires that those items be recognized as current-period
charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that
allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on
the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are effective
for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is expected to
have no impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 

In December 2004,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 152, Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing
Transactions. SFAS No. 152 amends SFAS
No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, and No. 67, Accounting for
Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, to state that the
guidance for (a) incidental operations and (b) costs incurred to sell real
estate projects does not apply to real estate time-sharing transactions. Statement No. 152 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005. 
The adoption of SFAS No. 152 is expected to have no impact on the
Company s financial position or results of operations. 

In December 2004,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of
APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of
exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions which
should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. Statement No. 153 is effective for
nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15,
2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 is
expected to have no impact on the Company s financial position or results of
operations. 

Forward Looking Information and Risk 

Information
contained in this Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements which
reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and
financial performance. Wherever used,
terminology such as may, will, expect, intend, plan, anticipate, estimate 
or continue or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable
terminology reflect such forward-looking statements. 

There are certain
important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those
anticipated by some of these forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that all
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty. The factors, among others, that could cause
actual results to differ materially include: 
changes in general economic conditions, including recessionary effects
which may affect consumers spending and debt levels; the Company s ability to
execute its business plan including the successful expansion of its Christopher
 Banks, C.J. Banks and Acorn concepts; the Company s ability to open new
stores on favorable terms and the timing of such store openings; the acceptance
of the Company s merchandising strategies by its target customers; the ability
of the Company to anticipate fashion trends and consumer preferences; the loss
of one or more of the Company s key executives; continuity of a relationship
with or purchases from major vendors, particularly those from whom the Company
imports merchandise; timeliness of vendor production and deliveries;
competitive pressures on sales and pricing; increases in other costs which
cannot be recovered through improved pricing of merchandise; and the adverse
effect of weather conditions from time to time on consumers ability or desire
to purchase new clothing. Since the
Company relies heavily on sourcing from foreign vendors, there are risks and
uncertainties including transportation delays related to ocean, air and ground
shipments, political instability, work stoppages, and changes in import and export controls
including quota restrictions and the expiration thereof. The Company assumes no obligation to publicly
update or revise its forward looking statements to reflect events or
circumstances that may arise after the date of this Form 10-K. 

21 

Certain
Additional Business Risk Factors: 

Investors in the Company should consider the following risk factors as
well as the other information contained herein. 

Need for
Optimal Retail Store Locations 

The success of individual retail stores will depend to a great extent
on locating them in desirable shopping venues in markets where the Company s
target customers shop. The success of individual stores may depend on the
success of the shopping malls or lifestyle centers in which they are located.
In addition, the demographic and other marketing data the Company relies on in
determining the location of its stores cannot predict future consumer
preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy. As a result, retail
stores the Company opens may not be profitable or may be less successful than anticipated. 

Effective
Management of Growth Strategy 

The Company s continued growth depends on its ability
to open and operate stores successfully and to manage the Company s planned
expansion. During fiscal 2006, the Company plans to open approximately 75 new
stores, including approximately 45 Christopher Banks stores, 25 C.J.
Banks stores, and five Acorn stores. The
Company s planned expansion is dependent upon a number of factors, including
locating suitable store sites, negotiating favorable lease terms, sourcing
sufficient levels of inventory, hiring and training qualified management level
and other employees and integrating new stores into its existing operations.
There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its planned expansion
or that such expansion will be profitable or that the Company will be able to
manage its growth effectively. 

Changing
Customer Preferences 

The Company s future success will depend on its
ability to continually select the right merchandise assortment, maintain
appropriate inventory levels and creatively present merchandise in a way that
is appealing to its customers. Consumer preferences cannot be predicted with
certainty, as they continually change and vary from region to region. On
average, the Company begins the design process for its apparel six to seven
months before merchandise is available to its customers and the Company
typically begins to make purchase commitments four to five months in advance. These lead times make it difficult for the
Company to respond quickly to changing consumer preferences and amplify the
consequences of any misjudgments it might make in anticipating customer
preferences. Consequently, if the
Company misjudges its customers merchandise preferences or purchasing habits, its
sales may decline significantly, and the Company may be required to mark down
certain products to significantly lower prices to sell excess inventory, which
would result in lower margins. 

Fluctuations
in Comparable Store Sales Results 

The Company s comparable store sales results have
fluctuated in the past on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis, and are
expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect
comparable store sales results, including changes in fashion trends, changes in
the Company s merchandise mix, calendar shifts of holiday periods, actions by
competitors, weather conditions and general economic conditions. Past
comparable store sales results are not an indicator of future results, and
there can be no assurance that the Company s comparable store sales results
will not decrease in the future. The Company s comparable store sales results
are likely to have a significant effect on the market price of the Company s
common stock. 

Competition 

The retail apparel industry is highly competitive. The
Company competes with national and local department stores, specialty and
discount store chains and independent retail stores that market similar lines
of merchandise. Many competitors are significantly larger and have
substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources and enjoy
greater national, regional and local name recognition than does the Company.
Depth of selection in sizes, colors and styles of merchandise, merchandise
procurement and pricing, ability to anticipate fashion trends and consumer
preferences, inventory control, reputation, quality of merchandise, store
design and location, brand recognition and customer service are all important
factors in competing successfully in the retail industry. The Company s successful performance in
recent years has increased the amount of imitation by other 

22 

retailers. Such imitation has made and will continue
to make the retail environment in which the Company operates more competitive. 

General
Economic Conditions 

The Company s business fluctuates according to changes in consumer
preferences, which are dictated in part by fashion and season. In addition,
certain economic conditions affect the level of consumer spending on
merchandise offered by the Company, including, among others, unemployment
levels, business conditions, interest rates and consumer confidence in future
economic conditions. Consumer preference and economic conditions may differ or
change from time to time in each market in which the Company operates and
negatively affect the Company s net sales and profitability. 

Reliance
on Key Personnel 

The Company s success and ability to properly manage its growth depends
to a significant extent both upon the performance of its current executive and
senior management team and its ability to attract, hire, motivate and retain
additional qualified management personnel in the future. The Company s
inability to recruit and retain such additional personnel, or the loss of the
services of any of its executive officers, could have a material adverse impact
on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Volatility
of Stock Price 

The market price of the Company s common stock has fluctuated
substantially in the past and there can be no assurance that the market price
of the common stock will not continue to fluctuate significantly. Future
announcements or management discussions concerning the Company or its
competitors, sales and profitability results, quarterly variations in operating
results or monthly comparable store net sales, changes in earnings estimates by
analysts or changes in accounting policies, among other factors, could cause
the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition,
stock markets, in general, have experienced extreme price and volume volatility
in recent years. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market
prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated
to the operating performance of the specific companies. 

ITEM 7A. 

 QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE 
DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The market risk inherent in the Company s financial
instruments and in its financial position represents the potential loss arising
from adverse changes in interest rates. 
The Company s results of operations could be negatively impacted by
decreases in interest rates on its short-term investments. 

The Company is potentially exposed to market risk from
changes in interest rates relating to its Revolving Credit and Security
Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank. Loans
under the Wells Fargo Revolver bear interest at Wells Fargo s fluctuating base
rate, 5.5 as of February 26, 2005, plus 0.25 . However, the Company had no revolving credit
loan borrowings under the Wells Fargo Revolver during fiscal 2005 or 2004 and,
given its existing liquidity position, does not expect to utilize the Wells
Fargo Revolver in the near future except for its continuing use of the import
letter of credit facility. 

The Company enters into certain purchase obligations
outside the United States, which are settled in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the Company has only minimal
exposure to foreign currency exchange risks. 
The Company does not hedge against foreign currency risks and believes
that the foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial. 

The Company does not have any derivative financial
instruments and does not hold any instruments for trading purposes.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 Christopher Banks Corporation: 

We have completed an integrated audit of
Christopher Banks Corporation s February 26, 2005 consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of February
26, 2005 and audits of its February 28, 2004 and March 1, 2003 consolidated
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below. 

Consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule 

In our opinion, the consolidated balance sheets and the related statements of income, of
stockholders equity, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Christopher Banks Corporation and its
subsidiaries at February 26, 2005 and February 28, 2004 and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended February 26, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 
In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15 (a)
(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. 
An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 

As discussed in Note 2, the consolidated
financial statements as of February 28, 2004 and March 1, 2003 have been
restated. 

25 

Internal control over financial reporting 

Also, in our opinion, management s assessment, included in Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item
9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of February 26, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ), is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of February 26, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
COSO. The Company s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on management s assessment and on the effectiveness of
the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. We conducted our audit of
internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control
over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management s assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

A company s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

CHRISTOPHER BANKS CORPORATION 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1 NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

Christopher 
Banks Corporation, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Christopher 
Banks, Inc., Christopher Banks Company and Christopher Banks
Services Company (collectively referred to as Christopher Banks or the Company operates retail specialty stores selling women s apparel in the United States. The Company operated 642, 534 and 438 stores (unaudited)
at the end of fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 

Fiscal
year and basis of presentation 

The Company s
fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest February 28. The fiscal years ended February 26, 2005,
February 28, 2004 and March 1, 2003 each consisted of 52 weeks. The Consolidated Financial Statements include
the accounts of Christopher Banks Corporation and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Christopher Banks, Inc., Christopher Banks Company
and Christopher Banks Services Company. 
All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. 

Use
of estimates 

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting
period. As a result, actual results could differ because of the use of these
estimates and assumptions. 

Cash
and cash equivalents 

Cash and cash
equivalents consist of cash on hand and in banks, and investments purchased
with an original maturity of three months or less. 

Short-term
investments 

In accordance with
the Company s investment policy, short-term investments consist of U.S.
Government, corporate and asset-backed debt securities. Auction rate debt securities, which had
historically been classified as cash and cash equivalents, have now been
properly classified as short-term investments at February 28, 2004 thereby
reducing cash and cash equivalents and increasing short-term investments by
 19.0 million. This classification correction resulted in a 19.0 million
increase in net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended February 28,
2004. These investments, classified as
available for sale, have long-term stated contractual maturities, but have
variable interest rates that reset at each auction period, typically 28 or 35
days. These securities trade in a broad,
highly liquid market and the Company has never had difficulty liquidating any
such investment at the end of a given auction period. The Company typically reinvests these
securities multiple times during the year at each new auction period. The Company has revised its presentation in
the cash flow statement for fiscal 2004 to include the gross purchases and redemptions
of these securities as investing activities rather than as a component of cash
and cash equivalents. All income from
these investments was recorded as interest income for each period presented. 

The Company has
the positive intent and ability to hold its short-term investments, other than
auction rate debt securities, to maturity. 
These securities are recorded at amortized cost, which management believes
approximates fair value, and the related amortization of premiums and discounts
arising at acquisition are reported in earnings each period as a component of
interest income. The original maturities
of the Company s U.S. Government debt securities range from two to three
years. These securities are callable
within one year at the option of the issuer and have historically been called
by the issuer within one year from the date of purchase. Therefore, these securities are classified as
short-term investments in the Company s balance sheet. When call options are exercised by the
issuer, the Company receives the full principal amount of the bond and any
interest accrued through the call date. 

Inventory
valuation 

Merchandise
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in,
first-out retail inventory method. 
Permanent markdowns of inventory are recorded monthly based on an
evaluation by merchandising management, which includes analyzing inventory
levels and aging, as well as rate of sale. 
The Company further reduces the value of inventory by recording an
allowance for permanent markdowns based on 

31 

inventory levels
from the season which immediately precedes the current season as of the
reporting date. Permanent markdowns on
this merchandise take into account the future anticipated selling price of the
inventory. To the extent that management s
estimates differ from actual results, additional markdowns may have to be
recorded, which could reduce the Company s gross margins and adversely affect
its financial position and results of operations. For the fiscal years ended February 26,
2005, February 28, 2004 and March 1, 2003, permanent inventory
markdowns totaled 2,702,444, 1,555,865 and 689,779, respectively. 

Property,
equipment and improvements 

Property,
equipment and improvements are stated at cost. Property and equipment is
depreciated over its estimated useful life; three to five years for computer
hardware and software, seven years for furniture, fixtures and other equipment,
and 25 years for the Company s corporate office and distribution center and
related building improvements. Store leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life or term of the
related leases, which is typically ten years. 
Repairs and maintenance which do not extend an asset s useful life are
expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the
cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the
accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for that
period. 

Long-Lived
Assets 

The
Company reviews long-lived assets with definite lives at least annually or
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
the asset may not be recoverable. This
review includes the evaluation of individual under-performing stores and
assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of the improvements and
equipment related to the store. Future
cash flows are projected for the remaining lease life considering such factors
as future sales levels, gross margins, changes in rent and other expenses, as
well as the overall operating environment specific to that store. If the estimated future cash flows are less
than the carrying value of the assets, the Company records an impairment charge
equal to the difference between the assets fair value and carrying value. As the projection of future cash flows
involves judgment and estimates, differences in circumstances or estimates
could produce different results. 

Goodwill 

The Company
recognizes the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net amount assigned
to assets acquired, including intangible assets with indefinite lives, and
liabilities assumed, as goodwill. Goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an
annual basis during the fourth quarter, and between annual tests whenever there
is an impairment indicated. Fair values
are estimated based on future cash flows and are compared with the corresponding
carrying value of the related assets. 
Impairment losses will be recognized whenever the fair values are less
than the carrying value of the related assets. 

Intangible
Assets 

Intangible assets
comprised of customer lists and customer related information acquired through
acquisition are recorded at cost net of accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed on a straight-line
basis over estimated useful lives ranging from three to nine years. The straight-line method of amortization
reflects an appropriate allocation of the cost of the intangible assets to
earnings in each reporting period. 

Deferred
lease incentives 

The Company
accounts for construction allowances received from landlords in accordance with
SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, and Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Technical Bulletin 88-1, Issues Relating to Accounting for Leases. Accordingly, all amounts received from
landlords to fund leasehold improvements are recorded as a deferred liability,
which is amortized over the related store s lease term. See Note 2 for additional information
regarding deferred lease incentives. 

Common
stock held in treasury 

The Company
accounts for its treasury stock under the cost method, whereby stockholders 
equity is reduced for the total cost of the shares repurchased. The Company has engaged in treasury stock
repurchases as a means to support the Company s stock price as well as a means
to reduce the number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding, which
in turn increases earnings per share. 

Revenue
recognition 

Sales are
recognized by the Company at the point of purchase when the customer takes
possession of the merchandise and pays for the purchase, generally with cash or
credit card. Sales from purchases made
with gift certificates and gift cards are also recorded when the customer takes
possession of the merchandise. Gift
certificates and gift cards issued by the Company are recorded as a liability
until they are redeemed. The Company has

32 

established an
allowance for sales returns by customers. 
This allowance has been calculated using estimates based on historical customer
return data that management believes to be reasonable. 

Vendor
allowances 

From
time to time, the Company receives certain allowances or credits from its
vendors primarily related to defective merchandise or markdown allowances. These allowances or credits are reflected as
a reduction of merchandise inventory in the period they are received. The aggregate amount of such allowances and
credits totaled 222,734, 113,136 and 91,452 in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 

Substantially
all of the Company s merchandise is produced exclusively for the Company and
sold under the Christopher Banks and C.J. Banks private labels. Accordingly, the Company does not enter into
any arrangements with vendors where payments or other consideration might be
received in connection with the purchase or promotion of a vendor s products,
buy-down agreements or cooperative advertising programs. 

Cost
of sales 

Cost of
sales include the cost of merchandise, markdowns, shrink, freight into and out
from the Company s distribution center, buyer and distribution center salaries,
buyer travel, rent and other occupancy related costs, miscellaneous merchandise
expenses and other costs related to the Company s distribution network. Cost of sales excludes all depreciation and
amortization expense. 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses include all salaries with the exception of
buyer and distribution center salaries, other employee benefits, advertising,
store supplies, credit card processing fees, information technology related
costs, insurance, professional services, non-buyer travel and miscellaneous other
selling and administrative related expenses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses exclude all depreciation
and amortization expense. 

Store
pre-opening costs 

Non-capital
expenditures such as payroll and training costs incurred prior to the opening
of a new store are charged to selling, general and administrative expense in
the period they are incurred. 

Rent
expense and deferred rent obligations 

Rent expense under
non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or free rent
periods is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term,
beginning on the date of initial possession, which is generally when the
Company enters the space and begins the construction build-out. Most of the Company s lease agreements for retail
space include escalation clauses in minimum base rent. For leases that contain predetermined fixed
escalations of minimum rent, the Company recognizes the related rent expense on
a straight-line basis and records the difference between the recognized rent
expense and amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent obligations. 

In addition, the
Company has a limited number of other lease agreements for retail space which
include escalation in minimum rent based on increases in the Consumer Price Index,
not to exceed 2.0 . For purposes of
calculating rent expense and future minimum lease payments, the Company
utilizes the maximum annual increase of 2.0 . 
The Company also recognizes the related rent expense for these leases on
a straight-line basis and records the difference between the recognized rent
expense and amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent obligations. 

Advertising 

The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs for the
fiscal years ended February 26, 2005, February 28, 2004 and March 1,
2003 were 920,398, 841,186 and 949,954, respectively. The Company includes advertising expense in
selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 

Fair
value of financial instruments 

The Company s
financial instruments consist of cash, receivables, payables and accrued
liabilities, for which current carrying amounts approximate fair market value.

Stock-based
employee compensation 

The Company
discloses stock-based compensation information in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS No. 123 ), Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation and No. 148 SFAS No. 148 ), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure . SFAS No. 148,
an amendment of SFAS No. 123, does not amend the provisions of SFAS No. 123 that
permit entities to account for stock-based compensation under the intrinsic
value method set forth by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB No.
25 ), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company has elected to continue to
recognize compensation cost for its stock-based compensation plans in
accordance with APB No. 25. Generally,
no compensation expense is recognized for stock options with exercise prices
equal to the market value of the underlying shares of stock at the date of
grant. The Company is currently
evaluating the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, and will
adopt SFAS No. 123R the first quarter of fiscal 2007. 

If stock-based employee compensation cost had
been determined based on the fair value methodology prescribed by SFAS No. 123
and SFAS No. 148, the Company s net earnings and earnings per share in fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003 would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated
in the following table.

The fair value of
each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. Option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options. 

The estimated
weighted-average fair value of options granted during fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003 were 5.54, 8.24, and 8.85, respectively. The following assumptions were used to apply
the Black-Scholes pricing model for grants in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Income
taxes 

Income taxes are recorded
following the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes . 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the
difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. 
Realization of deferred tax assets is ultimately dependent upon future
taxable income. Inherent in the
measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of
tax laws and published guidance with respect to the Company s operations. No valuation allowance has been provided for
deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of net deferred
tax assets will be realized. The
effective tax rate utilized by the Company reflects management s estimation of
the expected tax liabilities within various taxing jurisdictions. 

Net
income per common share 

Basic earnings per
share EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the applicable periods while diluted EPS is
computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common and common
equivalent shares (dilutive stock options) outstanding. 

The following is a
reconciliation of the number of shares and per share amounts used in the basic
and diluted EPS computations.

Segment
information 

The Company
executes its operations through three concepts: 
Christopher Banks, C.J. Banks and Acorn stores. The concepts offer similar products, have
consistent distribution channels and target a similar customer base. Substantially all of the Company s stores are
located within high traffic retail (destination) shopping locations, and the
individual stores generally display similar economic characteristics. Based on these factors and the way in which
the Company manages its business, it has presented its operations as one
reportable operating segment. 

Recently
issued accounting pronouncements 

On October 22,
2004, the President signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act ). The Act provides a deduction for income from
qualified domestic production activities, which will be phased in from 2005
through 2010. In return, the Act also
provides for a two-year phase out of the existing extraterritorial income
exclusion ETI for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with
international trade protocols by the European Union. Under the guidance in the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB Staff Position No. 109-1, Application
of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction
on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004, the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as
described in the FASB Statement No. 109. 
As such, the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities existing at the enactment date. 
Rather, the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period
which the deduction is claimed on the Company s tax return. 

35 

In December 2004,
the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based
Payment, which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees. SFAS No. 123R requires
all share-based payment transactions, including stock options, restricted stock
plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee stock
purchase plans, to be recognized as compensation expense in the financial
statements. The cost will be measured
based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments on the date
issued. On April 14, 2005, the
Securities Exchange Commission announced it would provide for a phased-in
implementation process for SFAS No. 123R. 
The SEC will require that registrants that are not small business issuers
adopt SFAS No. 123R for the first annual period beginning after June 15,
2005. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact this statement will have on its financial statements and
will adopt SFAS No. 123R effective the first quarter of fiscal 2007. 

In November 2004,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs. This Statement amends the guidance in
Accounting Research Bulletin ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to
clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs, and wasted material. 
SFAS No. 151 requires that those items be recognized as current-period
charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that
allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on
the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are effective
for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is expected to
have no impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 

In December 2004,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 152, Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing
Transactions. SFAS No. 152 amends SFAS
No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, and No. 67, Accounting for
Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, to state that the
guidance for (a) incidental operations and (b) costs incurred to sell real
estate projects does not apply to real estate time-sharing transactions. Statement No. 152 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005. 
The adoption of SFAS No. 152 is expected to have no impact on the
Company s financial position or results of operations. 

In December 2004,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of
APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of
exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions which
should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. Statement No. 153 is effective for
nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15,
2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 is
expected to have no impact on the Company s financial position or results of
operations. 

NOTE 2 
RESTATEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATMENTS 

In January 2005,
the Company s management initiated a review of its lease-related accounting
practices, specifically the manner in which it accounted for construction
allowances and the period over which it recognized rent expense for its
operating leases. As a result of the
review, the Company concluded that its prior practices were not in accordance
with GAAP. As a result, the Company has restated
its Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended March 1,
2003 and February 28, 2004, as well as interim quarterly results. See Note 18, Quarterly Financial Data
(Unaudited), for the effects of these corrections and changes on the Company s
interim quarterly periods within fiscal 2005 and 2004. 

Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Technical Bulletin No. 88-1, Issues
Related to Accounting for Leases, FTB No. 88-1 requires construction
allowances received from landlords to be recorded as deferred lease incentives
in the liability section of the balance sheet and as a component of
operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Previously, construction allowances were
treated as reductions of property, equipment, and improvements on the Company s
Consolidated Balance Sheet and as a reduction of capital expenditures within
the investing activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Accordingly, the Company has established the
appropriate deferred lease incentive liability and recorded a corresponding
increase in property, equipment and improvements. Additionally, the amortization of deferred
lease incentives has been classified as a reduction of rent expense, included as
part of cost of sales, rather then a reduction of depreciation expense in the
Company s Consolidated Income Statement. 

36 

In
determining the proper period over which to recognize rent expense with free
rent periods and/or rent escalation, FTB No. 88-1 considers the lessee s
possession or right to physically control the property, and requires that
straight-line rent expense begin when the lessee takes possession of or
controls the use of the space. The
Company had previously recorded straight-line rent expense beginning on the
earlier of the store opening date or lease commencement date, which had the
effect of excluding the build-out period of its stores from the calculation of the
period over which rent was expensed. The
Company now considers possession to occur on the date it attains physical
access to the space and begins the construction build-out. The restated financial statements reflect
additional rent expense and deferred rent obligations in the Company s Consolidated
Statements of Income and Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. 

The
Company restated its Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal years ended February 28,
2004 and March 1, 2003 in this Form 10-K. 
The following tables present a summary of the effects of these
restatements on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal
years ended February 28, 2004 and March 1, 2003. See Note 18, Quarterly Financial Data
(Unaudited), for the effects of these corrections and changes on the Company s
interim quarterly periods within fiscal 2005 and 2004.

NOTE 3 
ACQUISITION OF ACORN STORES 

On November 1,
2004, the Company acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of
Gilmore Brothers Inc., a privately held women s specialty retailer operating
stores under the name Acorn, for approximately 7.4 million in cash. The Company funded the purchase from current
cash balances and redemptions of short-term investments. Of the 7.4 million purchase price, 2.3
million was placed in escrow to satisfy certain obligations of Gilmore
Brothers, Inc. not assumed by the Company. 
As of February 26, 2005, 700,000 of the purchase price remained in
escrow. Subsequent to year end,
approximately 15,000 of the escrow balance was remitted to the Company and the
remainder was remitted to Gilmore Brothers Inc. 
The Company plans to continue to operate Acorn as a division of
Christopher Banks, Inc. 

As of November 1,
2004, Acorn operated 21 stores in nine states that offer upscale women s
fashions along with complementary jewelry and accessories under private and
branded labels. In January 2005,
the Company closed one of the acquired Acorn stores. The transaction was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the results of operations of Acorn
have been consolidated in the Company s financial statements from the date of
acquisition. 

The total purchase
price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from
Gilmore Brothers, Inc., based on their respective estimated fair values as of
the date of acquisition. The purchase
price allocation resulted in excess consideration, over the estimated fair
value of the net assets acquired, of approximately 3.6 million, which has been
assigned to goodwill. A summary of the
allocation of the purchase price follows:

awards program, a preferred customer shopping program. The intangible assets will be amortized over
their estimated useful lives, ranging from three to nine years, based on a
valuation analysis completed in October 2005. The resulting amortization expense has been
included in depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

As a result of an
impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 which
includes the evaluation of individual under-performing stores and assessing the
recoverability of the carrying value of the improvements and equipment related
to the stores, the Company determined that the carrying value of the
improvements and equipment at certain under-performing stores exceeded the
expected future undiscounted cash flows from the stores. As a result, the Company recorded an
impairment charge of 837,000 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company continues to hold the assets
impaired for use. The asset impairment was
recorded as a reduction of property, equipment and improvements in the Company s
Consolidated Balance Sheet and a charge to selling, general and administrative
expenses in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Income.

amounts due to additional intangible asset acquisitions, potential impairment,
accelerated amortization or other events. 
Impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible
asset subject to amortization is not recoverable from expected future cash
flows and exceeds its fair value.

NOTE 11 LONG-TERM DEBT 

The Company
maintains an Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement with
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Wells Fargo Revolver which
expires on June 30, 2006. The Wells
Fargo Revolver provides the Company with revolving credit loans and letters of
credit of up to 40 million, subject to a borrowing base formula based on
inventory levels. In October 2004,
the Wells Fargo Revolver was amended to allow, among other things, the
formation of a new subsidiary, Christopher Banks Services Company, in
conjunction with the acquisition of Acorn. 

Loans under the
Wells Fargo Revolver bear interest at Wells Fargo s base rate, 5.5 as of February 26,
2005, plus 0.25 . Interest is payable monthly in arrears. The Wells Fargo
Revolver carries a facility fee of 0.25 based on the unused portion as defined
in the agreement. Facility fees totaled
 5,128 in fiscal 2005. 

The Wells Fargo
Revolver is collateralized by the Company s equipment, general intangibles,
inventory, inventory letters of credit and letter of credit rights. The Company had no revolving credit loan borrowings
under the Wells Fargo Revolver during fiscal 2005 or 2004. Historically, the Wells Fargo Revolver has
only been utilized by the Company to open letters of credit to facilitate the
import of merchandise. The borrowing
base at February 26, 2005, was 32.3 million. As of February 26, 2005 the Company had
outstanding letters of credit in the amount of 21.7 million. Accordingly, the availability of revolving
credit loans under the Wells Fargo Revolver was 10.6 million at that date. 

The Wells Fargo
Revolver contains certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on
incurring additional indebtedness and limitations on certain types of
investments, as well as requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios. 

NOTE 12 STOCKHOLDERS 
EQUITY 

In July 2003, the
Company s Board of Directors approved a 3-for-2 stock split payable in the form
of a stock dividend on the Company s outstanding common stock. The record date was August 13, 2003 and
the stock dividend was distributed on August 27, 2003. The Company previously distributed 3-for-2
stock splits on December 14, 1999, July 11, 2000, February 12,
2001 and December 12, 2001. Share
and per share data contained within this Form 10-K have been restated to
reflect the effect of the stock splits. 

In September 2003,
the Company s Board of Directors declared the Company s first cash
dividend. The declaration provides for
an on-going cash dividend of 0.04 per share to be paid quarterly, subject to
Board approval. Quarterly dividends were
paid on October 6, 2003, January 6, 2004, April 6, 2004, July 6,
2004, October 5, 2004 and January 4, 2005 to shareholders of record
as of September 19, 2003, December 18, 2003, March 19, 2004, June 18,
2004, September 20, 2004, and December 17, 2004, respectively. 

The Company s
Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program in February 2003
enabling the Company to purchase up to 20 million of its common stock, subject
to market conditions. During February and
March 2003, the Company purchased a total of 1,608,000 shares of its
common stock at a total cost, including commissions, of approximately 17.3
million. This stock repurchase
authorization expired in February 2004. 

42 

In February 2004, the Company s Board of
Directors authorized another stock repurchase program. This program allowed the Company to purchase
up to 25 million of its common stock, subject to market conditions. On June 28, 2004, the Company announced
its Board of Directors authorized an increase in the stock repurchase program
to 40 million. The Company repurchased
2,367,400 shares at a total cost, including commissions, of approximately 40
million, effectively completing the repurchase program in October 2004. 

The common stock repurchased is being held in treasury
and has reduced the number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding
by approximately 10 . All of the Company s
share repurchases were executed in the open market and no shares were
repurchased from related parties. Depending
on market conditions and the Company s cash position, the Company may
participate in additional stock repurchase programs in the future. 

NOTE 13 
STOCK OPTION PLANS 

Under various
plans, the Company may grant options to purchase common stock to employees and
non-employee members of its Board of Directors at a price not less than 100 of
the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the option grant
date. In general, options granted to
employees vest over three to five years and are exercisable up to ten years
from the date of grant. Options granted
to Directors vest immediately upon grant and are exercisable up to five years
from the date of grant. 

The Company has not paid
cash to any employee to settle an outstanding stock option, to settle an
earlier grant of stock award within six months after vesting or to repurchase
shares within six months after exercise of an option or issuance in the fiscal
years ended February 26, 2005, February 28, 2004 and March 1,
2003.

tax assets represent potential future income tax benefits. Realization of these
assets is ultimately dependent upon future taxable income. No valuation allowance has been provided for
deferred tax assets because management believes realization of the full amount
of net deferred tax assets is more likely than not. 

NOTE 15 
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS 

The Company has
established a defined contribution plan qualified under Section 401(k) of
the Internal Revenue Code for the benefit of all employees who meet certain
eligibility requirements, primarily age, length of service and hours of service. The plan allows eligible employees to invest
from 1 to 25 of their compensation. 
The plan allows for discretionary Company matching contributions. Company contributions for the fiscal years
ended February 26, 2005, February 28, 2004 and March 1, 2003 totaled
 470,343, 427,998 and 384,524, respectively. 

The Company does not
offer any other post-retirement, post-employment or pension benefits to
directors or employees. 

The Company has entered
into employment agreements with certain executives of the Company. These agreements provide for a specified base
salary and that each executive is entitled to certain severance benefits in the
event that their employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by
such executive following a change of control (both as defined in the
employment agreements). The employment
agreements also provide for the immediate vesting of unvested stock options in
the event of a change of control. 

NOTE 16 LEASE COMMITMENTS 

The Company leases each
of its store locations and vehicles under operating leases. The store lease
terms, including rental period, renewal options, escalation clauses and rent as
a percentage of sales, vary among the leases. Most store leases require the
Company to pay real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges. 

In
fiscal 2002, the Company purchased its 210,000 square foot corporate office and
distribution center facility, located in Plymouth, Minnesota. Prior to fiscal 2002, the Company leased this
facility. The Company utilizes
approximately 130,000 square feet of the building for its own corporate offices
and distribution center facility. The
remaining 80,000 square feet of the building are subleased to a third
party. Under the sublease, the Company
received 26,667 per month through August 31, 2003 and will receive
 30,000 per month from September 1, 2003 through May 31, 2005. The subtenant is also required to reimburse
the Company for property taxes, utilities and other operating costs of the
subleased portion of the facility. Upon
expiration of the sublease, the Company plans to utilize the 80,000 square feet
for its own distribution center requirements.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We have established and maintain disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our Company s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our Company s management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our Company s disclosure controls and procedures
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based upon the foregoing, as of
February 26, 2005, our Company s management concluded that our Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of February 26, 2005. 

Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls
and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management of our Company, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
in Rules 13a - 15(f) and 15d - 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Our Company s internal control over financial reporting was designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of our Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of our Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of our Company; and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our Company s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Our management conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based
on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This
evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the
design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of
controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on the evaluation,
management has concluded our Company s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of February 26, 2005. 

Our management s assessment of the effectiveness of
the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of February 26, 2005
has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. 

49 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other than as discussed below, there have been no
changes during our Company s fiscal quarter ended February 26, 2005 in our
Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our Company s internal
control over financial reporting. 

In coming to the conclusion that our internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of February 26, 2005, our management
considered, among other things, the restatement related to the accounting for
leases, as disclosed in Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included herein, which management concluded resulted from a
deficiency in our controls over the accounting for leases, which represented a
material weakness. Management notified
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and our Company s independent registered
public accounting firm of this matter. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005
and prior to February 26, 2005, the Company implemented controls to ensure that
all leases are reviewed and accounted for in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Accordingly, the Company evaluated its controls over the
selection and application of lease accounting policies as of February 26, 2005
and has concluded that the material weakness had been remediated as of
year-end.
