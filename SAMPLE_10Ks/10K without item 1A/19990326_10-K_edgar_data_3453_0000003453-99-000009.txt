DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

 A. OCEAN TRANSPORTATION
				--------------------

 (1) FREIGHT SERVICES
						----------------

 Matson's Hawaii Service offers containership freight services
between the ports of Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, and the major ports in
Hawaii, which are located on the islands of Oahu, Kauai, Maui and Hawaii.
Roll-on/roll-off service is provided between Los Angeles and the major ports in
Hawaii. Container cargo also is received at and delivered to Portland, Oregon,
and moved overland between Portland and Seattle at no extra charge.

 Matson is the principal carrier of ocean cargo between the
United States Pacific Coast and Hawaii. In 1998, Matson carried 143,431
containers (compared with 149,734 in 1997) and 73,717 motor vehicles (compared
with 78,641 in 1997) between those destinations. Principal westbound cargoes
carried by Matson to Hawaii include dry containers of mixed commodities,
refrigerated cargoes, packaged foods, building materials and motor vehicles.
Principal eastbound cargoes carried by Matson from Hawaii include household
goods, canned pineapple, refrigerated containers of fresh pineapple, motor
vehicles and molasses. The preponderance of Matson's Hawaii Service revenue
is derived from the westbound carriage of containerized freight and motor
vehicles.

 Matson's Guam Service provides containership freight service
between the United States Pacific Coast and Guam and Micronesia. Matson's Guam
Service is a component of the Pacific Alliance Service, a strategic alliance
established in 1996 by Matson and American President Lines, Ltd. ("APL") to
provide freight service between the United States Pacific Coast and Hawaii,
Guam, and several Far East ports. In 1998, Matson carried 18,418 containers
(compared with 19,122 in 1997) and 3,132 automobiles (compared with 3,595 in
1997) in the Guam Service. Modifications to the strategic alliance were
implemented in January 1998 to provide better service and reduce operating
costs. The restructured alliance now utilizes six vessels (three Matson
vessels and three APL vessels) in a schedule which provides service from the
United States Pacific Coast to Guam and Micronesia, continuing through Far East
ports, and returning to California.

 Matson's Pacific Coast Service provides containership freight
service between Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle and Vancouver, Canada. In 1998,
Matson carried 34,669 containers (compared with 39,390 in 1997) in the Pacific
Coast Service. The Pacific Coast Service benefited in 1998 from a relationship
with Canadian National Railway, commenced in August 1997, which enables Matson
to provide the railway and its customers with reliable, fixed-day service that
reduces overall transit time between western Canada and southern California.

 Matson's Mid-Pacific Service offers container and conven-
tional freight service between the United States Pacific Coast and the ports of
Kwajalein, Ebeye and Majuro in the Republic of the Marshall Islands and
Johnston Island, all via Honolulu.

 See "Rate Regulation" below with respect to Matson's freight
rates.

 (2) VESSELS
						-------

 Matson's cargo fleet consists of eleven containerships, four
combination container/trailerships, one roll-on/roll-off barge, two container
barges equipped with cranes which serve the neighbor islands of Hawaii and one
container barge equipped with cranes in the Mid-Pacific Service. These
nineteen vessels represent an investment of approximately 850,300,000 expended
over the past 29 years. The majority of vessels in the Matson cargo fleet have
been acquired with the assistance of withdrawals from a Capital Construction
Fund established under Section 607 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as
amended.

 In the second half of 1998, Matson agreed to bareboat charter
two container/trailerships in reserve status to Sea Star Line, LLC, a newly-
created entity which operates the vessels in the Florida-Puerto Rico trade. 
The vessels were refitted to respond to the market requirements in that trade.

 Matson's fleet units are described in the list on the
following page.

 As a complement to its fleet, Matson owns approximately
16,500 containers, 9,000 container chassis, 590 auto-frames and miscellaneous
other equipment. Capital expenditures by Matson in 1998 for vessels, equipment
and systems totaled approximately 51,100,000.

(3) TERMINALS
						---------

 Matson Terminals, Inc. ("Matson Terminals"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Matson, provides container stevedoring, container equipment
maintenance and other terminal services for Matson and other ocean carriers at
the ports of Honolulu, Los Angeles, Oakland and Seattle.

 Matson Terminals is among the largest container stevedoring
and terminal operators on the United States Pacific Coast. A total of 852
vessel calls were served at all Matson Terminals container facilities in 1998.
The four terminals operated by Matson Terminals are as follows:

Terminal	 Expiration of 	 1998											 Usable
 Terminal		 Size		 Terminal		 Throughput	 Container		 Crane		 Ship
 Location (acres)		 Lease		 (# containers) Cranes (#)	 Ownership	 Berths (#)

Matson Terminals has lease agreements with the port
authorities for the use of the publicly-owned container terminal properties at
these locations and does not anticipate any difficulty in renewing such
agreements as they expire or in finding satisfactory alternative premises.
Besides owning or leasing the shoreside cranes identified in the above table,
Matson Terminals owns or leases supporting container-handling equipment at its
container facilities and owns all of the maintenance equipment used in
providing container equipment and terminal maintenance services.

 Capital expenditures for terminals and equipment totaled
approximately 8,300,000 in 1998.

 (4) OTHER SERVICES
						--------------

 Matson Intermodal System, Inc. ("Matson Intermodal"), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Matson, is an intermodal marketing company which
arranges North American rail and truck transportation for shippers and
carriers, frequently in conjunction with ocean transportation. Through volume
purchases of rail and motor carrier transportation services, augmented by such
services as shipment tracing and single-vendor invoicing, Matson Intermodal is
able to reduce transportation costs for customers. Matson Intermodal
currently has 11 offices and manages 30 equipment depots across the United
States Mainland. 
 
 Matson Services Company, Inc. ("Matson Services"), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Matson, owns two tugboats, which are employed in
Hawaiian waters under operating agreements to provide harbor assistance to
vessels calling at the islands of Hawaii and Maui.

 Matson Logistics Solutions, Inc. ("Matson Logistics"), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Matson, was formed in 1998 to provide supply and
distribution services to Matson customers, including management of
transportation purchases, inventory and on-time deliveries.

 (5) COMPETITION
						-----------

 Matson's Hawaii and Guam Services have one major container-
ship competitor which serves Long Beach, Oakland, Tacoma, Honolulu and Guam.
In an administrative proceeding in 1997, the purpose of which was to determine
the historic service levels to which that competitor would be limited as a
condition to its participation in the Maritime Security Program, the U.S.
Maritime Administration limited the annual capacity which the competitor may
offer in the Hawaii trade. The current limit on annual capacity is 162,378
TEUs (see footnote (1) on page 4 for an explanation of "TEU").

 Other competitors in the Hawaii Service include two common
carrier barge services, unregulated proprietary and contract carriers of bulk
cargoes and air cargo services. Although air freight competition is intense
for time-sensitive or perishable cargoes, historic and projected inroads of
such competition in cargo volume are limited by the amount of cargo space
available in passenger aircraft and by generally higher air freight rates. In
the summer of 1998, a temporary barge service offered competing service for
the summer movement of military household goods to and from Hawaii.
Competitors in the Pacific Coast Service include truck, rail and ocean carrier
services.

 Matson vessels are operated on schedules which make available
to shippers and consignees regular day-of-the-week sailings from the United
States Pacific Coast and day-of-the-week arrivals in Hawaii. This service is
attractive to customers because it decreases their overall distribution costs.
In order to match better the fleet capacity with existing cargo volume in the
Hawaii Service, without a reduction in service quality, in September 1998
Matson reduced the number of vessel arrivals in Honolulu from four per week to
three. This reduction still left Matson with 156 Hawaii round-trip voyages per
year, 50 percent more than its closest competitor. In addition, Matson
competes by offering more comprehensive service to customers, supported by its
scope of equipment and its efficiency and experience in the handling of
containerized cargoes, and by competitive pricing.

 The carriage of cargo between the United States Pacific Coast
and Hawaii on foreign-built or foreign-documented vessels is prohibited by
Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, frequently referred to as the
Jones Act. However, foreign-flag vessels carrying cargo to Hawaii from foreign
sources provide indirect competition for Matson's container freight service
between the United States Pacific Coast and Hawaii. Far East countries,
Australia and New Zealand have direct foreign-flag services to Hawaii.

 In response to coordinated efforts by various interests over
the past several years to convince Congress to repeal the Jones Act, in 1995
Matson joined other businesses and organizations to form the Maritime Cabotage
Task Force, which supports the retention of the Jones Act and other cabotage
laws. Repeal of the Jones Act would allow all foreign-flag vessel operators,
which do not have to abide by U.S. laws and regulations, to sail between
American ports in direct competition with Matson and other U.S. operators which
must comply with such laws and regulations. The Task Force seeks to inform
elected officials and the public about the economic, national security,
commercial, safety and environmental benefits of the Jones Act and similar
cabotage laws.

 Matson Terminals competes with numerous other companies which
perform the same or similar services. The container stevedoring and terminal
services business is extremely competitive. The primary considerations of
ocean carriers, when selecting stevedore and terminal operators, are rates,
quality of service, expertise and reputation. The industry is highly capital-
intensive because of the need for expensive container-handling equipment.

 Matson Intermodal competes for freight with a number of large
and small companies engaged in intermodal transportation. Matson Services
competes with several larger operators of tugboats in Hawaiian waters. Matson
Logistics competes with many larger providers of logistics services and with
transportation companies whose services include logistics.

(6) LABOR RELATIONS
						---------------

 The absence of strikes and the availability of labor through
hiring halls are important to the maintenance of profitable operations by
Matson. Matson's operations have not been disrupted significantly by strikes
in the past 27 years. However, in 1996 and 1997, labor disruptions at some
United States Pacific Coast ports by longshore bargaining units of the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union, attributed to dissatisfaction with
collective bargaining agreements negotiated in 1996, adversely affected ocean
carriers, including Matson, calling at those ports. See "Employees and Labor
Relations" below for a description of labor agreements and certain unfunded
liabilities for multi-employer pension plans to which Matson and Matson
Terminals contribute. 

 (7) RATE REGULATION
						---------------
 
 Matson is subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface
Transportation Board ("Board"), an agency within the U.S. Department of
Transportation, with respect to its domestic rates. The Interstate Commerce
Commission Termination Act of 1995 ("Act") establishes a "Zone of
Reasonableness," as defined in the Act, within which rate adjustments are
deemed reasonable. Rate adjustments outside of the Zone of Reasonableness are
subject to investigation and/or suspension by the Board. In December 1998,
Matson filed a 2.5 percent across-the-board increase in its Hawaii Service,
effective February 14, 1999.

 B. PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT

 (1) GENERAL
						-------

 The property development and management operations of A&B are
conducted by ABHI, a wholly-owned subsidiary headquartered in Honolulu. A&B
and its subsidiaries own approximately 93,000 acres of land, consisting of
approximately 91,000 acres in Hawaii and approximately 2,000 acres elsewhere,
as follows:

 LOCATION NO. OF ACRES
				--------										 ------------

As described more fully in the table below, the bulk of this acreage currently
is used for agricultural and related activities, and includes pasture land
leased to ranchers, watershed and conservation reserves. The balance is used
or planned for development or other urban uses. An additional 3,200 acres on
Maui and Kauai are leased from third parties.

 ABHI is actively involved in the entire spectrum of land
development, including planning, zoning, financing, constructing, purchasing,
managing and leasing, and selling and exchanging real property.

 (2) PLANNING AND ZONING
						-------------------

 The entitlement process for development of property in Hawaii
is both time-consuming and costly, involving numerous State and County
regulatory approvals. For example, conversion of an agriculturally-zoned
parcel to residential zoning usually requires the following approvals:

 - amendment of the County general plan to reflect the desired residential
 use;

 - approval by the State Land Use Commission to reclassify the parcel from
 the "Agricultural" district to the "Urban" district;

 - County approval to rezone the property to the precise residential use
 desired; and,

 - if the parcel is located in the Special Management Area, the granting of
 a Special Management Area permit by the County.

The entitlement process is complicated by the conditions, restrictions and
exactions that are placed on these approvals, such as the construction of
infrastructure improvements, payment of impact fees, restrictions on the
permitted uses of the land, provision of affordable housing, and/or mandatory
fee sale of portions of the project.

 ABHI actively works with regulatory agencies, commissions and
legislative bodies at various levels of government to obtain zoning
reclassification of land to its highest and best use. ABHI designates a parcel
as "fully-entitled" or "fully-zoned" when all necessary government land use
approvals have been obtained.

 As described in more detail below, in 1998 work to obtain
entitlements for urban use focused on (i) the Kukui'Ula residential development
on Kauai, (ii) the proposed master-planned community at Pilot Hill Ranch in
California, (iii) obtaining Community Plan designations for various ABHI lands
on Maui, and (iv) obtaining State "Urban" designation for two proposed single-
family subdivisions on Maui.

 With regard to item (iii) in the preceding paragraph, ABHI
continues to participate actively in Maui County's decennial update of its
Community Plans, a process that began in 1992. The Community Plans serve to
guide planning and development activity over the next decade. ABHI has
obtained and continues to seek various urban designations for its undeveloped
lands within the following four Community Plans, where most of its Maui lands
are located: Pa'ia-Haiku Community Plan, Kihei-Makena Community Plan, Wailuku-
Kahului Community Plan, and Makawao-Pukalani-Kula ("Upcountry") Community Plan.
In March 1998, the Maui County Council adopted the Kihei-Makena Community Plan.
The Plan reflected the approval of "Project District" designation for 650 acres
in Maalaea as a master-planned residential community, consisting of up to 1,800
homes, a golf course and commercial uses. The County Council previously had
adopted the Pa'ia-Haiku and Upcountry Community Plans in 1995 and 1996,
respectively. Adoption of the Wailuku-Kahului Community Plan by the County
Council is expected in 1999.

 (3) RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS
						--------------------

 ABHI is pursuing a number of residential projects in Hawaii
and on the U.S. Mainland, in particular:

 (a) KUKUI'ULA. The 1,045-acre Kukui'Ula project was
 --------- 
originally conceived to be a planned residential community on the island of
Kauai, comprising up to 3,000 dwelling units, an 18-hole golf course, hotels,
commercial areas, schools and parks. Construction of the wastewater treatment
plant, mass grading and drainage and certain roadway improvements were
completed in 1993. Since 1993, construction of major infrastructure to serve
the Kukui'Ula project has been suspended because of weak economic conditions on
Kauai.

 Beginning in late 1997, and continuing throughout 1998, a
complete reevaluation of the Kukui'Ula project was undertaken. That work has
led to a revised strategy for the project and to subsequent write-downs of
costs previously incurred. The revised strategy recognizes that, as a result
of Hurricane Iniki and generally weak economic conditions on Kauai, the resi-
dential housing market will not provide the level of sales absorption needed
to support the planned residential community concept.

 The revised strategy is to proceed with the development of
the residential component of the project on a reduced scale, through a series
of individual residential subdivisions designed in accordance with a master
development plan. This approach will allow infrastructure requirements to be
built on an incremental basis, rather than as a single large project, which
would be the case with a planned residential community.

 The initial increment of this program, a 32-lot residential
subdivision known as "Koloa Estates," received tentative subdivision approval
from the County of Kauai in December 1997. Construction plans were prepared
and approved, and construction began in August 1998. Construction is
anticipated to be complete in mid-1999. A public offering statement has been
submitted to the State, and is expected to be approved in March 1999.
Marketing of the lots will commence upon approval of the public offering
statement.

 The second aspect of the revised strategy is to expedite the
resort component of the project. A concept plan for the resort area at
Kukui'Ula was completed in early 1998. Based on that plan, a petition was
filed with the State Land Use Commission to add 77 acres of land, comprising
most of the planned resort, to the State "Urban" district. That petition was
approved in June 1998. As a result of that action, 837 acres at Kukui'Ula are
classified "Urban" and are available for development, while 208 acres are
conditionally designated "Urban," subject to a showing that substantial
progress has been made on providing infrastructure to the initial increment.

 In October 1998, three petitions were submitted to the Kauai
County Planning Department to (i) amend the County General Plan, (ii) amend the
County Zoning Ordinance, and (iii) amend the County Visitor Destination Area
Ordinance to complete the basic entitlements needed to proceed with the resort
component of the project. Hearings on these petitions began in early 1999 and
final action is anticipated in mid-1999.

 In 1998, in recognition of the reduced market support for the
project, previously-incurred and capitalized development costs of 20,216,000
were written off. These costs were primarily related to the wastewater
treatment plant, and recognized that the costs of that plant would not be
recoverable through the future cash flows of the plant. For additional
information, see Note 4 to A&B's financial statements on page 33 of the 1998
Annual Report, which Note is incorporated herein by reference.

 (b) KU'AU BAYVIEW AT PA'IA. Since the completion and
								----------------------
opening of the model homes in April 1996, 87 homes in this 92-lot single-family
subdivision on Maui (92 of the total) have been sold (19 homes in 1998). As
of March 15, 1999, three contracts were in escrow. The remaining two homes are
being marketed actively through brokers. It is anticipated that the project
will be sold out by the end of the second quarter of 1999.

 (c) KAHULUI IKENA. Since the completion of the 102-unit
								-------------
Maui condominium project in June 1995, a total of 82 units have been sold to
date (13 units in 1998). As of March 15, 1999, an additional 8 units were in
escrow. The remaining 12 units are being marketed through various brokers.

 (d) OTHER MAUI SUBDIVISIONS. Four agricultural
 -----------------------
subdivisions, which consist of a minimum lot size of two acres per lot, were in
various stages of design, development and sale in 1998. At the nine-lot
Kauhikoa Hill Ranch subdivision (located in Haiku), six lots were sold in 1998,
leaving two lots available for purchase. Site work construction for the 28-lot
Haiku Makai subdivision (also located in Haiku) was substantially completed in
April 1998. By year-end, 25 lots had been sold at an average sales price of
approximately 200,000 per lot, and sales contracts for the remaining three
lots were in escrow. The construction plans for the 37-lot Maunaolu sub-
division (located in Haliimaile) continue to be processed by the County.
Approval of the plans has been delayed due to inadequate availability of
water, and final approval will require a potable water source to be secured
for the project. The last of the four lots in the 10-acre Ku'au Beach Estates
subdivision (located in Pa'ia) was sold last year.

 In addition, ABHI is seeking entitlements
for two single-family subdivisions on Maui: (i) an approximately 200-unit
subdivision on 45 acres in Haliimaile, and (ii) an approximately 400-unit
subdivision on 110 acres in Spreckelsville, which includes the possible
development of nine holes of golf in order to expand the nearby nine-hole Maui
Country Club golf course into an 18-hole course. In October 1998, State
"Urban" designation was obtained for the Haliimaile project. In December 1998,
an application was filed with the County for the re-zoning of the property, the
final entitlement required for the project's development. A Petition also was
filed in 1998 seeking State "Urban" designation for the Spreckelsville project.
The hearing on the Petition was substantially completed in October 1998, and
final action is expected in 1999.

 (e) PILOT HILL RANCH. Pilot Hill Ranch, located in El
								----------------
Dorado County, near Sacramento, California, is an 1,800-acre parcel designated
in the 1996 El Dorado County General Plan as a planned residential community.
In 1997 and 1998, completion of the entitlement process for the property was
pursued through the submission to the County of a Specific Plan and an
Environmental Impact Report. In December 1998, the County Board of Supervisors
considered the Specific Plan application, but was not able to reach a decision.
Action on the application was continued to sometime in 1999. In light of this,
several alternatives are being considered, including the sale of the project.

 (4) COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES
						------------------------------------

 An important source of property revenue is the lease rental
income A&B and its subsidiaries receive from nearly 3.6 million leasable square
feet of industrial and commercial building space, ground leases on 286 acres
for commercial/industrial use, and leases on 11,600 acres for agricultural/
pasture use.

 (a) HAWAII COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES
 ---------------------------------------

 In Hawaii, most of the nearly 839,000 square feet of income-
producing commercial and industrial properties owned by A&B and its subsi-
diaries are located in the central Kahului/Wailuku area of Maui. They consist
primarily of two shopping centers and four office buildings, as well as several
improved commercial and industrial properties.

 The primary Hawaii commercial/industrial properties are as
follows:

LEASABLE AREA
 PROPERTY LOCATION TYPE (SQUARE FT.) 
 -------- -------- ---- -------------

Maui Mall Kahului, Maui Retail 180,600

Kahului Shopping Kahului, Maui Retail 108,500
Center

One Main Plaza Wailuku, Maui Office 85,300

Wakea Business Kahului, Maui Warehouse/Retail 61,500

Kahului Office Kahului, Maui Office 29,800
Center

Apex Building Kahului, Maui Retail 28,000

Stangenwald Building Honolulu, Oahu Office 28,200

In addition to the above-described properties, a number of
other commercial and industrial projects are being developed on Maui, Oahu and
Kauai, including:

 (i) TRIANGLE SQUARE. Development and marketing
										---------------
efforts are continuing for this 10.6-acre, light industrial zoned, commercial
subdivision in Kahului, Maui. Three lots have been leased, and the 28,000-
square-foot Apex Building is 95 occupied by retail users. A County Special
Management Area permit was secured in late 1998 to build Tri-Square One
Building, a proposed 15,000-square-foot, multi-tenant retail center on two of
the six remaining lots available for ground leases and retail development.

 (ii) MAUI BUSINESS PARK. In 1998, the sale of the
										------------------
final fee interest in the Maui Marketplace site was completed. Located in the
42-acre initial phase (Phase IA) of the Maui Business Park, Maui Marketplace is
a 300,000-square-foot retail center, owned by a third party, which occupies
20.3 acres of Phase IA's 37.4 salable acres. Maui Marketplace includes such
anchor tenants as Eagle Hardware and Garden, Office Max, Sports Authority and
Border's Books and Music. In addition, 13 Maui Business Park lots have been
sold to various commercial and retail businesses. There are 19 lots remaining
for sale or lease in Phase IA.

 Steps taken by the State of Hawaii to extend the runway
at the nearby Kahului Airport have generated increased interest in the next
phase of Maui Business Park, Phase IB. As a result, the planning and design of
the onsite improvements for the 34-acre site have been accelerated to meet the
anticipated market demand.

 The entire Maui Business Park development consists of a
planned total of 239 acres, and is planned to be developed in four phases. The
overall absorption of the property is expected to take 20 years.

 (iii) MILL TOWN. Located in Waipahu, Oahu, near
										---------
Honolulu, this 40-acre parcel of light industrial zoned land was acquired in
November 1998 for 8 million. All major entitlements had been secured for
development of the property, and 80 of the improvements had been completed for
the development of the first 17 acres. This two-phase project consists of 23
subdivided lots ready for sale in the first phase, a three-acre park expansion
area, and an additional 20 acres remaining for future subdivision in the second
phase. Construction commenced in November to complete the roadway improvements
for the sale of the lots within the first phase. Sales activities commenced in
December 1998.

 Overall occupancy for the Hawaii improved commercial and
industrial properties owned by A&B and its subsidiaries averaged 68 in 1998,
compared with 78 in 1997. The lower occupancy level reflects the addition of
new properties having large amounts of untenanted space, the retenanting of a
major retail unit, and the continuing weak Hawaii economy. In particular, on
Maui, the addition of the large amounts of new retail space which slowed
absorption and depressed average rents in 1998 is expected to continue to
challenge this market in 1999. A&B is continuing its program to upgrade its
Hawaii properties, as demonstrated by the completion in 1998 of major reno-
vation to the interior of the Kahului Office Building and the planned
repositioning of the Maui Mall in order to complement the addition of a twelve-
screen movie theater to the property.

 (b) U.S. MAINLAND COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES
 ----------------------------------------------

 On the U.S. Mainland, A&B and its subsidiaries own a port-
folio of commercial and industrial properties, acquired primarily by way of
tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, as
amended ("IRC"), comprising a total of approximately 2.72 million square feet
of leasable area, as follows:

 TOTAL: 2,721,000

A&B took advantage of the strong real estate market in
California's Silicon Valley area by selling Ridgeview Court, a 246,000-square-
foot office/research facility located in Cupertino, CA, in June 1998 for
 51.5 million. Proceeds from this sale, together with proceeds from the sale
of other Mainland and Hawaii land parcels, were invested in six Mainland
properties by way of IRC 1031 and 1033 exchanges. Three of these properties
were acquired in San Antonio, TX: San Pedro Plaza, Northwest Business Center,
and Arbor Park. The other three acquisitions consisted of two office buildings
in Sacramento, CA (2868 Prospect Park and 2450 Venture Oaks), and an office
building in Phoenix, AZ (Southbank II), marking A&B's entry into these markets.
These office buildings are well positioned to realize the benefits of the
above-average population and business growth that is expected to occur in these
metropolitan areas over the next several years.

 A&B's Seattle area properties continued to benefit from the
strength of the Pacific Northwest's economy. The 4225 Roosevelt Building and
the Valley Freeway Corporate Park warehouse complex maintained 100 occupancy,
while demand for retail space on Bainbridge Island, a suburb of Seattle,
enabled A&B to construct an 8,400-square-foot retail building next to its
existing Island Village shopping center. A&B has listed the 4225 Roosevelt
Building for sale, after securing a five-year lease extension for a major
tenant occupying 20 of the property.

 In Texas, A&B sold Woodlands IV and V in October 1998, two
service center/warehouse properties that were part of its Great Southwest
Industrial portfolio. Proceeds from this sale were reinvested in accordance
with IRC Section 1031. The remaining properties in the Great Southwest
Industrial portfolio continued to perform well, despite increased competition
from new construction. As described above, A&B entered the San Antonio, TX
market in 1998 with the purchase of three properties. These properties all
maintained occupancy in excess of 90 , reflecting this market's strong demand.

 In Reno, NV, A&B entered into an agreement with Costco
Wholesale Corporation, an anchor store at Airport Square, which enabled Costco
Wholesale Corporation to expand its store and thereby enhance this retail
shopping center's presence in the Reno market. Despite a large increase in
retail space in Reno, Airport Square's excellent location and strong anchor
stores enabled achievement of a 99 occupancy rate.

 The U.S. Mainland leased property portfolio had an average
overall occupancy rate of 91 , as compared with 98 for the prior year, due to
the vacancy of two large warehouse spaces in City of Industry, CA and Dallas,
TX. The City of Industry property is now fully leased.

 C. FOOD PRODUCTS
 -------------

 (1) PRODUCTION
						----------

 A&B has been engaged in activities relating to the production
of cane sugar and molasses in Hawaii since 1870. A&B's food products opera-
tions are conducted by ABHI. ABHI operates a sugar plantation on the island of
Maui, through its Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company ("HC&S") division, and a
coffee farm on the island of Kauai, through its Kauai Coffee Company, Inc.
("Kauai Coffee") subsidiary.

 HC&S is Hawaii's largest producer of raw sugar, producing
216,188 tons of raw sugar in 1998, or 61 of the raw sugar produced in Hawaii,
compared with 198,037 tons of raw sugar in 1997. Total Hawaii sugar pro-
duction, in turn, amounted to approximately five percent of total United States
sugar production. HC&S harvested 17,210 acres of sugar cane in 1998, compared
with 17,005 acres in 1997. Yields averaged 12.7 tons of sugar per acre in
1998, compared with 11.6 tons per acre in 1997, due to changes in farming and
factory practices. The average cost per ton of sugar produced at HC&S,
including the cost of power production, was 373.89 in 1998, compared with
 446.92 in 1997. The decrease in cost per ton is attributable to the nine
percent increase in sugar production and to aggressive cost reduction efforts,
including personnel reductions, that had been initiated in January 1998. As a
by-product of sugar production, HC&S also produced 80,915 tons of molasses in
1998, compared with 77,960 tons in 1997.

 During 1998, Kauai Coffee had approximately 3,800 acres of
coffee trees under cultivation. The harvest of the 1998 coffee crop is
expected to yield approximately 4.0 million pounds of green coffee, compared
with 4.7 million pounds in 1997. The reduction is attributable to fewer acres
harvested, due to pruning and to the natural cyclicality of coffee yields.

 HC&S and McBryde Sugar Company, Limited ("McBryde"), the
parent company of Kauai Coffee, produce electricity for internal use and for
sale to the local electric utility companies. HC&S's power is produced by
burning bagasse (sugarcane fiber), by hydroelectric power generation and, when
necessary, by burning fossil fuels, whereas McBryde produces power solely by
hydroelectric generation. The price for the power sold by HC&S and McBryde is
equal to the utility companies' "avoided cost" of not producing such power
themselves. In addition, HC&S receives a capacity payment to provide a
guaranteed power generation capacity to the local utility. In 1998, HC&S sold
72,589 megawatt hours ("MWH") of electric power, and McBryde sold 21,975 MWH.
Revenue from the sale of electricity depends on the amount of power produced
and sold, as well as the average price of fuel. (See "Energy" below.)

 Kahului Trucking & Storage, Inc., a subsidiary of ABHI,
provides sugar and molasses hauling and storage, petroleum hauling, mobile
equipment maintenance and repair services, and self-service storage facilities
on Maui. Kauai Commercial Company, Incorporated, another subsidiary of ABHI,
provides similar services on Kauai, as well as general trucking services. 

 (2) SUGAR REFINING; MARKETING OF SUGAR AND COFFEE
 ---------------------------------------------

 Virtually all of the raw sugar produced in Hawaii is pur-
chased, refined and marketed by California and Hawaiian Sugar Company, Inc.
("C&H"). C&H processes the raw cane sugar into a full line of refined sugar
products for the grocery market, and a full range of industrial refined sugar
products for industrial bakers, confectioners and food processors. C&H is the
leading sugar brand in the western United States. Marketing of C&H's refined
products is conducted by C&H's sales staff and a network of brokers under
exclusive representation agreements. The refined products are marketed
primarily in the western and central United States.

 C&H's profit margins declined in 1998 as a result of lower
selling prices driven by the large 1997/1998 beet sugar crop. The larger crop
created an intense period of price competition among beet processors in late
1997, which affected the performance of C&H in 1998. Consumer sugar sales are
seasonal in nature and, as a result, C&H's financial results are expected to be
better in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year, compared with the
first two quarters.

 C&H has a ten-year supply contract, ending in 2003, with
Hawaiian Sugar & Transportation Cooperative ("HS&TC"), a cooperative consisting
of the three major sugarcane growers in Hawaii (including HC&S), pursuant to
which the growers sell their raw sugar to C&H at a price equal to the No. 14
Contract settlement price, less a discount and less costs of sugar vessel
discharge and stevedoring. This price becomes a cost to C&H and, after
deducting the marketing, operating, distribution, transportation and interest
costs of HS&TC, reflects the gross revenue to the Hawaii sugar growers,
including HC&S. The No. 14 price is established by, among other things, the
supply of and demand for all forms of domestically-produced sweeteners,
government policies regarding the U.S. sugar import quota, and potential
changes in international trade programs which might affect the U.S. sugar
program. There are no minimum supply guarantees on the part of HS&TC. 
During 1998, the supply contract with HS&TC provided approximately 50 of the
raw sugar used by C&H.

 On December 24, 1998, A&B completed the recapitalization and
partial sale of approximately 60 percent of the equity interest in C&H to an
investor group that included Citicorp Venture Capital, Ltd. The transaction
will permit A&B to focus better on its core businesses. Beginning in 1999, the
results of A&B's remaining equity investment in C&H will be reported in A&B's
financial statements as an investment in an affiliate.

 At Kauai Coffee, coffee marketing efforts currently are being
directed toward developing a market for premium-priced, estate-grown Kauai
green coffee. Most of the 1998 coffee crop is being marketed on the U.S.
Mainland and in Asia as green (unroasted) coffee. In addition to the sale of
green coffee, Kauai Coffee produces and sells a roasted, packaged coffee
product in Hawaii under the "Kauai Coffee" trademark.

 (3) COMPETITION AND SUGAR LEGISLATION
 ---------------------------------

 Hawaii sugar growers produce more sugar per acre than other
major producing areas of the world, but that advantage is partially offset by
Hawaii's high labor costs and the distance to the U.S. Mainland market. C&H's
refined sugar is marketed primarily west of Chicago. This is also the largest
beet sugar growing and processing area and, as a result, the only market area
in the United States which produces more sugar than it consumes. Sugar from
sugar beets is the greatest source of competition for C&H.

 The overall U.S. sweetener market continues to grow. In
1998, domestic consumption of caloric sweeteners comprised the following:

Refined sugar . . . . . . . 43 
 High fructose corn syrup. . 40 
 Other corn sweeteners . . . 16 
 Other . . . . . . . . . . . 1 
 ----
 TOTAL 100 
														 ====

The use of non-caloric (artificial) sweeteners accounts for a relatively small
percentage of the domestic sweetener market. Although the use of high fructose
corn syrup and artificial sweeteners is expected to continue to grow, such in-
creased use is not expected to affect sugar markets significantly in the near
future.

 Worldwide, most sugar is consumed in the country of origin.
Only about a quarter of world sugar is involved in international trade. A much
smaller amount is traded at the world sugar market price (the other sugar
involved in international trade is traded at negotiated prices under bilateral
trade agreements). Due to protective legislation, raw cane sugar prices in the
U.S. generally are substantially higher than the world price, and the amount of
foreign sugar allowed into the U.S. under import quotas is regulated by the
U.S. government. Such foreign sugar sells at U.S. domestic prices. As a
result, the world sugar price does not have material relevance to U.S. sugar
producers and refiners.

 The U.S. Congress historically has sought, through legisla-
tion, to assure a reliable domestic supply of sugar at stable and reasonable
prices. Congress's most recent renewal of protective legislation for domestic
sugar, the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act (the "1996 Act"),
provides a sugar loan program for the 1996 through 2002 crops, with a loan rate
(support price) of 18 cents per pound for raw sugar. When the import quota is
1.5 million tons or less, the loans are recourse, meaning the producer is
liable for any losses the government incurs in remarketing any sugar forfeited
by the producer. When the import quota is greater than 1.5 million tons, the
loans are non-recourse, but in the event of forfeiture the producer must pay a
one-cent-per-pound penalty for the sugar forfeited to the government. The 1996
Act also eliminated marketing allotments, thereby removing the means of
limiting domestic production. The 1.25-million-ton minimum import quota set
under the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade ("GATT") is retained in the
1996 Act. 
 The loan rate represents the value of sugar given as
collateral for government price-support loans. The government is required to
administer the sugar program at no net cost, and this is accomplished by
adjusting fees and quotas for imported sugar to maintain the domestic price
at a level that discourages producers from defaulting on loans. The target
price established by the government is known as the market stabilization price
and is based on the loan rate plus transportation costs, interest and an
incentive factor. The market stabilization price was 21.8 cents per pound in
1988-89 and 21.9 cents per pound in 1990-91. No market stabilization price
has been announced since 1990-91. The actual U.S. domestic raw sugar price
(measured by the closing price of the quoted spot contract) averaged 22.07
cents per pound in 1998, compared with 21.94 cents per pound in 1997. A
chronological chart of the average U.S. domestic raw sugar prices, based on
the average daily New York Contract #14 price for domestic raw sugar, is shown
below:

Liberalized international trade agreements, such as the GATT,
include provisions relating to agriculture, but these agreements will not
affect the U.S. sugar or sweetener industries materially. A "side" agreement
that modified the North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA") alleviated some
of the cane refiners' and sugar producers' concerns over NAFTA provisions which
could have allowed Mexico to export large quantities of sugar to the U.S.
starting in three years. Under the side agreement, if Mexico is projected to
be a net surplus producer of sugar, i.e., its production of sugar is expected
to exceed its consumption of both sugar and high fructose corn syrup, then it
is limited to 25,000 tons of sugar exports, in any form, to the U.S. This
export ceiling increases to 250,000 tons of sugar in the year 2000, and is
eliminated in the year 2007.

 (4) PROPERTIES AND WATER
 --------------------

 C&H's refining operations are located at Crockett,
California. The Crockett refinery is one of the largest in the world, and is
the only cane sugar refinery on the U.S. West Coast. It is ideally located
next to a deep-water port, a major rail line and an interstate highway. The
refinery and administrative offices occupy a complex of buildings that contains
approximately 1,310,000 square feet and is located on approximately 55 acres.
C&H leases approximately 42 acres from the California State Lands Commission
under long-term ground leases, and owns the remaining area. The Lease
Agreement with the State of California covering the main refinery and wharf
facilities expires in 2022, and the Lease Agreement covering the area where the
secondary wastewater treatment facility is located expires in 2024.

 The HC&S sugar plantation, the largest in Hawaii, consists of
approximately 43,300 acres of land, including 2,000 acres leased from the State
of Hawaii and 1,300 acres under lease from private parties. Approximately
36,900 acres are under cultivation, and the balance either is used for
contributory purposes, such as roads and plant sites, or is not suitable for
cultivation.

 McBryde owns approximately 9,500 acres of land on Kauai, of
which approximately 2,400 acres are used for watershed and other conservation
uses, approximately 3,900 acres are used by Kauai Coffee, and the remaining
acreage is leased to various agriculture enterprises for cultivation of a
variety of crops and for pasturage.

 Large quantities of water are necessary to grow sugar cane
and coffee. Because of the importance of water, access to water, reliable
sources of supply and efficient irrigation systems are crucial for the
successful growing of sugar cane and coffee. A&B's plantations use a "drip"
irrigation system that distributes water to the roots through small holes in
plastic tubes. Except for 55 acres expected to be converted to drip irriga-
tion by June 1999, all of the cultivated cane land owned by HC&S, a total of
34,378 acres, currently is drip irrigated. All of Kauai Coffee's fields are
drip irrigated.

 ABHI owns 16,000 acres of watershed lands on Maui which
supply a portion of the irrigation water used by HC&S. ABHI also held four
water licenses to 38,000 acres owned by the State of Hawaii, which over the
years supplied approximately one-third of the irrigation water used by HC&S.
The last of these water license agreements expired in 1986, and all four
agreements have been extended as revocable permits that are renewable
annually. The State Board of Land and Natural Resources has indicated its
intention to replace these four permits with long-term licenses. The issuance
of such licenses currently is pending a hearing before the Board.

D. EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS
				-----------------------------

 As of December 31, 1998, A&B and its subsidiaries had approximately
2,331 regular full-time employees (this figure does not include C&H's regular
full-time employees, who numbered 547 as of December 24, 1998, when a majority
of the equity interest in C&H was sold). About 1,009 regular full-time
employees were engaged in the growing of sugar cane and coffee and the
production of raw sugar and green coffee, 1,096 were engaged in ocean trans-
portation, 37 were engaged in property development and management, and the
balance was in administration and miscellaneous operations. Approximately 55 
were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions.

 As of December 31, 1998, Matson and its subsidiaries had approxi-
mately 1,096 regular full-time employees, 289 seagoing employees and 339 casual
employees. Approximately 37 of the regular full-time employees, all of the
seagoing employees and all of the casual employees were covered by collective
bargaining agreements. The casual employees are U.S. Pacific Coast longshore
workers who are employed through hiring halls and are not full-time employees
of either Matson or Matson Terminals.

 Bargaining unit employees of Matson and Matson Terminals, other
than seagoing employees, are represented by 10 different unions, and Matson and
Matson Terminals are parties to 95 separate collective bargaining agreements.
Matson's seagoing employees are represented by six unions. Matson and Matson
Terminals are members of the Pacific Maritime Association ("PMA"), and Matson
Terminals also is a member of the Hawaii Stevedoring Industry Committee and the
Hawaii Employers Council, through which organizations various collective
bargaining agreements are negotiated. Matson also is a member of the Maritime
Service Committee ("MSC"), which engages in collective bargaining with three
unions representing licensed deck, engineer, and radio officers for Matson
vessels.

 Historically, collective bargaining with the longshore and seagoing
unions has been complex and difficult. However, Matson and Matson Terminals
consider their respective relations with the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union ("ILWU"), other unions, and their non-union employees generally
to be satisfactory.

 During 1998, collective bargaining agreements with the American
Radio Association, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America
in Oakland, and the ILWU Office Clerical union in Los Angeles were renewed for
2-year, 3-year, and 3-year terms, respectively. Collective bargaining
agreements with the ILWU on the U.S. Pacific Coast, ILWU longshore workers in
Hawaii, ILWU clerical bargaining units in Honolulu and Oakland, and the three
unions representing unlicensed crew members are expected to be renewed in 1999
without service interruption.

 In January 1997, the Acting Regional Director of the National Labor
Relations Board ("NLRB"), in response to the ILWU's petition requesting that it
be certified as the bargaining agent for employees who plan and supervise the
loading of ships at Seattle, ruled that these Seattle employees are supervisors
who are not subject to the National Labor Relations Act. The union's appeal of
that ruling to the NLRB in Washington, D.C. is pending.

 Matson contributed during 1998 to multi-employer pension plans for
vessel crews. If Matson were to withdraw from or significantly reduce its
obligation to contribute to one of the plans, Matson would review and evaluate
data, actuarial assumptions, calculations and other factors used in determining
its withdrawal liability, if any, and, in the event of material disagreement
with such determination, would pursue the various means available to it under
federal law for the adjustment or removal of its withdrawal liability. Matson
Terminals participates in a multi-employer pension plan for its Hawaii long-
shore employees. For a discussion of withdrawal liabilities under the Hawaii
longshore and seagoing plans, see Note 6 to A&B's financial statements on
pages 34 and 35 of the 1998 Annual Report, which Note is incorporated herein by
reference.

 Matson pays, through Matson Terminals on the basis of cargo tons
carried, and Matson Terminals contributes as a direct employer, to a
multi-employer pension plan for Pacific Coast longshore workers. Under special
withdrawal liability rules in the plan, Matson Terminals could cease United
States Pacific Coast cargo handling operations permanently and stop making
contributions to the plan, without any withdrawal liability.

 Bargaining unit employees of HC&S are covered by two collective
bargaining agreements with the ILWU. These agreements have been renegotiated
and expire January 31, 2000. The collective bargaining agreements covering the
three ILWU bargaining units at Kahului Trucking & Storage, Inc. have been
renegotiated, with two expiring June 30, 1999 and the third expiring March 31,
2000. The two collective bargaining agreements with Kauai Commercial Company,
Incorporated employees represented by the ILWU were renegotiated in 1998 and
will expire April 30, 2001. The collective bargaining agreement with the ILWU
for the production unit employees of Kauai Coffee has been renegotiated and
will expire on December 31, 1999.

 The bargaining unit employees of C&H at Crockett, California are
represented by the Sugar Workers Union and the ILWU. Contracts covering these
employees have been renegotiated and expire May 31, 2003.

 E. ENERGY
 ------

 Matson and Matson Terminals purchase residual fuel oil, lubricants,
gasoline and diesel fuel for their operations. Residual fuel oil is by far
Matson's largest energy-related expense. In 1998, Matson vessels consumed
approximately 2.0 million barrels of residual fuel oil, compared with
2.8 million barrels in 1997.

 Residual fuel oil prices paid by Matson started 1998 at 101.50 per
metric ton and ended the year at 68.88 per metric ton. A high of 101.50 per
metric ton occurred in January, and a low of 55.00 per metric ton occurred in
March. Sufficient fuel for Matson's requirements is expected to be available
in 1999.

 As has been the practice with sugar plantations throughout Hawaii,
HC&S uses bagasse, the residual fiber of the sugarcane plant, as a fuel to
generate steam for the production of most of the electrical power for sugar
milling and irrigation pumping operations. In addition to bagasse, supple-
mental fuel is required to produce power, principally for pumping irrigation
water during the factory shutdown period when bagasse is not being produced.
No. 6 (heavy) oil and coal are the primary supplemental fuels used by HC&S.
Since 1992, when suppliers of oil to HC&S discontinued regular heavy oil
shipments as a result of unlimited liability concerns arising from federal and
state environmental laws, heavy oil has been provided to HC&S on a space-
available basis. In 1998, HC&S produced 203,755 MWH of electric power and sold
72,589 MWH, compared with 228,279 MWH produced and 85,680 MWH sold in 1997.
The reduction in power production was due to the failure of a turbogenerator in
1998. HC&S's oil use decreased to 155,966 barrels in 1998 from the 215,389
barrels used in 1997. Coal use for power generation also decreased, from
50,946 short tons in 1997 to 43,614 short tons in 1998. The decreased use of
oil and coal was due primarily to an improvement in the quality (in terms of
fuel value) of the bagasse and a decrease in the steam energy requirements for
raw sugar production.

 In 1998, McBryde produced 34,400 MWH of hydroelectric power,
compared with 34,676 MWH of hydroelectric power produced in 1997. Power sales
in 1998 amounted to 21,975 MWH, compared with 23,712 MWH sold in 1997.

 C&H relies primarily on steam to power its Crockett refinery.
Natural gas and electricity also are used, to a lesser extent, for refinery
operations. C&H obtains its steam from a 240 MW cogeneration plant, located
adjacent to its refinery, that was placed into operation by a third party in
May 1996. Pursuant to an agreement between C&H and the third party that
expires in 2026, C&H purchases the steam at prices that reflect a discount to
the prevailing market price for natural gas, thereby reducing C&H's total
energy costs. In 1998, C&H purchased 24,833,949 therms of steam from the
cogeneration plant, compared with 23,654,519 therms of steam in 1997.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
- --------------------------

 See "Business and Properties - Ocean Transportation - Rate Regulation"
above for a discussion of rate and other regulatory matters in which Matson is
routinely involved.

 In February 1992, Pan Ocean Shipping Co., Ltd. ("Pan Ocean") served on
Matson an amended complaint alleging that a Matson vessel negligently dis-
charged contaminated ballast water into Los Angeles harbor on January 9, 1991.
In that amended complaint, Pan Ocean sought contribution and indemnification
for the in-harbor clean-up charges it had incurred as the result of a fuel oil
discharge into Los Angeles harbor on January 8, 1991 from a vessel which it
owned and operated. In January 1999, the parties settled the matter for an
amount covered by insurance.

 On September 14, 1998, Matson was served with a complaint filed with the
Surface Transportation Board, alleging that Sea-Land Services, Inc., American
President Lines, Ltd. and Matson charged unreasonable rates in the Guam trade
from January 1991 to the present. Matson did not enter the trade until
February of 1996. Matson has filed an answer to the complaint denying that its
rates have been unreasonable, and it intends to defend vigorously against the
charges in the complaint.

 A&B and its subsidiaries are parties to, or may be contingently liable in
connection with, other legal actions arising in the normal conduct of their
businesses, the outcomes of which, in the opinion of management after consulta-
tion with counsel, would not have a material adverse effect on A&B's financial
position.

 At February 12, 1999, there were 5,088 record holders of A&B common
stock. In addition, Cede & Co., which appears as a single record holder,

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
- --------------------------------

 Information for the years 1988 through 1998 is contained in the
comparative table captioned "Eleven-Year Summary of Selected Financial Data" on

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 ---------------------

 A&B's financial statements, including the results of operations discussed
herein, are based on the historical-cost method of accounting, in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. If estimated current costs of
property and inventory were applied to reflect the effects of inflation on
A&B's businesses, total assets would be higher and net income lower than shown
by the historical-cost financial statements. Additional information regarding
the fair values of A&B's assets and liabilities is included in Notes 1, 2, and
5 on pages 31 through 34 of the 1998 Annual Report, which Notes are incorpora-
ted herein by reference.

 Additional information applicable to this Item 7 is contained in the
section captioned "Management's Discussion and Analysis" on pages 22 through 25
of the 1998 Annual Report, which section is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
- --------------------------------------------------------------------

 A&B, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the risks
associated with fluctuations in the market value of certain financial
instruments. A&B maintains a portfolio of marketable equity securities
available for sale, a preferred stock investment in an affiliated company, and
an investment in mortgage-backed securities. Details regarding these financial
instruments are described in Notes 2 and 5 on pages 32 through 34 of the 1998
Annual Report, which Notes are incorporated herein by reference. A&B believes
that, as of December 31, 1998, its exposure to market risk fluctuations for
these financial instruments is not material.

 A&B also is exposed to changes in U.S. interest rates, primarily as a
result of its borrowing and investing activities used to maintain liquidity and
to fund business operations. In order to manage its exposure to changes in
interest rates, A&B utilizes a balanced mix of debt maturities, along with both
fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. A&B does not hedge its interest rate
exposure. The nature and amount of A&B's long-term and short-term debt can be
expected to fluctuate as a result of future business requirements, market
conditions and other factors. The following table summarizes A&B's debt
obligations at December 31, 1998, presenting principal cash flows and related
interest rates by expected fiscal year of maturity. Variable interest rates
represent the weighted-average rates of the portfolio at December 31, 1998.
A&B estimates that the carrying value of its debt is not materially different
from its fair value. The information presented below should be read in
conjunction with Note 7 on page 37 of the 1998 Annual Report, which Note is
incorporated herein by reference.

A&B's sugar plantation, HC&S, has a contract to sell its raw sugar
production to HS&TC until 2003. Under that contract, the price paid will
fluctuate with the #14 Contract settlement price for domestic raw sugar, less a
fixed discount rate. A&B is not exposed to foreign currency exchange rate
risk.

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS
Alexander & Baldwin's earnings for 1998 can be summarized in one word -
disappointing. Before discussing 1998, let us assure you that we
are taking actions to improve earnings in 1999 and in future years. A&B has
great potential, and we are committed to realizing it.

1998 PERFORMANCE - The 1998 earnings results should be placed in context.
Before one-time items, earnings per share amounted to 1.33, which was
13-percent below the 1.53 earned in 1997. There was a one-time gain of 28
cents per share in 1997 from an insurance settlement. In 1998, there were
three one-time charges that totaled 77 cents per share. These charges included
the loss on the partial sale of California and Hawaiian Sugar Company, our
sugarcane refiner; the write-down of a real estate project; and the recognition
of a liability for future workers' compensation assessments as a result of a
new accounting directive. But, to reiterate the major issue, earnings from our
core operating businesses did decline 13 percent in 1998.

Matson, which comprises the ocean transportation segment of the Company,
experienced an 18-percent decrease in profit, again excluding one-time items.
The decrease was due to the continued weakness of Hawaii's economy, along with
stiffer competition. The food products segment dropped 21 percent from 1997,
principally because of reduced profitability at C&H. Partially offsetting these
two negatives was a strong 17-percent improvement in our property development
and management business, and a much better performance in the agricultural
portion of our food products segment.

BUSINESS DIRECTION

OCEAN TRANSPORTATION - The first and foremost priority is to increase Matson's
profit. Matson must become more cost-competitive. We took a major step in this
direction last fall by reducing the number of ships serving the Hawaii trade.
Matson has retained its leading position in the Hawaii trade even after cutting
costs by eliminating excess capacity. But this action, in and of itself, is not
sufficient to return Matson to an acceptable level of performance. Other
actions, large and small, either are under way or are under consideration.

SALE OF C&H - As 1998 ended, we accomplished the recapitalization of C&H and
sold a 60-percent equity interest to an investor group that included Citicorp
Venture Capital, Ltd. Divesting a majority interest in C&H was a significant
step, because we will be able to concentrate now on developing more productive
uses for A&B's capital.

[Photo Caption: Maui Marketplace is the retail anchor of A&B's Maui
Business Park development. Ultimately, Maui Business Park will comprise nearly
240 acres. Development of this well-located project still is at an early stage.
To date, a 42-acre portion of the first phase has been completed.]

Among the challenges faced by the Company during 1998 was the announcement in
late July that its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, John C.
Couch, was taking a medical leave of absence. At the request of the A&B Board
of Directors, R. J. Pfeiffer accepted the appointment as A&B Chairman of the
Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Pfeiffer previously served as
Chairman at A&B from 1980 to 1995. During the late '70s, the '80s, and early
'90s, Mr. Pfeiffer also served as A&B's President and Chief Executive Officer.
Subsequently, on October 22, 1998, the Board appointed W. Allen Doane President
and Chief Executive Officer, with Mr. Pfeiffer remaining as Chairman of the
Board. At the time of publication of this report, Mr. Couch continues his
treatment.

REAL ESTATE - Our property development and management business continues to
perform strongly in spite of extremely weak conditions in the Hawaii real
estate market. The majority of A&B Properties' earnings are still derived from
Hawaii, and we are pleased with how well this business has performed year-in
and year-out for more than a decade. In 1998, there were 82 million of
property sales and 97 million of acquisitions. These acquisitions comprised
seven properties on the Mainland and in Hawaii. The challenge here is to take
a strong business and to grow it more aggressively. We made progress in this
direction during 1998, and plan continued growth for 1999.

REAL ESTATE ENTITLEMENTS - The Company owns over 90,000 acres in Hawaii. We are
working to increase the value of these substantial holdings by moving land
through Hawaii's complex entitlement process. Note that the Company's Hawaii
landholdings are recorded on the balance sheet at historical cost, which
averages approximately 150 an acre. From the standpoint of potential value
creation, our Maui landholdings of 69,000 acres could not be located better.
Ranked as the number one island travel destination in the world, Maui has a
bright future. We are accelerating our efforts to realize increased value from
the Company's landholdings. Nearly 3,000 acres in Hawaii either are fully
entitled and available for development, or proceeding through the entitlement
process.

AGRIBUSINESS - Recovering from a difficult 1997, Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar
Company, our sugar-growing business on Maui, was able to increase its yields
significantly and lower its unit production costs. This success increases our
confidence that HC&S indeed will have a long-term future as a grower of sugar
cane.

FUTURE VALUE - A&B possesses a number of inherent strengths that we can use to
build future value.

OCEAN TRANSPORTATION - Matson has a strong and stable market position in Hawaii
as a result of its excellent service. Matson carries more than two-thirds of
Hawaii's freight. Its shipping network is almost irreplaceable. The current
economic malaise in Hawaii, however, makes it imperative for Matson to reduce
its cost structure.

REAL ESTATE - Property Development and Management has provided a highly
reliable source of earnings, despite Hawaii's economic problems. There is a
good ability to grow the business and to continue to capitalize on the
Company's highly valuable Hawaii landholdings.

FINANCIAL POSITION - Our financial position is favorable, with a
debt-to-capital ratio of 33 percent and consistently positive free cash flow.
The key will be finding investment opportunities, especially in real estate,
that provide assurance of returns above A&B's cost of capital. We are committed
to making such capital allocations in the interest of our shareholders.

HAWAII - The state and its economy are at a low ebb--a condition compounded by
the recent financial problems in Asia. While no immediate turnaround is
expected, ultimately, we expect that the economy will recover, and A&B's
businesses will benefit as a result.

During 1998, A&B was able to increase its dividend modestly, from 88 cents per
share to 90 cents, and to repurchase almost one million shares of A&B stock.
Seventy percent of these shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 1998.

While work continues on the long-term issues, management recognizes that
improvement in performance must be demonstrated in the short term. 1999 will be
a start. As noted at the beginning of this letter, we are committed to taking
the necessary operating and strategic actions to realize the Company's
potential. We cannot wait for the Hawaii economy to improve. When it does,
though, it only will add to the benefits realized from actions the Company
already is taking to improve earnings. We will keep you informed of our
progress.

A&B has employees who are extraordinarily capable, talented and dedicated to
our Company's success. We are convinced that, as a team, we have the
capability to achieve at a much higher level. Going forward, we are confident
that the Company's goals will be realized.

The Board of Directors deserves special acknowledgment this year for its active
and valued role in helping A&B deal with the many challenges it faced. We
extend a warm welcome to Lynn M. Sedway, the newest independent member of the
Board. Her broad experience has added to the Board's strength. We continue to
wish John Couch well on his extended medical leave. We are pleased to report
that his health has improved, and that the prospects for his recovery remain
good. 

Finally, we thank you, our shareholders, for your continuing commitment to and
belief in A&B.

Chairman of the Board President and Chief Executive Officer

REAL ESTATE

A&B strives to put its land to the highest and best use that is consistent with
community needs. At year-end 1998, the Company owned a total of about 93,000
acres. Of these, about 1,380 acres were fully zoned for urban use. At least one
step in the value-adding entitlement process has been completed for an
additional 1,600 acres, and about 8,900 acres have long-term urban-use
potential. Most of the remaining acreage will be in agricultural use for many
years.

ENTITLEMENTS - In March 1998, the Maui County Council gave final approval to an
update of the community plan for the Kihei-Makena region. Included in the
update were 650 acres of A&B-owned land at Maalaea designated as a master-
planned community. In 1999, the Company will seek approval to have approxi-
mately 170 acres included in the Wailuku-Kahului Community Plan as light
industrial/commercial property. It also will seek approval for other properties
to be included under residential and industrial designations.

In October 1998, the State Land Use Commission granted an urban designation to
a 200-unit single-family subdivision on 45 acres at Haliimaile, Maui.
Subsequently, an application for the appropriate zoning change was filed with
the County. A Land Use Commission decision is expected in 1999 on a proposal
for 400 residential units on 110 acres at Spreckelsville, Maui.

Plans to lengthen the runway of Maui's principal airport advanced during 1998,
with approval by the Governor and federal authorities of environmental filings.
The airport is in the immediate vicinity of A&B's Maui Business Park develop-
ment, and is near several other Company landholdings.

The State Land Use Commission also gave an urban designation to an additional
77 acres of A&B's 1,045-acre Kukui'Ula development on Kauai. The project's
urban lands now total 837 acres. This 77-acre portion of the project is
proposed for hotel and time-share development.

SALES AND DEVELOPMENT - In June 1998, the Company sold a 246,000-square-foot
research and office complex in Cupertino, Calif. The proceeds from this large
sale were combined with proceeds from other property sales and reinvested, on a
tax-deferred basis, in a total of six income-producing properties. The six
properties comprised 776,200 square feet of leasable space and were purchased
for 89 million.

A&B also acquired a 40-acre, industrial property on Oahu in November 1998 for
 8 million. Construction of the first 23 lots at this property - the Mill Town
Center - commenced in November 1998. Lot sales began early in the first quarter
of 1999.

At A&B's Maui Business Park, the developer of the 300,000-square-foot Maui
Marketplace Shopping Center purchased the remaining fee interest in the land
underlying the Marketplace in mid-1998. Another large lot nearby was sold
earlier in the year. The 19 remaining lots in phase IA of Maui Business Park,
totaling about 10 net salable acres, continue to be marketed actively.

On Maui, grading, roads and utility installations were completed in May 1998
for Haiku Makai, a 28-lot agricultural subdivision. Haiku Makai enjoyed rapid
sales. Twenty-five of the 28 lots in the project were sold between May and
year-end, at an average sales price of 201,000 per lot. In the 92-lot Ku'au
Bayview single-family development, 84 of the homes had been sold by year-end
1998. The 19 sales in 1998 averaged 240,000 per unit. At the Kahului Ikena
condominium project, 82 of 102 units have been sold. The prices of the 13 units
sold in 1998 averaged 139,000 per unit.

On Kauai, construction began in August 1998 at Koloa Estates, the initial
residential project at Kukui'Ula. There are 30 residential lots and two church
sites in the 28-acre project. Sales are scheduled to begin in May 1999.

PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

MAINLAND PORTFOLIO - At year-end 1998, A&B's portfolio of 16 properties in six
Western states consisted of 2.7 million square feet of leasable space.
Occupancies averaged 91 percent throughout 1998.

HAWAII PORTFOLIO - The Hawaii commercial-property portfolio consisted of
839,000 square feet of leasable space, plus ground leases of 286 acres for
commercial uses and 11,600 acres for agricultural uses. During 1998, lease
rates continued to be very competitive, due to the lackluster Hawaii economy.
Occupancy of the commercial properties averaged 68 percent.

PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT & MANAGEMENT

OUTLOOK - Operating profit from property leasing is forecast to improve in
1999, primarily due to the new leased properties added during 1998. Residential
and commercial developments likely will continue to sell steadily, but slowly,
in 1999. Sales of developed properties deemed to be fully valued also will
continue. The Company will consider accelerating the development of Maui
Business Park in response to interest in potential multi-lot projects at phases
IA and IB of the development. The Company also will continue to pursue
entitlements of land-holdings as well as investment opportunities in income and
development properties.

TRANSPORTATION

HAWAII SERVICE - The core business of Matson Navigation Company, Inc. (Matson)
is its Hawaii service. Last year was the eighth consecutive year of slow
economic growth in Hawaii. During this period, marked declines have occurred in
certain industries - construction foremost among them - that normally provide
Matson with substantial volume. Matson's cargo volume declined in 1998 because
of this economic weakness, and also because of increased competition,
especially from a barge competitor that operated temporarily during the
seasonal peak period for movements of household goods.

To match fleet capacity with cargo volume better, Matson implemented a major
service change in mid-September 1998, reducing the number of vessels serving
Hawaii from eight to six. The change was intended to cut costs without a
corresponding reduction in service quality. Although the number of vessel
arrivals in Honolulu has been reduced from four per week to three, Matson
still has 156 Hawaii round-trip voyages per year - 50 percent more than its
closest competitor. 

In recognition of the weak economic conditions in Hawaii, Matson did not take
an across-the-board increase in its Hawaii service rates during 1998. Also,
as bunker fuel prices moderated, an existing fuel surcharge was reduced from
1.75 percent to 1.5 percent, effective January 15, 1998. It was reduced again
to 1.0 percent, effective March 15, and then was eliminated on September 6.

In mid-December 1998, the Company announced that it would increase rates by 2.5
percent, effective February 14, 1999, in order to offset cost increases and to
support necessary capital investments. 

GUAM SERVICE - Matson and American President Lines, Ltd. (APL) renegotiated the
terms of their transpacific operating alliance late in 1997, and implemented
the resulting new vessel schedules in January 1998. The new alliance agreement
produced the benefits projected for both Matson and APL, and also resulted in
better service to Guam customers. Matson now offers the only direct service
from the U.S. mainland to Guam, with transit times reduced from 13 to 10 days.

During 1998, Guam's economic growth continued to moderate, affected by many of
the same Asian economic factors that affected Hawaii. Although construction
activity benefited from rebuilding after Typhoon Paka, which struck Guam in
December 1997, the overall amount of cargo declined somewhat in 1998.

[Photo caption: Trade growth and solid customer service have combined to
propel Matson Intermodal's volume and revenue higher. Nationwide overland
transportation needs of outside customers and of Matson are fulfilled
economically and efficiently by this Matson subsidiary.]

[Photo caption: Matson's newest business is Matson Logistics Solutions. Its
role is to handle highly specialized transportation needs, such as this
observatory mirror destined for a new telescope atop Mauna Kea.]

PACIFIC COAST SERVICE (PCS) - During 1998, Matson's West Coast shuttle vessel
made 51 voyages, connecting the ports of Los Angeles, Seattle and Vancouver,
B.C. Customer support for the five-year-old service continues to grow. However,
the number of empty containers moved, to reposition them for transpacific ocean
carriers, declined substantially - the direct result of changes in trade flows
to and from Asia. The PCS made a modest contribution to Matson's profitability
during 1998.

MID-PACIFIC SERVICE - Matson's container-barge service to Johnston Island,
Majuro, Ebeye and Kwajalein experienced modestly lower volume in 1998 than in
1997. Lower freight rates also unfavorably affected the results for this
service.

MATSON INTERMODAL SYSTEM, INC. - Management of the transportation function
continues to gain greater recognition for its role in adding value, especially
in businesses where reliability and immediate response are critical competitive
factors. Matson has capitalized on this trend through Matson Intermodal, its
overland transportation subsidiary. In 1998, Matson Intermodal's annual revenue
exceeded 100 million and it was named one of the top 10 intermodal marketing
companies in the U.S. Matson Intermodal manages overland transportation for
Matson's shipping customers, as well as for more than a dozen ocean shipping
companies. As Matson increases its participation in the U.S. domestic shipping
trades, substantial opportunities are expected to arise for Matson Intermodal
and Matson to serve the same customers with a greater variety of services.

MATSON LOGISTICS SOLUTIONS, INC. - Matson's newest subsidiary, Matson Logistics
Solutions, Inc. was formed in early 1998 to provide project logistics,
construction logistics and supply-chain-management services to customers.

MATSON TERMINALS, INC. (MTI) - MTI is the stevedore for Matson and outside
customers at Matson-operated container terminals. In 1998, as part of a
Companywide effort to increase productivity and lower costs, Matson's container
terminal in Oakland, Calif. converted its primary method of container handling
from straddle carriers to yard tractors.

TRANSPORTATION OUTLOOK - The performance of this segment is expected to improve
in 1999, as the operation of a smaller fleet and other initiatives reduce costs
in the Hawaii service. Labor contracts with the longshore union on the Pacific
Coast expire at midyear. The employer group, of which Matson is a member,
anticipates that negotiations will be concluded without any work stoppage.
Results in 1999 also will benefit from the revised alliance with APL and from
the charter of two previously idle vessels in a new service from Florida to
Puerto Rico. During 1998, Matson concluded that, with appropriate maintenance
and selective improvements, its present fleet would be suitable for at least 10
more years of service. Capital investments, therefore, should be relatively
modest in 1999.

FOOD PRODUCTS

RAW SUGAR PRODUCTION - Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company (HC&S), located on
Maui, is Hawaii's largest producer of raw cane sugar, with 61 percent of the
state's 1998 crop. HC&S made significant progress during 1998, increasing raw
sugar yields and lowering unit costs. Changes in farming and factory practices
improved raw sugar yields from a disappointing 11.6 tons sugar per acre in 1997
to 12.7 in 1998. Total production - 216,200 tons of raw sugar - was the second
highest this decade. Contributing to the lower costs was a January 1998
reorganization that eliminated about six percent of HC&S's nearly 1,000
employees.

COFFEE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING - Kauai Coffee Company, Inc. is the largest
coffee grower in the United States, producing over half of the coffee grown in
Hawaii. Green (unroasted) coffee production in 1998 was about four million
pounds, down somewhat from 1997's record harvest. The reduced output was due to
scheduled pruning of maturing coffee trees and normal biennial yield
fluctuation. Kauai Coffee continues to broaden its customer base by emphasizing
product quality and building consumer awareness of Kauai's distinctiveness as a
coffee-producing region. Although coffee operations do not yet contribute to
operating profit, the results are improving steadily.

POWER, TRUCKING - The Company's hydroelectric plants on Maui and Kauai, as well
as cogeneration units at its sugar mills on Maui, continue to generate surplus
electricity, which is sold to the local public utilities. During 1998, a total
of 95,000 megawatt-hours (MWH) were sold, compared with 109,000 MWH in 1997.
The reduction was due to increased use of electric power by the Company to
irrigate its crops during periods of low rainfall, and to the catastrophic
failure of a generating unit. The Company also has trucking operations on both
Maui and Kauai that support its agricultural operations and serve independent
customers in each community.

SUGAR REFINING AND MARKETING - California and Hawaiian Sugar Company, Inc.
(C&H), the only raw cane sugar refiner in the western United States, produces
about eight percent of the national supply of refined sugar.

Through most of 1998, margins in the cane sugar refining industry were lower
than in 1997. Supplies of beet sugar were higher during the year, and supplies
of raw cane sugar were relatively scarce, due to a low sugar import quota. On
the positive side, at mid-year 1998, two principal labor contracts were
renegotiated successfully for five-year terms without any work interruption.

In December 1998, the Company recapitalized C&H and sold approximately 60
percent of its equity to an investor group that included Citicorp Venture
Capital, Ltd. In 1999 and thereafter, the pretax income of A&B's remaining
equity investment in C&H will be reported as an investment in an affiliate,
under the heading "Food Products."

FOOD PRODUCTS OUTLOOK - Because of the recent improvements in yields and
costs, HC&S should continue to make a greater contribution to consolidated
results in 1999 and thereafter. Kauai Coffee should continue its progress
toward profitability. Even without the contribution from C&H, food products
still represents a business with about 100 million in annual sales and
operating margins between five and seven percent. A&B's share of total C&H
results will reflect its lower ownership, but total C&H results are projected
to improve modestly over those of 1998.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Management has prepared and is responsible for the Company's consolidated
financial statements and related notes. They have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include amounts
based on judgments and estimates made by management. All financial information
in this Annual Report is consistent with these financial statements.

The Company maintains internal control systems, and related policies and
procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safe-
guarded, that transactions are properly executed and recorded in accordance
with management's authorization, and that underlying accounting records may be
relied upon for the accurate preparation of financial statements and other
financial information. The design, monitoring and revision of internal control
systems involve, among other things, management's judgment with respect to the
relative cost and expected benefits of specific control measures. The Company
maintains an internal auditing function that evaluates and formally reports on
the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls, policies and procedures.

The Company's financial statements have been audited by independent auditors
who have expressed their opinion with respect to the fairness, in all material
aspects, of the presentation of financial position, results of operations and
cash flows under generally accepted accounting principles (see Independent
Auditors' Report on page 18).

The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee (composed of non-employee
directors), oversees management's responsibilities in the preparation of the
financial statements and nominates the independent auditors, subject to
shareholder election. The Audit Committee meets regularly with the external
and internal auditors to evaluate the effectiveness of their work in
discharging their respective responsibilities and to assure their independent
and free access to the Committee.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF ALEXANDER & BALDWIN, INC.:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Alexander & Baldwin, Inc.
and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related state-
ments of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1998 (pages 19 and 26 to 41). These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, in 1998 the Company changed
its method of accounting for assessments from a second injury workers'
compensation fund.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS

Net income in 1998 was 25,142,000, or 0.56 per share, versus 81,387,000, or
 1.80 per share, in 1997. Net income in 1998 was reduced by three one-time
factors. First, the recapitalization and partial sale of a subsidiary,
California and Hawaiian Sugar Company, Inc. (C&H) resulted in a 15,955,000, or
 0.36 per share, after-tax loss. Second, changes in development plans for the
1,045-acre Kukui'Ula real estate project on Kauai, resulting from extended weak
real estate market conditions, led to a 12,837,000, or 0.29 per share, after-
tax charge, to reduce the carrying value of certain assets associated with that
project. Third, the cumulative effect of a required accounting change, related
to longshore labor second injury workers' compensation funds, resulted in an
after-tax charge of 5,801,000, or 0.13 per share. In contrast, net income in
1997 included an after-tax benefit of 12,478,000, or 0.28 per share,
resulting from the favorable settlement of protracted litigation related to an
insurance claim for earthquake damage to port facilities. Before all of these
one-time factors, the Company's earnings per share in 1998 was 1.33, versus
 1.53 in 1997, a decrease of 13 percent.

1998 COMPARED WITH 1997

OCEAN TRANSPORTATION revenue of 722,744,000 for 1998 increased four percent
compared with 1997; however, operating profit of 66,298,000 decreased 18
percent.

Matson Navigation Company's (Matson) Hawaii service revenue declined by nearly
 29 million in 1998. The revenue decline primarily reflected lower container
volume and lower average revenue per container. Matson's total Hawaii
container volume, at 143,400 units in 1998, was four-percent lower than 1997
container volume of 149,700 units. This follows a three-year trend of
declining container volume, from 173,300 units in 1994, to 157,200 in 1995 and
152,100 in 1996. Although 1994 volume was significantly enhanced due to a
competitor's work stoppage, the continuing decline in both container average
revenue yield and volume resulted primarily from continuing weakness in the
Hawaii economy, combined with competitive pressures. While a significant
portion of the container decline has been due to a nearly 40-percent
contraction in recent years of Hawaii's construction industry, other types of
cargo have been affected as well. A barge competitor, that operated
temporarily during the summer months in 1998, had an adverse impact on
household goods volumes and rates.

Operating expenses rose in 1998, reflecting primarily a decline in terminal
productivity and higher labor costs. The master agreement between stevedoring
companies, including Matson, and labor, represented by the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union, expires at mid-year in 1999. Negotiations
leading up to a new agreement are expected to focus on increasing productivity.

Fuel expenses declined significantly in 1998 as the average price paid for fuel
dropped to approximately 12 per barrel from 16.70 per barrel in 1997.

The unfavorable trends in operating margins in the Hawaii service continue to
be of concern to the Company. Late in 1998, Matson reduced the number of ships
serving the Hawaii trade from eight to six vessels, to better balance the
capacity offered with the demand for cargo space. Matson still remains the
service leader to Hawaii. In addition, Matson chartered two idle
vessels to a new joint venture operating between Florida and Puerto Rico; a
venture in which Matson has a 27.5-percent equity interest. Matson is
currently evaluating other ways in which it can reduce its operating costs
while maintaining a high level of service to shippers.

Matson announced a 2.5-percent increase in Hawaii service rates effective in
February 1999. Matson did not take any general rate increases in 1998.

Increases in revenue from Matson's Guam and intermodal services and from the
American President Lines, Ltd. (APL) Alliance more than offset the revenue
decline from the Hawaii service. These increases were led by a restructuring
of the APL Alliance charter agreements and increased intermodal revenue.

PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT - LEASING revenue of 37,955,000 for 1998
rose two percent compared with 1997; however, operating profit of 22,634,000
for 1998 decreased eight percent compared with 1997. The decrease was due
primarily to lower occupancy rates, especially in the Hawaii market. Occupancy
rates for the Mainland properties averaged 91 percent in 1998, versus 98
percent in 1997. The lower Mainland average rate primarily reflected a shift
in the composition of the portfolio toward more multi-tenant properties,
following the sale of a large, single-tenant property in 1998. Occupancy
levels for the Hawaii properties averaged 68 percent in 1998, versus 78 percent
in 1997. The lower Hawaii average rate reflected ongoing weak economic
conditions in Hawaii as well as low occupancy rates for properties acquired
during 1997.

PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT - SALES revenue of 82,382,000 for 1998
considerably exceeded the 35,916,000 in sales recorded in 1997. Operating
profit from property sales in 1998 of 21,663,000 was 63-percent higher than
the 13,262,000 achieved in 1997. The increases resulted from the sales of a
large single-tenant research and office complex in Cupertino, California for
 51,500,000 and of the Company's remaining interest in a 14-acre parcel at Maui
Business Park. Other significant sales in 1998 included five developed
business parcels and 64 residential properties. Sales in 1997 included four
leased parcels in Maui Business Park, an undeveloped 24-acre residential
parcel, several developed and undeveloped business parcels, an industrial
warehouse in California and 59 residential units. Sales totaling 67,258,000
in 1998 were completed on a tax-deferred basis compared with 1997 tax-deferred
sales of 17,388,000. Purchases, utilizing proceeds from tax-deferred sales,
totaled 85,896,000 and 22,170,000 for 1998 and 1997, respectively.

The mix of property transactions in any year can be diverse. Sales can include
property sold under threat of condemnation, developed residential real estate,
commercial properties, developable subdivision lots and undeveloped land. The
sales of undeveloped land and subdivision lots generally provide a greater
contribution margin than the sales of developed and commercial property, due to
the low historical-cost basis of the Company's Hawaii land, which averages
approximately 150 per acre. Consequently, historical property sales and the
amount of real estate held for sale currently on the balance sheets do not
necessarily indicate future profitability trends for this segment. Because the
Company sells a significant amount of property on a tax-deferred basis, the
proceeds of which must be reinvested in similar property within time periods
specified by the Internal Revenue Code, property sales may not necessarily be
indicative of cash flows.

FOOD PRODUCTS revenue of 465,661,000 in 1998 was four-percent lower than the
1997 revenue of 486,912,000. Operating profit of 21,327,000 in 1998 was 21-
percent lower than the 27,083,000 earned in 1997. Several factors contributed
to these lower results. Refined sugar prices declined in 1998 as a result of a
large beet sugar crop. The average per-ton cost to purchase raw sugar was
about the same in 1998 as it was in 1997, but refining and direct operating
expenses increased. While the volume of refined sugar sales increased slightly
in 1998, the mix of sales resulted in a lower margin than last year. The
continued low cane sugar import quota made it difficult for C&H to purchase raw
sugar at attractive prices. Additionally, a majority interest in C&H was sold
on December 24, 1998, resulting in one less week of operations as a consoli-
dated business than in 1997. The combined impact of these items reduced
operating profit by approximately 13,000,000.

Results from Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company (HC&S), the Company's Maui
sugarcane plantation, showed significant improvement in 1998. Changes in
cultivation and ripening processes for a recently introduced cane-sugar variety
occurred during the year, increasing sugar yields to 216,200 tons in 1998 from
198,000 tons a year earlier. The higher sugar production, combined with cost
reduction efforts, resulted in an 18-percent margin improvement, partially
offsetting the lower operating profit from C&H. During 1998, HC&S wrote off
several abandoned and obsolete items of equipment, which had a total carrying
cost of approximately 4,500,000, and also recognized a 3,000,000 involuntary
conversion gain, due to insurance proceeds received in settlement of an insured
turbine generator failure which occurred earlier in the year.

1997 COMPARED WITH 1996

OCEAN TRANSPORTATION revenue of 692,689,000 for 1997 increased five percent
and operating profit of 80,385,000 for 1997 decreased two percent, compared
with 1996. Excluding a one-time vessel charter hire, which contributed
 5,634,000 to 1996 results, operating profit for the ocean transportation
segment rose six percent. Hawaii service container and automobile volumes
were two- and five-percent lower, respectively, due to weak economic
conditions in Hawaii. Terminal labor costs increased by six percent in 1997
compared with 1996.

PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT - LEASING revenue and operating profit rose
three percent compared with 1996. The leased-property portfolio benefited from
continuing high occupancy levels for Mainland properties. Occupancy rates in
1997 averaged 98 percent for the Mainland portfolio, versus 97 percent in 1996.
Occupancy levels for the Company's Hawaii-leased real estate portfolio averaged
78 percent in 1997, versus 86 percent in 1996. That decrease was due primarily
to properties acquired in early 1997 that had relatively low occupancy rates
and to the weak Hawaii economy.

PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT - SALES revenue of 35,916,000 for 1997 was
13-percent higher than in 1996; however, operating profit decreased 13 percent
for 1997 compared with 1996. Sales in 1997 included four leased parcels in
Maui Business Park, an undeveloped 24-acre residential parcel, several
developed and undeveloped business parcels, an industrial warehouse in
California and 59 esidential properties. Significant sales in 1996 included
two leased parcels, a 66-acre unimproved parcel to a Maui utility, four lots
in the Company's Maui Business Park and 73 residential properties.

FOOD PRODUCTS revenue of 486,912,000 in 1997 was four-percent lower than the
1996 revenue of 506,909,000. Operating profit of 27,083,000 in 1997,
however, was one-percent higher than the operating profit of 26,863,000 for
the prior year. Improved sugar refining margins were offset substantially by
the effects of lower sugar yields at the Company's Maui plantation.

During most of 1997, margins in the cane sugar refining industry benefited from
relatively low supplies of beet sugar. However, margins tightened late in the
year, following projections for a larger sugar beet crop and lower refined beet
sugar prices.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

The Company's principal liquid resources, comprising cash and cash equivalents,
receivables, inventories and unused lines of credit, less accrued deposits to
the Capital Construction Fund (CCF), totaled 365,393,000 at December 31, 1998,
a decrease of 143,783,000 from December 31, 1997. This decrease was due
primarily to lower amounts available under lines of credit, lower receivables,
and lower inventories, partially offset by increased cash and a decrease in
accrued deposits to the CCF. Amounts available under lines of credit decreased
 130,999,000, primarily due to a decrease in credit facilities, resulting from
the partial sale of C&H and the expiration of a 35 million unused credit
facility. The decreases in receivables and inventories were mostly due to the
C&H transaction. Cash increased 65,195,000, primarily due to the cash
receipts from the C&H transaction, which had not yet been fully used to repay
debt at year-end. Accrued deposits to the CCF decreased 930,000.

Working capital was 67,113,000 at December 31, 1998, a decrease of 47,693,000
from the amount at the end of 1997. This was primarily due to decreases in
inventories and accounts receivable and an increase in short-term debt,
partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable. The C&H transaction was
the primary reason for these changes. At December 31, 1997, C&H provided
working capital of approximately 31,327,000.

Net cash provided by operations, before capital expenditures for real estate
developments held for sale, was 137,244,000 and 187,505,000 for 1998 and
1997, respectively. Net operating cash flows were used principally for
capital expenditures, payments of debt, dividends, repurchases of capital
stock and deposits into the CCF. Withdrawals from the CCF in 1998 were used to
purchase a leased vessel and to invest in a joint venture shipping operation.
(See Note 2 to the Company's financial statements.)

In 1998, capital additions were 197,633,000, compared with 70,666,000 in
1997. Ocean transportation capital additions in 1998 of 60,403,000 were
primarily for the acquisition of container and terminal equipment and the
purchase of a vessel which previously was leased by Matson. Property develop-
ment and management capital additions in 1998 of 118,552,000, which included
the reinvestment of tax-deferred sales proceeds, were for real estate develop-
ments held for investment purposes and for improvements to leased properties.
Food products capital additions in 1998 of 18,237,000 were primarily for sugar
refinery modifications, power generation, and harvesting and factory equipment
for sugar plantation and coffee orchard operations.

Capital expenditures approved, but not yet spent, were 60,294,000 at December
31, 1998. These expenditures are primarily for container equipment, real
estate developments held for investment purposes, improvements to leased
properties, Year-2000 computer remediation, and irrigation, factory and power
generation equipment for the Company's sugar-growing operations. For 1999,
internal cash flows and short-term borrowing facilities are expected to be
sufficient to finance working capital needs, dividends, capital expenditures
and debt service.

OTHER MATTERS

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD: In 1998, the Company adopted the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 97-3, "Accounting by
Insurance and Other Enterprises for Insurance-Related Assessments." This
standard required that the Company accrue the present value of future
assessments from a United States Department of Labor second injury workers'
compensation fund as a liability. Previously, the annual assessments were
charged to expense in the year paid. The after-tax, cumulative effect of the
change in accounting method was a reduction of 1998 net income by 5,801,000,
or 0.13 per share. (See Note 3 to the Company's financial statements.)

C&H RECAPITALIZATION AND PARTIAL SALE: On December 24, 1998, the Company
recapitalized and sold a majority of its equity in C&H, recognizing a loss of
 19,756,000. The after-tax impact of the loss on 1998 net income was
 15,955,000, or 0.36 per share. C&H is included in the consolidated results
of the Company up to the date of sale. Effective December 24, 1998, the
Company began accounting for its investment in C&H under the equity method.
(See Note 2 to the Company's financial statements.)

WRITE-DOWN OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS: In 1998, the Company changed the strategic
direction of its Kukui'Ula real estate development project on Kauai. As a
result, the Company determined that the total present capitalized investment
could not be recovered through future cash flows and, accordingly, reduced the
carrying value by 20,216,000. The after-tax impact to 1998 net income of this
write-down was 12,837,000, or 0.29 per share. (See Note 4 to the Company's
financial statements.)

INSURANCE LITIGATION: In 1997, Matson received 33,650,000 in settlement of
litigation involving a contested insurance claim for earthquake damage to port
facilities in 1989. After recovering repair and litigation costs of
approximately 13,650,000, the Company recorded, in 1997, 9,700,000 of
interest revenue and 10,300,000 of other revenue. The after-tax impact of the
settlement on 1997 net income was 12,478,000, or 0.28 per share.

TAX-DEFERRED REAL ESTATE EXCHANGES: In 1998, the Company sold eight parcels of
land for 67,258,000. Proceeds of 85,896,000 were reinvested in 1998 on a
tax-deferred basis from sales completed in 1998 and earlier years. The
proceeds from these sales and amounts reinvested are reflected in the State-
ments of Cash Flows under the caption "Non-cash Activities." The purchases of
real estate using tax-deferred monies are included in capital expenditures on
the Industry Segment Information (page 19).

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: As with most industrial and land-development companies
of its size, the Company's operations have certain risks, which could result in
expenditures for environmental remediation. The Company believes that it is in
compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and
regulations, and works proactively to identify potential environmental
concerns. Management believes that appropriate liabilities have been accrued
for environmental matters.

OUTLOOK: Information about the Company's outlook for 1999 and its plans to
address issues affecting primary business units is included in the Letter to
Shareholders on pages 2 through 5 and in the business unit discussions included
on pages 6 through 15 of the Annual Report to Shareholders, which sections are
incorporated herein by reference.

YEAR-2000 INFORMATION AND READINESS DISCLOSURE ACT OF 1998

In 1995, the Company and its subsidiaries commenced an evaluation of its
computer systems and applications to prepare for the Year-2000. Following this
evaluation, implementation plans for all business segments were prepared and
are currently being executed. Programs that recognize "00" as a date other
than "2000" might result in data errors or system problems if not corrected
before December 31, 1999. Not all systems used by the Company and its subsi-
diaries are sensitive to this issue.

The work related to primary systems and applications, which have the greatest
risk of adversely affecting operations, is substantially complete as of 1998
year-end. The Company and its subsidiaries are currently testing the corrected
systems for undetected program errors. In addition, the Company and its
subsidiaries are continuing work on correcting secondary support applications,
embedded systems and applications at smaller business units to ensure that they
will be Year-2000 compliant before the end of 1999. The Company and its
subsidiaries are working with primary vendors, customers, lenders, suppliers
and other appropriate third parties to assess their compliance efforts and the
potential risks to the Company and its subsidiaries in the event that they are
not Year-2000 compliant. Contingency plans for potential significant problems
that may occur in the Year-2000 will be completed by the end of 1999.

Staffing for the remaining Year-2000 work is expected to be adequate. Work on
this project has not affected other systems-related activities adversely. The
implementation plans, which consist of upgrading, modifying or replacing
various systems, are expected to cost approximately 6,000,000 to 8,000,000.
At the end of 1998, the Company and its subsidiaries had expended approximately
 3,600,000 for this work.

The Year-2000 risk to the Company and its subsidiaries is substantially the
same as that of other companies in the same industries. The Company and its
subsidiaries believe that their systems and applications necessary to operate
and manage their businesses will be replaced, modified or upgraded successfully
in advance of the year 2000.

Despite the preparations being taken by the Company and its subsidiaries, the
Year-2000 issue presents risks and uncertainties. In the most reasonably
likely worst case scenario, there could be temporary disruptions in customer
services (including ocean transportation) and product deliveries, temporary
billing and collection delays, and temporary delays in payrolls and vendor
payments. The Company believes that a worse case scenario is not likely;
however, if it did occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

Although there can be no absolute assurance that the Company and its
subsidiaries will be successful in identifying and avoiding all possible
problems, the Company and its subsidiaries continue to identify and address
potential negative consequences which may result from not being Year-2000
ready. In particular, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be
affected adversely by the failure of a vendor, customer, or other third party
to address the Year-2000 issue adequately. However, in the context of the
uncertainties inherent in dealing with the Year-2000 issue, the Company
believes, based on available information, that the impact of the Year-2000
issue and its associated costs will not have a material impact on the results
of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ALEXANDER & BALDWIN, INC.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. and all wholly-owned subsidiaries, after
elimination of significant intercompany amounts. Investments in 20 to 50
percent owned companies are accounted for using the equity method.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME: Comprehensive Income includes changes from either
recognized transactions or other economic events, excluding capital stock
transactions, which impact Shareholders' Equity. For the Company, the only
difference between Net Income and Comprehensive Income is the unrealized
holding gains on securities available for sale. Comprehensive Income is not
used in the calculation of Earnings per Share. 

BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK: Basic Earnings per Share
is determined by dividing Net Income by the weighted-average common shares
outstanding during the year. The impact on earnings per share of the Company's
stock options is immaterial; consequently, Diluted Earnings per Share is the
same amount as Basic Earnings per Share.

OCEAN TRANSPORTATION: Voyage revenue and variable costs and expenses are
included in income at the time each voyage leg commences. This method of
accounting does not differ materially from other acceptable accounting methods.

Vessel depreciation, charter hire, terminal operating overhead and general and
administrative expenses are charged to expense as incurred. Expected costs of
regularly-scheduled dry docking of vessels and planned major vessel repairs
performed during dry docking are accrued.

PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT: Sales are recorded when the risks and
benefits of ownership have passed to the buyers (generally at closing dates),
adequate down payments have been received and collection of remaining balances
is reasonably assured.

Expenditures for real estate developments are capitalized during construction
and are classified as Real Estate Developments on the Balance Sheets. When
construction is complete, the costs are reclassified either as Real Estate Held
for Sale or Property, based upon the Company's intent to sell the completed
asset or to hold it as an investment. Cash flows related to real estate
developments are classified as operating or investing activities, based upon
the Company's intention either to sell the property or to retain ownership of
the property as an investment following completion of construction.

FOOD PRODUCTS: Revenue is recorded when refined sugar products and coffee are
sold to third parties.

Costs of growing sugar cane are charged to the cost of production in the year
incurred and to cost of sales as refined products are sold. The cost of raw
cane sugar purchased from third parties is recorded as inventory at the
purchase price.

Costs of developing coffee orchards are capitalized during the development
period and depreciated over the estimated productive lives. Costs of growing
coffee are charged to inventory in the year incurred and to cost of sales as
coffee is sold.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: The Company considers highly liquid investments
purchased with original maturities of three months or less, which have no
significant risk of change in value, to be cash equivalents.

INVENTORIES: Sugar inventory, consisting of raw and refined sugar products,
and coffee inventory, are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out
basis) or market. Other inventories, composed principally of materials and
supplies, are stated at the lower of cost (principally average cost) or market.

PROPERTY: Property is stated at cost. Major renewals and betterments are
capitalized. Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or
extend asset lives are charged to expense as incurred. Assets held under
capital leases are included with property owned. Gains or losses from property
disposals are included in income.

CAPITALIZED INTEREST: Interest costs incurred in connection with significant
expenditures for real estate developments or the construction of assets are
capitalized. Interest expense is shown net of capitalized interest on the
Statements of Income, because the amounts are not significant.

DEPRECIATION: Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method.
Depreciation expense includes amortization of assets under capital leases.

Estimated useful lives of property are as follows:

 Buildings 10 to 50 years
 Vessels 10 to 40 years
 Marine containers 15 years
 Machinery and equipment 3 to 35 years
 Utility systems and other depreciable property 5 to 60 years

PENSION PLANS: Certain ocean transportation subsidiaries are members of the
Pacific Maritime Association (PMA), the Maritime Service Committee or the
Hawaii Stevedore Committee, which negotiate multi-employer pension plans
covering certain seagoing and shoreside bargaining unit personnel. The
subsidiaries negotiate multi-employer pension plans covering other bargaining
unit personnel. Pension costs are accrued in accordance with contribution
rates established by the PMA, the parties to a plan or the trustees of a plan.
Several trusteed, noncontributory, single-employer defined benefit plans cover
substantially all other employees.

INCOME TAXES: Income tax expense is based on revenue and expenses in the
Statements of Income. Deferred income tax liabilities and assets are computed
at current tax rates for temporary differences between the financial statement
and income tax bases of assets and liabilities.

FAIR VALUES: The carrying values of current assets (other than inventories,
real estate held for sale, deferred income taxes and prepaid and other assets)
and of debt instruments, are reasonable estimates of their fair values. Real
estate is carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair values are
generally determined using the expected market value for the property, less
sales costs. For residential units and lots held for sale, market value is
determined by reference to the sales of similar property, market studies, tax
assessments and cash flows. For commercial property, market value is
determined using recent comparable sales, tax assessments and cash flows. A
large portion of the Company's real estate is undeveloped land located in
Hawaii. This land has a cost basis which averages approximately 150 per acre,
a value which is much lower than fair value.

FUTURES CONTRACTS: Realized and unrealized gains and losses on commodity
futures contract hedges are recorded in inventory and subsequently charged to
cost of sales when the related inventory is sold. These amounts are not
significant.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS: Environmental expenditures that relate to current
operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that
relate to an existing condition caused by past operations or events, and which
do not contribute to current or future revenue generation, are charged to
expense. Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments or remedial
efforts are probable and the costs can be estimated reasonably.

YEAR-2000 COSTS: Computer and related costs necessary to prepare for the Year-
2000 date change are treated as an operating expense in the year incurred
unless a computer system is being replaced for operating reasons as well as for
Year-2000 compliance, in which case the costs are capitalized. The annual
amounts charged to expense were not significant. (See Management's Discussion
and Analysis, unaudited, for additional information.)

USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting periods. Future actual amounts could differ from those estimates.

RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain amounts in the 1997 and 1996 financial statements
have been reclassified to conform with the 1998 presentation.

2. INVESTMENTS AND PARTIAL SALE OF SUBSIDIARY

At December 31, 1998 and 1997, investments consisted principally of marketable
equity securities, equity in affiliated companies, limited partnership
interests and purchase-money mortgages, as follows (in thousands):

 1998 1997
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Marketable equity securities 110,119 96,597
Equity in affiliated companies 42,568 --
Limited partnership interests,
 purchase-money mortgages and other 6,381 6,216
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total Investments 159,068 102,813
=======================================================================

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES: The marketable equity securities are classified
as "available for sale" and are stated at quoted market values. The unrealized
holding gains on these securities, net of deferred income taxes, have been
recorded as a separate component of Shareholders' Equity.

The components of the net unrealized holding gains at December 31, 1998 and
1997 were as follows (in thousands):

 1998 1997
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Market value 110,119 96,597
Less historical cost 9,851 9,851
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Unrealized holding gains 100,268 86,746
Less deferred income taxes 36,939 31,602
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Net unrealized holding gains 63,329 55,144
=======================================================================

EQUITY IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES: On December 24, 1998, the Company recognized a
loss of 19,756,000 for the partial sale of its sugar refining and marketing
unit, California and Hawaiian Sugar Company, Inc. (C&H) and the sale of a
majority of its equity in that company. The Company received approximately
 45,000,000 in cash, after the repayment of certain C&H indebtedness,
 25,000,000 in senior preferred stock, 9,600,000 in junior preferred stock,
and retained an approximately 36 percent common stock interest in the
recapitalized C&H. The Company holds all of C&H's senior preferred stock and
40 percent of C&H's junior preferred stock. The carrying amounts of these
investments approximated their fair values at December 31, 1998. C&H is
included in the consolidated results of the Company up to the date of the sale.
Effective December 24, 1998, the Company began accounting for its investment in
C&H under the equity method. The equity in earnings of C&H for the last seven
days of 1998 was not significant. Condensed balance sheet information for C&H
as of December 31, 1998 was as follows (in thousands):

 1998
- --------------------------------------------------

Assets:
 Current 77,109
 Property and other 139,191
- --------------------------------------------------
Total 216,300

Liabilities
 Current 36,092
 Long-term debt and other 123,845
 Shareholders' equity, including
 preferred stock 56,363
- --------------------------------------------------
Total 216,300
==================================================

In September 1998, the Company invested approximately 7,284,000 in a joint
venture which carries cargo between Florida and Puerto Rico, in which the
Company has a 27.5-percent interest. The Company charters two of its ships to
that venture.

LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS AND PURCHASE-MONEY MORTGAGES: The investments in
limited partnership interests and purchase-money mortgages are recorded at
cost, which approximated market values at December 31, 1998 and 1997. The
purchase-money mortgages are intended to be held to maturity. The value of the
underlying investments of the limited partnership interests is assessed
annually.

See Note 5 for a discussion of market values of investments in the Capital
Construction Fund.

3. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING METHOD FOR INSURANCE- RELATED ASSESSMENTS

The Company self-insures a portion of its federal workers' compensation
liability. As such, the Company utilizes the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)
second injury fund, as authorized by Section 8(f) of the U.S. Longshore and
Harborworkers' Act. Under this Act, the DOL annually assesses self-insurers
for their share of the related cost. Through 1997 these assessments were
recorded as expense in the year the amounts were assessed and paid. Effective
January 1, 1998, the Company adopted the provisions of the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 97-3, "Accounting by
Insurance and Other Enterprises for Insurance-Related Assessments." This
statement requires that the Company record as a liability, the expected cost of
future assessments relating to existing compensation claims made prior to the
end of the current fiscal year. In adopting this statement, the Company
recorded a one-time, non-cash charge to earnings of 9,282,000 5,801,000 net
of income tax, 0.13 per share), representing the cumulative effect of the
accounting change as of the beginning of the year. The discount rate used in
estimating the liability was 5.43 . On an undiscounted basis, the liability
was approximately 13,869,000 as of December 31, 1998. The effect of the
change on operating costs was not significant for the current or prior years.

4. WRITE-DOWN OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS

During 1998, the Company changed the strategic direction of its 1,045 acre
Kukui'Ula real estate development, from a single master-planned residential
community to a series of individual subdivisions with fewer units, as a result
of continued weaknesses in the State's and Kauai's economy and real estate
markets. As a result, the Company determined that its investment in a waste
water treatment plant (WWTP) could not be recovered through the WWTP's future
cash flows; accordingly, the costs of the WWTP were reduced by 15,900,000 to
the plant's fair value, which was based on the present value of estimated
future cash flows. Under the original higher-density Kukui'Ula development
plan, the cost of the WWTP would have been recoverable from its future cash
flows. The changes in the development plan also resulted in the write-off of
 4,316,000 for design and study costs which were determined to have no future
economic benefit. The remaining carrying cost of the Kukui'Ula project is
approximately 29,650,000 and, based on current development plans, the Company
has determined that this amount is recoverable from the project's future cash
flows.

5. CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION FUND

A subsidiary is party to an agreement with the United States Government which
established a Capital Construction Fund (CCF) under provisions of the Merchant
Marine Act, 1936, as amended. The agreement has program objectives for the
acquisition, construction or reconstruction of vessels and for repayment of
existing vessel indebtedness. Deposits to the CCF are limited by certain
applicable earnings. Such deposits are Federal income tax deductions in the
year made; however, they are taxable, with interest payable from the year of
deposit, if withdrawn for general corporate purposes or other non-qualified
purposes, or upon termination of the agreement. Qualified withdrawals for
investment in vessels having adequate tax bases do not give rise to a current
tax liability, but reduce the depreciable bases of the vessels or other assets
for income tax purposes.

Amounts deposited into the CCF are a preference item for calculating Federal
alternative minimum taxable income. Deposits not committed for qualified
purposes within 25 years from the date of deposit, will be treated as non-
qualified withdrawals over the subsequent five years. As of year-end, the
oldest CCF deposits date from 1994. Management believes that all amounts on
deposit in the CCF at the end of 1998 will be used or committed for qualified
purposes prior to the expiration of the applicable 25-year periods.

========================================================================================================= 

Under the terms of the CCF agreement, the subsidiary may designate certain
qualified earnings as "accrued deposits" or may designate, as obligations of
the CCF, qualified withdrawals to reimburse qualified expenditures initially
made with operating funds. Such accrued deposits to and withdrawals from the
CCF are reflected on the Balance Sheets either as obligations of the Company's
current assets or as receivables from the CCF.

The Company has classified its investments in the CCF as "held-to-maturity"
and, accordingly, has not reflected temporary unrealized market gains and
losses on the Balance Sheets or Statements of Income. The long-term nature of
the CCF program supports the Company's intention to hold these investments to
maturity.

At December 31, 1998 and 1997, the balances on deposit in the CCF are
summarized in Table 1.

Fair value of the mortgage-backed securities was determined by an outside
investment management company based on experience trading identical or
substantially similar securities. No central exchange exists for these
securities; they are traded over-the-counter. The Company earned 4,514,000 in
1998, 5,897,000 in 1997 and 6,838,000 in 1996 on its investments in mortgage-
backed securities. The fair values of other CCF investments are based on
quoted market prices. These other investments mature in 1999. There were no
sales of securities classified as "held-to-maturity" during 1998 or 1997.

6. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has funded single-employer defined benefit pension plans which
cover substantially all non-bargaining unit employees.

In addition, the Company has plans that provide certain retiree health care and
life insurance benefits to substantially all salaried and to certain hourly
employees. Employees are generally eligible for such benefits upon retirement
and completion of a specified number of years of credited service. The Company
does not pre-fund these benefits and has the right to modify or terminate
certain of these plans in the future. Certain groups of retirees pay a portion
of the benefit costs.

The status of the funded defined benefit pension plans and the unfunded
accumulated post-retirement benefit plans at December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996
is shown in Table 2 (page 36).

The net periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit pension plans and the
post-retirement health care and life insurance benefit plans during 1998, 1997
and 1996 is summarized in Table 3 (page 36).

As described in Note 2, the Company sold a majority of its interest in C&H
during 1998. The impact of this transaction on the benefit obligation and the
plan assets is noted in Table 2. At the time of the transaction, C&H had
recorded in its financial statements net obligations of 12,300,000 and
 46,500,000 for its pension and post-retirement benefit plans, respectively.

The assumptions used to determine the components of the net periodic benefit
cost were as follows:

Pension Benefits Other Post-retirement Benefits
 --------------------------- ------------------------------
 1998 1997 1996 1998 1997 1996
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Discount rate 6.75 7.25 7.50 6.75 7.25 7.50 
Expected return on
 plan assets 9.00 9.00 9.00 - - -
Rate of compensation
 increase 4.25 4.25 4.50 4.25 4.25 4.50 

For post-retirement benefit measurement purposes, a 10-percent annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed
through 2001. The rate was assumed to decrease to 5-percent for 2002 and
remain at that level thereafter. For 1998 and 1997, gains and losses of the
post-retirement benefit plans were amortized over five years. For 1996 and
previous years, gains and losses for the post-retirement benefit plans were
amortized using the minimum method allowed by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employer's Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits
other than Pensions." This change did not significantly affect financial
results.

If the assumed health care cost trend rate were increased or decreased by one
percentage point, the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation, as of
December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, and the net periodic post-retirement benefit
cost for 1998, 1997 and 1996, would have increased or decreased as follows (in
thousands):

Other Post-retirement Benefits

Effect on total of service and
 interest cost components (583) (1,016) (1,052) 689 1,172 1,208
Effect on post-retirement
 benefit obligation (4,387) (9,786) (9,833) 5,157 11,113 11,105

The assets of the defined benefit pension plans consist principally of listed
stocks and bonds. Gains and losses are amortized using the minimum method
allowed by SFAS No. 87, "Employer's Accounting for Pensions." Contributions
are determined annually for each plan by the Company's pension administrative
committee, based upon the actuarially determined minimum required contribution
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (ERISA)
and the maximum deductible contribution allowed for tax purposes. For the
plans covering employees who are members of collective bargaining units, the
benefit formulas are determined according to the collective bargaining agree-
ments, either using career average pay as the base or a flat dollar amount per
year of service. The benefit formulas for the remaining defined benefit plans
are based on final average pay.

The Company has non-qualified supplemental pension plans covering certain
employees and retirees, which provide for incremental pension payments from the
Company's general funds, so that total pension benefits would be substantially
equal to amounts that would have been payable from the Company's qualified
pension plans if it were not for limitations imposed by income tax regulations.
The obligation, included with other non-current liabilities, relating to these
unfunded plans, totaled 11,860,000 and 10,654,000 at December 31, 1998 and
1997, respectively. The annual expense associated with the non-qualified plans
was not significant.

Total contributions to the multi-employer pension plans covering personnel in
shoreside and seagoing bargaining units were 5,633,000 in 1998, 5,828,000 in
1997 and 5,552,000 in 1996. Union collective bargaining agreements provide
that total employer contributions during the terms of the agreements must be
sufficient to meet the normal costs and amortization payments required to be
funded during those periods. Contributions are generally based on union labor
paid or cargo volume. A portion of such contributions is for unfunded accrued
actuarial liabilities of the plans being funded over periods of 25 to 40 years,
which began between 1967 and 1976.

The multi-employer plans are subject to the plan termination insurance
provisions of ERISA and are paying premiums to the Pension Benefit Guarantee
Corporation (PBGC). The statutes provide that an employer who withdraws from,
or significantly reduces its contribution obligation to, a multi-employer plan
generally will be required to continue funding its proportional share of the
plan's unfunded vested benefits.

Under special rules approved by the PBGC and adopted by the Pacific Coast
longshore plan in 1984, the Company could cease Pacific Coast cargo-handling
operations permanently and stop contributing to the plan without any withdrawal
liability, provided that the plan meets certain funding obligations as defined
in the plan. The estimated withdrawal liabilities under the Hawaii longshore
plan and the seagoing plans aggregated approximately 809,000 as of December
31, 1998, based on estimates by plan actuaries. Management has no present
intention of withdrawing from and does not anticipate termination of any of the
aforementioned plans.

Long-term debt 255,766 290,885
====================================================================

COMMERCIAL PAPER: At December 31, 1998, there were two commercial paper
programs. The first program was used by a subsidiary to finance the
construction of a vessel. At December 31, 1998, 99,766,000 of commercial
paper notes was outstanding under this program. Maturities ranged from 7 to
25 days. The borrowings outstanding under this program are classified as long
- -term, because the subsidiary intends to continue the program and, eventually,
to repay the borrowings with qualified withdrawals from the Capital
Construction Fund.

The second commercial paper program, which was used by C&H, before the partial
sale of that business (see Note 2), to fund the purchases of raw sugar
inventory and to provide working capital for sugar refining and marketing
operations, was terminated on January 19, 1999 as a result of the partial sale
of C&H. At December 31, 1998, 42,000,000 of commercial paper notes was
outstanding under this program, all of which was classified as current. 
Maturities ranged from 6 to 19 days. The interest cost and certain fees on the
borrowings relating to sugar inventory advances to growers were reimbursed by
the growers. The commercial paper was supported by an 85,000,000 backup
revolving credit facility with four commercial banks, which also was terminated
in January 1999.

VARIABLE RATE LOANS: The Company has a revolving credit and term loan
agreement with four commercial banks, whereby it may borrow up to 140,000,000,
under revolving loans to November 30, 2000, at varying rates of interest. Any
revolving loan outstanding on that date may be converted into a term loan,
which would be payable in 12 equal quarterly installments. The agreement
contains certain restrictive covenants, the most significant of which requires
the maintenance of an interest coverage ratio of 2:1. At December 31, 1998 and
1997, 50,000,000 and 25,000,000, respectively, were outstanding under this
agreement.

The Company has an uncommitted 45,000,000 short-term revolving credit
agreement with a commercial bank. The agreement extends to November 30, 1999,
but may be canceled by the bank or the Company at any time. At December 31,
1998 and 1997, 3,500,000 and 11,500,000, respectively, were outstanding under
this agreement.

The Company has an uncommitted 25,000,000 revolving credit agreement with a
commercial bank. The agreement extends to September 8, 2000. At December 31,
1998 and 1997, 10,000,000 and 5,000,000, respectively, were outstanding under
this agreement.

The Company has a 50,000,000 one-year revolving credit agreement with a two-
year term option. At December 31, 1998, 15,000,000 was outstanding. No
amounts were outstanding under this agreement at December 31, 1997.

The Company has an uncommitted 15,000,000 revolving credit agreement with a
commercial bank. The Agreement extends to November 28, 2000. At December 31,
1998 and 1997, there were no amounts outstanding under this agreement.

In 1998, the Company entered into a 25,000,000 one-year revolving credit
agreement with a commercial bank which serves as a commercial paper liquidity
back-up line. At December 31, 1998, no amounts were outstanding under this
agreement.

LONG-TERM DEBT MATURITIES: At December 31, 1998, maturities and planned
prepayments of all long-term debt during the next five years totaled
 45,533,000 for 1999, 17,500,000 for 2000, 15,000,000 for 2001, 7,500,000
for 2002 and 7,500,000 for 2003.

8. LEASES

THE COMPANY AS LESSEE: Principal operating leases include office and terminal
facilities leased for periods which expire between 1999 and 2026. Management
expects that, in the normal course of business, most operating leases will be
renewed or replaced by other similar leases.

Rental expense under operating leases totaled 45,519,000, 45,560,000 and
 45,559,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

There were no assets recorded under capital leases at December 31, 1998.
Assets recorded under capital lease obligations which were included in property
at December 31, 1997 were as follows (in thousands):

The Company is obligated to pay terminal facility rent equal to the principal
and interest on Special Facility Revenue Bonds issued by the Department of
Transportation of the State of Hawaii. Interest on the bonds is payable semi-
annually and principal, in the amount of 16,500,000, is due in 2013. An
accrued liability of 8,800,000 and 8,257,000 at December 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively, included in other long-term liabilities, provides for a pro-rata
portion of the principal due on these bonds.

THE COMPANY AS LESSOR: The Company leases land, buildings, land improvements,
and vessels under operating leases. Five vessels were leased under new
agreements commencing in 1998. The historical cost of and accumulated
depreciation on leased property at December 31, 1998 and 1997 were as follows

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its audits of the Company's
tax returns through 1995 and, with the exception of the valuation of three land
donations, has settled all substantive issues raised during the audits. No
settlement has had a material effect on the Company's financial position or
results of operations. The IRS has commenced an audit of the Company's tax
returns for 1996 and 1997. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of
the outstanding audit issues and other matters which may result from the
current audits will not have a material effect on the Company's financial
position or results of operations.

10. CAPITAL STOCK AND STOCK OPTIONS

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLANS: During 1998, the Company had two stock option
plans under which key employees were granted options to purchase shares of the
Company's common stock.

Under the 1998 Plan, approved at the 1998 Annual Meeting of Shareholders,
option prices may not be less than the fair market value of the Company's
common stock on the dates of grant, and the options become exercisable over
periods determined, at the dates of grant, by the committee that administers
the plan. Payments for options exercised may be made in cash or in shares of
the Company's stock. If an option to purchase shares is exercised within five
years of the date of grant and if payment is made in shares of the Company's
stock, the option holder may receive, under a reload feature, a new stock
option grant for the number of shares equal to that surrendered, with an option
price not less than the greater of the fair market value of the Company's stock
on the date of exercise or one and one-half times the original option price.
During 1998, options to purchase 100,000 shares were granted. At December 31,
1998, these were the only options outstanding under the 1998 Plan.

The 1989 Plan is substantially the same as the 1998 Plan, except that each
option generally becomes exercisable in-full one year after the date granted.
The 1989 Plan terminated in January 1999, but options granted through 1998
remain exercisable. During 1998, options to purchase 485,400 shares were
granted, no reload options to purchase shares were granted, options to purchase
65,850 shares were exercised, and options to purchase 17,950 shares were
canceled. At December 31, 1998, options to purchase 3,263,438 shares were
outstanding under the 1989 Plan.

The 1998 and 1989 Plans also permit the issuance of shares of the Company's
common stock as a reward for past service rendered to the Company or one of its
subsidiaries or as an incentive for future service with such entities. The
recipients' interest in such shares may be fully vested upon issuance or may
vest in one or more installments, upon such terms and conditions as are
determined by the committee which administers the plans. The number of
incentive shares issued during 1998 or outstanding at the end of the year was
not material.

A third plan, the 1983 Plan, terminated in 1993, but options to purchase shares
previously granted under the 1983 Plan are still exercisable. At December 31,
1998, options to purchase 161,200 shares were outstanding under this plan.
These options expire in January 1999.

DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLANS: The Company also has two Directors' stock option
plans. Under the 1998 Directors' Plan, each non-employee Director of the
Company, elected at an Annual Meeting of Shareholders, is automatically
granted, on the date of each such Annual Meeting, an option to purchase 3,000
shares of the Company's common stock at the fair market value of the shares on
the date of grant. Each option to purchase shares becomes exercisable six
months after the date granted. At December 31, 1998, no options to purchase
shares had been granted under this plan.

The 1989 Directors' Plan is substantially the same as the 1998 Directors' Plan.
This plan terminated in January 1999, but options granted through termination
remain exercisable. During 1998, options to purchase 21,000 shares were
granted and no options to purchase shares were exercised or canceled. At
December 31, 1998, options to purchase 204,000 shares were outstanding under
the 1989 Directors' Plan.

Changes in shares under all option plans, for the three years ended December
31, 1998, were as follows:
 Price Range
 Shares Per Share
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1995 Outstanding, December 31 2,586,751 17.375-37.875

1996: Granted 495,264 21.750-32.625
 Exercised (125,188) 17.375-24.750
 Canceled (15,800) 24.250-36.250
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Outstanding, December 31 2,941,027 17.375-37.875

 Exercised (263,351) 17.375-24.750
 Canceled (57,850) 24.750-37.875

 Outstanding, December 31 3,206,038 21.750-37.875

1998: Granted 606,400 22.750-29.769
 Exercised (65,850) 21.750-27.000
 Canceled (17,950) 26.250-34.000
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 OUTSTANDING, DECEMBER 31 3,728,638 21.750-37.875
 EXERCISABLE, DECEMBER 31 3,143,238 21.750-37.875
=======================================================================

ACCOUNTING METHOD FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: The Company applies Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
and related Interpretations, in accounting for its stock-based compensation
plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost is recognized in the Company's income
statement for stock option plans at the time grants are awarded. If the
compensation costs for the stock option grants had been determined consistent
with SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-based Compensation," the after-tax
cost for grants made in 1998, 1997 and 1996 would have been approximately
 2,015,000, 1,800,000 and 900,000, respectively. Earnings per share for
1998, 1997 and 1996 would have declined by 0.05, 0.04 and 0.02,
respectively.

SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN: The Company has a Shareholder Rights Plan, designed
to protect the interests of shareholders in the event an attempt is made to
acquire the Company. The rights initially will trade with the Company's
outstanding common stock and will not be exercisable absent certain
acquisitions or attempted acquisitions of specified percentages of such stock.
If exercisable, the rights generally entitle shareholders to purchase
additional shares of the Company's stock or shares of an acquiring company's
stock at prices below market value.

SHARE REPURCHASES: During 1998, the Company purchased and retired 969,200
shares of its stock, at an average per-share price of 21.50. During 1997, the
Company purchased and retired 624,050 shares, at an average per-share price of
 26.58.

11. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

At December 31, 1998, the Company and its subsidiaries had an unspent balance
of total appropriations for capital expenditures of approximately 60,294,000.
However, there is no contractual obligation to spend this entire amount.

The Company has arranged for standby letters of credit of approximately
 14,100,000, necessary to qualify as a self-insurer for state and federal
workers' compensation liabilities. In addition, the Company guarantees a
letter of credit of 10,432,000 for workers' compensation claims incurred by
C&H employees, under a now-closed self insurance plan, prior to December 24,
1998 (see Note 2). The Company would only be called upon to honor this
guarantee in the event of C&H's insolvency. The Company also has
approximately 3,600,000 of letters of credit outstanding for normal operating
matters.

C&H, in which A&B has a 36 percent common stock interest, is party to a long-
term sugar supply contract with Hawaiian Sugar & Transportation Cooperative
(HSTC), a raw sugar marketing and transportation cooperative owned by the
Company and by two other Hawaii sugar growers. Under the terms of this
contract, C&H is obligated to purchase, and HSTC is obligated to sell, all of
the raw sugar delivered to HSTC by the Hawaii sugar growers, at prices
determined by the quoted domestic sugar market. Prior to the partial sale of
C&H, it made purchases of raw sugar totaling 141,018,000, 126,629,000 and
 190,188,000 under the contract during 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

A subsidiary has guaranteed obligations of up to 13 million of a joint venture
shipping operation (see Note 2) in which it has a 27.5-percent interest.

The Company and certain subsidiaries are parties to various legal actions and
are contingently liable in connection with claims and contracts arising in the
normal course of business, the outcome of which, in the opinion of management
after consultation with legal counsel, will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

12. INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

Industry segment information for 1998, 1997 and 1996, on page 19, is
incorporated herein by reference.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information," during the fourth quarter of 1998. SFAS No. 131
established standards for reporting information about operating segments in
annual financial statements and requires selected information about operating
segments in interim financial reports issued to stockholders. Operating
segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate
financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief
operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate
resources and in assessing performance. The Company's chief operating
decision-making group is made up of the president and lead executives of each
of the Company's segments. The lead executive for each operating segment
manages the profitability and cash flow of each respective segment's various
product or service lines and businesses. The operating segments are managed
separately because each operating segment represents a strategic business unit
that offers different products or services and serves different markets.

The Company's reportable operating segments include Ocean Transportation,
Property Development and Management and Food Products. The Ocean Trans-
portation segment carries freight between various United States and Canadian
West Coast, Hawaii and other Pacific ports, and provides terminal and cargo
logistics services. The Property Development and Management segment develops,
manages and sells residential, commercial and industrial properties. The Food
Products segment grows and processes raw sugar and molasses; invests in a
sugar refining and marketing business (see Note 2); grows, mills and markets
coffee; and generates and sells electricity.

The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant policies. Reportable segments are
measured based on operating profit, exclusive of non-operating or unusual
transactions, interest expense, general corporate expenses and income taxes.
